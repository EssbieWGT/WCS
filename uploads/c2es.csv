Modelling by the Institute for Public Policy Research found that a yearlong interruption at the main suppliers of battery parts could cost as many as 90,000 UK jobs and wipe out production of more than 580,000 electric vehicles from 2030.

Such a shock would leave domestic carmakers ceding ground to Chinese electric-vehicle manufacturers, with BYD Co. already increasing its UK market share from 0.5% to 2.5% in 2025, and would ripple into other industries such as rail, aerospace and defense manufacturing, the think tank warned in a report published Friday.

“Trump’s trade war with China, the rise of conflicts around the world – these shocks ultimately hurt the UK economy because we rely so much on trade to source the essentials, including clean energy technologies,” said Pranesh Narayanan, senior research fellow at the IPPR.

The IPPR also estimated that delays to solar deployment and continued reliance on gas could also add about £1.5 billion ($2 billion) a year to energy import costs.

The researcher offered some policy recommendations to increase the UK’s energy resilience. It said the government should invest in domestic production, diversify supply with allies, build strategic stockpiles and set out a clear stance on Chinese involvement in the most critical supply chains.

“The UK is a small open trading nation sailing through an international economy whose waters are getting choppier by the day,” Narayanan said.

President Donald Trump talked of purchasing Greenland in 2019 during his first time in office, but Europeans have only now realized how serious he is about acquiring it by any means necessary.

At first, Europeans deployed the same playbook they used to safeguard NATO during the alliance’s June 2025 summit at The Hague. To avert the worst of tariffs for the European market and prevent a breakdown of U.S. support for Ukraine, leaders engaged the president directly and sold him a victory. Announcing favorable trade deals or new defense spending successes allowed the administration to claim victory and move on from the issue, before negotiations and reality set in and complicated the picture.

Facing similar tensions over Greenland, the Europeans adopted a strategy that effectively offered “everything but territory” to address the economic and security concerns of the United States. European, Danish, and Greenlandic officials offered a greater NATO presence (called Arctic Sentry, in reference to NATO’s Baltic mission), more U.S. troops, and several investment deals for resources. All this notwithstanding the fact that the United States already has an agreement with Denmark and Greenland—one of three that governs the U.S. relationship with the island—that allows it to increase its military presence on Greenland as desired.

But Europe has found that its playbook is not working as effectively as in the past. This time, Trump’s desires seem to be not only about security and economic concerns, but about territory. And this is a bright red line for the European side: A U.S. annexation of Greenland would violate Danish sovereignty and Greenland’s right of self-determination. It would also be a crass breach of international law that would end theNATO alliance. If the United States—as the group’s most powerful member—annexed the territory of another NATO member, how could the alliance’s defense pledge be considered credible?

More From Our Experts

Europeans have therefore begun to complement their strategy of engagement with deterrence. The idea is to raise the stakes of any forceful U.S. action on Greenland and demonstrate that annexing the island will not be an easy win, but have “unprecedented knock-on effects,” as French President Emmanuel Macron put it. Europeans hope that Trump is just testing the boundaries of how much resistance he will evoke, and that standing firmly united will make him back off.

To achieve this, European leaders are working with members of the U.S. Congress with the hope of future legislation that would make it more difficult for the president to make a move on Greenland. A bipartisan congressional delegation currently visiting Denmark and the island is meant to convey the message that there is no interest whatsoever for a U.S. takeover. In addition, Europeans are signaling to Congress that the possession of an island that is much smaller than it appears on the standard Mercator projection map is not worth the dissolution of NATO.

Europeans are also weighing their economic and military options to deter Trump’s threat. On the economic side, the use of limited sanctions, further punitive measures against U.S. tech companies, and the European Union’s (EU) anti-coercion instrument—which was already considered but discarded as a response to U.S. tariffs—are back as actions of last resort. However, Trump’s threat to use tariffs once again over Greenland may discourage some Europeans for fear of escalation.

On the military side, France, Germany, Norway, and Sweden have deployed a small number of troops to Greenland to deter a fait accompli from the U.S. side (and France has proposed sending more). However, Europeans are fully aware that a military conflict with the United States would be a disastrous scenario that they will only lose. Other “nuclear options,” like limiting U.S. access to bases in Europe, are technically available. But this tactic would assume that the transatlantic relationship is already irreparably harmed.

Yet, for all the same reasons European leaders have repeatedly genuflected to Trump—namely their near-total reliance on the United States for Europe’s defense —these nuclear options are unlikely to materialize. For many European capitals, there’s a difference between considering the relationship broken and actively breaking it.

Europe could attempt to divert Trump’s attention with various delaying tactics or wait and hope that it happens naturally. It is easy to imagine this happening, with Trump’s agenda so full. Iran, for example, is one area that could consume the president’s full focus, forcing him to move on.

But Greenland is not the only item challenging transatlantic relations. For Europe’s relationship with the United States, there is now an era before the publication of the U.S. National Security Strategy (NSS) and one after that. Prior to its release, Europeans thought they could still work with Trump constructively and that the administration considered Europe a partner, not a potential adversary.

After the release of the NSS and the Trump administration’s twenty-eight-point Ukraine peace plan—and now these threats to seize territory from Denmark—Europeans have lost all illusions about the transatlantic relationship and are just trying to prevent the very worst. The fact that Vice President JD Vance canceled his scheduled participation at the upcoming Munich Security Conference sends the message that the administration believes there is nothing to discuss, that everything has been said in the NSS, and that the White House stands by it.

Europe cannot afford to continually be caught so flatfooted on this and other issues. It needs to take the following lesson from Greenland and all prior disputes: Trump should be taken seriously, and they must plan for what was once considered unimaginable.

One year into President Donald Trump’s second term, one of his most potent campaign pledges is unraveling under the weight of hard data.

Trump rode back to the White House promising to slash American energy bills by 50 percent, vowing that “energy dominance” would deliver instant relief to households battered by inflation. Instead, the opposite has happened. Electricity and gas costs have risen nationwide, leaving families paying more—not less—for basic utilities.

An analysis by The Guardian shows that average US electricity bills rose by 6.7 percent in 2025, while gas prices climbed by 5.2 percent. For the typical household, that translates into an additional $116 (about Sh15,000) per year, puncturing the president’s central economic pitch.

“Your Bill Will Be 5-0 Percent Less”

On the campaign trail in Detroit in 2024, Trump made the promise unmistakably clear:

“Your bill will be 5-0 percent less.”

Twelve months later, that pledge is proving politically toxic.

The increases have been uneven—but brutal in key regions. Washington, D.C. recorded a staggering 23 percent jump in electricity bills, while parts of the Midwest, long considered Trump’s electoral backbone, have also seen sustained rises. The pain is now extending beyond low-income households; middle-class families are increasingly struggling to keep up.

Tariffs, Markets, and Unintended Consequences

Energy economists point to a convergence of forces undermining the White House narrative.

Global fuel markets remain volatile, while Trump’s renewed tariff-heavy trade policy has driven up the cost of imported components critical for energy infrastructure—from transformers to grid hardware. Utilities, facing higher capital and maintenance costs, have passed those increases directly to consumers.

The result: disconnections for unpaid bills have reportedly surged, in some states increasing several-fold, an indicator usually associated with economic downturns rather than “dominance.”

Political Fallout Ahead of the Midterms

The timing could hardly be worse for Republicans. Energy affordability cuts across ideology, and rising utility bills are among the most visible costs of living for voters. In swing districts, the contrast between promise and performance is already being weaponized by Democrats, who argue that deregulation and tariffs have delivered corporate windfalls, not household relief.

Trump, for his part, has doubled down on his familiar mantra—“drill, baby, drill”—insisting that expanded domestic production will eventually bring prices down. But critics note that oil and gas output does not automatically translate into cheaper electricity, particularly in a grid shaped by regulation, infrastructure costs, and global supply chains.

The Bottom Line

Energy independence, it turns out, is not the same as energy affordability.

For millions of Americans, the numbers that matter are not the ones touted at rallies, but the figures printed on monthly bills. And right now, those numbers tell a far less triumphant story—one that threatens to turn a signature Trump promise into a defining political liability as the midterms approach.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c93dca57078f0e450903b892301db46052aaa7d7/0_0_3000_2400/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8c91e7885ae840e84e04023ca276e87e",N,,2026-01-17 14:59:12.308019

He has advised Congress on dynamic scoring, and policymakers from both parties consult him while drafting major tax and spending legislation.
According to Smetters, the primary issue with wealth taxes is that they rarely meet revenue expectations.
As of June 2024, only four countries in the OECD had a wealth tax, and the U.S. does not have any on the books; it’s unclear whether any would be constitutional.
Noting that most repeals were permanent, not experimental reversals, he said France was an exception, replacing a general wealth tax with a narrow real-estate tax.","The Wharton School professor and faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model (PWBM), speaking to Fortune from his office in Philadelphia, recently argued that the measure is an inefficient revenue tool born from a “perfect storm of craziness” in the current economic and social climate that makes “populist” ideas like this so sticky. As the state grapples with a significant budget shortfall, Smetters warns that taxing the ultrawealthy would simply fail to provide the expected windfall. Blame behavioral economics and “the money illusion,” he said.

Smetters’ PWBM is widely used in Washington DC to analyze the fiscal and macroeconomic effects of federal policy proposals.​ And he brings a lot of Beltway policy chops to the role, with a background that includes serving as an economist at the Congressional Budget Office and as Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy at the U.S. Treasury. He has advised Congress on dynamic scoring, and policymakers from both parties consult him while drafting major tax and spending legislation. Smetters has described much of the PWBM’s work as private analysis, even a “sandbox,” for legislators to workshop ideas before bills are written.​ He lives and breathes economic policy.

According to Smetters, the primary issue with wealth taxes is that they rarely meet revenue expectations. “When you think about the wealth tax itself,” he told Fortune, “it’s not really a super efficient way of raising money over time, and it also often doesn’t actually raise as much revenue as people think.” He noted that many countries that adopted a wealth tax “gave up on it, partly just because it raised a lot less revenue than what they were thinking.”

Examples are legion of countries abandoning wealth-targeted taxes, from Austria in 1994 to Denmark and Germany in 1997, to France in 2018. As of June 2024, only four countries in the OECD had a wealth tax, and the U.S. does not have any on the books; it’s unclear whether any would be constitutional. Smetters noted that almost all repealed wealth taxes raised an amount less than or equal to 0.3% of GDP, often much less, showing his point that there just isn’t as much money in them as people think. Also, the administrative costs were high relative to revenue, especially due to asset valuation and avoidance. Noting that most repeals were permanent, not experimental reversals, he said France was an exception, replacing a general wealth tax with a narrow real-estate tax.

Smetters cited some PWBM research that asked the question: what would happen if it were illegal to be a billionaire, as some far-left figures such as Zohran Mamdani have previously suggested. If the federal government seized every dollar from every individual above $999 million at current market value, the resulting “wealth grab” would only fund the federal government for about seven to eight months, he said. “What people don’t realize is [there’s] just not as much money there as people think.”

A Different Path Forward

Instead of “jacking up” income taxes or implementing a wealth tax that targets illiquid assets—such as sports teams or startups—Smetters suggested that California could do with “broader participation in tax revenue,” recommending that the state consider more stable, broad-based options like a large sales tax or a value added tax (VAT). Without such discipline, Smetters warned that the state’s reliance on a highly progressive and volatile tax system will continue to leave it vulnerable to economic shifts.

Some progressive policy analysts and economists argue that PWBM, under Smetters’ direction, builds in assumptions that overstate the growth costs of deficits and taxes while understating the benefits of public investment, which they claim biases the model against expansive social spending.. If anything, Smetters argues, the PWBM does the opposite. Critics argue this biases PWBM’s results against expansive social spending, whereas Smetters offers examples of spending that grows the economy if designed well, including investments in pre-K education, healthcare, the environment, and some public goods. PWBM analysis also shows that, contrary to popular opinion, more high-skill immigration generally raises all wages, including for native-born workers.

Smetters said that he has a free-market bias somewhat, in the sense that he jokingly calls himself “80% libertarian,” meaning he generally thinks free market principles are the most effective at increasing human welfare, with some regulatory exceptions including pollution control and some human capital investments, especially at younger ages. In contrast, a lot of government spending today goes higher-income and older people.

Could the economy actually be harmed, Fortune asked Smetters, if the massively improved standard of living means that life is full of annoying, hidden expenses, prompting a widespread dissatisfaction with the economy and a populist thirst for wealth taxes? Smetters noted that even some conservative economists such as Milton Friedman and Martin Feldstein (his own dissertation advisor), had a very strong free-market orientation, “but they would basically agree that markets work well when you don’t deceive people and exploit people.”

A ‘Perfect Storm of Craziness’

When asked why he thinks there is such a push for a billionaires tax at the moment, Smetters described what he saw as a “perfect storm of craziness” involving the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the influence of social media. The concentration in the S&P 500 is one thing, he said, with only 10 companies at the top really driving all the gains in the three-year bull market since ChatGPT was released, and an existential fear (driven on by tech billionaires) about AI coming to replace everyone’s job. Smetters said this was making people “unnecessarily anxious” that “we’re getting replaced by robots and so forth.”

Standing in front of a row of terminals working away on his budget analyses, Smetters insisted that “the reality is that AI is not going to be that as impactful as people think.” Pointing at the computers all around him, he noted, “I literally have models running right now, and so I am a big user of AI,” but many were “probably embellishing how much impact it’s going to potentially have.” He distinguished between the two types of technologies: labor-augmenting versus labor-replacing, insisting that AI would be the former.

The economist cited a well-known phenomenon in behavioral economics known as the “money illusion,” where people don’t believe that they have, in fact, actually gotten richer because they are shocked by higher prices they see around them. “The reality is that, in fact, we have a much higher standard of living than we had even 20 or 30 years ago,” Smetter said. He allowed that much of this is poorly measured, and some goods are even priced at zero. “I’m not saying there’s no problems,” he allowed, but he said it’s a much different world from when he was growing up, and his low-income family had to budget for, say, their car breaking down every so often.","https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2249826533-e1768592346699.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2026-01-17 13:00:25.817368

The utility giant, with a market capitalization of nearly $52 billion, has seen its stock trading near its 52-week high of $62.87 as investors respond to developments in this significant renewable energy initiative.

The court decision enables work to continue on the project while Dominion Energy’s lawsuit challenging a federal agency’s action proceeds. The company stated it will now focus on safely restarting construction activities to ensure the project begins delivering energy in the coming weeks. InvestingPro data shows Dominion currently operates with a significant debt burden, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.83, reflecting the capital-intensive nature of such large infrastructure projects.

The CVOW project will consist of 176 offshore wind energy turbines with a combined capacity of 2.6 gigawatts, which the company says could power up to 660,000 homes. Dominion Energy describes the project as part of its strategy to meet the region’s growing energy demand. Despite the capital expenditure, the company has maintained its impressive 43-year streak of consecutive dividend payments, currently offering investors a 4.42% yield.

Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) provides regulated electricity service to 3.6 million customers across Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, along with natural gas service to 500,000 customers in South Carolina.

The company is pursuing a resolution of the matter through continued cooperation with the federal government while its legal challenge moves forward.

In other recent news, Dominion Resources has faced significant developments concerning its Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project. The U.S. Department of Interior issued a 90-day suspension of work on the project, citing national security concerns related to potential radar interference with military operations. This suspension affects multiple offshore wind projects, representing a $25 billion investment collectively. Dominion Energy expressed concerns that this pause could impact grid reliability in areas with critical infrastructure, including military installations and data centers.

Analyst firms have responded to these developments with mixed reactions. Jefferies lowered its price target for Dominion Resources from $62.00 to $60.00, maintaining a Hold rating, due to potential regulatory risks associated with the CVOW project. Meanwhile, TD Cowen initiated coverage on Dominion Resources with a Hold rating and a $65.00 price target, describing the company as a ""classic turnaround utility story."" BTIG has reiterated its Neutral rating on Dominion Resources, citing recent regulatory decisions that provide the company with increased certainty. These developments highlight the ongoing challenges and opportunities facing Dominion Resources in its energy projects.

Environmental groups argued Friday that PJM’s data center plan favors fossil fuels.
“The primary fast-tracking of energy PJM is doing is biased towards fossil gas,” wrote Charkoudian, vice chair of the House Economic Matters Committee.
Stanek, a former Maryland utility regulator, argued that PJM has pursued multiple reforms to approve new energy projects more quickly.
But he remains concerned that Moore will focus on renewable sources, such as wind and solar, to supply that new power to the grid.","Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) found himself in a rare position Friday: Joining forces with President Donald Trump’s (R) administration on energy policy.

Moore was one of 13 governors who signed an agreement with the Trump administration, pushing for PJM Interconnection, the operator of the nation’s largest electric grid, to bring $15 billion worth of new power online — with data center companies paying the tab.

Moore has been a critic of PJM, arguing that its policies delayed new clean energy projects, which got stuck in a backlogged queue waiting for approval, and then electricity demand skyrocketed because of power-hungry data centers.

“I have been crystal clear: We cannot build a 21st-century economy on an energy market that blocks new supply,” Moore said in a statement Friday. “This moment calls for urgency. Maryland families and businesses must be served by a reliable grid without shouldering the cost of sky-high energy bills.”

But PJM’s Board of Directors released its own data center plan later Friday.

That plan also initiated a “backstop procurement” for new energy. But PJM merely directed its staff to study assigning the costs of new energy to the jurisdictions, who could then pass those costs to the data center companies, such as Amazon and Google.

PJM’s plan also encourages — but doesn’t mandate — “bring your own generation,” wherein data centers could choose to bring new power onto the system on an expedited basis, to defray the possibility of being asked to reduce their power demand when the grid is strained.

“This decision is about how PJM integrates large new loads in a way that preserves reliability for customers while creating a predictable, transparent path for growth,” said David Mills, PJM Board Chair and Interim President and CEO, in a statement.

“This is not a yes/no to data centers,” Mills’ statement said. “This is, ‘How can we do this while keeping the lights on and recognizing the impact on consumers at the same time?’ We look forward to implementing, along with our stakeholders, these proposals to manage the phenomenal demand growth we are experiencing.”

PJM’s plan also includes changes to the way that the grid operator forecasts energy demand. Concerns had been raised that PJM’s projections were inflated, because companies looking to build data centers could be shopping the same data center proposal in more than one jurisdiction.

According to a news release from PJM, some of the items will require approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, while others can take place immediately.

Environmental groups argued Friday that PJM’s data center plan favors fossil fuels.

The Natural Resources Defense Council said in a statement that PJM’s decision protects “everyday families from blackouts” caused by data centers, but it falls short when it comes to new power generation.

PJM has created a “fast-track process that effectively excludes clean energy projects and gives special treatment to fossil fuel power plants built for data centers, allowing them to cut ahead of low-cost clean resources that have been waiting years to connect to the grid,” wrote Claire Lang-Ree, advocate for the Sustainable FERC Project at NRDC.

Maryland Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D- Montgomery) also chimed in, adding that PJM’s decision doesn’t provide sufficient protections for ratepayers.

“The primary fast-tracking of energy PJM is doing is biased towards fossil gas,” wrote Charkoudian, vice chair of the House Economic Matters Committee. “Given that solar and batteries are the fastest, cheapest way to provide new generation, this is another example of PJM serving for-profit energy companies and not families who can’t afford their energy bill.”

A Trump spokesperson called the administration’s plan with the governors an “unprecedented bi-partisan effort urging PJM to fix the energy subtraction failures of the past, prevent price increases, and reduce the risk of blackouts.”

“Ensuring the American people have reliable and affordable electricity is one of President Trump’s top priorities, and this would deliver much-needed, long-term relief to the Mid-Atlantic region,” wrote White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers in a statement.

The governors’ proposal would also have extended a cap on PJM’s energy capacity auction, which has lowered the price charged to ratepayers from the last several auctions, during which PJM procures energy supply to feed the grid in the future.

But PJM decided to request additional feedback about the cap before making a final decision.

Meanwhile, PJM executive director Jason Stanek was in Annapolis on Friday, speaking to a panel of legislators from Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, convened by Maryland’s conservative Freedom Caucus.

Stanek, a former Maryland utility regulator, argued that PJM has pursued multiple reforms to approve new energy projects more quickly.

“Despite what you may have heard, our interconnection queue is open, and PJM has been processing the connection of new, and mostly renewable, resources to connect to the grid at record pace,” Stanek said. “We soon hope to turn around requests in a period of one to two years, or possibly sooner.”

During his remarks, Stanek said that states own part of the blame for energy supply worries — and high electric bills, citing state-level energy policies and permitting procedures. He urged the legislators in the room to look inward as they aim to reduce prices.

“We would implore all of our states in the PJM region not to retire any more [power] resources until you have a sufficient amount of resources to backfill those retirements,” Stanek said.

“We would also ask that you look at your state permitting laws on the books to determine whether or not we can actually build energy infrastructure in your states in a timely manner.”

The Republicans in attendance were insistent that Maryland has contributed to its own power woes, by passing legislation to push the state away from fossil fuels — and toward a grid fueled by solar, wind and nuclear power. By law, Maryland has until 2031 to cut its carbon emissions 60% from 2006 levels.

“Why would politicians push to force the economy onto electricity while simultaneously shutting down the very power plants needed to generate it? It’s simple. Virtue signaling, green dreams over common sense,” said Del. Mark Fisher (R-Calvert).

Senate Minority Leader Steve Hershey (R-Upper Shore) said Friday that he was initially encouraged by the PJM governors’ announcement, because he agrees that data centers should pay for new power. But he remains concerned that Moore will focus on renewable sources, such as wind and solar, to supply that new power to the grid.

“Gov. Moore needs to embrace natural gas,” Hershey said. “He hasn’t done it yet. He’s trying to talk about nuclear, because it’s clean, but nuclear is 12 or 15 years out. As we heard today in this hearing, the quickest way to get reliable energy back on grid is to open up these retired fossil fuel generation facilities.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-101/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/52232240165_3efe674540_o-1024x6831768665316.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=RSos3tNW,N,,2026-01-17 12:00:00.463520

As more state public finance crypto efforts develop, the shift represents a change in a core philosophy of safety and liquidity that has dominated the investing of state and local funds for centuries.","Led by Texas and New Hampshire, U.S. states across the national map, both red and blue in political stripes, are developing bitcoin strategic reserves and bringing cryptocurrencies onto their books through additional state finance and budgeting measures.

Texas recently became the first state to purchase bitcoin after a legislative effort that began in 2024, but numerous states have joined the ""Reserve Race"" to pass legislation that will allow them to ultimately buy cryptocurrencies.

New Hampshire passed its crypto strategic reserve law last May, even before Texas, giving the state treasurer the authority to invest up to 5% of the state funds in crypto ETFs, though precious metals such as gold are also authorized for purchase. Arizona passed similar legislation, while Massachusetts, Ohio, and South Dakota have legislation at various stages of committee review.

Despite much of the legislation being largely sponsored or co-sponsored by Republicans, the adoption of crypto at the state level is not expected to strictly fall along party lines. The 2024 election cycle was the first time that the cryptocurrency industry played a major role in lobbying in both state and national elections. In fact, it was the largest corporate donor in an election cycle, with support given to candidates on both sides. It is already amassing a war chest for the 2026 midterms.

Congress is currently debating a crypto market structure bill, and state-level politicians are as much out to prove that they, and their states, won't be left out of the digital assets boom. Justin Marlowe, a public policy professor at the University of Chicago, sees the state-level trend as largely one of signaling at present. ""If you're a governor and you want to broadcast that you are amenable to innovative business development in the digital economy, these are relatively low-cost, low-risk ways to send that signal. That's why we've seen leaders across the ideological spectrum and all over the country take tangible steps in this direction,"" he said.

Where the state-level crypto efforts can be described as ""bigger steps"" — Marlowe cited Texas, Arizona, and Florida, as examples — he said it has helped to acknowledge the growing political power of crypto advocates in these states.

Similarities in the actions taken across states to date include include authorizing the state treasurer or other investment official to allow the investment of a limited amount of public funds in crypto and building out the governance structure needed to invest in crypto. This often will involve more frequent reporting requirements and stronger custodial agreements compared to traditional asset classes. The seeding of the reserve can take the form of utilizing cash or government-seized crypto, as in the recent case of the federal government. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a strategic bitcoin reserve last March, but limited the authorization to seized crypto in an effort to show taxpayers would bear no financial burden.

It is no surprise that Texas was the first state to fund a crypto reserve. Texas has been a crypto hub for years through its role in bitcoin mining. The state's affordable and flexible power, as well as a political environment that has largely been pro-crypto, led Texas in recent years to a sizable position in not just the national, but global bitcoin hashing market.

""Texas has spent the last few years becoming one of the key centers of bitcoin activity, especially on the mining side,"" said Christian Catalini, founder of the MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab, seeing this move as one that early branded the state as ""open for business"" when it comes to digital assets.

""Once you've made that bet on infrastructure and industry, adding some Bitcoin exposure at the treasury level is a natural next step,"" Catalini said. Such a move essentially makes the state's balance sheet one that is explicitly aligned with the ecosystem it aims to attract.

Texas also has a long history with bitcoin's traditional market competitor: gold.

""Texas has proven to be a bedrock of government adoption of bitcoin, starting with laws that allow for legal custody arrangements akin to gold storage laws that are well established there,"" said Nik Bhatia, founder of The Bitcoin Layer.

When it comes to storing physical gold, Texas has clear rules on storage and ownership, and even the language invoked – vaults, custodians – helps grease the wheels for crypto assets at the state level. The Texas Bullion Depository of 2015, which allowed for state-level depository of bullion and precious metals, was specifically adapted to apply to digital assets like bitcoin. The Texas Bullion Depositary was the first state-administered precious metals depository in the nation.

Texas has not purchased any on-chain bitcoin. After passing the legislation to create a strategic bitcoin reserve that gave authorization to the state comptroller to hold the cryptocurrency, Texas purchased a stake in a bitcoin ETF — roughly $5 million in the largest bitcoin ETF, the BlackRock iShares' Bitcoin Trust (IBIT ), which since its launch in January 2024 has grown to over $72 billion in assets under management.

The Comptroller's office made its purchase on the morning of November 20, 2025, when the price of a single bitcoin was $91,336. As of Saturday morning, bitcoin was trading at a little over $95,000.

Bhatia said the approval of bitcoin ETFs by the SEC was crucial to the state plans to be comfortable with the holdings under current U.S. securities law. ""Using ETFs is a very clean and safe way to invest in bitcoin, minimizing storage logistical risk and opting for security law protection,"" Bhatia said.

Texas state officials have described this purchase — which deployed only half of the $10 million set aside by the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve — as a ""placeholder"" while security and storage for raw bitcoin can be put into place.

Crypto's move into core state finance and budgeting

In addition to the concept of reserve funds, states are bringing crypto into core finance functions, with an approach that balances the inherent trepidation of venturing into new terrain with a desire to be a part of the fast-moving crypto realm.

New Hampshire, for example, became the first state to approve the issuance of a bitcoin-backed municipal bond last November, a $100 million issuance that would mark the first time cryptocurrency is used as collateral in the U.S. municipal bond market. The deal has not taken place yet, though plans are for the issuance to occur this year. ""The idea is they'll use bitcoin to back a municipal bond issue, the proceeds of which will then be divvied up into loans to smaller governments for economic development projects across the state,"" Marlowe said. Repayment of these loans will recapitalize the fund.

It is a creative evolution in state finances, but like many of the mechanisms for crypto development at the state level, it utilizes existing financial structures and state goals, according to Marlowe, with similar public bonds in prior decades used for projects like clean water, school upgrades, and other infrastructure. ""What's different here is it's bitcoin rather than taxpayer dollars as the collateral,"" he said.

In numerous states, including, Colorada, Utah, and Louisiana, crypto is now accepted as payment for taxes and other state business. As more state public finance crypto efforts develop, the shift represents a change in a core philosophy of safety and liquidity that has dominated the investing of state and local funds for centuries.

In recent decades, assets including real estate and private equity expanded the investment approach of public funds, but crypto represents not only the most recent addition, but the most volatile.

""For many in the state/local investing industry, crypto-backed assets are still far too speculative and volatile for public money,"" Marlowe said. ""But others, and I think there's a sort of generational shift in the works, see it as a reasonable store of value that is actually stronger on many other public sector values like transparency and asset integrity,"" he added.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108252507-1768414217350-gettyimages-1076707262-_cpr3811.jpeg?v=1768414237&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2026-01-17 11:59:31.026146

The president’s promise to slash power bills was, along with similar pledges to cut grocery costs and to reduce immigration to the US, a key pillar of his 2024 election triumph.
“Instead of reducing electric bills by 50%, the president’s actions have raised the cost of home energy for all Americans.
Democrats and their allies have warned Trump that his broken promise on energy bills will haunt his fellow Republicans.
“Are blue states going to adopt President Trump’s commonsense energy agenda to bring energy prices down in their states?”","Donald Trump has comprehensively failed to meet a key election promise to slash Americans’ energy bills in half within the first year of his presidency, with power prices instead surging across the US.

The average household electricity bill in the US was 6.7% more expensive in 2025 compared with the previous year, according to a Guardian analysis of data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the Department of Energy’s statistical arm. The increases meant that, on average, US households paid nearly $116 more across 2025 than they did in 2024.

The power bill increases have been extreme in many parts of the US, with residents of Washington DC experiencing the biggest increase, a 23% jump in electricity costs, followed by Indiana, with a 17% rise, and then Illinois, with a 15% increase, the EIA data shows. The midwest is the region of the US that has been hit by the steepest bill rises, which include utility costs laden on top of an underlying 4.9% average increase in the unit cost of the electricity itself.

On top of soaring electricity bills, US households have also been confronted by rising gas prices, which have jumped 5.2% on average in the past year, according to the EIA. As a result, there has been a spike in power disconnections for unpaid bills across many states – in New York the rate of disconnections rose fivefold from a year previous – with some households having to forgo other essentials in order to keep the lights on.

This all means that, with just days until the first anniversary of his inauguration, Trump has missed his self-imposed target of cutting bills in half in his first year. The president’s promise to slash power bills was, along with similar pledges to cut grocery costs and to reduce immigration to the US, a key pillar of his 2024 election triumph.

“You have some states where the power bills are instead up 10% or 20%, which is why so many people are angry about this now,” said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA).

“Instead of reducing electric bills by 50%, the president’s actions have raised the cost of home energy for all Americans. It used to be the poorest Americans who struggled with their power bills, but now we are seeing more and more middle-income families who have to make sacrifices to avoid being shut off. But there’s a limit to how much people are able to sacrifice, which we are very concerned about.”

During his election campaign, Trump repeatedly vowed to tackle power bills. “I will cut the price of energy and electricity in half,” he said at one rally in Detroit in October 2024. “12 months from January 20 – I take office on January 20 – your electric bill, including cars, air conditioning, heaters, everything, the total electric bill will be 50, 5-0 per cent, less.”

Trump told voters at a separate event that “your energy bill within 12 months will be cut in half. I’ll have your energy bill down within 12 months, throughout the country … That’s my pledge, all over the country.”

But this rhetoric has sharply reversed as electricity has replaced eggs as the most-talked-about area of inflation, with Trump recently claiming that the affordability crisis is a “hoax” and a “fake narrative” invented by his political enemies. On Tuesday, the president said he had overseen the “greatest first year in history” for the economy.

“The administration is tone-deaf about this – the president said it’s all made up, when it is in fact quite clear,” said Wolfe. “Families are struggling to pay energy bills and yet the Trump administration’s actions have made it worse.”

Angie Shaneyfelt, a 52-year-old resident of Baltimore, Maryland, has seen her bill shoot up rapidly this year, from less than $300 in December 2024 to $400 last month. In an effort to keep up with the increases, Shaneyfelt has considered taking up a second job, even signing up to deliver food with DoorDash last month.

More work hours would give her even less time with her twin 13-year-old daughters, but with another gas and electric rate hike planned for next month, she may be forced to bring in more income. “I’ve already slimmed back so much stuff,” she said. “And now I have to give up my time with my family?”

Trump pushes oil and gas – and AI

The administration’s energy policy has centered on ramping up the drilling of oil and gas – already at record levels in the US – while tearing up environmental rules that delay projects and limit the amount of pollution Americans are exposed to.

Trump has also embarked upon the aggressive promotion of an artificial intelligence industry that is raising US electricity demand for the first time in decades, while at the same time blocking numerous renewable energy projects he calls a “scam” and a “con job” but were set to provide electricity for millions of American homes.

This agenda – coupled with administration edicts to reverse the closure of ageing coal plants and to restart the overseas export of liquified natural gas, both actions that can raise costs for domestic consumers – has ensured that Trump’s election promise to cut bills had little chance of being met, experts say.

“The fundamental dynamic is that we are using more electricity than we did 12 months ago and the infrastructure isn’t keeping pace with that extra demand – if anything, we have fallen further behind,” said Abe Silverman, an expert in the energy transition at Johns Hopkins University.

The cost of Americans’ power bills largely matched overall inflation until around 2020, when they started to diverge, driven by a constellation of regionally varying factors such as utility upgrades of transmission lines, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and disruption from extreme weather events worsened by the climate crisis.

The rapid advance of AI has accelerated this trend, Silverman said, only for the administration to block available clean-energy projects, particularly offshore wind, from meeting soaring demand. In December, Trump halted construction of five windfarms off the east coast, a move that has been challenged in the courts. “We have not approved one windmill since I’ve been in office, and we’re going to keep it that way,” Trump said this month.

“If you think of it as a race, the demand-growth horse has got a shot of adrenaline and is galloping around the track at a faster pace,” Silverman said. “The supply horse is losing, by a lot. Unfortunately with the ideologically driven attack on certain technologies, such as wind and solar, it’s made it very difficult for investment to proceed and get the extra electrons we desperately need.”

As stress grows over bills, help is being cut

Electricity bills are now a “major” source of stress for more than a third of all Americans, polling has found, with colder-than-expected temperatures this winter pushing up heating bills by 9.2% on average compared with a year ago. The average household will pay $995 on heating this winter, an increase of $84 from last winter, as families struggle with electricity prices that are the highest in a decade, according to the NEADA.

As more Americans face higher bills, the Trump administration has slashed federal assistance, eliminating tax credits for home energy efficiency upgrades and attempting to scrap a federal program that helps low-income people with their energy bills, a move that would affect more than 6m households that rely on this support for heating and cooling.

Trump’s promise to bring down gasoline costs has seen more success, with retail prices at the gas pump falling by 6% on average in the last year. This decrease, the third year in a row in which gasoline prices have dropped, is due to a global glut of crude oil and a fall in demand due to concerns over an economic downturn, according to the EIA. Trump has claimed that the US seizing control of Venezuela’s oilfields will help drive down the cost of gasoline for American drivers.

Perhaps cognizant of a growing political backlash to persistently high power bills, Trump said this week he is pressing tech companies to foot the bill for the rising costs associated with their datacenters. “We are the ‘HOTTEST’ Country in the World, and Number One in AI,” the president posted on Truth Social. “Data Centers are key to that boom, and keeping Americans FREE and SECURE but, the big Technology Companies who build them must ‘pay their own way.’”

The overall cost of living is likely to remain a salient topic for voters this year, though, before the midterm elections in November that will determine the balance of power in Congress. Democrats and their allies have warned Trump that his broken promise on energy bills will haunt his fellow Republicans.

“Trump and Republicans are making life more expensive by taking energy options off the grid while demand skyrockets,” said Jesse Lee, senior adviser to Climate Power, a climate advocacy group. “We’re going to make sure that every Republican who rubber-stamps Trump’s anti-energy agenda pays the political price in 2026.”

A White House spokesperson said that lowering energy prices is a “top priority” for the president and said that Democratic-run states have seen higher costs than Republican-led states.

""Energy drives everything, and I mean everything,"" Delegate Brian Chisholm said. ""It is the future or it's the failure of this country going forward.""

Currently, Maryland imports about 40% of its energy from other states, and Republicans have long-criticized the state's current focus toward clean energy.

Officials with PJM, the regional grid operator, also spoke at the hearing, saying in order to have meaningful relief for ratepayers, the supply and demand needs to balance out. Since the demand is unlikely to decrease, due to data centers and other forms of electrification, supply needs to increase.

""State governments are ultimately responsible for resource adequacy,"" Jason Stanek, the Executive Director for Governmental Services with PJM, said.

While many Democrats have been advocates of renewable and clean energy sources like solar and wind, despite differences among the parties, even at the start of session there is already some middle ground.

While Senate President Bill Ferguson said while he is a strong believer of renewable energy sources, he acknowledged that reliability can be a problem with them. He said other sources of energy are also needed, which include natural gas in some capacity.

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle also support nuclear energy, but acknowledge that is a long-term solution since it can take years to get those projects connected to the grid.

This comes as Gov. Wes Moore joined a coalition of governors at the White House to sign a Statement of Principles, calling for urgent reforms related to PJM. The agreement, outlines a strategy to incentivize new power generation, protect residential customers from price increases, and ensure that data centers pay for the generation investments they drive.

“I have been crystal clear: We cannot build a 21st-century economy on an energy market that blocks new supply,” Gov. Moore said. “This moment calls for urgency. Maryland families and businesses must be served by a reliable grid without shouldering the cost of sky-high energy bills.”

During the evening of Jan. 16, PJM announced a series of actions, which will be taken to address the challenges of integrating new data centers and other large load customers onto the grid, while preserving reliability and affordability. Those steps will include load forecasting improvements and increased role for states, avenues for new large loads to bring their own new generation, creation of an accelerated interconnection track for state-sponsored generation projects and a review of PJM markets.

“This decision is about how PJM integrates large new loads in a way that preserves reliability for customers while creating a predictable, transparent path for growth,” David Mills, PJM Board Chair and Interim President and CEO said. “This is not a yes-no to data centers. This is ‘How can we do this while keeping the lights on and recognizing the impact on consumers at the same time?’ We look forward to implementing, along with our stakeholders, these proposals to manage the phenomenal demand growth we are experiencing.”",https://foxbaltimore.com/resources/media2/16x9/1280/1320/center/90/08a47662-daa0-4740-8212-b78388117483-PENERGY.transfer_frame_6111.jpeg,N,,2026-01-17 13:58:53.820202

But building the kind of power plants that the Trump administration prefers has become extremely difficult. Nobody has constructed a US coal plant in over a decade. And no developers have released plans for large-scale nuclear after the last new reactor came in billions of dollars over budget and years behind schedule.

Gas plants have their own challenges. The time it takes to get a US gas plant into service is increasing, with average lead times growing from 3.5 years to 5 years between 2023 and 2025, according to BloombergNEF. The cost of building a combined-cycle gas plant, the more efficient type, grew about 49% over the same time frame.

“The key limits are the turbine market and the people who actually build these things,” said Evercore analyst Nicholas Amicucci. “Siting and permitting are a mess.”

The massive jump in power consumption from data centers, new factories and the overall electrification of the economy has led to an accompanying spike in the demand for the turbines that produce electricity by burning natural gas. That’s led to a rush among tech firms, utilities and developers all competing to secure a limited number of gas turbines. Turbine manufacturer GE Vernova has said it’s sold out through 2028 and is now taking orders for 2029.

Advocates focused on reducing waste say the bill is a free pass for the plastic industry to continue pushing plastic into the marketplace without considering where it ends up.","The plastics industry is not happy with California. And it’s looking to friends in Congress to put the Golden State in its place.

California has not figured out how to reduce single-use plastic. But its efforts to do so have created a headache for the fossil fuel industry and plastic manufacturers. The two businesses are linked since most plastic is derived from oil or natural gas.

In December, a Republican congressman from Texas introduced a bill designed to preempt states — in particular, California — from imposing their own truth-in-labeling or recycling laws. The bill, called the Packaging and Claims Knowledge Act, calls for a national standard for environmental claims on packaging that companies would voluntarily adhere to.

“California’s policies have slowed American commerce long enough,” Rep. Randy Weber (R-Texas) said in a post on the social media platform X announcing the bill. “Not anymore.”

The legislation was written for American consumers, Weber said in a press release. Its purpose is to reduce a patchwork of state recycling and composting laws that only confuse people, he said, and make it hard for them to know which products are recyclable, compostable or destined for the landfill.

But it’s clear that California’s laws — such as Senate Bill 343, which requires that packaging meet certain recycling milestones in order to carry the chasing arrows recycling label — are the ones he and the industry have in mind.

“Packaging and labeling standards in the United States are increasingly influenced by state-level regulations, particularly those adopted in California,” Weber said in a statement. “Because of the size of California’s market, standards set by the state can have national implications for manufacturers, supply chains and consumers, even when companies operate primarily outside of California.”

It’s a departure from Weber’s usual stance on states’ rights, which he has supported in the past on topics such as marriage laws, abortion, border security and voting.

“We need to remember that the 13 Colonies and the 13 states created the federal government,” he said on Fox News in 2024, in an interview about the border. “The federal government did not create the states. ... All rights go to the people in the state, the states and the people respectively.”

During the 2023-2024 campaign cycle, the oil and gas industry was Weber’s largest contributor, with more than $130,000 from companies such as Philips 66, the American Chemistry Council, Koch Inc. and Valero, according to OpenSecrets.org.

Weber did not respond to a request for comment. The bill has been referred to the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

Plastic and packaging companies and trade organizations such as Ameripen, Keurig, Dr Pepper, the Biodegradable Plastics Industry and the Plastics Industry Assn. have come out in support of the bill.

Other companies and trade groups that manufacture plastics that are banned in California — such as Dart, which produces polystyrene, and plastic bag manufacturers such as Amcor — support the bill. So do some who could potentially lose their recycling label because they’re not meeting California’s requirements. They include the Carton Council, which represents companies that make milk and other beverage containers.

“Plastic packaging is essential to modern life ... yet companies and consumers are currently navigating a complex landscape of rules around recyclable, compostable, and reusable packaging claims,” Matt Seaholm, chief executive of the Plastics Industry Assn., said in a statement. The bill “would establish a clear national framework under the FTC, reducing uncertainty and supporting businesses operating across state lines.”

The law, if enacted, would require the Federal Trade Commission to work with third-party certifiers to determine the recyclability, compostability or reusability of a product or packaging material, and make the designation consistent across the country.

The law applies to all kinds of packaging, not just plastic.

Lauren Zuber, a spokeswoman for Ameripen — a packaging trade association — said in an email that the law doesn’t necessarily target California, but the Golden State has “created problematic labeling requirements” that “threaten to curtail recycling instead of encouraging it by confusing consumers.”

Ameripen helped draft the legislation.

Advocates focused on reducing waste say the bill is a free pass for the plastic industry to continue pushing plastic into the marketplace without considering where it ends up. They say the bill would gut consumer trust and make it harder for people to know whether the products they are dealing with are truly recyclable, compostable or reusable.

“California’s truth-in-advertising laws exist for a simple reason: People should be able to trust what companies tell them,” said Nick Lapis, director of advocacy for Californians Against Waste. “It’s not surprising that manufacturers of unrecyclable plastic want to weaken those rules, but it’s pretty astonishing that some members of Congress think their constituents want to be misled.”

If the bill were adopted, it would “punish the companies that have done the right thing by investing in real solutions.”

“At the end of the day, a product isn’t recyclable if it doesn’t get recycled, and it isn’t compostable if it doesn’t get composted. Deception is never in the public interest,” he said.

On Friday, California’s Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta announced settlements totaling $3.35 million with three major plastic bag producers for violating state law regarding deceptive marketing of non-recyclable bags. The settlement follows a similar one in October with five other plastic bag manufacturers.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6e12659/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3528+0+476/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F58%2F90%2F2f08e9fa4e13946196883e1abd11%2F1192415-me-plastics-project-wilmington-recycling-plant-05-cmc.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 11:00:29.443977

The Details: Media outlets took different approaches in their coverage of the new air pollution policy changes, ranging from warnings of a major shift to pushback from officials who say the reporting mischaracterized the agency's plans. The New York Times (Lean Left bias) reported that the EPA may stop counting many health gains from reducing fine particulate matter and ozone, citing internal documents reviewed by the Times. But the EPA said it will continue considering health impacts when setting pollution limits.

Key Quotes: EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin denied the claims by the Times, saying on social media platform X that the story is ""another dishonest, fake news claim courtesy of the New York Times."" Charlie Stadtlander, a spokesperson for the Times, said in a statement: ""Our reporting on internal EPA documents found that the agency is no longer calculating the health benefits of reducing fine particulate matter and ozone pollution when writing clean-air regulations.""

For Context: Although levels of particle pollution and ground‑level ozone are lower than in past decades, many areas still experience unhealthy levels, according to the EPA. These pollutants come from cars, power plants, industrial facilities, and wildfires, and they can travel long distances across state lines. Fine particles and ozone are linked to asthma attacks, heart and lung problems, and premature death.

How The Media Covered It: Fox News (Right bias) centered its report on EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who denounced The New York Times for ""claiming in a headline that the agency"" won't consider the impact of air pollution on human health.

That sun has provided him cheap power for 25 years, and this month he installed his fourth iteration of solar panels on his Vermont home. In an interview after he set up the new system, he said President Donald Trump's stance against solar and other cheap green energy will hurt the GOP in this year's elections as electricity bills rise.

After the Biden and Obama administrations subsidized and championed solar, wind and other green power as answers to fight climate change, Trump has tried to dampen those and turn to older and dirtier fossil fuels. The Trump administration froze five big offshore wind projects last month but judges this week allowed three of the projects to resume. Federal clean energy tax incentives expired on Dec. 31 that include installing home solar panels.

Meanwhile, electricity prices are rising in the United States, and McKibben is counting on that to trigger political change.

“I think you’re starting to see that have a big political impact in the U.S. right now. My prediction would be that electric prices are going to be to the 2026 election what egg prices were to the 2024 election,” said McKibben, an author and founder of multiple environmental and activist groups. Everyday inflation hurt Democrats in the last presidential race, analysts said.

The Trump administration and a bipartisan group of governors on Friday tried to step up pressure on the operator of the nation’s largest electric grid to take urgent steps to boost power supplies in the mid-Atlantic and keep electricity bills from rising even higher.

“Ensuring the American people have reliable and affordable electricity is one of President Trump’s top priorities,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.

Renewable energy prices drop around the world

Globally, the price of wind and solar power is plummeting to the point that they are cheaper than fossil fuels, the United Nations found. And China leads the world in renewable energy technology, with one of its electric car companies passing Tesla in annual sales.

""We can’t economically compete in a world where China gets a lot of cheap energy and we have to pay for really expensive energy,"" McKibben told The Associated Press, just after he installed a new type of solar panels that can hang on balconies with little fuss.

When Trump took office in January 2025, the national average electricity cost was 15.94 cents per kilowatt-hour. By September it was up to 18.07 cents and then down slightly to 17.98 cents in October, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

That's a 12.8% increase in 10 months. It rose more in 10 months than the previous two years. People in Maryland, New Jersey and Maine have seen electricity prices rise at a rate three times higher than the national average since October 2024.

At 900 kilowatt-hours per month, that means the average monthly electricity bill is about $18 more than in January 2025.

Democrats blame Trump for rising electric bills

This week, Democrats on Capitol Hill blamed rising electric bills on Trump and his dislike of renewable energy.

“From his first day in office, he’s made it his mission to limit American’s access to cheap energy, all in the name of increasing profits for his friends in the fossil fuel industry. As a result, energy bills across the country have skyrocketed,"" Illinois Rep. Sean Casten said at a Wednesday news conference.

“Donald Trump is the first president to intentionally raise the price of something that we all need,” Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, also a Democrat, said Wednesday on the Senate floor. “Nobody should be enthused about paying more for electricity, and this national solar ban is making everybody pay more. Clean is cheap and cheap is clean.”

Solar panels on McKibben's Vermont home

McKibben has been sending excess electricity from his solar panels to the Vermont grid for years. Now he's sending more.

As his dog, Birke, stood watch, McKibben, who refers to his home nestled in the Green Mountains of Vermont as a “museum of solar technology"" got his new panels up and running in about 10 minutes. This type of panel from the California-based firm Bright Saver is often referred to as plug-in solar. Though it's not yet widely available in the U.S., McKibben pointed to the style's popularity in Europe and Australia.

“Americans spend three or four times as much money as Australians or Europeans to put solar panels on the roof. We have an absurdly overcomplicated permitting system that’s unlike anything else on the rest of the planet,"" McKibben said.

McKibben said Australians can obtain three hours of free electricity each day through a government program because the country has built so many solar panels.

“And I’m almost certain that that’s an argument that every single person in America would understand,"" he said. ""I don’t know anyone who wouldn’t say: ‘I’d like three free hours of electricity.’”

Globally, the price of wind and solar power is plummeting to the point that they are cheaper than fossil fuels, the United Nations found. And China leads the world in renewable energy technology, with one of its electric car companies passing Tesla in annual sales.

“We can’t economically compete in a world where China gets a lot of cheap energy and we have to pay for really expensive energy,” McKibben told The Associated Press, just after he installed a new type of solar panels that can hang on balconies with little fuss.

When Trump took office in January 2025, the national average electricity cost was 15.94 cents per kilowatt-hour. By September it was up to 18.07 cents and then down slightly to 17.98 cents in October, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

That’s a 12.8% increase in 10 months. It rose more in 10 months than the previous two years. People in Maryland, New Jersey and Maine have seen electricity prices rise at a rate three times higher than the national average since October 2024.

At 900 kilowatt-hours per month, that means the average monthly electricity bill is about $18 more than in January 2025.

Democrats blame Trump for rising electric bills

This week, Democrats on Capitol Hill blamed rising electric bills on Trump and his dislike of renewable energy.

“From his first day in office, he’s made it his mission to limit American’s access to cheap energy, all in the name of increasing profits for his friends in the fossil fuel industry. As a result, energy bills across the country have skyrocketed,” Illinois Rep. Sean Casten said at a Wednesday news conference.

“Donald Trump is the first president to intentionally raise the price of something that we all need,” Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, also a Democrat, said Wednesday on the Senate floor. “Nobody should be enthused about paying more for electricity, and this national solar ban is making everybody pay more. Clean is cheap and cheap is clean.”

Solar panels on McKibben’s Vermont home

McKibben has been sending excess electricity from his solar panels to the Vermont grid for years. Now he’s sending more.

As his dog, Birke, stood watch, McKibben, who refers to his home nestled in the Green Mountains of Vermont as a “museum of solar technology” got his new panels up and running in about 10 minutes. This type of panel from the California-based firm Bright Saver is often referred to as plug-in solar. Though it’s not yet widely available in the U.S., McKibben pointed to the style’s popularity in Europe and Australia.

“Americans spend three or four times as much money as Australians or Europeans to put solar panels on the roof. We have an absurdly overcomplicated permitting system that’s unlike anything else on the rest of the planet,” McKibben said.

McKibben said Australians can obtain three hours of free electricity each day through a government program because the country has built so many solar panels.

“And I’m almost certain that that’s an argument that every single person in America would understand,” he said. “I don’t know anyone who wouldn’t say: ‘I’d like three free hours of electricity.’”

“Americans spend three or four times as much money as Australians or Europeans to put solar panels on the roof.","RIPTON, Vermont (AP) — At a time when the Trump administration rolled back numerous environmental regulations while global temperatures and U.S. carbon pollution spiked, longtime climate activist Bill McKibben finds hope in something that didn’t seem that strong on a recent single-digit-temperature day: the sun.

That sun has provided him cheap power for 25 years, and this month he installed his fourth iteration of solar panels on his Vermont home. In an interview after he set up the new system, he said President Donald Trump’s stance against solar and other cheap green energy will hurt the GOP in this year’s elections as electricity bills rise.

After the Biden and Obama administrations subsidized and championed solar, wind and other green power as answers to fight climate change, Trump has tried to dampen those and turn to older and dirtier fossil fuels. The Trump administration froze five big offshore wind projects last month but judges this week allowed three of the projects to resume. Federal clean energy tax incentives expired on Dec. 31 that include installing home solar panels.

Meanwhile, electricity prices are rising in the United States, and McKibben is counting on that to trigger political change.

“I think you’re starting to see that have a big political impact in the U.S. right now. My prediction would be that electric prices are going to be to the 2026 election what egg prices were to the 2024 election,” said McKibben, an author and founder of multiple environmental and activist groups. Everyday inflation hurt Democrats in the last presidential race, analysts said.

The Trump administration and a bipartisan group of governors on Friday tried to step up pressure on the operator of the nation’s largest electric grid to take urgent steps to boost power supplies in the mid-Atlantic and keep electricity bills from rising even higher.

“Ensuring the American people have reliable and affordable electricity is one of President Trump’s top priorities,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.

The exponential growth of electric vehicle adoption worldwide has created an unprecedented challenge for governments seeking to maintain control over critical mineral supply chains. As battery technologies mature and reach end-of-life cycles, nations must navigate complex trade-offs between environmental protection, strategic resource security, and industrial competitiveness. China's approach to this challenge represents a fundamental shift toward centralised material flow control that extends far beyond traditional environmental regulations, particularly as china mandates ev batteries remain with vehicles.

The Chinese regulatory framework encompasses comprehensive lifecycle management systems designed to capture maximum value from degraded battery materials whilst preventing uncontrolled disposal channels. This strategic approach addresses multiple objectives simultaneously: environmental protection through standardised processing, material security through domestic retention, and competitive positioning through secondary material market development.

Critical Threshold Analysis:

Waste Volume Year Projected Tonnes Growth Rate 2020 200,000 Baseline 2025 780,000 290% increase 2030 1,000,000+ 400% total growth

The regulatory implementation timeline reflects careful coordination between waste volume projections and infrastructure development. By establishing mandatory compliance before peak waste volumes materialise, Chinese authorities create processing capacity advantages over reactive regulatory approaches adopted elsewhere.

Comprehensive Lifecycle Management Implementation

The April 1, 2026 implementation date represents simultaneous activation of three interconnected regulatory mechanisms that fundamentally alter how electric vehicles reach end-of-life in the Chinese market. This coordination prevents regulatory gaps that could allow battery diversion during transition periods.

Mandatory Battery Retention Protocols:

Electric vehicles must retain power batteries throughout the scrapping process

Recycling facilities cannot separate batteries before official vehicle classification

Incomplete vehicle designation applies to any EV processed without its original battery

Real-time tracking prevents battery transfer to uncontrolled channels

The national information platform establishes unprecedented visibility into battery lifecycle progression from manufacturing through final disposal. According to state-run Xinhua News Agency reporting from January 16, 2026, this system addresses the increasing volume of discarded power batteries as EV models from previous years enter capacity degradation phases.

Manufacturer Responsibility Scope:

Battery manufacturers face expanded obligations covering both domestically-produced and imported batteries destined for Chinese market use. The framework excludes only batteries sold directly to vehicle manufacturers, ensuring comprehensive coverage of replacement and aftermarket segments.

The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology regulations specify that manufacturers cannot refuse battery transfers from swap operators, leasing services, or repair enterprises. This mandatory acceptance requirement prevents processing bottlenecks whilst ensuring accountability across diverse business models.

Classification System Impact:

The incomplete vehicle designation creates powerful incentives for proper battery disposal. Vehicles lacking power batteries during scrapping face regulatory complications that encourage integrated processing rather than component separation. This mechanism maintains traceability whilst simplifying enforcement procedures.

Strategic Resource Recovery Objectives

China's battery lifecycle management framework addresses critical material security vulnerabilities through systematic recovery of lithium, cobalt, nickel, and rare earth elements from degraded cells. The timing of implementation coincides with the first major wave of battery retirements from vehicles purchased during China's early EV adoption phase between 2016-2019.

Material Volume Projections:

By 2030, waste battery volumes exceeding 1 million tonnes annually will contain substantial recoverable material quantities. Based on typical battery compositions, this represents approximately:

50,000-80,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent

15,000-25,000 tonnes of cobalt content

40,000-70,000 tonnes of nickel materials

Various rare earth elements depending on cathode chemistry mix

These projections assume continued dominance of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries in the Chinese market. Furthermore, the Chinese battery recycling breakthrough indicates significant technological advancement in increasing penetration of nickel-based chemistries in premium vehicle segments.

Secondary Material Market Positioning:

The regulatory framework positions Chinese processors as gatekeepers for secondary material exports by restricting waste battery material outflows. This creates pricing leverage in international markets whilst ensuring domestic supply chain access to recovered materials.

Strategic Advantage Alert: Domestic material retention reduces Chinese dependence on primary material imports whilst creating competitive pressure on international suppliers through secondary material availability.

The concentrated processing model enables quality standardisation for recycled materials, potentially achieving specification parity with primary extracted materials. This technological advancement transforms waste streams into strategic assets rather than disposal liabilities.

Battery Technology Differentiated Regulatory Impact

Different battery chemistries face varying regulatory compliance challenges and economic outcomes under the new framework. The Chinese EV market's dominance by lithium iron phosphate technology creates high-volume processing requirements with distinct characteristics from nickel-based alternatives.

Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) Battery Considerations

LFP batteries represent the highest volume segment in Chinese waste streams due to their market penetration across domestic vehicle manufacturers. These batteries present simplified processing profiles due to reduced toxic material content, enabling streamlined regulatory compliance.

Lower material recovery value per unit compared to nickel-based chemistries

Simplified pyrometallurgical processing requirements

High volume throughput potential for certified recycling facilities

Reduced hazardous material handling protocols

The economic viability of LFP recycling depends on processing scale rather than per-unit material value. Consequently, this creates advantages for high-capacity centralised facilities over distributed processing networks.

Nickel-Cobalt-Manganese (NCM) Battery Challenges

NCM batteries offer significantly higher material recovery value per unit but require specialised processing infrastructure due to hazardous electrolyte content and complex separation requirements.

High-value cobalt and nickel recovery potential

Complex hydrometallurgical processing requirements

Specialised equipment needs for safe electrolyte handling

Premium processing facility certification requirements

The regulatory framework's applicability to all non-swappable vehicles ensures comprehensive coverage regardless of battery chemistry. However, this prevents regulatory arbitrage between different technology platforms.

Capacity Degradation Thresholds

Batteries reaching 80% capacity retention trigger end-of-life classification under the regulatory framework. This standardised threshold applies across all battery technologies, simplifying regulatory administration whilst ensuring consistent processing timing.

Battery Swap Exemption Market Dynamics

The regulatory exemption for battery-swappable vehicles creates a bifurcated compliance landscape with significant competitive implications for different business models operating in the Chinese EV market.

Exemption Scope and Timeline:

According to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology statement from January 16, 2026, battery-swappable vehicle models are explicitly excluded from the April 1, 2026 mandate. Management measures for such vehicles remain under development with no specified implementation timeline.

Competitive Advantage Analysis:

Companies operating established battery-swap networks, including NIO with its extensive infrastructure deployment, retain operational flexibility in battery lifecycle management timing. This exemption provides several strategic advantages:

Delayed compliance infrastructure development costs

Flexible recycling timing optimisation based on business models

Potential battery lifecycle extension through continued operational use

Regulatory uncertainty that may deter new entrants to swap-compatible segments

Market Distortion Mechanisms:

The exemption creates unequal competitive conditions between traditional EV manufacturers and swap-enabled platforms:

Vehicle Type Compliance Date Infrastructure Requirements Non-swappable EVs April 1, 2026 Mandatory recycling partnerships Swappable EVs TBD Provisional regulatory status Hybrid models April 1, 2026 Full compliance if non-swappable

This regulatory asymmetry potentially influences vehicle platform development decisions as manufacturers evaluate compliance costs against market access benefits. The absence of finalised swap vehicle management measures creates strategic planning uncertainty for this segment.

International Supply Chain Transformation

The Chinese regulatory framework establishes domestic processing as a prerequisite for market access. This fundamentally alters operational requirements for international battery manufacturers and creates potential trade friction with battery-exporting nations.

Foreign Manufacturer Compliance Obligations:

International battery suppliers face mandatory domestic recycling infrastructure establishment or exclusive partnership requirements for continued Chinese market participation. This affects major suppliers including:

LG Energy Solution (South Korea) serving Chinese EV manufacturers

Panasonic (Japan) supplying Tesla China operations

Samsung SDI (South Korea) with historical Chinese market exposure

Emerging battery manufacturers seeking market entry

Capital Requirements Analysis:

Foreign manufacturers must establish either direct ownership of certified Chinese recycling facilities or exclusive partnerships with domestic processors. This creates substantial capital allocation decisions:

Investment Requirement: Foreign battery manufacturers selling into China must establish domestic recycling infrastructure or partner with certified processors to maintain market access beyond April 1, 2026.

The infrastructure requirement represents a significant market access barrier that may influence supplier consolidation and strategic partnership formation across the industry. Additionally, developments in battery-grade lithium refinery projects globally indicate increasing competition for processing capabilities.

Cross-Border Material Flow Restrictions:

The framework restricts waste battery material exports whilst enhancing tracking of imported battery components, creating controlled material circulation within Chinese borders:

Waste battery material export limitations prevent international competitor access to secondary materials

Enhanced import tracking systems monitor battery component origins

Domestic processing requirements ensure material retention within Chinese supply chains

Potential pricing leverage development for Chinese secondary material processors

Comparative International Regulatory Analysis

China's centralised battery lifecycle management approach differs substantially from regulatory frameworks implemented in other major EV markets. This creates potential trade friction and competitive advantages for different market participants.

European Union Battery Directive Comparison:

The EU's battery directive emphasises carbon footprint disclosure and producer responsibility principles but operates through decentralised member state implementation:

Similar producer responsibility concepts with different enforcement mechanisms

Carbon footprint transparency requirements not present in Chinese framework

By Eric Starkman

China’s electric vehicle industry could not ask for a more authentic or credible pitchman than Ford CEO Jim Farley. While Farley has shown he is no wizard when it comes to automotive manufacturing, his connection to the product is undeniable. When he is not quietly volunteering at the Detroit homeless shelter he supports, Farley races his own classic cars and remains deeply involved in Ford’s racing programs.

In 2024, Farley disclosed that he had been driving a China-made Xiaomi SU7 sports car for six months and that he did not want to give it back. He also said he had traveled to China multiple times and was jolted by what he witnessed.

“It’s the most humbling thing I have ever seen,” Farley said. “They have far superior in-vehicle technology. Huawei and Xiaomi are in every car. You get in, you don’t have to pair your phone. Your whole digital life is mirrored in the car. The cost, the quality of their vehicles are far superior to what I see in the West.”

Farley was not issuing a warning. He was offering a confession.

Carney opens the gate

Imagine tens of thousands of Canadians making that discovery firsthand and you begin to grasp the significance of Prime Minister Mark Carney’s decision to slash tariffs and allow up to 49,000 Chinese-built electric and hybrid vehicles per year into Canada at a 6.1 percent duty. That rate mirrors the standard tariff Canada applied before it aligned with the United States and imposed a 100 percent surtax that effectively sealed the North American market, protecting domestic automakers, most notably GM and Ford, even as both have steadily reduced their unionized manufacturing footprint in Canada.

Canadian unions remain far more powerful than their American counterparts, which helps explain why Carney’s China deal lands as much as a political signal as an economic one.

“We are opening the floodgates,” warned Lana Payne, national president of Unifor, which represents Canadian autoworkers. “For the folks who think this is great because they’re going to get a few cheap cars, cheap has a price — and the price is good jobs in the auto sector in Canada and good jobs that support communities and an industrial base.”

Payne pointed to Chinese state subsidies as evidence of unfair competition, a claim that rings hollow only if one forgets the billions of dollars Canadian taxpayers have already poured into GM and other foreign automakers to preserve jobs and attract EV investment. Unifor itself was instrumental in securing those subsidies.

“It’s not fair play,” Payne said, noting how Chinese automakers have expanded their market share in Europe and Brazil.

Whatever else Carney’s trade agreement may be, it can fairly be read as a calculated rebuke to President Trump’s tariff-first trade regime, a posture Carney, the Davos globalist, has openly criticized. The message is not subtle. Canada will reopen its market to China on its own terms, even if doing so undermines Washington’s trade posture and complicates North American industrial strategy.

Carney’s deceptive math

Under the deal, the annual import cap rises to 70,000 vehicles by year five. The Carney government has said it “anticipates” that roughly half will be affordable EVs priced below $35,000. Carney insists this represents less than three percent of Canada’s annual auto sales, framing the move as modest and controlled.

That framing is deliberately misleading. The relevant denominator is not total vehicle sales. It is EV sales.

Final Canadian EV figures for 2025 are not yet available, but even a generous estimate places them at no more than 170,000 vehicles after a roughly 32 percent decline in the first nine months of the year. Viewed through that lens, the quota represents a staggeringly large share of Canada’s EV market, instantly positioning Chinese manufacturers as price setters in a sector Canada is struggling to sustain.

One caveat matters. The 49,000-vehicle figure does not mean 49,000 Chinese-brand EVs suddenly flooding Canada. The quota applies to all electric and hybrid vehicles built in China, including Teslas and vehicles produced there by Western automakers. In 2022 and 2023, roughly 40,000 such vehicles already entered Canada, most of them Teslas, making the immediate increase closer to 9,000 units.

But quotas do not remain static. They establish precedent, and precedent has a habit of expanding.

GM’s Canadian tab

GM’s vulnerability in Canada is self-inflicted. The company received roughly $500 million in federal and provincial support to produce electric delivery vehicles at its CAMI plant in Ingersoll, then shuttered the operation and sent more than 1,000 workers to the unemployment line. GM once built the gas-powered Equinox in Ontario before shifting production to Mexico, where it now also manufactures the electric version.

Canada also paid heavily for GM’s survival during the 2008 bankruptcy, ultimately losing an estimated C$800 million. In return, GM closed its massive Oshawa plant in 2019, wiping out roughly 5,000 plant and supplier jobs. When the facility reopened in 2020 to build highly profitable Silverado pickups, many jobs were rebuilt on worse terms, with lower pay for new hires and far less security.

Canadians can buy GM vehicles and also have good reason to resent GM’s conduct. GM remains a sales powerhouse in Canada, but its corporate behavior has given Canadians little reason to view it as a reliable long-term partner. GM’s EV sales have been stronger in Canada than in the U.S., even as the company builds several of its most affordable models in Mexico.

Once China’s EVs gain a foothold, it is not hard to imagine Canadians clamoring for more.

The bridges already exist

Ontario Premier Doug Ford has warned that China has secured access to Canada “without any real guarantee of equal or immediate investment in Canada’s auto sector,” adding that the deal risks jeopardizing Canada’s access to the U.S. market, still its largest export destination.

Toyota and Honda may be especially exposed. Some of their most popular U.S. vehicles are manufactured in Canada, and future EV production allocations by these automakers could be affected if Canada continues to trade industrial leverage for short-term affordability.

For GM and Ford, China’s entry into Canada could prove existential. Millions of Americans visit Canada each year. They will notice when Canadians are driving EVs that feel technologically superior to what Detroit sells at home, often at prices below the gas-powered vehicles still dominating U.S. showrooms.

There is a final irony in Carney’s deal. Jim Farley traveled halfway around the world to experience the future of the automobile. Before long, he may only need to drive to Windsor, barely 10 miles from Ford’s headquarters in Dearborn.

With 19 bridges and tunnels connecting Canada to the United States, China’s EV manufacturers don’t need to break down barriers. They only need to cross them.",https://d2nyfqh3g1stw3.cloudfront.net/photos/featured_detroit_river_59235.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 11:01:09.227788

Shell sounding out buyer interest for up to 30% stake in LNG Canada, sources say

Cost to buyer could be as much as $15 billion including all commitments, one source estimates

Mitsubishi in early stages of exploring options for its 15% stake, sources say

LNG Canada Phase 1 operational since June; only major North America Pacific Coast LNG export facility online

HOUSTON/NEW YORK/LONDON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Oil major Shell (SHEL.L), opens new tab and Japanese conglomerate Mitsubishi Corp (8058.T), opens new tab are exploring sale options for their respective stakes in the C$40 billion ($28.8 billion) LNG Canada project, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The moves come as owners of the massive liquefied natural gas facility weigh a potential expansion, and after another stakeholder, Petronas, successfully offloaded a piece of the project.

Shell, the largest owner with a 40% stake in LNG Canada, has been working with investment bankers at Rothschild & Co to sound out interested parties in recent weeks, said two of the sources. Two sources added that Shell could offload as much as three-quarters of its holding, or 30% of the project. Shell has expressed willingness, however, to consider different options relating to its exposure to the project's Phase 1, which is operational, and the proposed Phase 2, given their different risks.

One of the sources estimated that any buyer for Shell's stake could be committing roughly $15 billion, inclusive of the equity stake, debt and capital requirements for Phase 2.

MITSUBISHI HIRES RBC

Mitsubishi, which holds a 15% stake, has hired RBC Capital Markets as it weighs its options, two of the sources said, cautioning deliberations were early and any sale effort would not kick off until later this year. The sources did not elaborate on how much of its stake Mitsubishi could market.

All the sources said sales involving Shell and Mitsubishi were not guaranteed, and spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations.

LNG Canada referred questions to Shell and Mitsubishi. Shell declined to comment. Mitsubishi was not immediately reachable outside Japanese office hours. RBC declined to comment. Rothschild did not immediately respond to a comment request.

MidOcean, backed by investment firm EIG and Saudi Aramco , closed a deal in December to buy a fifth of the Petronas venture that held a 25% stake in LNG Canada.

PetroChina (601857.SS), opens new tab holds a 15% stake, while Korea Gas Corporation owns 5% of LNG Canada.

LNG CANADA'S COST ADVANTAGE

LNG Canada is the first major LNG facility in North America with direct access to the Pacific Coast. The project in Kitimat, British Columbia, has a supply cost advantage because prices for Canadian natural gas consistently trade at a discount to the U.S. Henry Hub benchmark.

Even so, existing and potential owners will consider industry fears of global oversupply of the supercooled fuel, as new LNG output comes online. Energy Transfer (ET.N), opens new tab said in December that it was suspending development of its Lake Charles LNG export facility in Louisiana.

LNG Canada started production in June, but has since run into operational problems. Its second processing unit, known as Train 2, was down in December, nearly a month after its startup, two sources told Reuters.

When fully ramped up, Phase 1 will have the capacity to export 14 million metric tons of LNG per year.

Shell told potential bidders it will keep a gas contract with the terminal for 30 years, one source said.

Developers of major infrastructure projects often reduce their stakes once they become operational, allowing them to book profits and recycle cash into new ventures. Large investment firms and infrastructure funds are ready buyers of such stakes, as they like the projects' steady revenue.

Shell, the world's biggest LNG trader, said in March it targeted a 4% to 5% annual increase in LNG sales over the next five years and 1% annual production growth.

Shell and its partners were working toward a final investment decision for Phase 2, as soon as this year, which would double capacity.

“Americans spend three or four times as much money as Australians or Europeans to put solar panels on the roof.","RIPTON, Vermont(AP) — At a time when the Trump administration rolled back numerous environmental regulations while global temperatures and U.S. carbon pollution spiked, longtime climate activist Bill McKibben finds hope in something that didn't seem that strong on a recent single-digit-temperature day: the sun.

That sun has provided him cheap power for 25 years, and this month he installed his fourth iteration of solar panels on his Vermont home. In an interview after he set up the new system, he said President Donald Trump's stance against solar and other cheap green energy will hurt the GOP in this year's elections as electricity bills rise.

After the Biden and Obama administrations subsidized and championed solar, wind and other green power as answers to fight climate change, Trump has tried to dampen those and turn to older and dirtier fossil fuels. The Trump administration froze five big offshore wind projects last month but judges this week allowed three of the projects to resume. Federal clean energy tax incentives expired on Dec. 31 that include installing home solar panels.

Meanwhile, electricity prices are rising in the United States, and McKibben is counting on that to trigger political change.

“I think you’re starting to see that have a big political impact in the U.S. right now. My prediction would be that electric prices are going to be to the 2026 election what egg prices were to the 2024 election,” said McKibben, an author and founder of multiple environmental and activist groups. Everyday inflation hurt Democrats in the last presidential race, analysts said.

The Trump administration and a bipartisan group of governors on Friday tried to step up pressure on the operator of the nation’s largest electric grid to take urgent steps to boost power supplies in the mid-Atlantic and keep electricity bills from rising even higher.

“Ensuring the American people have reliable and affordable electricity is one of President Trump’s top priorities,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.

Renewable energy prices drop around the world

Globally, the price of wind and solar power is plummeting to the point that they are cheaper than fossil fuels, the United Nations found. And China leads the world in renewable energy technology, with one of its electric car companies passing Tesla in annual sales.

""We can’t economically compete in a world where China gets a lot of cheap energy and we have to pay for really expensive energy,"" McKibben told The Associated Press, just after he installed a new type of solar panels that can hang on balconies with little fuss.

When Trump took office in January 2025, the national average electricity cost was 15.94 cents per kilowatt-hour. By September it was up to 18.07 cents and then down slightly to 17.98 cents in October, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

That's a 12.8% increase in 10 months. It rose more in 10 months than the previous two years. People in Maryland, New Jersey and Maine have seen electricity prices rise at a rate three times higher than the national average since October 2024.

At 900 kilowatt-hours per month, that means the average monthly electricity bill is about $18 more than in January 2025.

Democrats blame Trump for rising electric bills

This week, Democrats on Capitol Hill blamed rising electric bills on Trump and his dislike of renewable energy.

“From his first day in office, he’s made it his mission to limit American’s access to cheap energy, all in the name of increasing profits for his friends in the fossil fuel industry. As a result, energy bills across the country have skyrocketed,"" Illinois Rep. Sean Casten said at a Wednesday news conference.

“Donald Trump is the first president to intentionally raise the price of something that we all need,” Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, also a Democrat, said Wednesday on the Senate floor. “Nobody should be enthused about paying more for electricity, and this national solar ban is making everybody pay more. Clean is cheap and cheap is clean.”

Solar panels on McKibben's Vermont home

McKibben has been sending excess electricity from his solar panels to the Vermont grid for years. Now he's sending more.

As his dog, Birke, stood watch, McKibben, who refers to his home nestled in the Green Mountains of Vermont as a “museum of solar technology"" got his new panels up and running in about 10 minutes. This type of panel from the California-based firm Bright Saver is often referred to as plug-in solar. Though it's not yet widely available in the U.S., McKibben pointed to the style's popularity in Europe and Australia.

“Americans spend three or four times as much money as Australians or Europeans to put solar panels on the roof. We have an absurdly overcomplicated permitting system that’s unlike anything else on the rest of the planet,"" McKibben said.

McKibben said Australians can obtain three hours of free electricity each day through a government program because the country has built so many solar panels.

“And I’m almost certain that that’s an argument that every single person in America would understand,"" he said. ""I don’t know anyone who wouldn’t say: ‘I’d like three free hours of electricity.’”

Kansans might also argue that the vote on Venezuela was less significant than congressional action on domestic policies, such as deployments of the National Guard or widespread raids by immigration officials. The Kansas senators could have stood up when Trump asserted those powers. (In fact, they still can.)

Nevertheless, the Venezuela vote is useful as a timely litmus test for Moran and Marshall, both as Republicans and surrogates for their constituents. Wednesday’s vote shows where they sit after almost one year of Trump’s second term. That is to say, on the sidelines.

To understand this, let’s inspect the conservative coalitions on this vote. Republican ranks broke down into three camps.

In the first group — let’s call them the Principled Objectors — there were three Republican senators: Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul of Kentucky. Beginning last week, they broke unexpectedly from their party to force the Venezuela roll call vote and stuck by their convictions in the face of public and private threats from Trump.

Marshall and Moran joining this group would require an extraordinary upgrade to their courage and wild swings to their ideologies. Both have long-term voting records that support the conservative cause. Perhaps it’s fantasy (or folly) to expect this level of resistance.

In the second group — let’s call them the Equivocaters — there were two Republican senators: Todd Young of Indiana and Josh Hawley of Missouri.

How do they earn the title of the Equivocaters? After first signaling their hopes of restraining the president, both waffled back to supporting Trump by voting with fellow conservatives. In doing so, they took a position of some courage before retreating, never fully committing themselves.

We can associate them with equivocation in another way: They insisted on nothing more than weak language from the administration.

From a statement by Young: “I’ve also received a commitment that if President Trump were to determine American forces are needed in major military operations in Venezuela, the Administration will come to Congress in advance to ask for an authorization of force.”

Sounds like asking for congressional approval without actually mandating by legislation.

Hawley said his assurance came from Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

If you are shaking your head at weak tea that the Equivocaters served, consider the posse that our Kansas senators joined — I call them the Compliant Coalition. Forty-eight Republican senators, including Moran and Marshall, helped Trump get his legislative wish this week with the Venezuelan vote. Vice President JD Vance was needed to break the tie.

The Compliant Coalition appeases. It cedes power. It responds to threats. It holds its tongue.

During Congressional votes. During campaigns. During election disputes. And during two Trump administrations.

Lest the coalition say that they are simply representing the will of the American people, read the polls. According to an Associated Press poll this week, 61 percent of U.S. adults disapprove of how Trump is handling foreign policy, in general. Only 35 percent believe this administration’s intervention has “been about right.”

Recent polling from Reuters shows how divided and nervous Americans are about Venezuela. Polling from Jan. 4-5 shows Americans almost perfectly split on their approval of US military action to remove the nation’s leader Nicolás Maduro: 33 percent in support, 33 percent don’t know and 34 percent disapprove.

Asked if they are concerned that the U.S. will get too involved in Venezuela, 72 percent said yes.

These seem like the exact conditions when a robust Congress — and an empowered Kansas delegation — would want a say. The country is unsure and divided. Our president is volatile and threatening, while also vague about his military intentions. And the administration is pulling a U-turn from its first term, one that kicked off with an inaugural address trumpeting the wisdom of “America First.”

If not now, if not on this issue, then when does Congress want power?

Perhaps these categories — the Principled Objectors, the Equivocators and the Compliant Coalition — are in flux. Maybe leadership will reel in the rogue Republicans. Maybe the Equivocators will develop further backbone when it comes to balance of powers.

Or maybe — just maybe — a Republican from the heartland will assert Congressional power and grab the steering wheel.

JOHN,,,,,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinese-evs-making-inroads-north-211111525.html,"So why are Chinese EVs such a threat to U.S. automakers and others?

The Mexican auto market has welcomed Chinese EVs, with massive growth last year.","So why are Chinese EVs such a threat to U.S. automakers and others?

Much of the global auto market is electrifying, an ideal opportunity for advanced Chinese automakers to capitalize on. China saw 17% growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles in 2025, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week, and Europe saw a 33% increase.

Meanwhile, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1% last year. As the rest of the world advances, U.S. automakers have weakened their once-ambitious, multibillion dollar electrification plans, instead opting for more efficient hybrid electric and gasoline vehicles amid the Trump administration's shift away from EV-friendly policy.

That shift threatens U.S. automakers’ competitive edge in the coming years. As is, Tesla lost its crown as the world’s bestselling electric vehicle maker last year, delivering only 1.64 million vehicles in 2025 to Chinese rival BYD’s 2.26 million.

Trump administration policy slashing emissions rules at a time when Chinese companies are advancing quickly has experts worried for the future of American car manufacturers.

Chinese automakers will have to meet standards required for the Canadian auto market for the latest trade arrangement to be successful — standards that are similar to those in the U.S. — which is likely to incentivize Chinese auto manufacturing investment in Canada.

They'll also have to establish which segment of the market they are targeting there: Higher-end vehicles, or less-expensive ones that sell at higher volumes.

Regardless, “It brings it home to what is needed to compete globally,” said Mark Wakefield, global automotive market lead at AlixPartners. The firm predicts Chinese brands will account for 30% of the global market by 2030.

“They’ve already started in Europe. They started in South America. Now Mexico and Canada,"" Wakefield said. American carmakers ""don’t want to end up as a Brazil with your ethanol-based cars that aren’t sellable anywhere else in the world and ... like Britain or Australia that used to matter in the auto world, and no longer really matter.”

Why have others sought to regulate Chinese EV-makers’ expansion?

Countries have attempted to regulate Chinese EVs from entering their markets for several reasons.

“China has become this overwhelming machine making inexpensive vehicles. And the fear is that if you give them an inch, they’re going to take a mile,” Fiorani said. “The other issue is technology. These vehicles are data centers... and the idea that a state-owned company in China could have access to where a high portion of drivers are going gives them leverage for all kinds of outlets.”

The European Union hiked tariffs on Chinese EVs last year, though the two have been resolving that at the start of this year.

In 2024, former President Joe Biden set a 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars. Canada matched that import tax on the vehicles until this week. And even with an annual import cap, Canada cutting its tariffs this week means those companies are another step closer to U.S. soil. The Mexican auto market has welcomed Chinese EVs, with massive growth last year.

“The advance of Chinese manufacturers is inevitable. It will happen eventually. Everybody is negotiating to put up the roadblocks to figure out: What data is being processed, how much market share you’re going to allow Chinese manufacturers to have?"" Fiorani added.

""There are a lot of guardrails that have to be put up, but eventually they’re going to make their way into all Western markets.”

Dominion Energy, which serves approximately 1.3 million customers in South Carolina, has provided several tips to help consumers save on energy costs during the colder months.

The company suggests setting thermostats to 68 degrees or lower and reducing the temperature further when away from home.

Each additional degree can significantly increase heating expenses.

For those with heat pumps, it's advised to raise the temperature only one to two degrees at a time to avoid triggering auxiliary or emergency heat.

Monthly checks and replacements of air filters, along with inspections of ductwork for leaks or tears, are recommended.

Additionally, opening drapes during the day can let in natural warmth from the sun, while closing them at night helps retain heat.

Sealing drafts with caulk and weather-stripping doors and windows can also keep the cold out.

Despite these conservation efforts, some residents report their bills are still climbing.

One Dominion Energy customer said, ""I started out. I was maybe paying $175 a month for my house now paying probably 250.""

In a National Energy Dominance Council meeting, the government called on Mid-Atlantic-based PJM Interconnection to force data center developers to pay for any new power generation they require, ""whether they show up and use the power or not.""

PJM covers 13 states in the Mid-Atlantic and the Midwest, including the data center hotspot of Northern Virginia.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D), Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) and outgoing Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) joined the Trump administration in calling for a number of changes, including calling on PJM to hold an “emergency” power auction “to address escalating electricity prices and growing reliability risks.”

The Dominance Council said that PJM should build more than $15 billion of reliable baseload power generation, and accelerate the development of reliable power generation by providing 15-year revenue certainty for new power plants.

It also blamed PJM for supporting renewable energy projects over coal and gas. Monitoring Analytics, PJM’s independent monitor, found that 60 percent of 2025’s price increases were the result of high prices for fossil fuels, with the grid heavily reliant on natural gas.

""In the coming years, America’s reindustrialization and the AI race will require a significantly larger supply of around-the-clock, reliable, and uninterrupted power,"" the administration said.

""The United States cannot afford to continue down the unstable and dangerous path of energy subtraction previous leaders pursued, forcing the closure of baseload power sources like coal and natural gas.""

""If we are going to keep the lights on, win the AI race, and keep electricity prices from skyrocketing, the United States must unleash American energy.""

Trump this week said that data centers across the US will be expected to pay their fair share for electricity, with Microsoft first to announce it would cover any utility costs.

PJM was not invited to the Dominance Council meeting. Hours later, it published its own board letter on utility challenges, which said that it would seek to incentivize data centers to develop their own power. Such projects could be rewarded with expedited connections to the grid.

But “Canada’s approach to tariffs on Chinese EVs has never needed to be so binary.
Doran said the experience in Europe has shown Chinese EVs creating incentives for other automakers to be more competitive, not displacing them.","Prime Minister Mark Carney has agreed to sharply reduce tariffs on electric vehicle imports from China, while China offers up tariff relief for Canadian canola, peas, pork, and seafood, prompting Canadian observers to predict lower EV prices and possible long-term advantages for the country’s automotive industrial base.

Canada will slash duties on up to 49,000 Chinese EVs per year to a “most-favoured-nation tariff rate” of 6.1%, Carney’s office said in a statement. The imports will amount to less than 3% of annual new vehicle sales in Canada, but “will drive considerable new Chinese joint-venture investment in Canada with trusted partners to protect and create new auto manufacturing careers for Canadian workers, and ensure a robust buildout of Canada’s EV supply chain,” the PMO said.

Within five years, more than half of those vehicles “will be affordable EVs with an import price of less than $35,000, creating new lower-cost options for Canadian consumers,” the statement adds.

Carney later told media the annual total will rise to 70,000 vehicles per year by 2031.

In return, by March 1 China will reduce its 84% tariff on Canadian canola seed entering its $4-billion annual market to about 15%, and eliminate anti-discrimination tariffs on canola meal, lobsters, crabs, and peas.

Carney and Chinese President Xi Jinping also “discussed increasing two-way investment in clean energy and technology, agri-food, wood products, and other sectors,” with Canada setting 2030 as a deadline to increase exports to China by 50%. That includes non-binding agreements on oil, gas, and uranium development, finance, public security and safety, and food safety, as well as a five-year memorandum of understanding on modern wood construction between Canada, China, and British Columbia.

“It’s a partnership that reflects the world as it is today, with an engagement that is realistic, respectful, and interest-based,” Carney told media in Beijing.

“From energy to agriculture to people-to-people ties to multilateralism, to issues on security, we believe that the spirit and the substance of these discussions, and these agreements, will provide great benefit to each of our peoples,” he added earlier in the visit.

No Need for Sledgehammers

Clean Energy Canada, a B.C.-based think tank that has long advocated against the EV tariff, hailed the announcement as “a breakthrough for consumers with potential for investment in a modern auto sector,” in a media release that included a detailed history and assessment of the issue.

“Canada inadvertently ‘broke’ its EV market with a combination of policy changes under the past two governments: ending the EV incentive, pausing the EV Availability Standard, and imposing a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs in late 2024,” Executive Director Rachel Doran said in the release. But “Canada’s approach to tariffs on Chinese EVs has never needed to be so binary. While we have simply followed the sledgehammer approach of the U.S. to date, the option has always been open to implement a more flexible lower tariff like our other allies did in the EU.”

Canada “is in a difficult position these days,” Doran told The Energy Mix in an interview. “So what we’ve been suggesting the government do in the changing terrain is put Canada first. The assumption that Canada is best served by borrowing Trump policies on EVs or fully endorsing the position of U.S.-based automakers may not be the best for Canadian consumers, or even for Canadian industry in the long term.”

Clean Energy Canada’s polling last summer found that nearly half of respondents wanted their next vehicle purchase to be electric, she added. “It’s just that we haven’t had the vehicles available at the price point that made sense for Canadians. So a choice, even if it’s just 3% of our EV market, can make some of those more available,” and “spark a bit of competition in the marketplace for Japanese or Korean automakers to bring more of their affordable models to Canada.”

Corporate Knights Research Director Ralph Torrie, who previously urged the federal government not to impose the EV tariff, said the announcement was “really quite exciting,” particularly if Chinese automakers can accelerate the timeline to send affordable EVs to Canada.

Even if that doesn’t happen, “the door has been cracked open, and it’s a good thing,” Torrie told The Mix. “I think this initial tranche of vehicles will be snapped up by Canadians who’ve been waiting for more choice in their electric vehicle purchase decisions, and I expect these vehicles will be relatively affordable, even if they’re not under the $35,000 cap.”

Throwing Down Gauntlets

Torrie pushed back on accusations that China has been “dumping” low-cost cars to distort and dominate the EV market in other countries.

“When you dump products, you sell them for below what it’s costing you to make them,” he explained. But apart from the “ridiculously low prices” that some Chinese manufacturers have come up with for their domestic market, “I don’t think they’re selling at a loss anywhere else in the world.”

Rather, what they’re doing is “throwing down the gauntlet to all the western carmakers and basically saying: If you want to compete against this new source of supply, you’re going to have to match them on price.” China’s EVs are “well-made, high-quality cars,” he added, and the small influx in the early years of the Canada-China deal “will address the fears Canadians have about these vehicles. They’ll start to see them on the road, and they’ll see their neighbours getting them.”

But another gauntlet landed hours after the announcement, with the Canadian Labour Congress and Unifor both arguing that Carney traded away well-paying, union jobs.

“While Ottawa frames this deal as a way to diversify markets for Canadian farmers and exporters, it ultimately puts both groups at risk, offering uncertain, short-term relief for canola and select fisheries while endangering hundreds of thousands of good jobs across Canada’s manufacturing and industrial sectors,” the CLC said in a statement. “In the end, no sector truly wins, and workers in every industry are left more vulnerable.”

“This is a self-inflicted wound to an already injured Canadian auto industry,” said Unifor National President Lana Payne. “Providing a foothold to cheap Chinese EVs, backed by massive state subsidies, overproduction, and designed to expand market share through exports, puts Canadian auto jobs at risk while rewarding labour violations and unfair trade practices.”

Jim Stanford, director of the Centre for Future Work, said the average price of a new car in Canada is well above the target for affordable EVs, but the Big Three Detroit automakers had a total of three electric models below the 2024 average of $56,393.

“I don’t know where this obsession with the $40,000 price point comes from,” Stanford wrotein an email last fall. “The vast majority of Canadian car buyers (85% or more) pay much more than that,” and a higher cost for EVs “is part of the trade-off: pay more up front, save big on energy costs over the vehicle’s life.”

Stanford added he supported “active measures to push the industry toward faster transition to EVs. I think the companies themselves know this is going to happen. But they are now also trying to appease Trump.” In response, “what we need are strong rules to both push the industry to keep moving in this direction, and strong rules to ensure that Canada gets a fair proportionate share of the resulting economic activity,” rather than “picking sides” among manufacturers.

Doran said the experience in Europe has shown Chinese EVs creating incentives for other automakers to be more competitive, not displacing them. Last fall, Clean Energy Canada reported that the EU had 21 electric vehicle models selling for less than $40,000—seven from China, the rest from Japan, South Korea, and the EU itself—compared to just one in Canada.

“Having these lower model price points in an open economy is going to spur some competition and make vehicles generally more affordable,” Doran said this week, with a “ripple effect” that goes beyond the initial 49,000 vehicles per year.

“We know the problem is not that that there is no Canadian who wants an EV. They want to benefit from the long-term savings, but have to be able to afford that up-front price.”

Trade War Truce

News reports interpreted the Canada-China deal as a marked departure from the past few years of frosty relations between Canada and China, triggered largely by the frostier and existentially dangerous relations brought to Canada’s doorstep by Donald Trump.

“The truce in a painful trade war helps lessen a major irritant in Canada-China relations as the Prime Minister seeks bigger overseas export markets and new foreign investment to offset the economic damage caused by… Donald Trump’s protectionist tariffs,” the Globe and Mail reports.

At the same time, it “raises the prospect that Canada may be putting itself offside of Mr. Trump’s tough-on-China agenda, which the president expects allies to follow,” the Globe adds. But Carney “told journalists that relations with China have recently been more predictable than those with the United States.”

The flurry of announcements in Beijing “marks a de-escalation in tensions with a country the Liberal government had, in recent years, branded as a disruptive power, and is getting mixed reactions in Canada,” The Canadian Press reports. “Ontario Premier Doug Ford and some auto industry groups are slamming the plan as a threat to the country’s auto industry, but Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe, who was in Beijing with Carney, was thrilled to see a deal he said will allow his province’s canola exports to China to return to normal levels.”

Ford said the deal gives China “a foothold in the Canadian market” that it will use at the expense of Canadian workers, the Globe writes. “The federal government is inviting a flood of cheap made-in-China electric vehicles without any real guarantee of equal or immediate investments in Canada’s economy, auto sector, or supply chain.”

Moe said the deal is “very good news for Canada and Saskatchewan,” demonstrating “the importance of foreign trade missions and show[ing] what can be achieved when the federal and provincial governments and our export industries work together.”

Greg Cherewyk, president of Pulse Canada, said tariffs effectively stopped all shipments to China and Canadian yellow peas worth about $700 million a year were being displaced by Russian products, CP adds. “It was really important that this didn’t last as long as we had feared it would last, into the years. It was resolved in what really amounts to a short period,” with timing that was ideal for farmers to make seeding decisions for this year’s crop.

The ‘Unreliable’ States of America

The news of the deal landed just a day after Washington Post foreign affairs columnist Fareed Zakaria wrote that the world is “adjusting to an unreliable United States”. The European Union has also been working to reduce trade frictions with China, aiming to avert “a broader confrontation over electric vehicles, subsidies, and market access,” he said. “Europe remains wary of China’s industrial policies and political system, but the EU now views China as a necessary partner.”

Trump’s trade wars over the last year have also prompted the continent to sign a “sweeping trade agreement” with key Latin American countries that took a quarter-century to negotiate, and to accelerate its outreach in Southeast Asia.

Zakaria cites Canada as a country that “made a clear strategic bet” on deeper economic integration with the U.S. Three decades later, “that trust has now been shattered. Trump’s tariffs, threats to reopen trade agreements, and bizarre declarations about annexing Canada have forced a rethink.”

Declarations along those lines continued Friday, with Trump surrogates talking down the importance of Carney’s visit to China. Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-MO) called the PM’s meeting Thursday with Chinese Premier Li Qiang a “grovel session”, Politico reports, while former co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita wrote off his statements as “asinine”.

In Ottawa, opposition leader Pierre Poilievre demanded to know what has changed since a spring election campaign in which Carney took a tough-talking stance on China, CP says. “Prime Minister Carney must explain how he has gone from saying China was Canada’s ‘biggest security threat’ before the election to announcing a ‘strategic partnership’ with Beijing after the election,” he declared in a statement.

“The security landscape continues to change, and in a world that’s more dangerous and divided, we face many threats,” Carney responded, after a reporter posed the question Friday. “You manage the threats through engagement.”

He added that he had raised human rights issues during his meeting with Xi, from a position of “values-based realism”.

“We fundamentally stand up for human rights, for democracy, territorial integrity, rights to self-determination,” he said. “We take the world as it is, not as we wish it to be.”

Carney’s former interim chief of staff Marco Mendicino defended the “uncomplicated” and “real benefit” of Carney being in China, Politico writes, opining that his former boss was acting as “chief diplomat for this country at a time when we need serious leadership.”

“The world has changed, and we cannot take for granted the relationships that we depend on every day, that they will be there,” Mendicino told a public audience in Toronto.

Prime Minister Mark Carney has agreed to sharply reduce tariffs on electric vehicle imports from China, while China offers up tariff relief for Canadian canola, peas, pork, and seafood, prompting Canadian observers to predict lower EV prices and possible long-term advantages for the country’s automotive industrial base.

Canada will slash duties on up to 49,000 Chinese EVs per year to a “most-favoured-nation tariff rate” of 6.1%, Carney’s office said in a statement. The imports will amount to less than 3% of annual new vehicle sales in Canada, but “will drive considerable new Chinese joint-venture investment in Canada with trusted partners to protect and create new auto manufacturing careers for Canadian workers, and ensure a robust buildout of Canada’s EV supply chain,” the PMO said.

Within five years, more than half of those vehicles “will be affordable EVs with an import price of less than $35,000, creating new lower-cost options for Canadian consumers,” the statement adds.

Carney later told media the annual total will rise to 70,000 vehicles per year by 2031.

In return, by March 1 China will reduce its 84% tariff on Canadian canola seed entering its $4-billion annual market to about 15%, and eliminate anti-discrimination tariffs on canola meal, lobsters, crabs, and peas.

Carney and Chinese President Xi Jinping also “discussed increasing two-way investment in clean energy and technology, agri-food, wood products, and other sectors,” with Canada setting 2030 as a deadline to increase exports to China by 50%. That includes non-binding agreements on oil, gas, and uranium development, finance, public security and safety, and food safety, as well as a five-year memorandum of understanding on modern wood construction between Canada, China, and British Columbia.

“It’s a partnership that reflects the world as it is today, with an engagement that is realistic, respectful, and interest-based,” Carney told media in Beijing.

“From energy to agriculture to people-to-people ties to multilateralism, to issues on security, we believe that the spirit and the substance of these discussions, and these agreements, will provide great benefit to each of our peoples,” he added earlier in the visit.

No Need for Sledgehammers

Clean Energy Canada, a B.C.-based think tank that has long advocated against the EV tariff, hailed the announcement as “a breakthrough for consumers with potential for investment in a modern auto sector,” in a media release that included a detailed history and assessment of the issue.

“Canada inadvertently ‘broke’ its EV market with a combination of policy changes under the past two governments: ending the EV incentive, pausing the EV Availability Standard, and imposing a 100% tariff on Chinese EVs in late 2024,” Executive Director Rachel Doran said in the release. But “Canada’s approach to tariffs on Chinese EVs has never needed to be so binary. While we have simply followed the sledgehammer approach of the U.S. to date, the option has always been open to implement a more flexible lower tariff like our other allies did in the EU.”

Canada “is in a difficult position these days,” Doran told The Energy Mix in an interview. “So what we’ve been suggesting the government do in the changing terrain is put Canada first. The assumption that Canada is best served by borrowing Trump policies on EVs or fully endorsing the position of U.S.-based automakers may not be the best for Canadian consumers, or even for Canadian industry in the long term.”

Clean Energy Canada’s polling last summer found that nearly half of respondents wanted their next vehicle purchase to be electric, she added. “It’s just that we haven’t had the vehicles available at the price point that made sense for Canadians. So a choice, even if it’s just 3% of our EV market, can make some of those more available,” and “spark a bit of competition in the marketplace for Japanese or Korean automakers to bring more of their affordable models to Canada.”

Corporate Knights Research Director Ralph Torrie, who previously urged the federal government not to impose the EV tariff, said the announcement was “really quite exciting,” particularly if Chinese automakers can accelerate the timeline to send affordable EVs to Canada.

Even if that doesn’t happen, “the door has been cracked open, and it’s a good thing,” Torrie told The Mix. “I think this initial tranche of vehicles will be snapped up by Canadians who’ve been waiting for more choice in their electric vehicle purchase decisions, and I expect these vehicles will be relatively affordable, even if they’re not under the $35,000 cap.”

Throwing Down Gauntlets

Torrie pushed back on accusations that China has been “dumping” low-cost cars to distort and dominate the EV market in other countries.

“When you dump products, you sell them for below what it’s costing you to make them,” he explained. But apart from the “ridiculously low prices” that some Chinese manufacturers have come up with for their domestic market, “I don’t think they’re selling at a loss anywhere else in the world.”

Rather, what they’re doing is “throwing down the gauntlet to all the western carmakers and basically saying: If you want to compete against this new source of supply, you’re going to have to match them on price.” China’s EVs are “well-made, high-quality cars,” he added, and the small influx in the early years of the Canada-China deal “will address the fears Canadians have about these vehicles. They’ll start to see them on the road, and they’ll see their neighbours getting them.”

But another gauntlet landed hours after the announcement, with the Canadian Labour Congress and Unifor both arguing that Carney traded away well-paying, union jobs.

“While Ottawa frames this deal as a way to diversify markets for Canadian farmers and exporters, it ultimately puts both groups at risk, offering uncertain, short-term relief for canola and select fisheries while endangering hundreds of thousands of good jobs across Canada’s manufacturing and industrial sectors,” the CLC said in a statement. “In the end, no sector truly wins, and workers in every industry are left more vulnerable.”

“This is a self-inflicted wound to an already injured Canadian auto industry,” said Unifor National President Lana Payne. “Providing a foothold to cheap Chinese EVs, backed by massive state subsidies, overproduction, and designed to expand market share through exports, puts Canadian auto jobs at risk while rewarding labour violations and unfair trade practices.”

Jim Stanford, director of the Centre for Future Work, said the average price of a new car in Canada is well above the target for affordable EVs, but the Big Three Detroit automakers had a total of three electric models below the 2024 average of $56,393.

“I don’t know where this obsession with the $40,000 price point comes from,” Stanford wrotein an email last fall. “The vast majority of Canadian car buyers (85% or more) pay much more than that,” and a higher cost for EVs “is part of the trade-off: pay more up front, save big on energy costs over the vehicle’s life.”

Stanford added he supported “active measures to push the industry toward faster transition to EVs. I think the companies themselves know this is going to happen. But they are now also trying to appease Trump.” In response, “what we need are strong rules to both push the industry to keep moving in this direction, and strong rules to ensure that Canada gets a fair proportionate share of the resulting economic activity,” rather than “picking sides” among manufacturers.

Doran said the experience in Europe has shown Chinese EVs creating incentives for other automakers to be more competitive, not displacing them. Last fall, Clean Energy Canada reported that the EU had 21 electric vehicle models selling for less than $40,000—seven from China, the rest from Japan, South Korea, and the EU itself—compared to just one in Canada.

“Having these lower model price points in an open economy is going to spur some competition and make vehicles generally more affordable,” Doran said this week, with a “ripple effect” that goes beyond the initial 49,000 vehicles per year.

“We know the problem is not that that there is no Canadian who wants an EV. They want to benefit from the long-term savings, but have to be able to afford that up-front price.”

Trade War Truce

News reports interpreted the Canada-China deal as a marked departure from the past few years of frosty relations between Canada and China, triggered largely by the frostier and existentially dangerous relations brought to Canada’s doorstep by Donald Trump.

“The truce in a painful trade war helps lessen a major irritant in Canada-China relations as the Prime Minister seeks bigger overseas export markets and new foreign investment to offset the economic damage caused by… Donald Trump’s protectionist tariffs,” the Globe and Mail reports.

At the same time, it “raises the prospect that Canada may be putting itself offside of Mr. Trump’s tough-on-China agenda, which the president expects allies to follow,” the Globe adds. But Carney “told journalists that relations with China have recently been more predictable than those with the United States.”

The flurry of announcements in Beijing “marks a de-escalation in tensions with a country the Liberal government had, in recent years, branded as a disruptive power, and is getting mixed reactions in Canada,” The Canadian Press reports. “Ontario Premier Doug Ford and some auto industry groups are slamming the plan as a threat to the country’s auto industry, but Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe, who was in Beijing with Carney, was thrilled to see a deal he said will allow his province’s canola exports to China to return to normal levels.”

Ford said the deal gives China “a foothold in the Canadian market” that it will use at the expense of Canadian workers, the Globe writes. “The federal government is inviting a flood of cheap made-in-China electric vehicles without any real guarantee of equal or immediate investments in Canada’s economy, auto sector, or supply chain.”

Moe said the deal is “very good news for Canada and Saskatchewan,” demonstrating “the importance of foreign trade missions and show[ing] what can be achieved when the federal and provincial governments and our export industries work together.”

Greg Cherewyk, president of Pulse Canada, said tariffs effectively stopped all shipments to China and Canadian yellow peas worth about $700 million a year were being displaced by Russian products, CP adds. “It was really important that this didn’t last as long as we had feared it would last, into the years. It was resolved in what really amounts to a short period,” with timing that was ideal for farmers to make seeding decisions for this year’s crop.

The ‘Unreliable’ States of America

The news of the deal landed just a day after Washington Post foreign affairs columnist Fareed Zakaria wrote that the world is “adjusting to an unreliable United States”. The European Union has also been working to reduce trade frictions with China, aiming to avert “a broader confrontation over electric vehicles, subsidies, and market access,” he said. “Europe remains wary of China’s industrial policies and political system, but the EU now views China as a necessary partner.”

Trump’s trade wars over the last year have also prompted the continent to sign a “sweeping trade agreement” with key Latin American countries that took a quarter-century to negotiate, and to accelerate its outreach in Southeast Asia.

Zakaria cites Canada as a country that “made a clear strategic bet” on deeper economic integration with the U.S. Three decades later, “that trust has now been shattered. Trump’s tariffs, threats to reopen trade agreements, and bizarre declarations about annexing Canada have forced a rethink.”

Declarations along those lines continued Friday, with Trump surrogates talking down the importance of Carney’s visit to China. Sen.

Four years later, the tribe is roughly halfway to meeting that target, driven by a slate of large‑scale energy projects, infrastructure upgrades and a long-term energy plan.

Four years later, the tribe is roughly halfway to meeting that target, driven by a slate of large‑scale energy projects, infrastructure upgrades and a long-term energy plan.

“Net zero” refers to balancing the carbon a community releases with the carbon it removes or avoids. Prairie Island’s goal requires eliminating or offsetting more than 20 million pounds of carbon annually.

The tribe’s Net Zero Program Manager Andrea Zimmerman said the tribe’s decision to pursue net zero is tied to a “long and painful” history, including energy development near the reservation without tribal consent. She pointed to the Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant, which was built next to the reservation more than 50 years ago before modern tribal consultation requirements were in place.

“Prairie Island’s net zero work is the community’s response,” Zimmerman said. “It’s the tribe’s way of expressing energy sovereignty and embodying the community’s values.”

The tribe approached the Minnesota Legislature as early as 2018 to access the state’s Renewable Development Account, which is funded by Xcel Energy in exchange for nuclear waste storage at Prairie Island. After several years of legislative efforts, lawmakers ultimately allocated $46.2 million to the tribe, Zimmerman said, allowing the first phase of projects to move forward.

The tribe has since supplemented that funding with additional state grants and federal support, including funding under the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Job Act, ZImmerman said. The tribe generated $470,473 in revenue from its solar power purchase agreement since the project entered commercial operation in May 2024, according to its July 2025 Net Zero Progress Report to the Minnesota legislature.

Early planning efforts focused on offsetting on-reservation energy use through a mix of onsite solar, microgrids, geothermal systems and energy efficiency upgrades. As preliminary engineering and procurement advanced, the tribe narrowed the scope of earlier concepts that exceeded available funding and concentrated resources on a smaller number of large projects, including a utility-scale solar array designed to generate revenue through a power purchase agreement.

The first phase of the revised project includes a 5.4‑megawatt solar array and a geothermal and electrification project at the tribe’s Welch-based Treasure Island Resort and Casino.

The solar array sits on about 20 acres of tribal land and includes roughly 10,000 panels. Construction took place through most of 2023 and early 2024, and the project went live in May 2024. The array is a front‑of‑the‑meter project. All power generated is sold to Great River Energy through the aforementioned, 30-year power purchase agreement, creating a revenue stream for the tribe.

Zimmerman said the geothermal conversion at the casino is also nearing completion. The project replaces aging heating, cooling and hot water systems that were close to the end of their useful life. The geothermal system will reduce emissions and lower long‑term energy costs by relying on the constant temperature of the earth rather than energy‑intensive chillers.

“It was going to need to be replaced anyway,” she said. “It was a great opportunity to upgrade critical infrastructure that was becoming an issue in terms of higher maintenance costs and risk to the community.”

With those two projects in place, the program is about “halfway” to its target, Zimmerman said. Other ongoing projects include a workforce development program with Xcel Energy, as well as a large-scale retrofit initiative for community homes. Zimmerman said the latter will likely continue into 2027.

The tribe is now updating its net zero plan to identify the next set of projects, though specific timelines have not yet been established. Currently, the most likely next steps include transitioning some of the tribe’s transportation fleet to electric vehicles, as well as more opportunities for commercial energy efficiency in kind with the geothermal work at the casino.

In the wake of a federal pivot away from renewable energy funding, it’s likely the tribe will need to seek other investment, however, Zimmerman noted. With that in mind, planning becomes more important than ever to establish a firm scope ahead of seeking capital.

“Starting with a concrete goal is very important,” she said. “If you don’t know where you’re trying to go, then it becomes a challenge to get there, and having that community support is critical.”

She said competitive procurement and strong partnerships have also been key. The tribe used an open-bidding process to secure development partners for retrofits, engineering, and the solar array.

Energy consultant Rita Mackwood, a longtime net zero advocate who is not involved with Prairie Island, says the tribe’s project could be a model for other tribes, particularly those with access to state funding.

Mackwood, who runs Firebrand Environmental, a Charlotte, N.C.-based energy consultancy,

said net zero projects often spur economic activity as construction, operations and maintenance work expands.

She said the current funding landscape for climate resiliency is “grim,” but tribes should continue pursuing emissions-reduction strategies with clear economic returns.

“As you can see with Prairie Island, they turned that into a power purchase agreement, which is revenue,” Mackwood said. “And a lot of states and local energy companies would be interested in reducing their own costs. If the money’s there, they should be seeking that out.”

As Prairie Island moves into its next phase, the tribe plans to expand residential upgrades, complete the casino conversion, continue workforce training and identify additional clean‑energy projects. Zimmerman said the work is focused on reducing long-term operating risk, strengthening energy sovereignty and improving infrastructure resilience.

The tribe has also restored more than 400 acres of native prairie and invested in wild rice, shoreline and oak savanna projects, describing these efforts as part of the same climate and sovereignty framework as the energy work.

“There’s been a lot of benefits to this work already,” Zimmerman said. “I think we’re going to see a lot more as it continues to grow.”",https://tribalbusinessnews.com/images/2023/PIIC_SOLAR.jpeg,N,,2026-01-17 09:59:07.962923

(CN) — In a blow to President Donald Trump, a federal judge on Friday granted an injunction allowing for the completion of a wind turbine project off the coast of Virginia.

In a ruling from the bench, Judge Jamar Walker, a Joe Biden appointee, granted a temporary restraining order permitting Dominion Energy to continue working on the coastal Virginia offshore wind project as litigation proceeds. Dominion Energy had sued the federal government in December after the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management suspended for 90 days all ongoing projects related to wind energy, citing national security.

“Our team will now focus on safely restarting work to ensure CVOW” — that is, the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project — “begins delivery of critical energy in just weeks,” Dominion Energy said in an email. “While our legal challenge proceeds, we will continue seeking a durable resolution of this matter through cooperation with the federal government.”

The bureau’s suspension came after Trump issued a presidential memorandum in January 2025 entitled “Temporary Withdrawal of All Areas on the Outer Continental Shelf from Offshore Wind Leasing and Review of the Federal Government’s Leasing and Permitting Practices for Wind Projects.” That memo prompted the Department of the Interior to review the project.

The administration cited purported confidential information from the War Department, which ostensibly indicated that offshore wind projects could impact national security.

“The prime duty of the United States government is to protect the American people,” Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a December press release. “Today’s action addresses emerging national security risks, including the rapid evolution of the relevant adversary technologies, and the vulnerabilities created by large-scale offshore wind projects with proximity near our East Coast population centers. The Trump administration will always prioritize the security of the American people.”

The government argued that the court should wait until it had provided its confidential reasoning. Walker, however, sided with Dominion Energy, which sought to maintain the status quo until the court ruled on a preliminary injunction. The order comes as Dominion Energy continues to litigate the legal basis for the suspension.

Walker has yet to issue an opinion explaining his decision but indicated he believes the suspension is causing Dominion Energy irreparable harm and that the company is likely to succeed on its claim that the suspension violates the Administrative Procedures Act.

“I applaud the court’s decision to block this reckless and unlawful order. Three judges — appointed by three different presidents, Reagan, Trump, and Biden — have now all rejected President Trump’s attempt to shut down this critical project,” Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates Don Scott, a Democrat, said in a press release. “This disruption should never have happened. I look forward to the legal process continuing, construction moving forward, and Virginia doing what we do best: building a reliable, affordable energy future.”

Virginia Senators Tim Kaine and Mark Warner and U.S. Representative Bobby Scott, all Democrats, submitted a brief in support of Dominion.

In it, they questioned why the administration hasn’t shared any specifics about this supposed national security threat.

“This lack of transparency raises grave concerns, which should inform this court’s review,” the legislators wrote in their support brief. “When information is not timely shared, it is reasonable to ask why. And asking that question is especially essential given the many steps the administration has taken to target offshore wind projects in particular, several of which have been declared unlawful or are currently being challenged.”

If completed, the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project will consist of 176 offshore wind turbines located 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach. They will be capable of supplying 9.5 million megawatt-hours of energy per year, enough to power approximately 660,000 homes.

Virginia State Senate Majority Leader Scott Surrovel, also a Democrat, estimated the project will save $320 million per year in avoided fuel charges while also generating renewable energy certificates.

The conservation community celebrated the order.

“Virginia needs more, not less, affordable clean energy, and today’s ruling helps make that happen,” Blair St. Ledger-Olson, director of advocacy and campaigns for the Virginia League of Conservation Voters, said in a press release. “The Trump administration’s continued obstruction of clean energy projects may be good for his fossil fuel donors, but it hurts Virginians, saddling us with higher energy bills and dirtier air while killing good-paying jobs.”

But six years later, many of those Wall Street institutions have walked back or abandoned their commitments.
“These institutions signed up without having any clue what they were signing up for,” said Paddy McCully, an analyst at Reclaim Finance, a nonprofit group that pushes Wall Street to address climate change.
It was money, more than anything else, that got Wall Street to care about climate change in the first place.
Conservative politicians and media pundits began pressuring Wall Street to distance itself from the climate cause.","In January 2020, Larry Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, stunned the business world by declaring that he intended to use the trillions of dollars managed by his firm to address global warming.

“Every government, company, and shareholder must confront climate change,” Mr. Fink wrote, calling for “a fundamental reshaping of finance.”

A few days later, Mr. Fink arrived in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum’s annual gathering, donning a scarf featuring a design of the “warming stripes,” a pattern that depicts 150 years of rising global temperatures.

Mr. Fink’s impassioned call to address climate change was the unofficial start of a movement. Nearly every major financial institution was soon pledging to reduce emissions, joining high-minded alliances designed to phase out fossil fuels and promising to support clean energy. Environmental, social and governance factors, known as E.S.G., became a defining feature of Wall Street investing.

But six years later, many of those Wall Street institutions have walked back or abandoned their commitments.

The alliances — like the Net-Zero Banking Alliance and the Net-Zero Asset Managers initiative — that were meant to steer investments toward clean energy and away from fossil fuels have largely fallen apart. Investors have withdrawn tens of billions of dollars each quarter from E.S.G. funds.

While U.S. investment in clean energy has boomed in recent years — reaching $279 billion last year — many large corporations have gone silent on climate change. On company earnings calls, mentions of words like climate and sustainability have plunged by 75 percent over the past year, according to a Bloomberg analysis.

And with President Trump back in office and using the presidency to promote fossil fuels and attack the clean energy industry, Wall Street’s retreat from climate action has coincided with American banks doubling down on coal, oil and gas projects.

These dynamics will be on full display next week, as Mr. Fink, now co-chair of the World Economic Forum, welcomes Mr. Trump to Davos, where climate issues have taken a back seat to A.I. and geopolitics.

Republican politicians joined conservative activists, including groups funded by the fossil fuel industry, to engineer a sweeping pushback at what they saw as corporate America’s attempt to advance liberal policies.

Their tactics involved filing lawsuits, passing laws, pulling funds out of Wall Street accounts and using social media to tarnish the reputation of individual executives, including Mr. Fink.

In short order, their efforts succeeded in beating back an environmental movement on Wall Street, which from its inception was defined more by idealistic rhetoric than substantive changes to business practices.

“These institutions signed up without having any clue what they were signing up for,” said Paddy McCully, an analyst at Reclaim Finance, a nonprofit group that pushes Wall Street to address climate change. “They were joining the herd and wanted to look good, but they never had any inclination to change their business model.”

The rise of E.S.G.

It was money, more than anything else, that got Wall Street to care about climate change in the first place.

In 2019, many of BlackRock’s biggest clients, including major Japanese and European sovereign wealth fund pension funds, started asking for more environmentally focused funds. If BlackRock came up with products that promised to benefit the planet, pension funds and sovereign wealth funds said they would entrust the company with even more of their money.

Mr. Fink obliged. BlackRock began designing new environmental funds and soon he was in Davos, wearing the climate scarf.

“Larry decided to be a leader in the bandwagon,” said Mindy Lubber, chief executive of Ceres, a nonprofit organization that works with companies to address climate change. “It worked out until it didn’t.”

Other Wall Street titans quickly followed BlackRock’s lead.

Every major American bank said it would no longer finance drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

JPMorgan said it was “adopting a financing commitment that is aligned to the goals of the Paris Agreement,” the 2015 agreement by most countries on Earth try and keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.

It was a fashionable pledge, and the movement soon came to encompass everything from investing in environmentally friendly bundles of stocks, to making loans to clean energy companies, to reducing corporate carbon emissions.

For a bank like JPMorgan, which regularly ranks as the biggest U.S. funder of fossil fuel projects, that would have meant rapidly winding down a lucrative line of business. JPMorgan did not reply to a request for comment.

Sensing momentum, Mr. Fink was even more ambitious in his 2021 annual letter to investors. In it, he promised to report climate impact of all BlackRock’s funds, create custom sustainability products, produce new ways to measure climate risk, and use the voting power of his firm’s holdings to push companies to address climate change.

In the months that followed, JPMorgan, Citigroup and Bank of America collectively pledged to deploy $5 trillion in sustainable finance by 2030 through loans and investments.

Ambitions kept rising at the annual United Nations climate summit in 2021. Known as COP26, the event in Glasgow, Scotland, would be the first such gathering since the pandemic, and its organizers wanted something concrete to show for their efforts.

Mark Carney, who was then fresh off his time as the governor of the Bank of England and is now prime minister of Canada, was brought in to convene a new U.N.-backed group that would encourage the private sector to reduce emissions.

The result was the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, or G.F.A.N.Z., which said it would harness the collective might of its members — some $130 trillion in assets — to try and stop global warming.

More than 450 financial groups including BlackRock, Bank of America and Citi signed on. In addition to the main umbrella group, G.F.A.N.Z. came to encompass a handful of industry specific associations including the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, the Net-Zero Asset Managers initiative and the Net-Zero Asset Owners Alliance.

Those alliances were a way for financial firms to signal their support for the highly ambitious goal of eliminating new planet-warming emissions by the year 2050. And joining was easy, requiring little more than an expression of good intentions. With no expectations that banks or investors needed to change their business models, companies signed on to the alliances in droves.

When convincing finance executives they should join the groups, Mr. Carney and his allies emphasized the chance to generate profits.

Celebrating the launch of the banking alliance, John Kerry, then the U.S. Special Presidential envoy for climate, said, “The largest financial players in the world recognize energy transition represents a vast commercial opportunity as well as a planetary imperative.”

Yet even as Wall Street firms raced to promote their climate bona fides, some executives were skeptical of the new products.

Terrence Keeley, a senior executive at BlackRock who oversaw sovereign wealth funds, pensions and central banks at the time, was among the loudest dissenters.

“All of these E.S.G. funds are wrong,” said Mr. Keeley, who left BlackRock in 2022 and now runs an impact investing firm. “They weren’t going to generate better returns. They are not going to make the world a better place. E.S.G. as an investment thesis should be entirely shut down.”

Mr. Keeley said that even as BlackRock was pushing E.S.G. funds, he was telling his own clients that they should not invest in them.

Internal dissent hardly mattered. Mr. Fink had delivered what the some clients had asked for, and alongside Mr. Carney, he had sparked a global movement.

It all added up to a banner year for BlackRock, which attracted nearly $25 billion in new assets for its E.S.G. funds in 2021.

Backlash

On the same day that executives in Glasgow were promoting their plans to use Wall Street as a force for good, a group of Republican state treasurers were gathered in Orlando, Fla., making plans to stop them.

The treasurers, part of a group called the State Financial Officers Foundation, discussed ways they might prevent their states’ assets from being used to support environmental causes.

Within a matter of months, Republican state treasurers had withdrawn more than $1 billion in funds from BlackRock. Conservative politicians and media pundits began pressuring Wall Street to distance itself from the climate cause.

Backing these efforts were right-leaning research organizations such as the Heritage Foundation and the Heartland Institute, major conservative funders and operatives including the Koch brothers and Leonard Leo, as well as fossil fuel trade groups including the American Petroleum Institute.

As conservative opposition mounted, financial firms found themselves exposed to unexpected legal liabilities.

In 2022, a U.N.-backed group called Race to Zero, which was partnered with G.F.A.N.Z., updated its expectations about what the participating companies would actually do. Among the changes was new language that pushed financial firms to stop doing business with coal companies.

That raised alarm bells on Wall Street, and conservatives pounced. Just one month after the update, a group of Republican activists gathered at a meeting of the American Legislative Exchange Council in Atlanta and discussed how they could target firms participating in G.F.A.N.Z. with antitrust lawsuits.

Then major banks and financial institutions pulled out of Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. Days later, the initiative said it was “suspending activities.” The group now says it will relaunch this year.

Bank of America, which said it would stop financing coal and refrain from financing drilling in the Arctic, walked back those commitments. The company declined to comment.

And BlackRock has slashed its support for social and environmental shareholder proposals.

In a statement, Chris Berger, a BlackRock spokesman, said that the company had built the industry’s largest platform for investing in sustainable business practices and the energy transition, with over $1 trillion in assets under management.

But in Mr. Fink’s most recent letter to investors, there was no mention of climate change. Instead, he emphasized the need for “energy pragmatism.”

“It was a bunch of empty promises from a bunch of Wall Street types who abandoned their pledges when it was no longer convenient,” said a former BlackRock executive who requested anonymity to speak freely about their former employer. “We marched up the hill, and we marched back down it.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/17/multimedia/17cli-wallstreet-01-fqhl/17cli-wallstreet-01-fqhl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 11:00:12.227949

Outlook for India’s EV Battery Ecosystem India has the right ingredients needed to emerge as a global EV battery manufacturing hub - a large domestic market, strong engineering talent, improving infrastructure, and a clear sustainability imperative.
If we get this right, EV batteries will no longer be a cost barrier.","India’s electric vehicle (EV) story has moved beyond pilots and proofs of concept. By 2030, India aims to have around 80 million EVs on the roads. The Indian EV market is projected to grow to $164.42 billion by 2033, registering a CAGR of 57.23 per cent.

The sector is also undergoing a distinct shift, given the consolidations in two-wheeler EVs and growth in heavy-duty EVs. One fact stands out clearly: the future of India’s EV growth will be shaped more by battery technology and economics.

Batteries account for nearly 40-50 per cent of an EV’s total cost. While vehicle platforms, power electronics, and software are getting increasingly localised, batteries are still largely imported. This makes EV manufacturers vulnerable to currency volatility, geopolitical risks and supply chain disruptions. It also limits the industry’s ability to drive down costs through scale, learning curves and design optimisation.

The Union Budget of India, therefore, has a critical role to play, not merely as a fiscal instrument, but as a signal of long-term intent to localise battery manufacturing, strengthening the value chain to ensure EV affordability. This can only be achieved with battery localisation.

Why Localisation of EV Batteries Matters

Though battery localisation is a strategic lever that shapes cost structures, supply chain resilience, sustainability outcomes, and long-term industrial competitiveness, the immediate impact is on cost. According to various market reports, batteries already account for the largest share of an EV’s bill of materials. Import dependence exposes manufacturers to issues that compound pricing pressures.

Local manufacturing, on the other hand, shortens supply chains and helps absorb these structural costs. It also allows battery chemistries and pack designs to be optimised for Indian conditions, such as high ambient temperatures, commuting through congested urban roads, and intensive daily usage, which are very different to global specifications that are designed for different environments. Localisation is central to energy security and supply chain resilience.

A study states that global battery supply chains remain highly concentrated, particularly across raw materials, processing infrastructure and cell manufacturing capacity. By developing a localised capability, manufacturers can reduce dependence on global hubs, besides gaining control over availability, quality and timelines.

Another report states that regions that succeed in building local battery value chains benefit greatly by having faster innovation cycles, deeper integration between design and manufacturing, and improved productivity at scale. This advantage enables manufacturers to move faster and compete more effectively in global markets.

Sustainability adds another layer, as global regulators and customers demand greater transparency on emissions, traceability, and circularity, localised battery ecosystems make compliance significantly more achievable. Proximity between manufacturing, usage, and end-of-life processes simplifies carbon tracking, enables recycling and second-life applications, and supports the transition toward more circular battery value chains.

India has already taken important steps through production-linked incentives and EV adoption programs, such as the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme. The next phase requires continuity of policy, clarity of long-term intent, and deeper support across the entire value chain, from materials and technology development to recycling infrastructure.

Role of Advanced Materials and Technology in EV Batteries

The focus of battery localisation is often on cell chemistry and giga factories. Yet, some of the most critical performance and safety gains come from materials and technologies that sit between components rather than at their core.

Thermal management is a case in point. As batteries move toward higher energy densities and faster charging, effective heat control becomes central to safety, longevity and charging performance. Industry analyses state that poor thermal regulation accelerates degradation and increases the risk of thermal runaway, especially under fast-charging and high load conditions. Advanced thermal interface materials, gap fillers, and heat-dissipating coatings help maintain optimal operating temperatures, extend battery life, and improve real-world reliability.

Modern battery packs rely on structural adhesives to enable lighter, more compact designs while improving crash performance and vibration resistance. These adhesives also support higher levels of automation and faster assembly, both of which are essential for scaling battery manufacturing. They must perform reliably under thermal cycling, chemical exposure, and long service lives, particularly in demanding operating environments such as India. Protective coatings and safety materials form the third pillar. Advanced coatings now deliver multiple functions in a single layer—electrical insulation, flame retardancy, corrosion resistance, and thermal stability. This multi-functionality improves safety while reducing weight and material complexity.

From an industry perspective, investment in advanced materials is foundational. Materials science enables consistency, scalability, and reliability, all of which will ultimately determine the competitiveness of localised EV battery manufacturing ecosystems.

What Industry Needs from Union Budget 2026

For the battery sector to truly come of age, the upcoming Union Budget should focus on long-term clarity and holistic support. Here is what the industry is looking forward to:

• Policy support across the full battery value chain: While incentives for cell manufacturing are essential, industry voices have consistently emphasised that batteries must be viewed as complete systems rather than isolated components. The automobile and EV ecosystem is seeking a more holistic approach, one that supports not only cells, but also packs, power electronics, materials, and enabling technologies. End-to-end value-chain support is critical to ensure that localisation delivers real cost and performance advantages.

• Incentives for R&D and advanced materials: Innovation in EV batteries is increasingly materials-led. The industry is calling for stronger R&D-linked incentives, simplified compliance, and greater support for startups and applied research. Targeted incentives for advanced materials, such as thermal solutions, adhesives, coatings, and safety materials, can accelerate the development of battery technologies tailored to Indian operating conditions. Structured industry–academia collaboration and pilot-scale validation facilities would further shorten the path from lab to manufacturing.

• Support for scaling manufacturing and infrastructure: Battery manufacturing is capital-intensive and highly sensitive to scale and utilisation. As per reports, auto industry is seeking a capex push, EV-specific support measures, and infrastructure investment to make large-scale manufacturing viable. Support for common infrastructure, financing mechanisms, and predictable demand signals, especially for fleet and public-sector adoption, can help de-risk early scale-up and improve project economics.

• Policy for long-term visibility: Across multiple industry commentaries, one message is consistent: long-term policy certainty matters as much as incentives. Battery investments have long gestation cycles. Clear timelines, stable subsidy structures, aligned regulations, and continuity across budget cycles are essential to unlock sustained private investment and accelerate EV adoption at scale.

Outlook for India’s EV Battery Ecosystem

India has the right ingredients needed to emerge as a global EV battery manufacturing hub - a large domestic market, strong engineering talent, improving infrastructure, and a clear sustainability imperative. What will determine its success is how effectively industry and government can work together to bridge the gap between intent and execution.

Localisation is not an end in itself. It is a means to build affordability, resilience, and competitiveness into the EV ecosystem. Batteries sit at the heart of this transformation, and their success depends on a network of materials, technologies, and capabilities that must evolve in parallel.

As we look at the Union Budget 2026, the opportunity is ripe to create an environment where innovation is rewarded, manufacturing is scalable, and sustainability is embedded by design. If we get this right, EV batteries will no longer be a cost barrier. They will become a strategic advantage that power not just vehicles, but also India’s broader industrial future.",https://static.businessworld.in/EV Battery Car_20260117164216_ogImage_18.jpeg,N,,2026-01-17 06:57:39.880358

are still taxed at 18 per cent, creating a clear cost imbalance for domestic manufacturers,” an industry expert said.
Further, the non-availability of a refund under IDS on ITC attributable to capital goods continues to add to the cost of production, given the capital-intensive nature of the EV industry, he said.
“EVs continue to attract a 5 per cent GST, but recent rate changes for some ICE segments have narrowed the gap.
“Faster adoption in these areas is essential to meeting the 30 per cent EV penetration target by 2030,” he said.","There is a need to correct inverted duty structures for electric vehicle makers, in addition to providing EVs with a clear GST advantage, including for charging infrastructure and services and battery swapping, industry players said ahead of the Union Budget.

While EVs continue to attract 5 per cent GST, the GST rate changes for internal combustion engine (ICE) segments in GST 2.0 have narrowed the price gap, thereby making ICE more attractive from a total cost of ownership perspective.

“GST on EVs and chargers remains at 5 per cent, but critical components such as power electronic components, magnetic cores, etc. are still taxed at 18 per cent, creating a clear cost imbalance for domestic manufacturers,” an industry expert said.

Aligning these GST rates and broadening government schemes, such as PM e-Drive, to also cover charging infrastructure costs would significantly enhance the overall market impact on India’s EV ecosystem, he added.

Expressing similar views, an tax expert said, “EV manufacturers in India continue to face challenges under the inverted duty structure (IDS), as the GST rate on electric vehicles is only 5 per cent, while most key inputs and components attract significantly higher rates.

Further, the non-availability of a refund under IDS on ITC attributable to capital goods continues to add to the cost of production, given the capital-intensive nature of the EV industry, he said.

“Considering the government’s intent to rigorously promote electrification and localised manufacturing of EVs, necessary steps should be taken to create a conducive environment for EV manufacturing in the country,” he noted.

This disparity leads to the accumulation of input tax credit and working capital strain.”

After the overhaul of the GST rate structure from September 22 2025, while the tax rate on parts and components was reduced from 28 per cent to 18 per cent, it provides partial relief to EV manufacturers, as the tax rate disparity persists for critical inputs compared to finished goods, he explained.

Another industry expert said that accelerating EV adoption in India, at a time when ICE vehicles are regaining momentum under GST 2.0 and global trade tensions are rising, requires steady, well-balanced policy support.

“EVs continue to attract a 5 per cent GST, but recent rate changes for some ICE segments have narrowed the gap. It is therefore important to protect a clear GST advantage for EVs, including on charging infrastructure, charging services, and battery swapping, to keep EVs affordable and investments viable,” he added.

He also said demand incentives under PM E-DRIVE should remain focused on segments where electrification delivers the maximum impact on public transport, shared mobility, commercial fleets, and last-mile delivery.

“Faster adoption in these areas is essential to meeting the 30 per cent EV penetration target by 2030,” he said.

On the supply side, he said duty exemptions on critical battery inputs should continue until domestic cell manufacturing under the PLI scheme reaches scale, especially in an uncertain global tariff environment.

Strong state support through demand, supply, and R&D incentives is also essential to sustain EV affordability, innovation, and long-term adoption momentum, he added.

However, there's still a lot of misinformation surrounding EVs that dissuades some drivers from ditching their gas-powered cars.

One EV owner shared their experience with their electric vehicle, breaking down how much they've saved since owning it.

""I wish more people understood how cheap EV ownership can actually be,"" wrote the OP. ""Last night I charged my Mustang Mach-E P for six hours and got up to 90%. The total cost was $1.59 and when you see that on your bill it's hard to take the whole 'EVs cost more to run' thing seriously.""

The OP also noted that most EV misinformation comes from people who don't own them, so they don't see firsthand how affordable they can be.

""It's cheap to run an EV if you can charge at home,"" agreed one Redditor.

Driving an EV can save you $1,500 on gas and maintenance each year. EVs also help to improve air quality, as they do not emit any tailpipe pollution.

For homeowners with solar panels, driving an EV is a home run with long-term savings. Charging your EV at home is cheaper and more convenient than charging at public stations. ""I really wish people understood how affordable EVs can be when you charge at home or at a condo,"" the OP wrote. Plus, charging your EV when you have solar panels essentially becomes free when your solar system is paid off.

Switching to an EV isn't just beneficial for your wallet; it also helps the environment. While EV battery production generates pollution, it's nowhere near the amount of pollution created by the fossil fuels used to run gas-powered vehicles, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

Companies like Electrified Materials in Indiana are also working to recycle EV batteries to reduce EVs' environmental impact even more.

Redditors continued to share their own experiences driving an EV and saving money.

The oil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future output, fell by one to 543 in the week to January 16, the lowest since mid-December..

Baker Hughes said this week’s decline puts the total rig count down 37 rigs, or 6% below this time last year.

Baker Hughes said oil rigs rose by one to 410 this week, while gas rigs fell by two to 122, their lowest since October.

The oil and gas rig count declined by about 7% in 2025, 5% in 2024, and 20% in 2023 as lower U.S. oil prices prompted energy firms to focus more on boosting shareholder returns and paying down debt rather than increasing output.

The independent exploration and production companies tracked by financial services firm TD Cowen said they planned to keep capital expenditures flat in 2026 after cutting spending by around 4% in 2025.

That compares with roughly flat year-on-year spending in 2024, increases of 27% in 2023, 40% in 2022, and 4% in 2021.

With U.S. spot crude prices expected to fall for a fourth year in a row in 2026, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected crude output would ease from a record 13.61 million barrels per day in 2025 to around 13.59 million bpd in 2026.

On the gas side, the EIA projected output would rise from a record 107.4 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2025 to 108.8 bcfd in 2026 even though spot prices at the Henry Hub benchmark were forecast to ease by about 2% in 2026.

IDEM implements both state and federal regulations to protect human health and the environment.
Beyond the basics, IDEM controls air and water pollution, regulates waste management, and enforces legal action against violators.
Many of those who testified in the Senate Environmental Affairs Committee on Monday said they are worried the changes would leave loopholes that would protect industry rather than people.
Another major concern brought up during testimony was the short amount of time given to digest the nearly 200-page bill.","Senate Bill 277, authored by Sen. Rick Niemeyer, R-Lowell, passed its committee Monday 5-3 along party lines, heading to the Senate Appropriations Committee, but testifiers were left questioning if its purpose is economic growth or actual protection of Indiana’s environment.

The bill amends the state’s environmental framework via Title 13, which is Indiana code governing the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM). IDEM implements both state and federal regulations to protect human health and the environment. Beyond the basics, IDEM controls air and water pollution, regulates waste management, and enforces legal action against violators.

SB 277 seeks to make various changes that would impact these regulations. Many of those who testified in the Senate Environmental Affairs Committee on Monday said they are worried the changes would leave loopholes that would protect industry rather than people.

Another major concern brought up during testimony was the short amount of time given to digest the nearly 200-page bill.

“It is nearly unattainable to fully relay the broader implications and effects of its contents in the time we have had before us,” said Desi Rybolt, Indiana Conservation Voters campaign manager.

Similar concerns were shared by David Van Gilder, senior policy and legal director for Hoosier Environmental Council.

“This sprawling bill covers the entirety of Title 13, and thus the Hoosier Environmental Council’s remarks today cannot address all of these issues presented by the 176 pages that dropped on Thursday morning,” he said.

“Burdensome” is a word used eight times throughout the bill. When Sen. Greg Taylor, D-Indianapolis, questioned IDEM Commissioner Clint Woods about the implications of that word, Taylor’s conclusion came back to paperwork.

In March 2025, Gov. Mike Braun released an executive order that tasked the state’s environmental agencies with cutting regulations.

Van Gilder told TheStatehouseFile.com that the Environmental Council has no problem with lawmakers cleaning up the code and updating outdated references. However, in doing so, SB 277 also slips in language that creates an opportunity for IDEM to deny Hoosiers protection, he said—for example, the requirement for state agencies to report back to IDEM would be eliminated.

According to Shannon Anderson, director of advocacy for Earth Charter Indiana, a survey from the beginning of July found that businesses were far more concerned with small changes and clarity that would go back to helping the environment.

“What we saw from that process was that businesses were not burdened by most of our state regulations,” said Anderson. “The letters that I received were overwhelmingly in support of greater protections.”

The original Title 13 consistently uses the word “shall” to require action, but in the proposed bill, “shall” is replaced with “may.”

“The obligation the agency has to protect Hoosiers’ environment and health is limited to the discretion of whoever may be in charge,” Rybolt said.

Van Gilder offered an example of what he thought was an especially dangerous provision in the bill. In the event of substantial threat to human health in the environment, the commissioner now can choose whether or not to take action, he said.

Woods said that IDEM does not comment on pending legislation and directed TSF to his already recorded testimony.

Anderson told The Statehouse File that the big question to take away from the meeting is how it will impact the environment and if IDEM will continue protecting regulations those working with the environment deem crucial.

“One person’s burdensome regulation is another person’s protection,” Anderson said. “Who will ultimately end up paying for this?”",http://dailyjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/135924028_web1_idem-logo-web.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 12:00:56.312212

It also supports Slovakia’s efforts to diversify its energy supply, strengthen long-term energy security, and integrate advanced American nuclear technology into Central Europe’s energy infrastructure.
“Today’s civil nuclear agreement reflects our shared commitment to strengthening European energy security and sovereignty for decades to come.","WASHINGTON—U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico today signed an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) to advance cooperation on Slovakia’s civil nuclear power program. This landmark agreement includes the development of a new, state-owned American 1,200 MWe nuclear unit at the Jaslovské Bohunice Nuclear Power Plant, deepening the U.S.-Slovakia strategic partnership and strengthening European energy security.

The agreement builds on President Trump’s commitment to advancing American energy leadership. A project of this scale is expected to create thousands of American jobs across engineering, advanced manufacturing, construction, nuclear fuel services, and project management, while reinforcing U.S. supply chains and expanding access to global markets for American-made nuclear technology. These efforts lay the foundation for sustained U.S. engagement in Slovakia’s nuclear energy program and support future civil nuclear projects across the region.

It also supports Slovakia’s efforts to diversify its energy supply, strengthen long-term energy security, and integrate advanced American nuclear technology into Central Europe’s energy infrastructure.

“The United States is proud to partner with Slovakia as a trusted ally as we expand cooperation across the energy sector,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright. “Today’s civil nuclear agreement reflects our shared commitment to strengthening European energy security and sovereignty for decades to come. By deploying America’s leading nuclear technology, we are creating thousands of good-paying American jobs, expanding global markets for U.S. nuclear companies, and driving economic growth at home”.

“I see this moment as a significant milestone in our bilateral relations, but also as a clear signal that Slovakia and the United States are united by a common strategic thinking about the future of energy – about its safety, sustainability, and technological maturity,” said the Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic Robert Fico.

The planned nuclear unit represents a multibillion-dollar energy infrastructure investment and one of the largest in Slovakia’s history. The project will support Slovakia’s transition away from reliance on Russian-designed reactors toward a diversified and resilient nuclear fleet, strengthening national energy security through cooperation with trusted Western partners.

Under the IGA, the United States and Slovakia will cooperate across a broad range of civil nuclear activities, including reactor technology, supply chains, safety and security best practices, workforce development, and long-term project planning.

Exacerbating matters is the legacy of the Biden administration’s regulatory assault on America’s coal and natural gas power plants.
But that agenda led to the elimination of U.S. power plants that are now needed more than ever.
Consider that, in 2025 alone, heavy domestic demand and surging exports drove up U.S. natural gas prices by an astounding 70%.
Keeping America’s coal plants online is an overlooked but critically important step in recovering from the Biden administration’s failed energy subtraction.","As America moves into 2026, consumers are looking for relief from an ongoing “affordability crisis.” While prices for some key items have mercifully held steady — or even come down — other costs such as rent, dining out, and hospital visits continue to climb unabated.

U.S. electricity — the one sector that affects all consumer industries in some way — is also racing upward. America’s electricity costs have jumped 32% in just the past five years. That’s a major problem for our new digital economy.

Why are electricity prices rising so rapidly? Soaring power demand — particularly from data centers — is colliding with an electric grid already stretched to the limit. Add to that natural gas price volatility and we can see why America’s families are getting squeezed in an “affordability” crunch.

Exacerbating matters is the legacy of the Biden administration’s regulatory assault on America’s coal and natural gas power plants. The Biden team was singularly focused on reducing carbon emissions. But that agenda led to the elimination of U.S. power plants that are now needed more than ever.

Peak U.S. power demand is expected to jump 166 gigawatts in just the next five years, thanks to the vast needs of artificial intelligence and the data center boom. That’s 15 times the peak electricity needs of New York City.

This is unsustainable without more “dispatchable power” — the reliable, on-demand electricity generation provided by many of the very power plants the Biden administration sought to eliminate.

In parts of the U.S., electricity supplies are now stretched so thin that grid operators and regulators are scrambling to avoid power shortfalls. The nation’s top grid reliability regulator recently called the situation a “five-alarm fire.”

To its credit, the Trump administration is working feverishly to stop the bleeding. Instead of cutting power plants from the grid, the administration is working to rapidly expand the supply of on-demand power in the United States. As a first step, that means retaining the nation’s coal generating capacity. Doing so could bolster grid reliability and ease some of the current price inflation.

We know this works because America’s coal fleet is already being tapped as a buffer against rapidly rising natural gas prices. Because natural gas is the leading fuel for both electricity generation and home heating, even a small change in prices can have a large impact on consumers. Consider that, in 2025 alone, heavy domestic demand and surging exports drove up U.S. natural gas prices by an astounding 70%.

Fortunately for consumers, low-cost coal generation is still an option amidst rising natural gas prices. In 2025, coal-fired electricity generation in creased more than 13% across the nation, easing natural gas demand and electricity costs for tens of millions of Americans.

Keeping America’s coal plants online is an overlooked but critically important step in recovering from the Biden administration’s failed energy subtraction.

The path to lower electricity prices is through abundant, reliable energy. Using policy tools to grow America’s supply of electricity — not tear it down — will be essential to keeping the lights on this winter and taking the bite out of electricity price inflation.

Conclusion and Final Verdict In conclusion, the Canada–China trade relationship is not defined by sweeping agreements but by strategic calibration.","Canada–China trade relations have entered a complex and highly strategic phase. After years of tension marked by tariffs, import restrictions, and diplomatic disputes, both countries are reassessing their economic relationship under shifting global conditions. Rising geopolitical fragmentation, supply chain reconfiguration, and climate-driven industrial policy, particularly in electric vehicles (EVs) and clean technology, have pushed tariffs and market access back to the center of bilateral trade discussions.

In early 2026, Canada and China announced a major reset of their economic relationship, one that Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney described as offering “historic gains” for both nations by leveraging mutual strengths across agriculture, energy, technology, and finance. This diplomatic milestone, marked by Carney’s first official visit to China since 2017, signals a deliberate effort to rebuild bilateral trade ties after years of tension and tariff escalations, and comes at a moment of global economic fragmentation and shifting trade alliances. According to the latest Canada export data and China import data, the total value of Canada-China trade reached $85.75 billion in 2024 and $65.40 billion in the first three quarters of 2025.

China is still one of Canada’s largest trading partners, while Canada remains an important supplier of agricultural commodities, natural resources, and increasingly, upstream inputs for clean energy and advanced manufacturing. At the same time, both governments are using tariffs and trade controls more actively to protect domestic industries and advance strategic objectives. This article breaks down the evolving Canada–China tariff landscape with a focus on three critical areas: electric vehicles (EVs), canola and agricultural trade, and broader structural trade dynamics shaping the bilateral relationship for Canada and China trade.

The EV–Canola Tariff Deal Reshaping Canada–China Trade Relations

At the heart of this renewed engagement is a preliminary tariff agreement focused on two previously contentious sectors, electric vehicles (EVs) and canola, with implications that go well beyond those industries. Canada agreed to slash tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, allowing up to 49,000 vehicles to enter at a most-favored-nation rate of 6.1 percent, a dramatic change from the punitive 100 percent tariffs imposed as recently as 2024 under the previous Canadian government. In exchange, China committed to reducing tariffs on Canadian canola seeds and related agricultural goods, including canola meal, lobsters, crabs, and peas. This shift in policy is expected to unlock billions of dollars in export opportunities for Canadian farmers and processors after prolonged market disruptions.

These breakthroughs are positioned by both governments as part of a strategic partnership aimed at sustainable economic cooperation, even as broader geopolitical tensions persist. Canada, long economically intertwined with both the United States and China, now appears intent on diversifying trade relationships and reducing dependency on any single market, a pragmatic response to unpredictable tariff environments and a fracturing global trading system. China, in turn, sees value in stabilizing and expanding trade with a major Western economy at a time when global supply chains and geopolitical alliances are shifting rapidly. This Canada-China tariff deal does not represent a full free trade deal in the conventional sense, but it positions trade policy as a core pillar of a deeper bilateral relationship.

By focusing on sectors central to both countries’ industrial strategies, EV manufacturing for Canada’s clean energy ambitions and canola agriculture for China’s food and industrial demand, the agreement reflects a pragmatic recalibration of Canada–China traderelations. In the sections that follow, we’ll break down this evolving tariff landscape, examine the ramifications for Canada’s EV and agricultural sectors, and explore broader trade implications as both nations navigate a complex global economy.

Canada–China Trade in Context: Size, Structure, & Imbalance

Trade Volume and Direction

Canada–China trade remains large but structurally imbalanced. As of the mid-2020s:

Annual two-way merchandise trade exceeds CAD 100 billion or USD 80 billion.

Canada consistently runs a significant trade deficit, importing far more from China than it exports.

Manufactured goods dominate Chinese exports to Canada.

Primary commodities dominate Canadian exports to China.

China is Canada’s second-largest trading partner after the United States, while Canada is a mid-tier partner for China, reflecting asymmetrical dependence.

What Canada Imports from China

Canada imports from China are heavily concentrated in:

Consumer electronics

Machinery and electrical equipment

Furniture and household goods

Textiles and apparel

Batteries and battery components

These imports are price-competitive and deeply embedded in Canadian retail and manufacturing supply chains.

What Canada Exports to China

Canada exports to China are narrower and more volatile, dominated by:

Canola and canola products

Wheat and barley

Pork and seafood

Wood pulp and lumber

Minerals and energy-related inputs

This structural asymmetry makes tariffs and non-tariff barriers particularly impactful for Canadian exporters.

Canada-China Trade in the Last 10 Years: Yearly Bilateral Trade Data

Tariffs as Policy Tools in Canada–China Relations

Unlike traditional free trade agreements, Canada–China tariff arrangements are selective, reactive, and politically sensitive. Tariffs are often accompanied, or replaced by, regulatory barriers, licensing requirements, and administrative controls. China imposed tariffs on about $2.6 billion worth of Canadian farm and food items, including canola oil and meal, in March in retaliation for Trudeau's tariffs. In August, the country imposed tariffs on canola seed. As a result, China's imports of Canadian commodities fell by 10.4% in 2025. According to Carney, Canada anticipates that China would reduce its canola seed tariffs from the current 84% to a combined rate of roughly 15% by March 1 as part of the new agreement. Canada anticipates the removal of anti-discrimination duties on canola meal, lobsters, crabs, and peas starting on March 1 and continuing until at least the end of the year.

Key characteristics of the Canada–China tariff environment include:

Limited tariff liberalization

High use of non-tariff measures

Sector-specific restrictions rather than economy-wide agreements

Strong linkage between trade actions and political developments

This context is critical when analyzing EVs and canola, where tariffs intersect with strategic and security concerns.

Electric Vehicles: Tariffs, Subsidies, & Strategic Competition

China’s Dominance in the EV Supply Chain

China is the world’s largest producer and exporter of electric vehicles and EV components. It controls significant portions of:

Battery cell manufacturing

Rare earth processing

Cathode and anode materials

EV platform manufacturing

Chinese EV exports have surged globally, raising concerns in importing countries about market distortion driven by state subsidies and scale advantages.

Canada’s EV Strategy

Canada has positioned itself as a clean automotive and battery manufacturing hub, supported by:

Large-scale investment incentives

Domestic battery plants

Critical mineral development

Industrial policy aligned with North American partners

Protecting this emerging ecosystem is a key priority for Canadian trade and tariff policy.

EV Tariffs Between Canada and China

Canada’s Approach to Chinese EV Imports

Canada does not have a comprehensive tariff agreement with China covering EVs. Instead, the EV trade is shaped by:

Existing Most-Favored-Nation tariff rates

Enhanced scrutiny of subsidies and state support

Alignment with broader industrial and national security policies

Canada has signaled a willingness to use:

Anti-dumping investigations

Countervailing duties

Investment screening

These tools function as de facto trade barriers even when formal tariffs remain unchanged.

Why EV Tariffs Matter More Than Volume

Currently, Chinese EVs represent a small share of Canada’s total vehicle market. However, their potential impact is significant due to:

Lower production costs

Rapid technological improvement

Aggressive export pricing

Tariff policy is therefore preemptive, aimed at shaping future market structure rather than reacting to existing volumes.

China’s Tariff and Market Access Policy on EV-Related Inputs

While China exports finished EVs, it imports upstream inputs where Canada is strategically positioned.

Canadian exports relevant to EV supply chains include:

Nickel

Cobalt

Copper

Lithium-related materials

Potash for battery-related chemical processing

China has generally maintained low tariff barriers on these inputs, prioritizing supply security. However, access is increasingly managed through:

Licensing

Long-term contracts

State-linked procurement

Tariffs are less important than strategic control mechanisms, which shape Canada’s export opportunities.

Canola: The Most Politically Sensitive Trade Issue

Importance of Canola to Canada

Canola is one of Canada’s most valuable agricultural exports:

Annual production exceeds 20 million tons

China has historically absorbed 30–40 percent of Canada’s canola exports

The sector supports tens of thousands of farmers and processors

Few Canadian exports are as exposed to China-specific trade policy risk.

China’s Restrictions on Canadian Canola

China’s actions on canola have rarely taken the form of straightforward tariffs. Instead, they have included:

Import suspensions

Tightened quality inspections

Revocation of exporter licenses

Delays at ports

While nominal tariff rates may remain unchanged, these measures function as effective trade barriers.

Economic Impact

During periods of restricted access:

Canadian canola prices have declined domestically

Export volumes have shifted to alternative markets at lower margins

Processing capacity utilization has fluctuated

These impacts demonstrate how non-tariff barriers can be more disruptive than tariffs.

Tariff Agreements vs. Managed Trade in Agriculture

Why Canola Is Treated Differently

Agricultural trade between Canada and China is shaped by:

Food security concerns

Domestic price stabilization

Political leverage

Consumer safety narratives

As a result, China prefers managed trade mechanisms over transparent tariff reductions. Even when tariffs are low, market access is conditional, unpredictable, and highly sensitive to bilateral relations.

Canada’s Response: Diversification and Domestic Processing

Canada has responded to canola trade volatility by:

Expanding domestic crushing capacity

Diversifying export markets in Asia and Europe

Promoting value-added exports such as canola oil and meal

While China remains important, its share of Canadian canola exports has become less dominant than a decade ago. This reduces vulnerability but does not eliminate exposure.

Beyond EVs and Canola: Other Tariff-Sensitive Sectors

Pork and Beef

Canadian meat exports to China are sensitive to:

Health certifications

Disease outbreaks

Inspection regimes

Tariffs are typically low, but access can be quickly curtailed through administrative action.

Seafood

Seafood exports face:

Seasonal demand volatility

Inspection delays

Changing consumer preferences

Tariffs are secondary to regulatory approvals.

Wood Products and Pulp

These products face cyclical demand and are influenced by China’s construction sector. Tariffs remain moderate, but demand swings drive trade volumes more than policy.

The Role of Tariffs in a Fragmenting Global Trade System

Canada and China trade illustrates a broader global trend:

Tariffs are no longer the primary barrier

Strategic controls and industrial policy matter more

Trade agreements are increasingly selective and sector-specific

EVs represent the future of industrial competition, while canola represents legacy commodity dependence. Both are shaped by policy rather than pure market forces.

Strategic Implications for Canadian Businesses

Risk Management Is Essential

Companies engaged in Canada–China trade must plan for:

Policy-driven disruptions

Sudden market access changes

Long-term uncertainty rather than short-term volatility

Sectoral Strategy Matters

EV-related firms should focus on upstream integration and trusted supply chain positioning.

Agricultural exporters should prioritize diversification and value-added processing.

Resource exporters should secure long-term contracts rather than rely on spot markets.

Outlook: What the Canada-China Trade Landscape Looks Like Ahead

What Is Unlikely

A comprehensive free trade agreement

Broad-based tariff elimination

Fully depoliticized trade relations

What Is Likely

Continued selective tariff use

Increased reliance on non-tariff measures

Strategic trade management in sensitive sectors

Deeper scrutiny of EVs, batteries, and clean technology

Trade will remain large but increasingly conditional.

Key Highlights of the Canada–China Trade & Strategic Partnership Agreement

Canada and China have agreed to forge a new strategic partnership aimed at delivering “historic gains” for both countries by leveraging strengths in areas such as agriculture, energy, agri-food, and finance.

This marked the first official visit to China by a Canadian prime minister since 2017, reflecting a reset in bilateral ties after years of diplomatic strain.

A preliminary trade deal was announced that includes tariff reductions on key products:

Canada will allow up to 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) to enter at a 6.1% tariff, down from the previous 100% tariffs.

China is expected to lower canola seed tariffs to about 15% by March 1, 2026 (down from 84%).

Additional Canadian agricultural products like canola meal, lobsters, crabs, & peas are expected to be free of discriminatory tariffs at least through the end of the year.

The changes are projected to unlock nearly $3 billion in Canadian export orders, benefiting farmers, fish harvesters, and processors.

China remains Canada’s second-largest export market, and these tariff reductions aim to rejuvenate trade that had been constrained by prior tariff disputes.

The deal also includes commitments to restart high-level economic and financial dialogue, boost two-way trade and investment, and expand cooperation in sectors like green energy, oil, gas, and clean technologies.

Part of the wider partnership includes discussions on visa-free travel for Canadians to China and enhancements in energy grid cooperation and LNG exports to Asia.

The agreement comes amid broader geopolitical dynamics as Canada seeks to diversify trade away from heavy reliance on the U.S. market, especially in the context of recent U.S. tariffs.

Conclusion and Final Verdict

In conclusion, the Canada–China trade relationship is not defined by sweeping agreements but by strategic calibration. Electric vehicles represent the future of industrial competition, where tariffs function as defensive tools. Canola represents legacy dependence, where market access is shaped more by politics and regulation than by tariff schedules. Understanding this dynamic is critical for policymakers, businesses, and investors. Canada and China trade is no longer about maximizing volume; it is about managing risk, protecting strategic sectors, and navigating an increasingly fragmented global trade system.

In this environment, tariffs are only one piece of the puzzle. The real story lies in how trade policy, industrial strategy, and geopolitics intersect to shape who trades, what they trade, and on what terms.",https://www.tradeimex.in/blogs/uploads/images/202601/img_w500_696b56bf663848-76682349.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 06:57:46.872218

JOHN,,,,,https://www.kiro7.com/news/business/chinese-evs-are/FZVUZJPKXE6YZIF6TXNAIVJOIY/,"DETROIT — Chinese automakers have been making inroads around the world with growing sales of their high-tech, stylish and affordable electric vehicles.

That has had competitors concerned even before Canada this week agreed to cut its tariffs on Chinese EVs in exchange for concessions on Canadian farm products.

Experts now say an easier path into Canada could be a big boost for Chinese carmakers looking to dominate the global market — particularly as their domestic market weakens. That poses a threat to other auto manufacturers, particularly American companies.

U.S. officials acknowledged that in remarks at an assembly plant for Jeep-maker Stellantis in Toledo, Ohio on Friday. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the Chinese Communist Party invests in its auto industry to “control this industry.”

“Why? They want to take over the auto industry. They want to take away these jobs,” Duffy said. As far as the Canadian trade deal, he added: “They will live to regret the day they partner with China and bring in their vehicles.”

Others say the shift is inevitable.

“This is telling us that Chinese automakers continue to be really popular, and are doing better and better, and not just something that’s sold in global markets that are more marginal or less important to U.S. automakers,” said Ilaria Mazzocco, deputy director and senior fellow with the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

What makes Chinese vehicles stand out?

Chinese-made vehicles are high-quality, stylish and inexpensive, experts say.

“It’s clear that the vehicles made by Chinese brands come at a very competitive cost, but are also technologically quite desirable,” Mazzocco said. “They tend to be connected vehicles, so they have a lot of additional software capabilities that consumers seem to like. But the price point and the competitiveness are really big selling points.”

These vehicles can cost as little as $10,000 to $20,000; in the U.S., new vehicles are running close to $50,000 on average, and EVs even more so.

Chinese companies also have unique advantages as far as auto manufacturing and production, efficiency and making vehicles lighter, which helps extend an electrified vehicle's driving range.

“They’ve found a way to make small and mid-sized cars — cars that people want — at a reasonable price,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. ""These are the segments where GM and Ford and almost everybody else have abandoned.”

Many automakers have discontinued smaller vehicles in favor of higher-margin, large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that are far more profitable.

So why are Chinese EVs such a threat to U.S. automakers and others?

Much of the global auto market is electrifying, an ideal opportunity for advanced Chinese automakers to capitalize on. China saw 17% growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles in 2025, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week, and Europe saw a 33% increase.

Meanwhile, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1% last year. As the rest of the world advances, U.S. automakers have weakened their once-ambitious, multibillion dollar electrification plans, instead opting for more efficient hybrid electric and gasoline vehicles amid the Trump administration's shift away from EV-friendly policy.

That shift threatens U.S. automakers' competitive edge in the coming years. As is, Tesla lost its crown as the world's bestselling electric vehicle maker last year, delivering only 1.64 million vehicles in 2025 to Chinese rival BYD's 2.26 million.

Trump administration policy slashing emissions rules at a time when Chinese companies are advancing quickly has experts worried for the future of American car manufacturers.

Chinese automakers will have to meet standards required for the Canadian auto market for the latest trade arrangement to be successful — standards that are similar to those in the U.S. — which is likely to incentivize Chinese auto manufacturing investment in Canada.

They'll also have to establish which segment of the market they are targeting there: Higher-end vehicles, or less-expensive ones that sell at higher volumes.

Regardless, “It brings it home to what is needed to compete globally,” said Mark Wakefield, global automotive market lead at AlixPartners. The firm predicts Chinese brands will account for 30% of the global market by 2030.

“They’ve already started in Europe. They started in South America. Now Mexico and Canada,"" Wakefield said. American carmakers ""don’t want to end up as a Brazil with your ethanol-based cars that aren’t sellable anywhere else in the world and ... like Britain or Australia that used to matter in the auto world, and no longer really matter.”

Why have others sought to regulate Chinese EV-makers’ expansion?

Countries have attempted to regulate Chinese EVs from entering their markets for several reasons.

“China has become this overwhelming machine making inexpensive vehicles. And the fear is that if you give them an inch, they’re going to take a mile,” Fiorani said. “The other issue is technology. These vehicles are data centers... and the idea that a state-owned company in China could have access to where a high portion of drivers are going gives them leverage for all kinds of outlets.”

The European Union hiked tariffs on Chinese EVs last year, though the two have been resolving that at the start of this year.

In 2024, former President Joe Biden set a 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars. Canada matched that import tax on the vehicles until this week. And even with an annual import cap, Canada cutting its tariffs this week means those companies are another step closer to U.S. soil. The Mexican auto market has welcomed Chinese EVs, with massive growth last year.

“The advance of Chinese manufacturers is inevitable. It will happen eventually. Everybody is negotiating to put up the roadblocks to figure out: What data is being processed, how much market share you’re going to allow Chinese manufacturers to have?"" Fiorani added.

""There are a lot of guardrails that have to be put up, but eventually they’re going to make their way into all Western markets.”

Expanding on this, Palmer says that these students have “different ways of engagement” and how they spend time.
To meet this moment, Muashsher also noted, “It’s not just about creating great products and great service.
Looking ahead, the panel emphasized the growing need to blend technical skills with human‑centered, transferable skills, especially as industry change accelerates.
With drivers keeping their cars longer and new demands emerging from e‑drive systems and advanced diagnostics, new skill sets will be essential.","Throughout the panel discussion, a consistent theme emerged: the importance of partnerships and the shared desire for what’s best for students. As skills rapidly evolve to prepare students for the jobs of the future, Sawyer stressed the importance of partnerships with employers to understand their needs, saying, “It’s our responsibility to put the programs together to help address those needs.”

Sawyer also mentioned the importance of partnerships with K-12 partners and universities because “for those skills that require advanced degrees, we need to provide a conduit to help those students move on to a successful university.”

When Valvoline launched its Aspiring Mechanics Program (AMP), Muashsher said the company relied on strong partnerships and meaningful connections to create immersive experiences and real‑world demonstrations. One specific example included Valvoline leveraging its partnership with Formula 1 and taking students from a school they work with in Mexico to the Mexico Grand Prix, where they connected with engineers and technicians to better understand career paths beyond their initial perceptions.

No matter if they’re in Mexico or back home in Michigan, there are different ways to engage K-12 students, according to the panel, and there is no single solution. Expanding on this, Palmer says that these students have “different ways of engagement” and how they spend time.

“We need to engage them not only when they’re right for making those decisions, but in ways that we are reaching them and engaging them in where they’re living on a day-to-day basis, whether that’s online or through social media, those types of things,” Palmer said.

The panel also touched on how some students question the value of the educational pipeline, often thinking it’s simply about getting a two- or four-year degree. However, Sawyer advocates for a broader range of postsecondary options, such as union skilled trades programs, emphasizing that, at the end of the day, “It’s about developing those skills and making them marketable.”

For K–12 students, it’s important to understand what all those options actually are, Palmer explains. Returning to the idea that many students receive most of their information through their phones, this can become a real advantage — an accessible way to reach them where they already are.

Still, because they can’t always rely on getting this guidance at home or from a counselor, Palmer said, “we have to be much more hands‑on in the weeds of it all,” by using those digital touchpoints to spark curiosity and ultimately encourage students to explore what’s happening inside the plants to then get them physically in the plants.

When managing the priorities of today’s talent landscape, Muashsher said that “we have to prioritize based on the impact that we can make.” He emphasized that partnerships operate as a two‑way street: one partner can share the feedback they need, enabling the other to provide the right resources for mutual success.

Many industry leaders recognize that the market is shifting. To meet this moment, Muashsher also noted, “It’s not just about creating great products and great service. It’s about giving back and getting involved in our own industry.”

For Valvoline, long-time collaboration with mechanics has kept these changes front and center, reinforcing the need to continually develop solutions and programs that meet technicians’ evolving needs. From the community college perspective, the challenge lies in innovation that doesn’t outpace practicality, according to Sawyer.

“We want to be on the cutting edge, not the bleeding edge,” Sawyer said. “We have to have opportunities for our students when they complete.” That means equipping learners with skills and tools that employers actually use, rather than experimental ones that may fade quickly.

To support this, Macomb Community College regularly meets with companies considering Macomb County, showing how strong partnerships help shape a responsive workforce pipeline.

Looking ahead, the panel emphasized the growing need to blend technical skills with human‑centered, transferable skills, especially as industry change accelerates. Muashsher also explained that vehicle maintenance services will shift rapidly. With drivers keeping their cars longer and new demands emerging from e‑drive systems and advanced diagnostics, new skill sets will be essential.

“What comes next is making sure we’re making the significant investments to give both the timely resources and the access to continue to enable the additional credentialing that’s going to be required to be successful,” Muashsher said.",https://michauto.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-Detroit-Auto-Show-feature_4.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 11:01:20.853381

The policy, announced by China’s finance ministry, will lower VAT export rebates from 9% to 6% starting April 2026 and phase them out entirely by January 1, 2027. This move has already impacted lithium prices and reshaped market sentiment. Here are five critical takeaways from this announcement, with insights from Reuters.

1. Lithium prices surge amid anticipation of higher demand

The announcement has caused a sharp increase in lithium prices, reflecting market expectations of higher near-term demand. On Monday, the most-active lithium carbonate contract on the Guangzhou Futures Exchange jumped 9%, closing at 156,060 yuan ($21,650) per metric ton; the highest level since November 2023. Reuters reported, “Lithium prices soared in China on Monday after Beijing said it would roll back value-added tax export rebates, as investors bet the move would spur front-loaded export demand.” Analysts believe this surge is driven by expectations of faster battery production and exports before the rebate rollback.

2. Short-term winners: Chinese battery giants

Chinese battery manufacturers like CATL and BYD are poised to benefit from the policy in the short term. The anticipated rush to export batteries before the rebates disappear could boost production volumes and revenues. Reuters highlighted that “investors and analysts expect exporters to accelerate overseas shipments ahead of the tax rollback.” CATL, the world’s largest battery producer, is already navigating supply chain disruptions, including the halt of production at its Jianxiawo mine. This policy shift provides an opportunity for Chinese manufacturers to capitalize on higher export demand. As Orient Securities noted, “The policy is expected to lift battery output in the near term, while underscoring Beijing’s longer-term push to curb excessive involution-style competition.”

3. Global lithium producers gain strategic importance

The VAT rollback is expected to tighten global battery economics, making non-Chinese lithium supply more valuable. Lithium producers such as Albemarle, Lithium Americas, and Rio Tinto stand to benefit from firmer price expectations and increased demand. Reuters reported that “stronger near-term battery output could boost lithium demand sentiment, while reduced subsidies over time make non-Chinese lithium supply more strategically valuable.” Albemarle, a leading lithium supplier, is expanding its conversion capacity to meet growing demand for battery-grade lithium. Lithium Americas’ Thacker Pass project in Nevada, which holds the largest known lithium resource in the U.S., is set to produce up to 40,000 tons of lithium carbonate annually. Rio Tinto’s acquisition of Arcadium Lithium further solidifies its position as a major player, with plans to produce over 200,000 tons of lithium carbonate equivalent per year by 2028.

4. EV makers face rising costs

According to Reuters and Zacks Investment Research, while miners and battery producers benefit, electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers reliant on Chinese batteries may face margin pressure. Tesla and Rivian are particularly vulnerable to rising battery costs. Reuters noted that EV makers reliant on Chinese batteries could face rising costs and margin pressure. Tesla, already grappling with slower EV demand growth and aggressive price competition, may see its cost structure strained further. Rivian, still scaling operations and working toward profitability, lacks Tesla’s scale and vertical integration, making it more sensitive to cost inflation. Higher battery costs could slow Rivian’s profitability trajectory and complicate execution, as analysts have pointed out.

5. Long-term industry implications

China’s policy shift signals a broader effort to curb overcapacity and promote rational pricing in the battery industry. While the short-term rush to export may create volatility, the eventual elimination of rebates could lead to more balanced competition globally. South Korean and Japanese battery manufacturers, long critical of Chinese subsidies, may regain market share in the US and Europe. Reduced subsidies are expected to push the industry toward more rational pricing and elevate the strategic importance of non-Chinese lithium supply, reshaping the global supply chain.

China’s decision to roll back VAT export rebates on lithium-ion batteries marks a pivotal moment for the global battery and lithium industries. While the short-term impact includes higher lithium prices and accelerated exports, the long-term implications could reshape competition and supply chains.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt95dab73c79c5d17e/696a8b357de2b34d982fa091/GettyImages-1426757565.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-17 06:57:51.700135

GenWealth expands

presence in Conway

Arkansas-based financial firm GenWealth Financial Advisors has moved into a 4,000-square-foot office on Markham Street in Conway, expanding its presence in the state's eighth-largest city, the financial advisor said Friday.

The addition is meant to serve the firm's growing client base and includes four meeting rooms and a conference room that will double the Conway team's meeting capacity.

The office space sits on what was formerly a vacant lot, according to Faulkner County property records. The land was bought by Capital Land Development LLC in 2025.

GenWealth said it will host a ribbon cutting ceremony for the new office on Jan. 20. The firm, which has locations in north Louisiana and central and western Arkansas, has had an office in Conway since 2020. The firm broke ground on a 6,000-square-foot office in Bryant in 2024.

The firm has 48 employees and serves over 4,500 clients with more than $1 billion in assets under management, according to the firm's website.

Scenarios for PJM Money Problems Versus Physical Problems As this issue unfurls in new or modified PJM rules, a few distinct futures could emerge.
When that generation eventually turns on, it bids into the PJM market with its construction costs already covered.
As is usually the case in PJM, when a major market intervention suppresses price signals for existing thermal assets, it drags existing renewables down with it.
Ultimately, this intervention privatizes the cost of reliability, a move that stands in sharp contrast to the unitary market design PJM has administered to date.","Earlier today, the White House National Energy Dominance Council and partnering agencies released a “Statement of Principles Regarding PJM.” These principles come out of “an agreement with governors across the Mid-Atlantic region to urge PJM to make electricity more affordable for residential customers and strengthen grid reliability by building more than $15 billion of reliable baseload power generation.”

The Statement of Principles outlines a radical departure from market norms as follows:

A new reliability backstop auction that will guarantee 15-year price certainty, a stark contrast to the market’s traditional short-term signals.

To protect ratepayers, the plan extends the existing price cap on existing generation for two more auctions, effectively freezing scarcity revenues for the legacy fleet.

Costs for the new plants will be allocated 100 percent to new data centers—“whether they show up and use the power or not”—unless they can prove they have self-procured capacity or have agreed to be curtailable.

The Trump administration explicitly directs PJM to bypass its own stakeholder process (“no further CIFP processes are necessary”) and mandates that interconnection studies be completed in “150 days or less.”

A proposal to auction 15-year generation contracts will do more than just fund new power plants. It will fundamentally alter who bears the risk of building out the American grid and keeping current power plants (thermal and non-thermal) open, creating a new, paradoxical reality for the technology sector: Participants are potentially “short” on power today, but “long” on liability tomorrow.

This shift moves regional transmission organizations (RTOs) into uncharted territory. RTO markets were designed to facilitate bilateral contracting and unitary pricing, not to host separate government-mandated procurements for a specific asset class. Whether that is the intent of the proposal, and what PJM files, is yet to be seen.

The policy implication is clear though: By carving out a dedicated market for certain loads while leaving the rest of the grid in the legacy auction, this proposal breaks the unitary market structure. On first read, the reality appears to be a hybrid: financially segregated but physically integrated. The data center might pay the mortgage (the 15-year contract), but the electrons flow into the shared grid. This distinction will be vital to understand the merits of the rules to come from PJM; it determines whether this intervention actually lowers prices for consumers—via a “denominator effect,” discussed below.

Scenarios for PJM Money Problems Versus Physical Problems

As this issue unfurls in new or modified PJM rules, a few distinct futures could emerge.

In one scenario, the definition of “eligibility” could dictate: By explicitly listing self-procured capacity and curtailment as the only off-ramps, these principles create an immediate, existential financial incentive for large loads to engineer their way out of the auction. Building your own plants could be a path out of the cost allocation; an exemption for “curtailable” load puts pressure on PJM to enact pathways to validate and count on that behavior for economics and reliability.

Critically, a 15-year contract could solve the money problem, but it does not fix the physical problem. While the principles mandate that interconnection studies be completed in “150 days or less,” industry insiders note that a memo cannot manufacture a transformer or staff a power study team overnight. This is a path for creating a financial instrument to pay for infrastructure that may still take years to physically connect.

Further, a structural risk looms in either scenario. Whether this commissioned generation is “siphoned” for large loads or allocated into the shared PJM loads pool, the influx of mandated supply—without a guaranteed match in net demand—creates a signal of artificial oversupply. Paradoxically, this could depress prices enough to motivate the retirement of the very baseload power the policy intends to preserve.

Denominator Effects for Consumer Electricity Rates

If the intent of the policy comes into being—the potential to protect residential retail ratepayers from steep increases due to data center demand—the proposed auction could operate like a capital injection: It forces data centers to cover the capital cost of these new plants upfront. When that generation eventually turns on, it bids into the PJM market with its construction costs already covered. It only needs to recover its fuel and operations. The result would be to inject massive amounts of supply that can bid at marginal cost. Assuming all other factors remain equal, this suppresses the wholesale price of energy for everyone.

Rates are assessed based on the costs of building, maintaining, and operating the grid. If some of those costs are already being absorbed by data center developers, then there is more power for everyone without increased costs, and rates can fall. This isn’t magic—it’s simply the math of the denominator effect (more energy hours to pay for a relatively fixed or new expense-insulated delivery infrastructure cost = lower rates for all impacted classes who can benefit).

This will not, however, fully insulate ratepayers. Increasing rates are not usually driven by the cost of adding generation. It’s the wires. If a utility builds a $50 million substation for a data center and spreads that cost to the legacy rate base, residential bills can rise despite low-cost generation. This is where state regulators must hold the line, with tariffs that require large data centers to pay demand charges covering specific infrastructure costs (including substations). Regulators can look to models like the Rappahannock Electric Cooperative’s Large Power-Dedicated Facilities tariff, which bills based on the installed capacity of the delivery infrastructure, and incentivize loads to build private firming solutions that bring flexibility to the utility. The incentive has an effect of derisking overbuild of the utility infrastructure The policy announcement today from the White House seems similar in intent: Pay for the power plant capital costs, whether the energy hours are used or not.

Considerations for Large Loads Asset Class Fracturing

Even if the new math of PJM protects the residential consumer, the pain within the technology sector is expected to be uneven, as will the pain to be distributed between legacy generation assets (thermal and renewable) and new construction under contract. This is largely true of existing proposals in PJM’s stakeholder processes: at least one such proposal posits market-oriented reforms consisting of a reliability backstop mechanism with multiyear price certainty (from Amazon, Calpine, Constellation, Google, Microsoft, Talen).

Early reactions to the announcements portend that this approach—a contract-specific auction—effectively has the economic impact of fracturing the electricity ratepayer asset class into at least three tiers while at least solving some of the problems of bringing enough capacity into the market to support gigawatts of load. Impacts on these classes, at least from the principles released today, also depend on the work that states will do to effectuate load-serving entity cost allocation.

Residential customers could remain shielded, provided state regulators enforce the strict tariffs described above and other theoretical wins become reality, including distributed energy and grid utilization programs that support lowering the average cost of utility operations. They get the increased reliability of a robust grid without the increased costs. Tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon are the “long capital” class. They are the most likely candidates who could possess the balance sheets to absorb a 15-year infrastructure liability, and if the rules of such a program or other PJM programs going forward allow it, the engineering depth to execute complex private firm delivery strategies needed to opt out (they can hedge the risk or pass it downstream).

The likely casualties of this new regime may include specialized infrastructure providers, co-location firms, and conventional industrial loads that lack the balance sheet of a hyperscaler. The administration’s Statement of Principles explicitly demands that new loads provide “credit/collateral support” to be counted, a hurdle that favors the giants. Often locked into fixed-price contracts with tenants, these “middle-class” providers lack the credit depth to absorb a 15-year liability and the physical footprint to execute the “self-procure or curtail” opt-outs envisioned by the new rules. For them, the choice between a massive balance sheet liability and a regulatory blockade represents an existential margin squeeze.

The other likely casualty to insure against, is price signals for existing PJM generators, and their contracted status with loads that cannot benefit from the new policy. The principles document extends the existing price collar for two more auctions, effectively capping scarcity revenues for the legacy fleet just as reliability value is rising. Perhaps most concerning to existing resources is a future where existing generators face a “dumping” risk. If the 7.5 GW of new mandated capacity is built but not fully utilized by data centers, that excess power flows onto the grid at zero marginal cost. This artificial oversupply creates a price-suppressive signal that could ironically force the retirement of the very baseload units the policy claims to value. As is usually the case in PJM, when a major market intervention suppresses price signals for existing thermal assets, it drags existing renewables down with it. By capping capacity revenues and potentially flooding the energy market with subsidized “must-run” baseload, the policy erodes the investment case for all legacy generation, not just the coal and gas plants it aims to protect.

Ultimately, this intervention privatizes the cost of reliability, a move that stands in sharp contrast to the unitary market design PJM has administered to date. While the principles document calls for a future “Return to Market Fundamentals” by 2027, the precedent from the proposed approach is one in which reliability procurement is no longer for and from a shared pool of buyers and sellers; PJM’s work over the next several months will be to develop a segmented product that is effectively procured by multi-state mandate and billed to specific asset classes. Market stakeholders invested in future-proofing retail and wholesale power deliverability solutions should find themselves even more invested than before in innovating solutions for their large and small customers.

So why are Chinese EVs such a threat to U.S. automakers and others?
Much of the global auto market is electrifying, an ideal opportunity for advanced Chinese automakers to capitalize on.

That has had competitors concerned even before Canada this week agreed to cut its tariffs on Chinese EVs in exchange for concessions on Canadian farm products.

Experts now say an easier path into Canada could be a big boost for Chinese carmakers looking to dominate the global market — particularly as their domestic market weakens. That poses a threat to other auto manufacturers, particularly American companies.

U.S. officials acknowledged that in remarks at an assembly plant for Jeep-maker Stellantis in Toledo, Ohio on Friday. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the Chinese Communist Party invests in its auto industry to “control this industry.”

“Why? They want to take over the auto industry. They want to take away these jobs,” Duffy said. As far as the Canadian trade deal, he added: “They will live to regret the day they partner with China and bring in their vehicles.”

Others say the shift is inevitable.

“This is telling us that Chinese automakers continue to be really popular, and are doing better and better, and not just something that’s sold in global markets that are more marginal or less important to U.S. automakers,” said Ilaria Mazzocco, deputy director and senior fellow with the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

What makes Chinese vehicles stand out?

Chinese-made vehicles are high-quality, stylish and inexpensive, experts say.

“It’s clear that the vehicles made by Chinese brands come at a very competitive cost, but are also technologically quite desirable,” Mazzocco said. “They tend to be connected vehicles, so they have a lot of additional software capabilities that consumers seem to like. But the price point and the competitiveness are really big selling points.”

These vehicles can cost as little as $10,000 to $20,000; in the U.S., new vehicles are running close to $50,000 on average, and EVs even more so.

Chinese companies also have unique advantages as far as auto manufacturing and production, efficiency and making vehicles lighter, which helps extend an electrified vehicle’s driving range.

“They’ve found a way to make small and mid-sized cars — cars that people want — at a reasonable price,” said Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “These are the segments where GM and Ford and almost everybody else have abandoned.”

Many automakers have discontinued smaller vehicles in favor of higher-margin, large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that are far more profitable.

So why are Chinese EVs such a threat to U.S. automakers and others?

Much of the global auto market is electrifying, an ideal opportunity for advanced Chinese automakers to capitalize on. China saw 17% growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles in 2025, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week, and Europe saw a 33% increase.

Meanwhile, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1% last year. As the rest of the world advances, U.S. automakers have weakened their once-ambitious, multibillion dollar electrification plans, instead opting for more efficient hybrid electric and gasoline vehicles amid the Trump administration’s shift away from EV-friendly policy.

That shift threatens U.S. automakers’ competitive edge in the coming years. As is, Tesla lost its crown as the world’s bestselling electric vehicle maker last year, delivering only 1.64 million vehicles in 2025 to Chinese rival BYD’s 2.26 million.

Trump administration policy slashing emissions rules at a time when Chinese companies are advancing quickly has experts worried for the future of American car manufacturers.

Chinese automakers will have to meet standards required for the Canadian auto market for the latest trade arrangement to be successful — standards that are similar to those in the U.S. — which is likely to incentivize Chinese auto manufacturing investment in Canada.

They’ll also have to establish which segment of the market they are targeting there: Higher-end vehicles, or less-expensive ones that sell at higher volumes.

Regardless, “It brings it home to what is needed to compete globally,” said Mark Wakefield, global automotive market lead at AlixPartners. The firm predicts Chinese brands will account for 30% of the global market by 2030.

“They’ve already started in Europe. They started in South America. Now Mexico and Canada,” Wakefield said. American carmakers “don’t want to end up as a Brazil with your ethanol-based cars that aren’t sellable anywhere else in the world and … like Britain or Australia that used to matter in the auto world, and no longer really matter.”

Why have others sought to regulate Chinese EV-makers’ expansion?

Countries have attempted to regulate Chinese EVs from entering their markets for several reasons.

“China has become this overwhelming machine making inexpensive vehicles. And the fear is that if you give them an inch, they’re going to take a mile,” Fiorani said. “The other issue is technology. These vehicles are data centers… and the idea that a state-owned company in China could have access to where a high portion of drivers are going gives them leverage for all kinds of outlets.”

The European Union hiked tariffs on Chinese EVs last year, though the two have been resolving that at the start of this year.

In 2024, former President Joe Biden set a 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars. Canada matched that import tax on the vehicles until this week. And even with an annual import cap, Canada cutting its tariffs this week means those companies are another step closer to U.S. soil. The Mexican auto market has welcomed Chinese EVs, with massive growth last year.

“The advance of Chinese manufacturers is inevitable. It will happen eventually. Everybody is negotiating to put up the roadblocks to figure out: What data is being processed, how much market share you’re going to allow Chinese manufacturers to have?” Fiorani added.

“There are a lot of guardrails that have to be put up, but eventually they’re going to make their way into all Western markets.”

The policy reverses a 100% additional duty imposed in 2024 and restores tariff levels that existed before bilateral trade frictions, lowering costs for consumers while reopening the door to industrial cooperation with China.

Speaking at a China–Canada trade event in Beijing, Carney said the quota would expand over time and would deliver tangible benefits to Canadians. He said cooperation with China was essential if Canada wanted to build a competitive domestic electric vehicle industry and secure resilient supply chains.

The previous tariff regime was introduced in August 2024 under former prime minister Justin Trudeau, when Canada imposed a 100% duty on Chinese EVs and a 25% tariff on Chinese steel and aluminum. Those measures took effect on October 1, 2024, and were closely aligned with U.S. trade policy at the time.

China responded by launching an anti-discrimination investigation and imposing countermeasures on Canadian agricultural products, including canola, contributing to a sharp deterioration in bilateral relations.

Under the revised framework, Chinese EVs imported within the 49,000-unit quota will face a 6.1% MFN tariff. The government did not specify the tariff rate for imports exceeding the quota or the precise implementation date, though the quota is expected to grow annually.

China exported 41,678 electric vehicles to Canada in 2023, with more than 80% produced at Tesla’s Shanghai plant. Carney said replacing blanket tariffs with a quota system would reduce vehicle purchase costs and allow bilateral cooperation to resume.

He described China as a global leader in electric vehicles, citing cost efficiency, energy performance, and innovation. He said Canada must learn from China’s experience and collaborate on supply chains rather than rely on trade barriers.

During meetings on January 16, leaders from both countries reaffirmed the principles guiding China–Canada relations. Canada reiterated its commitment to the one-China policy, and both sides pledged to provide fair and open business environments for companies.

The two governments endorsed the China–Canada Economic and Trade Cooperation Roadmap and agreed to advance cooperation through existing trade mechanisms. Energy cooperation featured prominently, with agreements to deepen collaboration in clean energy while expanding ties in oil and natural gas development.

Carney said the revised trade framework could attract large-scale Chinese investment into Canada’s automotive and energy sectors over the next three years, supporting job creation and Canada’s transition toward net-zero emissions.

Agriculture was another focus. Carney said China is expected to reduce tariffs on Canadian canola to about 15% by March 2026 and lift countermeasures on canola meal, lobster, crab, and peas from March through at least year-end. He said the changes could unlock nearly USD 3 billion in export opportunities.

He also said China would introduce visa-free entry for Canadian citizens, though this had not been formally confirmed by Chinese authorities at the time.

Addressing geopolitical questions, Carney said Canada and China still had differences but had established a more predictable and stable dialogue. He said recent engagement with China had delivered clearer economic outcomes, even as Canada maintained a broader relationship with the United States.

Canadian officials accompanying Carney signed agreements covering oil, natural gas, uranium, and renewable energy technologies, and held discussions with Chinese battery manufacturer CATL, which has already participated in multiple grid-scale energy storage projects in Ontario.

Industry Minister Mélanie Joly said Canada remained open to Chinese investment in renewable energy and battery manufacturing, including the possibility of local EV battery production.

The visit can be described as a political reset that signals intent rather than immediate economic gains, leaving open how quickly trade and investment flows will recover under Canada’s new China policy.",https://d4lckxzvtz1ll.cloudfront.net/XPENG%20MONA%20M03%20V4-1768613334098.webp,N,,2026-01-17 06:57:58.429362

That price cap has saved consumers in the PJM grid over $18 billion already.
And in our productive work with them, I was insistent that an extension of our price cap be included in this statement of principles we’re signing today.
As a result, we’re going to save consumers in the PJM grid – 65 million Americans – an additional $27 billion over the next several years.
Pennsylvania is the second largest energy producer in the entire country, and I’m an all-of-the-above energy Governor.","Washington, D.C. – Today, Governor Josh Shapiro signed a Statement of Principles alongside a bipartisan group of PJM governors, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum to extend Pennsylvania’s PJM price cap and protect consumers from rising electricity costs.

The agreement advances reforms to build more energy faster while keeping costs down and extends the price cap Governor Shapiro secured after suing PJM for two additional capacity auctions — a move expected to save consumers up to $27 billion and prevent price hikes across 13 states.

Governor Shapiro has led the push for PJM reform for more than two years, taking action when PJM failed to act and delivering consumer protections that are now shaping the national response.

See below for Governor Shapiro’s remarks as prepared for delivery:

Thank you, Secretary Burgum and Secretary Wright, for hosting us here today.

And thank you to my fellow Governors – Governors Moore and Youngkin – for your partnership in working to reform PJM and force them to cancel dramatic energy hikes over the past three years.

I’m glad that Governors on a bipartisan basis are leading the way and getting stuff done – because our collective work helped spur this action by the federal government.

Look, I hear it everyday: hardworking folks across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania are worried about rising costs right now. I know my colleagues hear it too.

Trips to the grocery store and visits to the doctor cost more these days – and too many families and small businesses are struggling to make ends meet.

In Pennsylvania, we are laser focused on cutting costs – that’s why we’ve cut taxes seven times since I’ve been Governor.

And I’ve worked hard to make sure families have peace of mind knowing that they can afford to keep the lights on at home – and that we have reliable, affordable power when they go to flip that light switch.

Unfortunately, PJM has been too slow to let new generation onto the grid at a time when demand for energy is going up.

That’s led to dramatically increasing prices in PJM’s capacity auctions year after year – which means higher energy bills for consumers.

That’s unacceptable.

And, as we are showing here today, it doesn’t have to be this way.

18 months ago, when I learned PJM’s proposed prices for the next capacity auction would be the highest ever, I immediately objected.

I spent months working behind the scenes with PJM leaders to try and find a different path forward – one that spared ratepayers unnecessary rate hikes and did more to bring new power plants online faster.

PJM refused to budge and so when we couldn’t come to an agreement, I sued them with the backing of my colleagues.

Because of that lawsuit, we reached an agreement with PJM that staved off the kind of price increases they were talking about and instituted a 2-year price cap.

That price cap has saved consumers in the PJM grid over $18 billion already.

And in our productive work with them, I was insistent that an extension of our price cap be included in this statement of principles we’re signing today.

As a result, we’re going to save consumers in the PJM grid – 65 million Americans – an additional $27 billion over the next several years.

Now, I want to be very clear, even as we work to protect consumers, I also know that we need to bring more affordable power online. More power means more freedom and more opportunity.

We can do that by working with large data center developers – like Amazon, who I stood with last summer to announce the largest private sector investment in Pennsylvania – and protecting our consumers.

I think it can be a both/and – not just either/or.

We’ve sped up permitting to get big energy projects off the ground in Pennsylvania.

I’ve pushed PJM to do their part and expedite the interconnection of these new sources of energy – including the Crane Clean Energy Center, which will be ready to connect to the grid a year earlier than originally expected because of our work.

But we need more generation, and these principles will help get more energy on the grid.

Pennsylvania is the second largest energy producer in the entire country, and I’m an all-of-the-above energy Governor.

We need more energy on the grid – and we need it fast.

In Pennsylvania, I’ve launched the Lightning Plan to build more power in the Commonwealth, connect producers to the grid faster, create good-paying jobs, and prevent price hikes.

The statement of principles we’re about to sign today complements that work – and I’m grateful to my fellow Governors, who have been leading the way on energy affordability for years.

I’m glad the White House has joined us in this fight to push PJM to lower costs for consumers and deliver reliable, affordable energy for all.

Thank you.

Virginia, home to the largest concentration of data centers in the world, is actively debating additional transparency and infrastructure safeguards.","As we work in this legislative session, my focus is on advancing responsible, forward-thinking and strategic legislation that puts Hoosiers first. Indiana must strike the right balance between economic development, revenue growth, transparency and the long-term needs of our communities. Our state’s economic interests are not one-size-fits-all. Every region has its own priorities, challenges and vision for the future, and state policy should reflect that reality.

One of the most pressing issues facing communities across Indiana is the rapid interest in data center development. Whether Hoosiers support or oppose these projects, it is clear the Legislature must lead. Without clear guidance from the state, local governments are being forced to make complex decisions on their own. That has resulted in inconsistent processes, confusion and growing concerns from residents who want answers about water use, energy demands and long-term impacts on their communities.

I am working to develop a standardized, statewide framework for evaluating data center projects. That framework must guarantee safe, drinkable water, protect local water supplies and ensure that increased energy demand does not raise monthly utility bills for residential customers. Data centers can use millions of gallons of water and consume as much electricity as small cities, which makes thoughtful oversight essential.

At the federal level, there is currently no comprehensive framework governing data center development. Oversight is limited to broad environmental laws and permitting processes that were never designed to address the scale of water use and energy demand these facilities create. As a result, states across the country are stepping in to fill the gap.

California and Connecticut now require disclosure of water and energy use before projects move forward. Minnesota and Arizona have tightened water permitting for large industrial users, particularly in regions facing supply constraints. Virginia, home to the largest concentration of data centers in the world, is actively debating additional transparency and infrastructure safeguards. Indiana should learn from these efforts and lead with a clear, consistent approach rather than leaving communities to navigate uncertainty on their own.

Hoosiers are paying attention and want their voices heard. That is why transparency must be a cornerstone of this effort. I strongly believe that requiring public hearings once plans are ready to be shared gives communities a seat at the table and ensures concerns are heard and addressed.

Handled correctly, this approach can strengthen Indiana’s economy, protect our resources and position our state as a national leader. We cannot afford to think short term. This is our moment to act responsibly and put Hoosiers first.•

Today, Democratic governors from Pennsylvania, Delaware, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Maryland signed onto a deal to ensure PJM takes measures that ensure Big Tech is paying their fair share for their massive power usage.

The nation’s largest grid operator, PJM, has been in the process of creating a plan to confront the massive amount of demand brought to the region by Big Tech’s data centers. In December 2025, Sierra Club sent a letter urging PJM’s board members to adopt a plan that protects its 67 million customers from more exorbitant bills, and from potential financial liability if a data center fails to pay for its fair share. Many elements of what the Sierra Club and allies have been pushing for were reflected in the deal made today.

The Democratic Governors’ deal comes at an auspicious time, as PJM is expected to submit an update on their Critical Issue Fast Pass (Large Load Addition) policy development process to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Tuesday, January 20. Despite numerous attacks on low-cost energy by the current federal administration, including illegal cancellation of completed energy generation projects, and announcing a sham energy emergency that has been used to extend the operation of some of the most expensive coal-burning plants in the country, a coalition of bipartisan governors in the PJM have continued to participate in difficult dialogue and champion a meaningful set of solutions to address affordability.

“The Sierra Club has been on the frontlines fighting for PJM’s customers to get a fair deal on their electricity bills and urging the regional operator to adopt meaningful policy,” said Sierra Club Senior Advisor Jessi Eidbo. “We have been working continuously with lawmakers, advocates, and PJM, to ensure that our communities aren’t forced to pay Microsoft or Meta or any Big Tech company’s power bills. While the grid operator has been dragging their feet to adopt measures to address exponentially increasing electric demand from large loads like data centers, the continued leadership and activity from these governors is a positive sign that a meaningful solution could be on the horizon.

“We are glad to see this deal come to fruition, but we know that this is just the first step to the future that we have been pushing for. We will continue to advocate on behalf of the 67 million people who depend on PJM to keep the lights on, and ensure that fairness and reliability continue to be at the forefront of PJM’s work to serve its customers.”

Elements of the agreement include an extension of the PJM price cap that Democratic governors, including Pennsylvania’s Shapiro, fought to put in place during the 2025/2026 capacity auctions to protect customers from record-breaking high auction results at PJM.

However, other provisions proposed in the deal are still being discussed, like an expedited interconnection for data center generation, which raise concerns. As the specifics are hammered out, the Sierra Club will continue to advocate for expansion of low-cost generation assets to meaningfully address rising costs of electricity, which we understand to unequivocally be wind, solar, battery storage, and geothermal.

“The specifics of the deal will ultimately determine the extent to which consumers are meaningfully protected from electricity costs from large industrial users, but we are heartened by the continued leadership of strong governors throughout the PJM region who see the urgency of sound data center policy, and are willing to negotiate with non-traditional allies to develop solutions,” continues Jessi Eidbo.

However, for states that want to move faster, there are meaningful steps that can be taken right now to address rising electricity costs from large load users. States can establish large-load tariffs that offer favorable treatment for large loads that are willing to be reliably flexible for a small number of hours during the year, to prevent spikes in demand that then set the ceiling for price auctions.

AVON LAKE, Ohio, Jan 16 (Reuters) - U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the Canadian government's decision to allow ​in up to 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles at a low ‌tariff rate is ""problematic"" and that Canada may come to regret the decision.

“If there’s one thing I believe, it’s this: Go big or go home,” Hochul said of the nuclear plans.
“We’ve seen a lot of movement to clear the way for nuclear power plant development.
Senator Rachel May said she was “not a fan, but I understand why she’s doing it, I guess.” Even some Republicans, who tend to prefer nuclear energy to renewables, are wary.
Like so many debates in New York energy policy today, the nuclear fight will likely be won by the side that convinces the public it represents affordability.","If 2025 was the year Gov. Kathy Hochul embraced “abundance” as the solution to New York’s woes — above all, the rising cost of living — 2026 is her year to show that she was just getting started.

That is, at least, what Hochul vowed in her State of the State address on Tuesday, putting the promise to “build, build, build” at the center of her agenda. And it is increasingly her answer to the conundrum facing New York’s energy system: how to keep the lights on while meeting growing demand for electricity, keeping utility bills in check and fighting climate change.

Nowhere is this clearer than with nuclear energy, which she’s making her signature energy policy as she seeks reelection. On Tuesday, the governor announced efforts to build four gigawatts’ worth of new reactors in the state. Combined with the one gigawatt she tasked the state power authority with building last year, that would be slightly more than the entire United States has built in the last three decades, and rival the total amount New York has ever built.

“If there’s one thing I believe, it’s this: Go big or go home,” Hochul said of the nuclear plans.

In her accompanying policy book, Hochul outlined a number of other proposals to curb energy bills and clean up the grid, but none come close to matching her ambitions for the nuclear buildout. She did not mention any new funding for climate initiatives — whether rebooting cap and invest, as many green groups are still calling for, or renewing the $1 billion climate action fund she introduced last year. (Asked about additional climate funding, spokesperson Ken Lovett said only that “the governor will be outlining her budget next week.”) Hochul likewise kept mum about whether or how she might seek to amend the climate law, as she suggested she wanted to last fall, after a judge ruled her administration was breaking it by failing to issue rules to cut emissions. She could still attempt such a maneuver in the state budget; she’s due to present her first draft of it in less than a week.

Instead, she proposed a wide range of less flashy items: an additional $50 million for the Empower energy efficiency program, which, along with a separate funding boost announced in December, will help rescue the program from drastic cuts; a package of reforms aimed at reining in utility rate hikes; customer incentives to participate in programs that reduce strain on the grid; and a sales tax exemption for electric vehicle charging stations, among others.

She also proposed a measure to help schools add more solar energy and create “cooler schoolyards,” apparently in line with New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s plans to green hundreds of city schools. And she vowed to make data centers “pay their fair share” for grid upgrades so that, the policy book says, “every-day New Yorkers do not subsidize” the industry.

The data center proposal could be an island of bipartisan consensus in what promises to be another year of bruising climate fights. The policy echoes calls from green groups as well as from a growing number of Republicans across the country, as artificial intelligence and its colossal demands on the grid face a mounting popular backlash.

But Liz Moran, New York policy advocate at the environmental law group Earthjustice, warned that much depends on the details: Will Hochul stipulate, for example, that data centers be required to provide their own clean power? Or will they be allowed to rely on gas?

Few climate advocates are in the mood to give Hochul the benefit of the doubt. Still fuming from Hochul’s repeated backtracking on climate policies last year — including her approval of a thrice-rejected gas pipeline after talks with President Donald Trump — they largely panned her agenda as insufficient, if not a betrayal of New York’s climate mandates.

“Under Gov. Hochul’s watch, New York has shifted from being a national climate leader to a state where the fossil fuel industry status quo holds New Yorkers hostage,” said Stephan Edel, executive director of the ny Renews coalition, in a statement.

Dozens of environmentalists rallied outside the entrance to Albany’s Egg theater before Hochul’s speech, denouncing the pipeline decision and her leap to nuclear power while the state continues to lag on building solar, wind, and batteries.

The renewable energy industry is striking a more bullish tone. Marguerite Wells, executive director of the trade group Alliance for Clean Energy New York, said Hochul’s proposals to cut red tape for housing and infrastructure — notably by reforming the 50-year-old State Environmental Quality Review Act — could pay dividends for clean energy, too.

“We’ve seen a lot of movement to clear the way for nuclear power plant development. We need equal movement for renewables,” Wells said in a statement. “New Yorkers need affordable electrons now, not in the decade-plus it will take until new nuclear could be operational.”

State officials insist the two go hand in hand. “We see nuclear as essential toward meeting the future energy needs in a way that pairs well with our existing renewable energy ambitions,” Public Service Commission Chair Rory Christian told New York Focus on Tuesday.

The state energy plan published in December envisions New York building at least two to three gigawatts’ worth of new nuclear alongside roughly 40 gigawatts of solar and wind by 2040.

Many Democratic lawmakers are lukewarm on Hochul’s nuclear plan. State Senate energy committee chair Kevin Parker said it was “not the optimal answer” to rising demand and prices. Senate environment committee chair Pete Harckham said he was “not wild” about the proposal. Senator Rachel May said she was “not a fan, but I understand why she’s doing it, I guess.”

Even some Republicans, who tend to prefer nuclear energy to renewables, are wary. “The benefits [Hochul] promises from her energy policies are years away, while families are struggling to afford their utility bills today,” said Assemblymember Matt Simpson in a statement.

Like so many debates in New York energy policy today, the nuclear fight will likely be won by the side that convinces the public it represents affordability. The pro-renewable Public Power New York this week blasted Hochul’s agenda as an “anti-affordability plan that will send already unaffordable utility bills skyrocketing,” citing a new analysis from a University of Pennsylvania researcher.

nyserda President Doreen Harris countered that, according to state modeling, even five gigawatts of new nuclear “was still a more affordable option than some of the alternatives” when considering the reliability of the grid overall.

Christian, the Public Service Commission chair, said he sees New York’s history of building massive hydroelectric dams as a roadmap. More than half a century later, those dams still provide some of the cheapest electricity in the country.

“New York has a history of going big and making those big investments pay off in the long run,” he said. “This is no different.”",https://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.adirondackdailyenterprise.com/images/2017/04/17105339/Untitled-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 00:58:27.791023

Carney also met senior executives from prominent Chinese businesses, including an EV battery maker and an energy giant.
The prime minister has repeatedly said he wants to reduce barriers to trade with Asia and Europe as a self-protection mechanism, and to take away “the cards” the U.S. holds against Ottawa in negotiations on economic matters and other issues.
On Friday, Carney said his new deal with China would unlock nearly $3 billion in export orders for Canadian farmers, fish harvesters, and processors.
Partnerships for natural gas exports were announced as well.","“This is a return to levels prior to recent trade frictions, but under an agreement that promises much more for Canadians,” Carney told reporters, referencing Beijing’s commitment to reduce the tariff on imports of Canadian canola seed from an 85% rate to 15% by March 1, and ensure visa-free access for Canadians travelling to China.

Carney made the remarks after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing, notably marking the first visit to China by a Canadian leader in nearly a decade. Carney also met senior executives from prominent Chinese businesses, including an EV battery maker and an energy giant. He made several agreements on energy and trade cooperation, which he said were designed to help Canada “build its own competitive EV sector,” by following opportunities to “learn from innovative partners, access their supply chains, and increase local demand.”

Strengthening ties with Asia and Europe is a critical piece of Carney’s strategy to wean Canada from dependence on the U.S. and shield itself from the weight of Washington’s tariffs. The prime minister has repeatedly said he wants to reduce barriers to trade with Asia and Europe as a self-protection mechanism, and to take away “the cards” the U.S. holds against Ottawa in negotiations on economic matters and other issues.

“Getting rid of barriers east, west … You know that alone, if it’s fully done — we’ve done the federal part — but if all our provinces reduce their barriers, the estimates are that is a bigger return to the Canadian economy than the worst case trade outcome with the U.S.,” he said during September 2025 remarks at a Council on Foreign Relations conference.

“Who has all the cards? There are other games. There’s not just one game,” the prime minister warned during an interview with the Economist the following month, referencing an analogy President Donald Trump has used regarding foreign relations. “That’s the point. There are other games, and yes, we’re going to spend more time, to extend the analogy, in the game with the United States, but we’re going to play other games with other players.”

TRUMP TELLS SUPREME COURT STRIKING DOWN TARIFFS WOULD ‘DISARM’ HIM ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE

“Part of the reason why countries end up in, quote, ‘having’ to do one or negotiating from the position they’re in is their degree of dependence on the United States. So the logical thing … is, well, we should take care of ourselves, do the stuff at home, and we should build up relationships abroad … really focusing on building up that outside option,” he added.

On Friday, Carney said his new deal with China would unlock nearly $3 billion in export orders for Canadian farmers, fish harvesters, and processors. Partnerships for natural gas exports were announced as well. Carney promised the Canadian production of 50 million annual metric tonnes of liquefied natural gas destined for Asian markets by 2030, said Canada will double its energy grid over the next 15 years, and expressed confidence in opportunities for Chinese partnership on offshore wind investments.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26016117181906.jpg?resize=1200,683",N,,2026-01-17 00:58:43.445276

A 25% surge in LNG purchases by European countries was a key highlight and raised hopes among gas sellers that further growth in gas use in economies such as Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom is in store for 2026 and beyond.

On the other hand, lower imports by three of the five largest LNG buyers – all in Asia – have raised profit concerns, especially among exporters banking on selling the even greater volumes of LNG expected to hit the market this year.

As 2026 gets underway, here are some of the growth markets and soft spots that will be closely eyed by the LNG sector.

EUROPE’S STAYING POWER

The steep climbs in LNG purchases by several European countries in 2025 beg the question whether the region can sustain such a voracious appetite.

On the plus side, Europe’s generation of electricity from gas-fired power plants posted its first annual rise last year since before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine snarled regional gas flows in 2022.

Total European gas-fired electricity output during January to November was 1,009 terawatt hours (TWh), according to think tank Ember, up 3.4% from the same months in 2024 and the first year-over-year increase for that period since 2021.

Further increases in gas-fired power generation will obviously trigger further LNG import demand, especially in markets with shortages of alternative power sources.

Europe’s broader industrial economy, however, remains hobbled by weak manufacturing and consumer demand, and output among gas-intensive sectors such as chemicals and fertilizers remains near historic lows in top regional producer Germany.

Until a synchronised upturn in consumer and business activity takes root, it’s likely that Europe’s overall demand for natural gas may remain patchy, which may cap any further increases in LNG import interest over the near term.

Another question for LNG exporters is whether Europe’s LNG purchases in 2025 were artificially inflated as several countries attempted to narrow their trade gaps with the United States during trade talks with the Trump administration.

European imports of LNG from the U.S. last year jumped by close to 60% from 2024 levels, data from commodities intelligence firm Kpler shows.

That outsized jump in U.S. purchases – well above the increase in Europe’s total LNG imports – suggests the region may have been trying to curry favour with President Donald Trump as European and U.S. policymakers discussed trade deals.

With international focus now turning more to geopolitical concerns – such as the U.S. interest in acquiring Greenland – it is possible that European countries may prove less keen to please President Trump in 2026.

If that’s the case, volumes of U.S. LNG imports aimed at reducing trade deficits in 2025 may get curbed in 2026.

ASIA’S PLATEAU?

LNG exporters also have questions about the state of demand in Asia, which accounted for around 64% of all LNG imports last year, data from Kpler shows.

Total shipments to Asian buyers last year were just over 613 million cubic meters, marking a nearly 5% fall from 2024.

While a 5% volume slip was not much of a concern through 2025 given the steep growth in sales to Europe, LNG exporters will be anxious if Asia’s overall appetite remains weak this year and Europe’s buying pace also slows.

The top two overall LNG importers – China and Japan – registered LNG import cuts of 15% and 2% respectively in 2025.

The synchronized dip in imports by such critical markets will remain a cause for concern in 2026, especially if China’s economy remains sluggish and trade relations with the United States and other markets remain chilled.

Rapidly expanding renewables power generation in China and steadily recovering nuclear power generation in Japan are further causes for concern as those power sources squeeze gas out of generation mixes.

LNG purchases by number four importer – India – also dropped by 7% last year, yet another source of worry among LNG exporters who had hoped India would be a steady growth market.

Higher global gas prices have resulted in a steady decline in gas-fired electricity generation in India so far this decade, bringing as well a sharp slowdown in spending on gas distribution and storage infrastructure.

Bullish forecasters argue the steady swell in planned LNG exports will drive global prices lower and reignite demand for the fuel in fast-growing but cost-sensitive economies like India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

They may be right, but with benchmark natural gas prices near three-year highs and rising in the United States – the top global gas producer – it may be hard for LNG exporters to drive sale prices lower over the near term.

That may leave LNG exporters in 2026 focusing on already established markets, struggling in Europe to grow sales much from last year’s levels and hampered in Asia by patchy demand as China’s economy struggles for growth.

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.

Our results show that the firms located further away from environmental agencies release more SO2 (β = 0.102, p < 0.01) than those close to those environmental agencies. Subsequent investigations reveal that geographic distance has a positive correlation with the short-term performance of firms (total production value and fixed investment) but a negative correlation with firms’ long-term performance (green innovation, technological updates and clean energy use). Heterogeneous checks show that the influence of geographic distance on SO2 emissions is mainly found in non-local firms, suggesting a possibility of collusion between proximate firms and local government. This study highlights how the firm-agency distance relation affects pollution emissions and suggests that policymakers should consider more efficient instruments for environmental management.",https://covers.tandf.co.uk/og/RSGJ.png,N,,2026-01-17 01:56:59.379278

Hybrids as a solution to EV sales growth

EVs are seen as a crucial climate solution. In the U.S., transportation accounts for the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, and switching to electric vehicles cuts those emissions and reduces air pollution.

Notice of Intent to Revise the State Implementation Plan for Air Quality:

Attainment Demonstration for the 2008 Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)

Contingency Measures and Motor Vehicle Emissions Budgets

The Commissioner of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) hereby gives notice of intent to revise the State Implementation Plan (SIP) to comply with the 2008 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for Ozone. This plan revision is necessary to fulfill the requirements under sections 172 and 182(d) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) for severe nonattainment areas. This revision addresses the attainment demonstration for Connecticut’s Southwest Connecticut nonattainment area, which is part of the New York- Northern New Jersey- Long Island (NY-NJ-CT) Nonattainment Area and includes Fairfield, New Haven, and Middlesex Counties. While the full impact on future year ozone levels associated with deregulatory efforts by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are yet to be determined, DEEP concludes, based on the photochemical grid modeling previously conducted by EPA in 2023, which took into account then currently adopted emissions control programs, that Southwest Connecticut may plausibly attain the 2008 ozone NAAQS by the July 20, 2027, attainment date.

This SIP revision also includes motor vehicle emissions budgets (MVEBs) for Southwest Connecticut.

As required under CAA section 172(c)(9), the SIP revision must include contingency measures to take effect upon a finding of failure to attain the ozone NAAQS by the attainment date. DEEP proposes to reduce MVEBs as contingency in the event of a finding of failure to attain the 2008 NAAQS by the severe attainment date of July 20, 2027. As described in the SIP, the MVEBs proposed for attainment in Table 1 will, after July 20, 2027, be reduced to the levels in Table 2 if the area fails to attain the standard by the attainment date. The levels in Table 2 provide one year’s worth (OYW) of progress toward attainment and results in additional reductions of 1.8 tons/day and 1.9 tons/day of nitrogen oxide (NOx) and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, respectively. Upon a finding of failure to attain, the budgets in Table 2 would take effect without further comment.

Safer Drinking Water

A Healthier San Joaquin River

Safer Drinking Water

Access to safe drinking water is a major challenge for small communities. In 2012, EPA and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) convened a series of stakeholder and inter-agency meetings to identify the needs of small systems that fail to meet safe drinking water standards. More than 50% of them – 140 systems – were in the San Joaquin Valley. The state agency’s goal is to bring at least 21 systems in the valley into compliance each year for the next three years.

EPA is helping to meet that goal by providing essential funding for technical assistance to these small drinking water systems through nonprofits like the California Rural Water Association. In partnership with CDPH, local stakeholders, and four nonprofits, EPA continues to work with these communities to identify barriers to compliance and develop long-term sustainable solutions.

EPA has also worked with communities to improve water quality by providing funding for education and training to more than 200 valley residents about preventing pollution of drinking water.

A Healthier San Joaquin River

Some of the most promising signs of progress to protect surface waters have recently come from the San Joaquin River. First, a 50-mile stretch that formerly went dry part of every year due to dams and water diversions was re-watered. In November 2012, the state Department of Fish and Wildlife captured adult salmon and trucked them upstream to spawning areas, in hopes of restoring a San Joaquin salmon run for the first time in more than 60 years.

EPA is participating in the review of modifications to water quality standards in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta proposed by the State Water Resources Control Board. The first phase of the new standards will address freshwater flows for the protection of aquatic life in the lower San Joaquin River and three of its tributaries, the Stanislaus, Merced, and Tuolumne Rivers.

In June 2012, EPA awarded $59,000 in grant funds to Revive the San Joaquin, a nonprofit in Fresno, to establish a citizen-based water quality monitoring and pollution prevention education program in the city’s 15 miles of neighborhoods lining the riverbank. This effort is now underway.

Also notable is the success of a 20-year effort to reduce levels of the pesticide diazinon in two stretches of the river, totaling 17 miles. Diazinon was being used on orchards, and runoff was washing the pesticide into the river.

This historic initiative marks a decisive step toward reinforcing the nation’s energy infrastructure, maintaining low energy costs and securing American leadership in innovation.
That’s why President Trump asked governors across the Mid-Atlantic to come together and call upon PJM to allow America to build big reliable power plants again.
Our directives will restore affordable and reliable electricity so American families thrive and America’s manufacturing industries once again boom.
President Trump promised to unleash American energy and put the American people first.","WASHINGTON — Today, National Energy Dominance Council (NEDC) Chairman and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, alongside Vice Chairman and Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, announced a landmark agreement with a bipartisan group of governors to expand the nation’s energy supply, safeguard affordability and support the rapid expansion of data-center development.

For years, electricity prices within the PJM market, which serves the Mid-Atlantic and parts of the Midwest, have risen faster than almost anywhere else in the country, in part, because of the previous administration’s war on American energy. To reverse this, President Donald J. Trump and the NEDC have secured an agreement with several states to advance more than $15 billion in new power-generation projects. These projects are designed to strengthen grid reliability and meet the surging energy demands of the digital economy.

In a first-of-its-kind partnership, a coalition of leading technology companies has committed to funding this new generation capacity. This ensures that the costs associated with increased data-center demand are carried by tech companies, not taxpayers. This historic initiative marks a decisive step toward reinforcing the nation’s energy infrastructure, maintaining low energy costs and securing American leadership in innovation.

""For too long, the Green New Scam has left families in the dark with skyrocketing bills,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. “Today, under President Trump’s leadership, the National Energy Dominance Council has come up with a solution to end these high costs, roll back the Biden administration’s policies of energy scarcity and ensure we are powering the Mid-Atlantic and parts of the Midwest’s future without charging its citizens a cent. This initiative will ensure we usher in the age of artificial intelligence with new power plants funded by the technology companies, not taxpayers, securing the steel of Pennsylvania, the manufacturing of Ohio and the ships of Virginia. The Trump administration is keeping the lights on, the factories humming and the American Dream affordable.""

“High electricity prices are a choice,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright. “The Biden administration’s forceful closures of coal and natural gas plants without reliable replacements left the United States in an energy emergency. Perhaps no region in America is more at risk than in PJM. That’s why President Trump asked governors across the Mid-Atlantic to come together and call upon PJM to allow America to build big reliable power plants again. Our directives will restore affordable and reliable electricity so American families thrive and America’s manufacturing industries once again boom. President Trump promised to unleash American energy and put the American people first. This plan keeps that promise.""

This announcement is a direct response to the national energy emergency declared by President Trump on Day One of his administration, following years of President Biden’s energy subtraction agenda that left the American grid vulnerable to blackouts and record-high prices. This initiative aims to:

Restore Energy Affordability: Lower the burden on residential customers who have faced skyrocketing monthly bills.

Strengthen Grid Reliability: Deploy $15 billion toward baseload power to ensure the lights stay on and the heat stays on, regardless of weather conditions.

Protect Regional Industry: Secure the energy-intensive manufacturing hubs of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Virginia that serve as the backbone of the American economy.

President Trump is shifting the focus back to reliable power generation, this agreement ensures that America remains an industrial powerhouse, powered by American resources and protected from the failed policies of previous administrations.

The company is ramping uranium production towards 2 million pounds annually, processing 350,000 pounds in December alone - a significant milestone when many US producers struggle to achieve 100,000 pounds quarterly.

White Mesa Mill provides unique competitive advantages with demonstrated rare earth processing capabilities, heavy mineral separation, and recent addition of an MREC circuit, positioning Energy Fuels to process material from diverse sources including ionic clays.

The Toliara project in Madagascar remains a world-class, low-cost heavy mineral sands and monazite deposit with feasibility studies showing NPV exceeding $1.5 billion at 10% discount rate, with final investment decision expected by Q1 2026.

Strong balance sheet with approximately $1 billion in cash, reinforced by a $700 million convertible note at an exceptionally low 0.75% coupon - significantly below the 4-5.5% rates competitors are paying - demonstrates market confidence and provides capital flexibility.

Energy Fuels (NYSE: UUUU) has emerged as a standout performer in the critical minerals sector, delivering returns in 2025 that position it as the year's best-performing uranium stock - outpacing its nearest competitor by more than 100%. With a current market capitalisation of $5 billion and share price around $21, the company has executed a strategic vision that CEO Mark Chalmers first articulated two and a half years ago. As the United States intensifies its focus on critical mineral security and energy independence, Energy Fuels stands uniquely positioned at the intersection of uranium production, rare earth processing, and heavy mineral sands development.

The company's strategy centres on leveraging its 50-year uranium processing heritage at the White Mesa Mill in Utah to create a diversified critical minerals platform. This approach addresses a fundamental challenge facing Western economies: reducing dependence on foreign - particularly Chinese - supply chains for materials essential to clean energy, defence, and advanced manufacturing. With a workforce that has grown from 100 employees in the United States a few years ago to 260-270 domestically and 600-700 globally, Energy Fuels has achieved critical mass that few competitors can match.

Uranium Production: Delivering on Core Operations

Energy Fuels' uranium operations provide the foundation for its broader critical minerals strategy. The company mined approximately 1.6 million pounds of uranium in 2025 and processed over 1 million pounds whilst stockpiling additional feed. For 2026, management targets mining production exceeding 2 million pounds annually, with processing planned for at least the first six months depending on rare earth processing activities.

The scale of operations became particularly evident in December 2025, when the White Mesa Mill processed 350,000 pounds of uranium in a single month. As Chalmers emphasised, this stands in stark contrast to competitors:

""350,000 pounds in a single month when a lot of people are trying to get to 100,000 pounds in a quarter."" This production capability directly addresses criticism that Energy Fuels had deprioritised uranium. ""The naysayers that were saying, 'Oh, we've got out of the uranium business. We don't care about uranium.' Well, we're doing pretty good,"" Chalmers noted.

The company's production economics remain highly competitive, with costs at the Pinyon Plain mine ranging between $23-30 per pound. At current uranium prices hovering around $83 per pound, this generates substantial margins. Chalmers built the Pinyon Plain mine 38 years ago, and it continues to anchor the company's cost-competitive position. The company secured long-term contracts covering 600,000 - 800,000 pounds in 2026, whilst maintaining flexibility to capitalise on spot market opportunities. In 2025, Energy Fuels realised average prices in the mid - $70s per pound across contract and spot sales.

Rare Earth Processing: Technical Capabilities Setting Energy Fuels Apart

Energy Fuels has developed rare earth processing capabilities that Chalmers describes as unmatched in the United States. The White Mesa Mill can process rare earth feedstocks through to separated oxides, with output already pre-qualified by multiple potential customers. Recent technical additions have expanded the facility's versatility, including the installation of an MREC (ionic clay processing) circuit that enables processing of cracked material from ionic clays and other sources before separation.

""We are so advanced when it comes to feed processing capabilities demonstrated that we can get to oxides that oxides can be has been pre-qualified with a number of outside parties,"" Chalmers explained.

The company's ability to recover heavy rare earth elements particularly distinguishes its offering, as these materials command premium pricing and face the most acute supply constraints.

The mill's flexibility allows Energy Fuels to balance uranium and rare earth processing according to market conditions and customer demand signals. For 2026, uranium processing is planned for at least six months, but this could extend depending on rare earth opportunities. The company submitted Phase 2 separation plant upgrades that would scale the facility to match the capacity of Lynas Rare Earths' operations whilst maintaining separated heavy rare earth capabilities - a technical achievement few Western facilities can claim.

Interview with Energy Fuels Inc's President & CEO, Mark Chalmers

Technical Team and Operational Scale

Energy Fuels has assembled what Chalmers characterises as ""the strongest technical team in all critical minerals of anybody in the United States that I know of."" This team's breadth spans uranium, vanadium, and rare earth elements - a combination that reflects the company's diversified approach. The technical expertise extends globally, with a Perth office supporting Australian operations, teams in Madagascar and Kenya for African projects, and personnel managing the Australian joint venture.

This operational scale provides Energy Fuels with advantages that extend beyond processing. The company maintains uranium-vanadium mines at La Sal and Pandora, and whilst vanadium recovery is currently suspended, the element remains in solution and can be recovered from tailings at a later date when economics justify it. ""You got to be in the game to capitalise on the game,"" Chalmers noted, highlighting the optionality this creates.

Toliara Project: World-Class Heavy Mineral Sands

The Toliara project in Madagascar represents one of Energy Fuels' most significant development assets. The recently released feasibility study confirmed previous economic assessments, showing net present value exceeding $1.5 billion at a 10% discount rate. Chalmers describes Toliara as ""the lowest cost undeveloped heavy mineral sand and monazite deposit in the world"" with long life and large scale characteristics.

The project has faced some political uncertainty following a change in Madagascar's government, but Energy Fuels maintains significant in-country presence and continues working closely with government officials. ""We see it as a very important project in Madagascar for the region for the government as a whole and we plan to work very very closely with them to deliver that project as soon as possible,"" Chalmers stated.

Capital costs have increased somewhat from previous estimates but remain reasonable in the context of the project's economics. Energy Fuels targets a final investment decision by the end of Q1 2026, which would represent a significant milestone in advancing the company's heavy mineral sands strategy. The project would provide monazite feedstock for the White Mesa Mill's rare earth processing operations, creating vertical integration within Energy Fuels' critical minerals platform.

Donald Project and Multiple Feasibility Studies

Alongside Toliara, Energy Fuels is advancing the Donald project, with a feasibility study anticipated by the end of Q1 2026. Additionally, a feasibility study on the White Mesa Mill upgrades will provide economic details on the rare earth processing expansion. This confluence of studies will enable investors to understand the integrated economics of Energy Fuels' strategy and how the company compares to global peers.

""We will have these multiple studies coming out that provides people the ability to connect the dots on what the economics look like and where we kind of fit into the world pecking order and we're really excited about that,"" Chalmers explained. The studies will cover economics across the value chain - from mining through processing to separated products - giving a comprehensive view that few competitors can offer.

Capital Structure, Competitive Dynamics and Industry Positioning

Energy Fuels' financial position has strengthened considerably, with approximately $1 billion in cash on the balance sheet. The company's capital markets success became particularly evident with a $700 million convertible note offering featuring a coupon of just 0.75% - dramatically below the 4-5.5% rates other uranium companies have paid for similar instruments. This financing was arranged with Goldman Sachs and attracted significant investor interest.

""I had number of investors say that was the big event for energy fuels for the year is being able to raise that quantum at those kind of terms,"" Chalmers noted. The favourable terms reflect market confidence in Energy Fuels' execution capabilities and strategic positioning. This capital provides flexibility for both organic development and potential acquisitions or partnerships as opportunities emerge in the consolidating critical minerals sector.

Energy Fuels' diversified approach addresses investor concerns about single-project risk whilst creating synergies competitors cannot easily replicate. The company's 50-year uranium processing history provides operational expertise that has proven difficult for others to restart. Multiple projects globally have faced challenges restarting or initiating uranium production, whilst Energy Fuels continues expanding output.

The company increasingly receives inbound interest from parties seeking processing partnerships, acquisition opportunities, and strategic investments. ""The phone keeps ringing with people that want to deal with us in different things,"" Chalmers noted. Upstream producers lacking access to processing facilities see value in partnering with Energy Fuels, whilst investors recognise the company's critical mass and balance sheet strength.

Looking Forward: Execution and Catalysts

Energy Fuels enters 2026 with momentum following a year in which the stock appreciated approximately 45% through mid-January alone. The company focuses on revenue growth and moving towards profitability, with uranium production providing near-term cash generation whilst rare earth and heavy mineral sands projects advance towards commercial production.

Key catalysts for 2026 include final investment decisions on both Toliara and Donald, the White Mesa Mill upgrade feasibility study, continued uranium production ramp-up, and potential government support programmes. The company's flexibility to balance uranium and rare earth processing according to demand signals and market conditions provides tactical advantages as both markets develop.

Chalmers acknowledges the challenges inherent in the business: ""This is a hard business. We always look over our shoulder and make sure we're not overconfident."" However, after 50 years in the industry, he expresses confidence in Energy Fuels' ability to deliver: ""We're experienced and we deliver and we do what we say we're going to do.""

The Investment Thesis for Energy Fuels

Optionality and Flexibility: Ability to modulate between uranium and rare earth processing, suspend/restart vanadium recovery, and pursue acquisitions provides management with tactical and strategic flexibility

Macro Thematic Analysis: Critical Minerals and Western Supply Chain Independence

The United States and allied Western nations face a strategic vulnerability in critical minerals supply chains, with China dominating processing of materials essential to clean energy transition, defence systems, and advanced manufacturing. Rare earth elements exemplify this challenge - China controls over 90% of global processing despite representing less than 40% of mining. This concentration creates national security risks and economic dependencies that recent geopolitical tensions have brought into sharp focus. The Trump administration's renewed emphasis on critical mineral security, combined with bipartisan recognition of supply chain vulnerabilities, has created unprecedented policy support for domestic production and processing capabilities.

Energy Fuels occupies a unique position as the only company with operational uranium production and rare earth processing capabilities in the United States, providing optionality across multiple critical materials. As CEO Mark Chalmers stated:

""We are like no other company in the critical mineral space where we're building a critical mineral hub using our longstanding uranium processing capabilities but also the ability to mine and recover rare earth into oxides.""

This positioning becomes increasingly valuable as governments prioritise resilient, diversified supply chains.

TL;DR: Executive Summary

Energy Fuels delivered the highest returns of any uranium stock in 2025 whilst building America's only integrated critical minerals platform spanning uranium production (targeting 2+ million lbs annually), rare earth processing to separated oxides, and world-class heavy mineral sands development. The company's $1 billion balance sheet, strengthened by a $700 million convertible at just 0.75% coupon, funds multiple Q1 2026 catalysts including feasibility studies and final investment decisions. With proven production generating cash at attractive margins ($23-30/lb costs versus $83/lb uranium prices) and unmatched processing capabilities at White Mesa Mill, Energy Fuels offers investors exposure to critical minerals security themes with operational validation few competitors can match.

New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) Commissioner Amanda Lefton today announced that more than $5 million is now available through the fifth round of the Regenerate NY Forestry Cost Share Grant Program. This grant program provides financial assistance to private landowners establishing new forests, improving the health of existing forests, and restoring forests that are heavily impacted by factors such as deer browse, invasive pests, or fragmentation. The funding for this round is made possible by the State Environmental Protection Fund’s (EPF) Climate Change Mitigation and Adaption Program, the Forest Landowners Support grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service, and the Arbor Day Foundation. New trees planted as a result of funded projects will contribute to Governor Hochul’s 25 Million Trees Initiative.

“Regenerate NY reflects commitments by Governor Kathy Hochul and DEC to protecting and strengthening New York’s forests for future generations,” said Commissioner Lefton. “Private landowners own approximately 75% of our state’s forestland, so it is essential that we support and invest in their ability to manage their forests sustainably. This round of funding will empower landowners to expand and restore their forests, support green jobs and local economies, and ensure these lands continue to provide clean air and water, habitat for wildlife, and resilient landscapes.”

Private landowners may apply for grants ranging from $10,000 to $1 million to conduct one or more of the following practices on their property:

Planting trees to restore or create new forests,

Creating young forest habitat to initiate natural regeneration and improve wildlife habitat,

Thinning to remove unhealthy or close-growing trees and to promote forest health or regrowth,

Removing competing or invasive vegetation, and

Installing tree protection to prevent deer browse of young tree seedlings.

Eligible applicants include any individual, trust, corporate entity or other for-profit organization that owns between 5 and 2,500 acres of undeveloped land that is forested or can become forested through tree planting or associated practices to encourage forest regeneration. Not-for-profit organizations and Indian Nations or Tribes with 5 or more acres of undeveloped land are also eligible and are not subject to the 2,500-acre maximum requirement. Projects must be at least 5 acres and must be guided by a private forester or natural resource professional. There is no limit to the number of applications/bids that a landowner or organization may submit; however, they cannot be for the same land area. Projects must be completed by December 15, 2029.

DEC Director of Lands and Forests and New York State Forester Fiona Watt said, “This grant opportunity offers a flexible toolkit for landowners to create new forest habitat on open land, and to nurture young and struggling forests to greater health and resilience. Regenerating New York’s private forests is a key pathway to supporting working lands, nature’s benefits, and addressing climate change.”

Portions of the grant funds will be reserved until March 11, 2026, for priority applicants, including new forest landowners, active military service members and veterans, and State or federally recognized Tribes and Indian Nations. Funds will also be reserved for priority projects, including planting trees on a large scale or restoring forests significantly impacted by invasive pests or diseases. Any funds not awarded by that date will then be available to all eligible applicants.

DEC will host a webinar on Tuesday, February 3, 2026, to provide information and answer questions about this funding opportunity. Register for the webinar here(link is external).(link is external)

Applications will be accepted until Thursday, August 27, 2026, and must be submitted through the Statewide Financial System (SFS). Applicants must register for an SFS account before they can apply, and not-for-profits must also prequalify by the deadline or their application will not be evaluated.

“It can be said that our meeting last year opened a new chapter in turning China–Canada relations toward improvement,” China’s top leader said.

Carney made the announcement after two days of meetings with Chinese leaders. He said there would be an initial annual cap of 49,000 vehicles on Chinese EV exports to Canada, growing to about 70,000 over five years. China will reduce its total tariff on canola seeds, a major Canadian export, from 84% to about 15%, he told reporters.

Carney said China has become a more predictable partner to deal with than the U.S, the country’s neighbor and longtime ally.

“Our relationship has progressed in recent months with China. It is more predictable and you see results coming from that,” Carney said.

Carney hasn’t been able to reach a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump to reduce some tariffs that are punishing some key sectors of the Canadian economy and Trump has previously talked about making Canada the 51st state.

The prime minister, speaking outside against the backdrop of a traditional pavilion and a frozen pond at a Beijing park, said meetings in China have been historic and productive.

Earlier Friday, he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged to improve relations between their two nations after years of acrimony.

Xi told Carney in a meeting at the Great Hall of the People that he is willing to continue working to improve ties, noting that talks have been underway on restoring and restarting cooperation since the two held an initial meeting in October on the sidelines of a regional economic conference in South Korea.

“It can be said that our meeting last year opened a new chapter in turning China–Canada relations toward improvement,” China’s top leader said.

Carney looks to improve global governance

Carney, the first Canadian prime minister to visit China in eight years, told Xi that better relations would help improve a global governance system that he described as “under great strain.”

Later, he said at the news conference that the system may give way at least in part to country-to-country or regional agreements rather than the global ones that have underpinned economic growth in the post-World War II era.

“The question is: What gets built in that place? How much of a patchwork is it?” he said.

The new reality reflects in large part the so-called America-first approach of Trump. The tariffs he has imposed have hit both the Canadian and Chinese economies. Carney, who has met with several leading Chinese companies in Beijing, said ahead of his trip that his government is focused on building an economy less reliant on the U.S. at what he called “a time of global trade disruption.”

A Canadian business owner in China called Carney’s visit game-changing, saying it re-establishes dialogue, respect and a framework between the two nations.

“These three things we didn’t have,” said Jacob Cooke, the CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, which helps exporters navigate the Chinese market. “The parties were not talking for years.”

Canada had been aligned with US on tariffs

Canada had followed the U.S. in putting tariffs of 100% on EVs from China and 25% on steel and aluminum under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Carney’s predecessor.

China responded by imposing duties of 100% on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25% on pork and seafood. It added a 75.8% tariff on canola seeds last August. Collectively, the import taxes effectively closed the Chinese market to Canadian canola, an industry group has said. Overall, China’s imports from Canada fell 10.4% last year to $41.7 billion, according to Chinese trade data.

Carney tried to address the concerns of Canadian automakers and auto workers by saying the initial cap on Chinese EV imports was about 3% of the 1.8 million vehicles sold in Canada annually and that, in exchange, China is expected to begin investing in the Canadian auto industry within three years.

More than half of the Chinese EVs exported to Canada would have an import price of less than 35,000 Canadian dollars ($25,000) within five years, he said, making them accessible to consumers.

“We’re building (a) new part of our car industry, building cars of the future in partnership, bringing affordable autos for Canadians at a time when affordability is top of mind, and doing it at a scale that allows for a smooth transition in the sector,” he said.

“For the exchange of a small piece of the Canadian market, we have a commitment. We are waiting for an investment commitment in Canada. The real leaders of the new industry. So it’s an agreement that will create the future for our industry.”

China sees an opening under

Trump

China is hoping Trump’s pressure tactics on allies such as Canada will drive them to pursue a foreign policy that is less aligned with the United States. The U.S. president has suggested Canada could become America’s 51st state.

Carney, though, noted Canada’s relationship with the U.S. is much more multifaceted, deeper and broader. Canada and China have different systems and disagree on issues such as human rights, he said, limiting the scope of their engagement even as they seek ways to cooperate on areas of common interest.

The Canadian leader leaves China on Saturday and visits Qatar on Sunday before attending the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum in Switzerland next week. He will meet business leaders and investors in Qatar to promote trade and investment, his office said.

An essential guide to the week’s key developments relating to climate change.

This week

Hottest hat-trick

STATE OF THE CLIMATE: Scientists have announced that 2025 was either the second or third hottest year on record, with close margins between last year and 2023, reported the Associated Press. The newswire noted that “temperature averages for 2025 hovered around – and mostly above – 1.4C of industrial era warming”. Bloomberg said that this happened despite the natural weather phenomenon La Niña, which “suppresses global temperatures”, meaning “heat from greenhouse gases countered that cooling influence”. Carbon Brief’s comprehensive analysis of the data found cumulative global ice loss also “reached a new record high in 2025”.

OVERHEATING OCEANS: Separately, the world’s oceans “absorbed colossal amounts of heat in 2025”, said the Guardian, setting “yet another new record and fuelling more extreme weather”. It added that the “extra heat makes the hurricanes and typhoons…more intense, causes heavier downpours of rain and greater flooding and results in longer marine heatwaves”.

FIRE AND ICE: Wildfires in Australia have destroyed around 500 structures, said the Sydney Morning Herald, with a “dozen major fires” still burning. A wildfire in Argentinian Patagonia has “blazed through nearly 12,000 hectares” of scrubland and forests, according to the Associated Press. Meanwhile, parts of the Himalayas are “snowless” for the first time in nearly four decades, signalling a “climatic anomaly”, reported the Times of India.

Around the world

EMISSIONS REBOUND: US emissions rose 2% last year after two years of declines” due to a rise in coal power generation, said Axios, in coverage of research by the Rhodium Group.

‘UNINVESTABLE’ OIL: US president Donald Trump may “sideline” ExxonMobil from Venezuela’s oil market after its comment that Venezuela is “uninvestable”, reported CNBC. TotalEnergies is also “in no rush to return to Venezuela”, said Reuters.

PRICE WARS: The EU issued guidelines that will allow tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles to be removed in exchange for minimum price commitments, said Reuters.

‘RECORD’ AUCTION: The UK government has secured “8.4 gigawatts of new offshore wind power” in a “record” auction, said Sky News. Although the auction saw some price rises, this will likely be “cost neutral” for consumers, Carbon Brief said – contrary to the “simplistic and misleading” narratives promoted by some media outlets.

COP STRATEGY: The Guardian reported that Chris Bowen, the Australian minister appointed “president of negotiations” for COP31, plans to use his role to lobby “Saudi Arabia and others” on the need to phase out fossil fuels.

Captured

Both China and India saw coal power generation fall in 2025, in the “first simultaneous drop in half a century”, found new analysis for Carbon Brief, which was widely reported around the world. It noted that, for both countries, the decline in coal was driven by new clean-energy capacity additions, which were “more than sufficient to meet rising demand”.

Spotlight

What are China experts watching for in 2026?

The year 2026 will be pivotal for China’s climate policy. In March, the government will release key climate and energy targets for 2030, the year by which China has pledged to have peaked its emissions.

At the same time, with the US increasingly turning away from climate policy and towards fossil fuel expansionism, China’s role in global climate action is more important than ever.

Carbon Brief asks leading experts what they are watching for from China over the year ahead.

Shuo Li, director of the China Climate Hub, Asia Society Policy Institute

After decades of rapid growth, independent analyses suggest China’s CO2 emissions may have plateaued or even begun to decline in 2025.

The transition from emissions growth to stabilisation and early decline will be the key watch point for 2026 and will be shaped by the forthcoming 15th five-year plan. [This plan will set key economic goals, including energy and climate targets, for 2030.]

However, the precise timing, scale and enforceability of these absolute emissions control measures remain under active debate. Chinese experts broadly agree that if the 2021-2025 period was characterised by continued emissions growth, and 2031-2035 is expected to deliver a clear decline, then 2026-2030 will serve as a critical “bridge” between the two.

Yan Qin, principal analyst, ClearBlue Markets

First, the 15th five-year plan inaugurates the “dual control of carbon” system. This year marks the first time industries and local governments face binding caps on total emissions, not just intensity.

Second, the national carbon market is aggressively tightening. With the inclusion of steel, cement and aluminum this year, regulators are executing a “market reset” – de-weighting older allowances [meaning they cannot be used to contribute to polluters’ obligations for 2026] and enforcing stricter benchmarks to bolster prices ahead of the full rollout of the EU’s carbon border adjustment mechanism.

Cecilia Trasi, senior policy advisor for industry and trade, ECCO

China’s solar manufacturing overcapacity is prompting Beijing’s first serious consolidation efforts. At the same time, its offshore wind technology is advancing rapidly [and there are] signals that Chinese wind companies are pursuing entry into European markets through local production, mirroring strategies adopted by battery manufacturers.

Together, these dynamics suggest that the next phase of cleantech competition will be shaped less by trade defense alone and more by the interaction between Chinese supply-side reforms and global market-absorption capacity.

Tu Le, managing director, Sino Auto Insights

China’s electric vehicle (EV) industry has been the primary force pushing the global passenger vehicle market toward clean energy. That momentum should continue. But a growing headwind has emerged: tariffs. Mexico, Brazil, Europe and the US are just a few of the countries raising barriers, complicating the next phase of global EV expansion.

One new wildcard: the US now effectively controls Venezuelan oil. If that meaningfully impacts global oil prices, it could either slow – or unexpectedly accelerate – the shift toward clean-energy vehicles.

,Detroit and Evs,2026-01-17 03:46:19+00:00,www.bbc.com,Canada's deal with China signals it is serious about shift from US - BBC,Nadine Yousif,,,,,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm24k6kk1rko,"Some experts said the electric vehicle provisions in the trade deal would help China make inroads into the Canadian automobile market.
""If you can get a deal with China, you should do that,"" he told reporters outside the White House.
""There's a reasonable chance that we could end up in 2026 without a meaningful, workable trade deal with the United States,"" he said.
The deal with China drops Canada's levies on Chinese EVs from 100% to 6.1% for the first 49,000 vehicles imported each year.
For Carney, though, Friday's deal may just be the first step in a ""recalibration"" of Canada's trade relations.","Prime Minister Mark Carney's new approach to Canada's foreign policy can perhaps be distilled in one line: ""We take the world as it is, not as we wish it to be.""

That was his response when asked about the deal struck with China on Friday, despite concerns over its human rights record and nearly a year after he called China ""the biggest security threat"" facing Canada.

The deal will see Canada ease tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles that it imposed in tandem with the US in 2024. In exchange, China will lower retaliatory tariffs on key Canadian agricultural products.

Experts told the BBC the move represents a significant shift in Canada's policy on China, one that is shaped by ongoing uncertainty with the US, its largest trade partner.

""The prime minister is saying, essentially, that Canada has agency too, and that it's not going to just sit and wait for the United States,"" said Eric Miller, a Washington DC based trade adviser and president of the Rideau Potomac Strategy Group.

China and Canada announce tariffs relief after high-stakes meeting

Carney faces delicate balancing act in China visit

Four things the US wants from Canada on trade

In Canada, as daylight broke on Friday, reaction to the deal was swift.

Some, like Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe, hailed it as ""very good news"". Farmers in Moe's province have been hard hit by China's retaliatory tariffs on Canadian canola oil, and the deal, he said, would bring much needed relief.

But Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whose province is home to Canada's auto sector, was sharply critical of the deal. He said removing EV tariffs on China ""would hurt our economy and lead to job losses"".

In a post on X, Ford said Carney's government was ""inviting a flood of cheap made-in-China electric vehicles without any real guarantees of equal or immediate investment in Canada's economy"".

Some experts said the electric vehicle provisions in the trade deal would help China make inroads into the Canadian automobile market.

With the lower EV tariffs, approximately 10% of Canada's electric vehicle sales are now expected to go to Chinese automakers, said Vivek Astvansh, a business professor at McGill University in Montreal.

The expected increase in Chinese EV sales could put pressure on US-based EV makers like Tesla which are seeking to expand their market share in Canada, he said.

""Carney has signalled to the Trump administration that it is warming up to China,"" Astvansh added.

Reaction from the White House, meanwhile, has been mixed.

In an interview with CNBC on Friday morning, US trade representative Jamieson Greer called the deal ""problematic"" and said Canada may come to regret it.

President Donald Trump, however, hailed it as ""a good thing"".

""If you can get a deal with China, you should do that,"" he told reporters outside the White House.

Since taking office for a second time last year, Trump has imposed tariffs on Canadian sectors like metals and automotives, which has led to swirling economic uncertainty. He has also threatened to rip up a longstanding North American free trade agreement between Canada, the US and Mexico, calling it ""irrelevant"".

That trade agreement, the USMCA, is now under a mandatory review. Canada and Mexico have both made clear they want it to remain in place.

But the decision to carve out a major new deal with China is a recognition by Carney that the future of North American free trade remains unclear, Miller of the Rideau Potomac Strategy Group told the BBC.

""There's a reasonable chance that we could end up in 2026 without a meaningful, workable trade deal with the United States,"" he said. ""And Canada needs to be prepared.""

The deal with China drops Canada's levies on Chinese EVs from 100% to 6.1% for the first 49,000 vehicles imported each year. That quota could rise, Carney said, reaching 70,000 in half a decade.

Canada and the US put levies on Chinese EVs in 2024, arguing that China was overproducing vehicles and undermining the ability of other countries to compete.

China is the world's largest producer of EVs, accounting for 70% of global production.

In exchange, China will cut tariffs on Canadian canola seed to around 15% by 1 March, down from the current rate of 84%. Carney said Beijing had also committed to removing tariffs on Canadian canola meal, lobsters, crabs and peas ""until at least the end of the year"".

China also committed to removing visa requirements for Canadian visitors, Carney said.

Beijing did not corroborate the details in a separate statement, but said ""the two reached a preliminary joint agreement on addressing bilateral economic and trade issues"".

The introduction of Chinese EVs to Canada's market will likely mean cheaper prices for Canadian consumers, said Gal Raz, an associate professor of Operations Management and Sustainability at Western University and an expert on the EV supply chain.

But Raz acknowledged that the deal Canada struck could hurt Canadian car manufacturers if it comes without further action from the Carney government to help the domestic sector.

He said it was the result of an ""unfortunate"" deterioration of the Canada-US trade relationship, which he noted has also hurt Canada's automotive industry.

""The US has really put Canada in a corner,"" he said.

Asked why Canada is giving China access to its automotive market, Carney said that China produces ""some of the most affordable and energy-efficient vehicles in the world"". He said he expects the deal will spur Chinese investment into Canada's auto industry, though he did not provide further details.

Trump himself has signalled openness to China building plants in the US if it means creating more jobs for Americans, despite his tough-on-China stance.

""If they want to come in and build a plant and hire you and hire your friends and your neighbours, that's great, I love that,"" Trump said at the Detroit Economic Club on Tuesday. ""Let China come in, let Japan come in.""

The US president is notably headed to Beijing for his own meeting with President Xi Jinping in April. He has also invited Xi for a state visit to Washington.

For Carney, though, Friday's deal may just be the first step in a ""recalibration"" of Canada's trade relations.

TOP NEWS IN ENERGY UN/AFFORDABILITY

STATE NEWS

NEW YORK GOVERNOR ANNOUNCES WINS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND FOR NEW YORKERS: In her State of the State address, New York Governor Kathy Hochul proposed a historic $3.75 billion investment into clean water infrastructure and a $425 million investment in the state Environmental Protection Fund. She also proposed various energy reforms such as improving programs to help New Yorkers lower their energy bills and promoting clean electric vehicles, as well as climate resilience initiatives, including helping communities be more prepared for flooding. Notably, Hochul also announced plans to establish critical ratepayer protections against large energy users, especially AI data centers, by requiring them to pay their fair share for the energy they use or generate their own power to lower the cost burden on New York residents.

NYLCV TAKE: New York LCV said, “Governor Hochul’s State of the State underscores New York’s commitment to energy affordability, consumer protection, and advancing public health through critical infrastructure upgrades. We applaud the Governor’s historic $3.75 billion investment in water infrastructure and a $425 million EPF, as well as her commitment to energy affordability programs like Empower+ and the deployment of funds to make our communities more resilient to flooding. We appreciate the need to streamline environmental review and permitting to support affordable housing and other critical infrastructure but it must be done carefully; we look forward to seeing the details and working together to ensure that solutions do not compromise on environmental protections. We urge the administration and Legislature to build on these measures by investing another $1 billion in the Sustainable Future Fund including $200 million for thermal energy networks, advancing the Accelerate Solar for Affordable Power (ASAP) Act and automated solar permitting, and delivering permitting reform and increasing support for battery storage – proven solutions that align with the Governor’s agenda of cutting burdensome red tape and delivering clean, affordable energy for New Yorkers.”

TAKE 2: New York LCV said on X, “@GovKathyHochul announces in her #StateOfTheState that data centers will pay their fair share for the power they use & they’ll ultimately generate their own clean energy. We hope the final budget requires them to add 100% renewable energy to the grid to power their operations.”

SOUTH CAROLINA REGULATORS APPROVE RATE HIKE: While the cost of living is at an all-time high in South Carolina, regulators have approved an electricity rate hike that will further increase energy bills for families. While the approved rate hike is smaller than the utility’s original proposal, South Carolinians can’t afford to keep seeing their energy bills go up.

NATIONAL NEWS

GOVERNORS DEMAND ELECTRICITY GRID REFORM: Governors of all 13 states in the nation’s largest electricity grid signed onto a bipartisan document with President Trump calling on regional grid operator, PJM, to enact significant reforms to address high energy prices in the wake of rapid data center buildout. LCV and our state affiliates are continuing to push PJM to bring more renewable energy, the cheapest, clean, and fastest form of energy to deploy, online to meet rising energy demand.

OUR TAKE: LCV Senior Director of State Climate and Equity Policy Lashelle Johnson said, “Today’s announcement shows that public pressure still works, but what happens next will determine whether people enjoy lower prices and cleaner communities sooner, or if they are locked in to waiting for dirtier and more expensive energy. We have been calling for data centers and tech companies to pay their fair share and to power with clean energy because sources like solar, wind, and battery storage are the cheapest and fastest ways to get more electricity onto the grid.

“Governors should use their authority to ensure data centers power operations with cheap solar and batteries and meet state clean energy goals. People understand data centers are one of the reasons electricity prices are skyrocketing and are rightly demanding solutions that can address this problem as quickly as possible. Today’s announcement only underscores why the Trump administration’s war on clean energy needs to end.”

CVPA TAKE: Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania Executive Director Molly Parzen said, “This action, supported by a bipartisan group of regional governors, follows the lead of Governor Shapiro’s previous steps to protect Pennsylvanians from out of control electric bills by negotiating a price cap on the PJM capacity auction. While this deal represents meaningful progress, we must continue to push for long-term solutions. Bringing more clean, renewable energy online will counter rising prices from increased demand, particularly from data centers. And while we agree that data centers must bring their own energy to Pennsylvania in order to keep our rates from further skyrocketing, that energy must be from clean and renewable sources that are the cheapest and fastest to bring online. We applaud this attempt to get PJM to do right by their customers, and strongly encourage Governor Shapiro and the state legislature to keep pushing for additional protections for workers, impacted communities, and our environment.”

OEC TAKE: Ohio Environmental Council CEO Carol Kauffman said, “Though this is meaningful progress, these actions alone will not achieve the affordable, reliable, and clean energy grid Ohioans deserve. The next critical step is clear: PJM must accelerate interconnection for existing clean energy projects stuck in its bureaucratic process. The bottom line? We urgently require more energy at an accelerated pace. Fortunately, market-driven solutions are already available. We must address the energy affordability crisis for millions of people living in the PJM territory by deploying cheap, clean energy as fast as possible.”

OFFSHORE WIND TRIUMPHS OVER TRUMP IN COURT: Federal courts ruled against the Trump administration to allow construction to resume on three offshore wind projects off the East Coast, Revolution Wind, Empire Wind, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind. The court rulings come after the president froze construction in late December. This is a huge win for the offshore wind industry and clean, affordable energy on the East Coast. Two additional offshore wind projects halted by the Trump administration are also challenging the order in court.

NYLCV TAKE: New York LCV said, “Today’s court ruling is a clear victory for New York workers, families, and our clean energy future. NYLCV applauds the decision allowing Empire Wind to resume construction, and we urge swift and similar action for Sunrise Wind and the other projects across the East Coast… We look forward to workers returning to the job without further delay and to the courts ultimately rejecting the Trump Administration’s unlawful attempt to kill clean energy jobs and halt fully permitted projects.”

VALCV TAKE: Virginia LCV Director of Advocacy and Campaigns Blair St. Ledger-Olson said, “Virginia needs more, not less, affordable clean energy and today’s ruling helps make that happen. When complete, this offshore wind project will be the nation’s largest, powering hundreds of thousands of Virginia homes with clean, renewable energy, while creating hundreds of jobs and billions of dollars of investment in our economy. The Trump Administration’s continued obstruction of clean energy projects may be good for his fossil fuel donors, but it hurts Virginians, saddling us with higher energy bills and dirtier air while killing good-paying jobs. We are pleased that CVOW has been allowed to proceed and look forward to continuing to unlock more clean energy off our coast, and securing offshore wind as an economic driver well into the future.”

MEMBERS OF CONGRESS INTRODUCE BICAMERAL PROTECTING TAXPAYERS FROM RISKY INVESTMENTS IN VENEZUELA ACT: Senator Jeff Merkley (OR) and Representative Mike Levin (CA-49) introduced the Protecting Taxpayers from Risky Investments in Venezuela Act in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The legislation aims to ensure taxpayers aren’t on the hook for the cost of building dirty, expensive fossil fuel infrastructure in Venezuela for the benefit of Trump’s fossil fuel donors.

OUR TAKE: LCV Senior Federal Advocacy Campaigns Director Leah Donahey said, “Taxpayers in the U.S. shouldn’t be forced to pay for Big Oil infrastructure — period. Trump’s proposal to invest taxpayer dollars subsidizing overseas oil and gas projects will help line the pockets of his Big Polluter friends and do zero to lower everyday expenses for families here at home. Energy prices are up 13% under President Trump and yet he is abusing his power and banning clean energy projects to give handouts to wealthy oil executives, when what we need is to invest in the fastest and cheapest energy to bring online — clean energy — and the good-paying jobs it creates. We applaud Senator Merkley and Representative Levin for introducing these bills and urge Congress to pass this legislation that helps to protect taxpayer dollars from funding Big Polluters.”

CLIMATE ATTACKS FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

EPA TO PRIORITIZE PROFITS OVER HUMAN LIFE: EPA announced it will stop considering the monetary value of health effects from air pollution (e.g. human lives saved or lost) when setting pollution limits. This is a reversal of decades of precedent in which the agency has used the benefits to human health, including fewer asthma attacks and premature deaths, to show the value of setting rules to limit pollution. This means they won’t tell the public how many more people will die and be sickened by their lax air pollution limits, which contradict EPA’s mission to protect public health and the environment, and prioritizes polluting industries’ profits while making our air dirtier.

OUR TAKE: LCV said on Bluesky, “This administration makes it abundantly clear every single day that they have zero regard for the health and well-being of the American people.”

EPA MOVES TO LIMIT STATE AND TRIBAL ABILITY TO SAFEGUARD CLEAN WATER: EPA proposed a rule to limit the scope of Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, which gives states and Tribes the authority to veto large projects that could result in more pollution in their water.

OUR TAKE: LCV Healthy Communities Government Affairs Advocate Lizzy Duncan said, “The Trump administration has proven time and time again that they will say and do whatever it takes to eliminate environmental safeguards and pad the pockets of their polluter allies at the expense of the health and safety of our communities. This latest proposal would strip states and Tribes of their right to protect their waterways from health harming pollution. The proposal is especially galling after the administration pointed to states’ rights as a key reason to undermine the Waters of the United States’ rule. This administration’s continued assault on the Clean Water Act threatens our communities and economic growth. It will make our waters dirtier and families sicker at a time when healthcare costs are already going up for millions. Protecting access to clean water is popular among families and communities across the country and communities need stronger clean water safeguards, instead of handouts to corporate polluters. The Trump administration should abandon this horrible proposal.”

HOUSE PASSES SHOWER ACT: The House passed the SHOWER Act, lifting water efficiency regulations for showerheads. People across the country are already struggling to pay their utility bills, and this legislation will drive bills even higher. Prior to the vote, LCV sent a letter to members of the House urging them to oppose the bill.

OUR TAKE: From the letter, “[This bill] would effectively eliminate already-attained federal showerhead efficiency standards by changing the legal definition of a showerhead to allow higher overall water use. This will result in higher household water and energy costs, place additional strain on water and energy infrastructure, and shift costs onto consumers and utilities, with disproportionately high burdens on renters and low income households.”

DOE REALLOCATES $500 MILLION FROM BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE LAW TO BOLSTER COAL: The Department of Energy (DOE) announced its illegitimate plans to use more than half a billion dollars in funding Congress had earmarked for programs to improve energy resiliency and environmental protection in rural America to instead prop up outdated and obsolete coal plants.

ICYMI: STATE NEWS

NEW JERSEY GRANTS $32 MILLION FOR ELECTRIC BUSES, CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE: New Jersey has issued $32 million in grants to fund 53 electric school buses, 41 fast chargers, and 26 public charging stations for electric vehicles. This investment will reduce pollution from transportation in the state.

NEW JERSEY LCV ANNOUNCES INTERIM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR: Following Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill’s announcement that New Jersey LCV Executive Director Ed Potosnak will serve as the commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, New Jersey LCV named Allison McLeod as the organization’s interim executive director. McLeod has served as the organization’s deputy director.

ICYMI: NATIONAL NEWS

SENATE PASSES THREE BILL APPROPRIATIONS MINIBUS: The Senate has passed a three bill minibus including the Interior-Environment, Energy-Water, and Commerce-Justice-Science bills. These bills avoided the worst of the cuts to environmental programs and poison-pill riders Republican lawmakers sought to attach. The legislation is now on the president’s desk.

OUR TAKE: Ahead of the bills’ passage in the House last week, LCV Legislative Director David Shadburn said, “This hard-fought compromise is a crucial step forward in blocking dozens of the worst partisan attacks. Congress must rein in Donald Trump and Russell Vought’s continued abuse of power and ensure that agencies are doing the work of the people as mandated by Congress. Quickly passing bipartisan funding bills is our strongest defense against the attacks on our core institutions of environmental protection. We are grateful to the members of Congress and their staff for working overtime to negotiate truly bipartisan funding bills that will help protect our air, water, and public lands.”

ONE YEAR OF TRUMP’S COSTLY SECOND TERM: Next week marks the first full year of Trump’s second term. Over the past year, Trump has consistently prioritized his polluter cronies over people and the planet, jacking up our energy costs and jeopardizing the health and safety of our communities and environment. LCV released a memo detailing how Trump and congressional Republicans have increased our costs over the last year.

OUR TAKE: From the memo, “Across the country, families are paying more. For electricity, for insurance, for health care, for housing…the list goes on. These rising costs aren’t abstract, and they aren’t accidental. They are the result of a series of policy choices that have shifted the costs of dirty energy, pollution, and climate damage onto families, workers, and taxpayers, while handing out gifts and giveaways to polluters.”

That has had competitors concerned even before Canada this week agreed to cut its tariffs on Chinese EVs in exchange for concessions on Canadian farm products.

Experts now say an easier path into Canada could be a big boost for Chinese carmakers looking to dominate the global market — particularly as their domestic market weakens. That poses a threat to other auto manufacturers, particularly American companies.

U.S. officials acknowledged that in remarks at an assembly plant for Jeep-maker Stellantis in Toledo, Ohio on Friday. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the Chinese Communist Party invests in its auto industry to “control this industry.”

“Why? They want to take over the auto industry. They want to take away these jobs,” Duffy said. As far as the Canadian trade deal, he added: “They will live to regret the day they partner with China and bring in their vehicles.”

Others say the shift is inevitable.

“This is telling us that Chinese automakers continue to be really popular, and are doing better and better, and not just something that’s sold in global markets that are more marginal or less important to U.S. automakers,” said Ilaria Mazzocco, deputy director and senior fellow with the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

What makes Chinese vehicles stand out?

Chinese-made vehicles are high-quality, stylish and inexpensive, experts say.

“It’s clear that the vehicles made by Chinese brands come at a very competitive cost, but are also technologically quite desirable,” Mazzocco said. “They tend to be connected vehicles, so they have a lot of additional software capabilities that consumers seem to like. But the price point and the competitiveness are really big selling points.”

These vehicles can cost as little as $10,000 to $20,000; in the U.S., new vehicles are running close to $50,000 on average, and EVs even more so.

Chinese companies also have unique advantages as far as auto manufacturing and production, efficiency and making vehicles lighter, which helps extend an electrified vehicle’s driving range.

“They’ve found a way to make small and mid-sized cars — cars that people want — at a reasonable price,” said Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “These are the segments where GM and Ford and almost everybody else have abandoned.”

Many automakers have discontinued smaller vehicles in favor of higher-margin, large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that are far more profitable.

So why are Chinese EVs such a threat to U.S. automakers and others?

Much of the global auto market is electrifying, an ideal opportunity for advanced Chinese automakers to capitalize on. China saw 17% growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles in 2025, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week, and Europe saw a 33% increase.

Meanwhile, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1% last year. As the rest of the world advances, U.S. automakers have weakened their once-ambitious, multibillion dollar electrification plans, instead opting for more efficient hybrid electric and gasoline vehicles amid the Trump administration’s shift away from EV-friendly policy.

That shift threatens U.S. automakers’ competitive edge in the coming years. As is, Tesla lost its crown as the world’s bestselling electric vehicle maker last year, delivering only 1.64 million vehicles in 2025 to Chinese rival BYD’s 2.26 million.

Trump administration policy slashing emissions rules at a time when Chinese companies are advancing quickly has experts worried for the future of American car manufacturers.

Chinese automakers will have to meet standards required for the Canadian auto market for the latest trade arrangement to be successful — standards that are similar to those in the U.S. — which is likely to incentivize Chinese auto manufacturing investment in Canada.

They’ll also have to establish which segment of the market they are targeting there: Higher-end vehicles, or less-expensive ones that sell at higher volumes.

Regardless, “It brings it home to what is needed to compete globally,” said Mark Wakefield, global automotive market lead at AlixPartners. The firm predicts Chinese brands will account for 30% of the global market by 2030.

“They’ve already started in Europe. They started in South America. Now Mexico and Canada,” Wakefield said. American carmakers “don’t want to end up as a Brazil with your ethanol-based cars that aren’t sellable anywhere else in the world and … like Britain or Australia that used to matter in the auto world, and no longer really matter.”

Why have others sought to regulate Chinese EV-makers’ expansion?

Countries have attempted to regulate Chinese EVs from entering their markets for several reasons.

“China has become this overwhelming machine making inexpensive vehicles. And the fear is that if you give them an inch, they’re going to take a mile,” Fiorani said. “The other issue is technology. These vehicles are data centers… and the idea that a state-owned company in China could have access to where a high portion of drivers are going gives them leverage for all kinds of outlets.”

The European Union hiked tariffs on Chinese EVs last year, though the two have been resolving that at the start of this year.

In 2024, former President Joe Biden set a 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars. Canada matched that import tax on the vehicles until this week. And even with an annual import cap, Canada cutting its tariffs this week means those companies are another step closer to U.S. soil. The Mexican auto market has welcomed Chinese EVs, with massive growth last year.

“The advance of Chinese manufacturers is inevitable. It will happen eventually. Everybody is negotiating to put up the roadblocks to figure out: What data is being processed, how much market share you’re going to allow Chinese manufacturers to have?” Fiorani added.

“There are a lot of guardrails that have to be put up, but eventually they’re going to make their way into all Western markets.”

Musk's artificial intelligence startup created a kind of off-grid power plant for its Colossus facility by using a cluster of gas-burning turbines. The company was able to avoid air pollution permitting by classifying the turbines, which were mounted on trailers, as ""non-road engines.""

The EPA's updated rule clarifies that those kinds of turbines can't be designated as non-road engines and companies must also obtain Clean Air Act permits before installing them, particularly if their aggregate emissions will go above ""major source thresholds"" of pollution.

The Shelby County Health Department in Memphis previously allowed xAI to designate its turbines as non-road engines, and to start using them without any public comment and environmental impact review, as would have been required in a standard permitting process.

Representatives from the county's health department and xAI didn't respond to requests for comment.

The move by the federal regulator could slow xAI's expansion in the Memphis area as it builds out facilities, packed with Nvidia's graphics processing units, to develop AI models and services in a booming generative AI market currently led by OpenAI and Google .

At the Memphis data center, which first opened in 2024, xAI conducts inference and training for its Grok models and apps, including a chatbot and image generator tightly integrated into the company's social network X.

While xAI had previously told Memphis regulators that its turbines would include state-of-the-art pollution controls, known as selective catalytic reduction technology, its supplier, Solaris Energy Infrastructure told CNBC in June that it did not install such controls in xAI's ""temporary"" turbines.

SEI, a Houston-based energy services provider, has seen its stock price soar in recent months, partly due to xAI's expansion plans. SEI didn't respond to a request for comment.

Pollution from the turbines has been a major source of local contention.

Last year, residents in the majority-Black community of Boxtown in South Memphis testified at public hearings about a rotten egg-like stench in the air, and the impact of worsening smog on their heart and lung health.

Research by scientists at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville also found that xAI's turbine use added to air pollution woes around Memphis.

Environmental advocates, including the NAACP, said they would sue to stop xAI's unpermitted use of the turbines. However, they didn't file a complaint after the county allowed xAI to treat the turbines as temporary, non-road engines, and issued them permits.

Canadian company TransAlta’s coal-burning power plant in Centralia, Washington, shut down Dec. 19, according to grid data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The plant has not re-started since then, despite a Dec. 16 emergency order from U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright to keep operating.

Washington state officials are challenging the Trump administration’s emergency order.

A state law enacted in 2011 required the Centralia plant to shut down by Dec. 31, while a 2019 law prohibits utilities from selling coal-based power in the state after 2025.

“There's no emergency,” said attorney Kelly Wood with the Washington Attorney General’s Office. “The authority that they're drawing upon here is reserved for times of war and times of actual, imminent emergency situations. So think of things like hurricanes, earthquakes.”

The Washington AG’s Office has requested the U.S. Department of Energy revoke the emergency order.

“The notion that there's some imminent threat of power loss in the Northwest is just false,” Wood said. “It's been a very wet season so far, and our reservoirs are all above capacity, and so hydropower is very abundant currently.”

The energy department has 30 days to reply before the state can sue to overturn the order.

Six environmental groups have filed a separate request with the Department of Energy seeking to revoke the emergency order.

Trump administration officials claim the coal power is needed because much of the country is at elevated risk of blackouts if extreme weather simultaneously hits broad stretches of the nation.

The energy department’s press office declined an interview request.

“The Trump Administration is committed to preventing the premature retirement of baseload power plants and building as much reliable, dispatchable generation as possible to achieve energy dominance,” Energy Department spokesperson Caroline Murzin said by email.

Officials with TransAlta, headquartered in Alberta, did not respond to interview requests.

Under the Federal Power Act, the secretary of energy can issue emergency orders effective for up to 90 days to stabilize the power grid.

The Trump administration has forced a coal-burning plant in Michigan to keep running since May by issuing three consecutive 90-day orders.

Sponsored

The TransAlta emergency order expires March 16.

Lauren McCloy with the Northwest Energy Coalition, one of the nonprofit groups challenging the emergency order, said the Centralia plant is typically idled each spring, when high flows on the Columbia River produce an abundance of cheap hydropower.

McCloy said the plant appears to be in “cold standby” mode—shut down but able to be switched back on again.

“They have been planning for the shutdown of this plant for a long time, and so they've deferred maintenance at the plant,” she said. “They have not been out shopping for a new coal contract. We don't really know what the status is of the ability for them to get more coal or to keep the plant operating.”

On Dec. 9, TransAlta announced it had reached a deal with Puget Sound Energy, Washington’s largest utility, to convert the Centralia plant and run it on natural gas for another 16 years. If that conversion takes place, the plant would become Washington’s largest gas-burning power plant.

Sponsored

The company’s website says the coal-to-gas conversion project “remains a priority for TransAlta.”

Natural gas produces less carbon dioxide and other pollutants when burned than coal does, but upstream leaks of methane, a climate super-pollutant, can make gas as harmful to the climate as coal.

Though the Centralia plant was considered a “baseload” source of electricity — more reliable than intermittent sources like wind or solar power — grid data shows it had shut down entirely for the first week of December before shutting down again on Dec. 19.

“The plant is affected by market conditions,” McCloy said. “Presumably, the reason the plant wasn't running during that time was because Puget Sound Energy didn't need the power, and the plant was not competitive with the other power that was available on the market.”

Sponsored

Puget Sound Energy and TransAlta had a long-term purchase agreement that expired Dec. 31.

Competition has pushed many coal plants out of business nationwide and replaced them with cheaper, gas-fired plants and wind turbines.

Blocking the nation’s aging coal plants from retiring would cost electricity consumers between $3 billion and $6 billion annually over the next three years, according to a report commissioned by environmental groups.

A Department of Energy fact sheet on Thursday said the Trump administration was “ending the war on beautiful, clean coal”— President Trump’s preferred term for the dirtiest of fossil fuels — by preventing the closure of five coal power plants.

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but it is patently false to call coal “clean.”

In 2023, despite having only one of its two boilers running, the Centralia plant was Washington’s largest source of heat-trapping carbon dioxide and of health-threatening pollutants including particulates, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and mercury, according to the Washington Department of Ecology.

On Dec. 29, TransAlta Centralia Vice President Mickey Dreher signed an agreement with the Washington Department of Ecology to clean up hazardous waste from 55 years of burning coal at the site.

Combustion of fossil fuels is the primary cause of the earth’s warming climate.

According to the Washington State Climate Office, 2025 was the state’s second-warmest year on record, with December 2025 its warmest December on record.

International scientific organizations reported in January that the last 11 years have been the hottest 11 years on record, with the pollution-induced warming accelerating in 2023, 2024, and 2025.

Wright said in a statement that President Trump had ""asked governors across the Mid-Atlantic to come together and call upon PJM to allow America to build big reliable power plants again.""

He promised that the directives would ""restore affordable and reliable electricity so American families thrive and America's manufacturing industries once again boom.""

JOHN, Associated Press",,,,,https://whnt.com/business/ap-business/ap-chinese-evs-are-making-inroads-in-north-america-that-worries-industry-experts/,"DETROIT (AP) — Chinese automakers have been making inroads around the world with growing sales of their high-tech, stylish and affordable electric vehicles.

The Mexican auto market has welcomed Chinese EVs, with massive growth last year.","DETROIT (AP) — Chinese automakers have been making inroads around the world with growing sales of their high-tech, stylish and affordable electric vehicles. That has had competitors concerned even before Canada this week agreed to cut its tariffs on Chinese EVs in exchange for concessions on Canadian farm products.

Experts now say an easier path into Canada could be a big boost for Chinese carmakers looking to dominate the global market — particularly as their domestic market weakens. That poses a threat to other auto manufacturers, particularly American companies.

U.S. officials acknowledged that in remarks at an assembly plant for Jeep-maker Stellantis in Toledo, Ohio on Friday. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the Chinese Communist Party invests in its auto industry to “control this industry.”

“Why? They want to take over the auto industry. They want to take away these jobs,” Duffy said. As far as the Canadian trade deal, he added: “They will live to regret the day they partner with China and bring in their vehicles.”

Others say the shift is inevitable.

“This is telling us that Chinese automakers continue to be really popular, and are doing better and better, and not just something that’s sold in global markets that are more marginal or less important to U.S. automakers,” said Ilaria Mazzocco, deputy director and senior fellow with the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

What makes Chinese vehicles stand out?

Chinese-made vehicles are high-quality, stylish and inexpensive, experts say.

“It’s clear that the vehicles made by Chinese brands come at a very competitive cost, but are also technologically quite desirable,” Mazzocco said. “They tend to be connected vehicles, so they have a lot of additional software capabilities that consumers seem to like. But the price point and the competitiveness are really big selling points.”

These vehicles can cost as little as $10,000 to $20,000; in the U.S., new vehicles are running close to $50,000 on average, and EVs even more so.

Chinese companies also have unique advantages as far as auto manufacturing and production, efficiency and making vehicles lighter, which helps extend an electrified vehicle’s driving range.

“They’ve found a way to make small and mid-sized cars — cars that people want — at a reasonable price,” said Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “These are the segments where GM and Ford and almost everybody else have abandoned.”

Many automakers have discontinued smaller vehicles in favor of higher-margin, large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that are far more profitable.

So why are Chinese EVs such a threat to U.S. automakers and others?

Much of the global auto market is electrifying, an ideal opportunity for advanced Chinese automakers to capitalize on. China saw 17% growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles in 2025, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week, and Europe saw a 33% increase.

Meanwhile, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1% last year. As the rest of the world advances, U.S. automakers have weakened their once-ambitious, multibillion dollar electrification plans, instead opting for more efficient hybrid electric and gasoline vehicles amid the Trump administration’s shift away from EV-friendly policy.

That shift threatens U.S. automakers’ competitive edge in the coming years. As is, Tesla lost its crown as the world’s bestselling electric vehicle maker last year, delivering only 1.64 million vehicles in 2025 to Chinese rival BYD’s 2.26 million.

Trump administration policy slashing emissions rules at a time when Chinese companies are advancing quickly has experts worried for the future of American car manufacturers.

Chinese automakers will have to meet standards required for the Canadian auto market for the latest trade arrangement to be successful — standards that are similar to those in the U.S. — which is likely to incentivize Chinese auto manufacturing investment in Canada.

They’ll also have to establish which segment of the market they are targeting there: Higher-end vehicles, or less-expensive ones that sell at higher volumes.

Regardless, “It brings it home to what is needed to compete globally,” said Mark Wakefield, global automotive market lead at AlixPartners. The firm predicts Chinese brands will account for 30% of the global market by 2030.

“They’ve already started in Europe. They started in South America. Now Mexico and Canada,” Wakefield said. American carmakers “don’t want to end up as a Brazil with your ethanol-based cars that aren’t sellable anywhere else in the world and … like Britain or Australia that used to matter in the auto world, and no longer really matter.”

Why have others sought to regulate Chinese EV-makers’ expansion?

Countries have attempted to regulate Chinese EVs from entering their markets for several reasons.

“China has become this overwhelming machine making inexpensive vehicles. And the fear is that if you give them an inch, they’re going to take a mile,” Fiorani said. “The other issue is technology. These vehicles are data centers… and the idea that a state-owned company in China could have access to where a high portion of drivers are going gives them leverage for all kinds of outlets.”

The European Union hiked tariffs on Chinese EVs last year, though the two have been resolving that at the start of this year.

In 2024, former President Joe Biden set a 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars. Canada matched that import tax on the vehicles until this week. And even with an annual import cap, Canada cutting its tariffs this week means those companies are another step closer to U.S. soil. The Mexican auto market has welcomed Chinese EVs, with massive growth last year.

“The advance of Chinese manufacturers is inevitable. It will happen eventually. Everybody is negotiating to put up the roadblocks to figure out: What data is being processed, how much market share you’re going to allow Chinese manufacturers to have?” Fiorani added.

“There are a lot of guardrails that have to be put up, but eventually they’re going to make their way into all Western markets.”

“Today’s announcement that DENSO is making a long-term $69 million investment in our community is great news for Wilson County,” said Wilson County Mayor Randall Hutto.","Laser Isotope Separation (LIS) Technologies plans to invest $1.38 billion to expand in Roane County, Tennessee. The company will create 203 jobs in Oak Ridge, on the formerly named Duct Island. The project is the third-largest nuclear-related investment since the creation of Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development’s (TNECD) Nuclear Energy Fund.

Upon completion, the Oak Ridge facility, which will locate on the historic K-25 uranium enrichment site, is intended to become the first U.S.-origin commercial laser uranium enrichment plant in the world, supporting U.S. utilities, next-generation reactor developers and national defense requirements while helping to reestablish a resilient domestic nuclear fuel supply chain.

“Selecting Oak Ridge is both a strategic and symbolic decision for LIS Technologies,” remarked Jay Yu, executive chairman and CEO, LIS Technologies. “This community represents the foundation of America’s enrichment capability and the future of its clean energy and national security mission. Our laser enrichment technology fundamentally changes the economics of enrichment, enabling faster deployment, lower capital intensity and long-term cost advantages. With our NRC licensing process underway, we are moving deliberately toward construction readiness and positioning the U.S. to lead the world in commercial laser enrichment.”

“This investment represents more than the construction of a single facility,” said Christo Liebenberg, president and co-founder, LIS Technologies. “It reflects a commitment to restoring a critical domestic capability, advancing peaceful nuclear technologies and strengthening the U.S.’ competitiveness in an evolving global energy landscape. As global demand for nuclear fuel grows and existing supply tightens, the opportunity – and responsibility – to act is clear. This project is a meaningful step toward reestablishing U.S. enrichment capacity and rebuilding the nuclear fuel cycle.”

The project underscores Oak Ridge’s role in America’s nuclear enterprise and reinforces Tennessee’s position at the forefront of the nation’s efforts to rebuild domestic uranium enrichment capacity critical to U.S. energy and national security.

The announcement follows recent funding LIS Technologies received from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). In 2024, the company was selected by the DOE as one of six domestic companies to participate in the Low-Enriched Uranium (LEU) Enrichment Acquisition Program. This initiative allocates up to $3.4 billion in funding, with contracts anticipated to last up to 10 years.

Founded in 2023 with its office and laser enrichment research and development headquartered in Oak Ridge in the recently renovated K-1330 building, LIS Technologies is the seventh company to locate in Tennessee for its commercial operations utilizing the Nuclear Energy Fund.

The $50 million fund was in Gov. Lee’s recommended 2023-2024 budget and approved by the Tennessee General Assembly. An additional $10 million was allocated and approved in the state’s budget during both the 2024 and 2025 legislative sessions, bringing the fund’s total to $70 million since its inception.

“Tennessee is leading the nation in advancing American energy independence, which is why innovative companies like LIS Technologies are choosing to do business here,” commented Governor Bill Lee. “By creating the Nuclear Energy Fund, we have uniquely positioned our state at the forefront of cutting-edge research and development, and I look forward to the opportunity this expansion will create for Tennesseans.”

“This investment reflects the continued momentum of Tennessee’s nuclear sector and builds on a strong year for nuclear energy in our state,” said Deputy Gov. and Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development (TNECD) Commissioner Stuart C. McWhorter. “LIS Technologies’ nearly $1.4 billion investment is a major win for Tennessee, and we believe Oak Ridge is uniquely positioned to support this project’s success. I am grateful to the leadership of LIS Technologies and to our partners in Oak Ridge for helping bring today’s announcement to fruition.”

DENSO To Invest $69M In New Lebanon Manufacturing Facility

Mobility supplier DENSO will invest $69 million to build an advanced logistics center in Lebanon, TN. The project will retain 100 jobs in the area and position DENSO to optimize its operations, enhance competitiveness, and better serve customers across North America.

The new 280,000-square-foot facility, targeted to break ground in summer 2026 and open in spring 2027, will replace DENSO’s current operation in Wilson County with a larger, more technologically advanced space. All current team members in Wilson County will have the opportunity to transition to the new location in a phased timeline, ensuring continuity for DENSO’s workforce and operations.

The project is supported by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the Joint Economic & Community Development Board of Wilson County (JECDB).

“We thank TVA and our local Wilson County partners for their support of our investment in Lebanon, which marks a significant milestone for DENSO and our Tennessee operations,” said Tomoyuki “Tom” Arakawa, CEO of DENSO in North America and an executive officer of DENSO Corporation. “Through this new, cutting-edge facility, we’ll not only improve how we deliver to customers but also create new opportunities for our team to work with the latest robotics and automation technologies. It’s a win-win that sets up our customers and team for future success.”

Marty Deschenes, North America chief manufacturing officer and an executive vice president at DENSO, added, “The transformation of our Wilson County operation is about more than a new building. It’s about empowering our team members, improving our speed and flexibility and, ultimately, advancing DENSO into a new era of operational excellence.”

“Congratulations to DENSO on its decision to expand operations in Wilson County. TVA, Middle Tennessee Electric, JECDB, along with its many partners have a shared commitment to supporting economic growth in the communities we serve,” said Heidi Smith, senior vice president of Economic Development, TVA. “We are proud to celebrate this announcement today and look forward to DENSO’s continued success in the region.”

The new facility will feature advanced safety and security systems, a climate-controlled environment, dedicated locker rooms, and expanded break areas, reflecting DENSO’s ongoing efforts to enhance the workplace experience for its team members. The update advances DENSO’s broader strategy to standardize and strengthen its manufacturing operations while aligning its distribution network with the company’s long-term priorities. This approach will be continuously refined to ensure it meets the evolving needs of customers and team members.

“Today’s announcement that DENSO is making a long-term $69 million investment in our community is great news for Wilson County,” said Wilson County Mayor Randall Hutto. “We work hard to recruit and retain world-class employers in Wilson County, and when a company like DENSO, which has never laid off a full-time associate in their over 35-year history in Tennessee, commits to not only retain but elevate already high-quality jobs, it shows that we’re succeeding.”",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/lis-technologies.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 20:59:27.935270

Louisiana Impact Fund Launched

Louisiana Impact Fund I, LLC (LIF, or the Fund) announced its initial closing and launch of a Louisiana-based, lower middle-market private equity fund dedicated to investing in companies located in or meaningfully connected to Louisiana. Led by Co-Founders and Managing Partners Joseph Seremet, Jared Quoyeser and Joshua Cummings, LIF is targeting $100 million in total capitalization focused exclusively on acquiring and growing businesses located in the state.

“Our purpose is simple: help founders and owners scale or transition their companies without handing ownership and decision making to out-of-state buyers,” said Jared Quoyeser, Co-Founder and Managing Partner. “We will measure success ﬁrst by returns, and second by how we grow and keep headquarters, wealth, jobs, and next-generation leaders here at home.”

The Fund’s anchor limited partners include leading Louisiana employers, family offices and civic institutions committed to keeping ownership and jobs in-state. The limited partners include Acadian Ambulance Service; John E. Atkins; Business First Bancshares; Scott Ballard; Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana; Rock Bordelon; Bradley and Henry Busch; Daryl Deshotel; JJPF Investments; North Louisiana Economic Partnership; Ochsner Health; Reilly Family; Stream Family; Bryan Schroder; and Heidi Raines (Redmond).

Though not an investor, Louisiana Economic Development (LED) is a key partner that will also help the fund support and identify promising companies and deal opportunities.

“The Louisiana Impact Fund reflects our commitment to helping businesses grow, expand and remain a part of our state’s economy,” LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said. “When ownership and decision-making stay here at home, we create quality jobs, attract new investment and strengthen community leadership across the state. This partnership shows the power of Louisiana-led growth and our shared focus on creating lasting opportunity for our people.”

LIF will invest in established Louisiana businesses through majority or significant minority positions — especially founder transitions, recapitalizations and growth capital — where the Fund and its network can unlock contract-backed expansion and operational upgrades without relocating headquarters. Primary areas of focus include industrial services, engineering & construction, distributed power solutions, infrastructure/EPC, energy technology and innovation, advanced manufacturing, healthcare, logistics and software.

Jones Walker LLP serves as fund formation counsel to LIF and Bennett Thrasher serves LIF’s third-party fund administration advisor.

Site Readiness In New Mexico

Less than a year after the Site Readiness Act became law, the New Mexico Economic Development Department has evaluated 47 development sites statewide, launched a public site readiness map, and established a new board to certify sites for business expansion.

Following the passage of SB 169 (Site Readiness) and SB 170 (Utility Pre-deployment) during the 2025 legislative session, EDD moved to put the framework into action. The program focuses on preparing land for development by identifying infrastructure needs, utility access, and site conditions that support timely project delivery and job creation.

“New Mexico is ready to compete for economic development projects that create opportunities for our families,” said EDD Cabinet Secretary Rob Black. “Our site readiness program is setting the stage, so it’s easier for companies to choose New Mexico and easier for our state to win.”

EDD partnered with Global Location Strategies (GLS) to evaluate, or “characterize,” sites across the state. Working closely with local governments and tribal communities, the department assessed industrial properties and produced site-specific recommendations related to infrastructure, utilities and development readiness.

Several sites have already been identified as immediately or near-term competitive for industrial investment. In addition to the 47 sites that have been evaluated, inquiries for 12 more sites have already been submitted for the next round of evaluations.

To support transparency and business recruitment, EDD also contracted with GIS WebTech, a site selection technology company, to develop a new public site-readiness map. The map allows companies, site selectors and community partners to explore evaluated sites and better understand development opportunities across New Mexico. The map can be found on EDD’s website at EDD.NewMexico.gov/sites.

The newly created Strategic Economic Development Site Advisory Committee will oversee the grading and certification of sites as “strategic economic development sites,” making them eligible for pre-development funding and technical assistance. The committee held its first meeting earlier this month.

The next round of evaluations is scheduled to begin in February 2026 and submissions can be made online at edd.newmexico.gov/site-submit.

Arlington, Texas: Supporting Small Business

An industry-specific small business cohort, the latest free offering from the Arlington Economic Development Corporation (EDC) in Texas, connects Arlington-based small businesses to subject matter experts through programming that directly addresses their sector.

Since September 2025, there have been two cohorts — Professional Services and Construction — serving 20 Arlington businesses. The program is geared towards established companies looking to take their business to the next level.

“We strive to offer a range of programs for different levels of entrepreneurship, and thought it was especially important to provide tangible, industry-specific insights as well as information beyond just startup basics,” said Kay Brown-Patrick, Assistant Executive Director of the Arlington EDC.

“In addition to class content, the program gives participants access to networking with like-minded professionals, potential clients and key industry experts,” she said.

Bwana Thurman, CEO of financial education and technology company BluPrint Worldwide, is a graduate of the professional services cohort. “My experience was informative and enlightening. One piece that has been extremely useful to me was how to improve my client experience and do a deep dive into my analytics,” Thurman said.

For Juan F. De Leon, CEO of De Leon’s Designs and graduate of the construction cohort, the experience went a step beyond the useful information provided in sessions — it made him feel seen. “There are a lot of programs and services for more white-collar professions, but construction folks are not often well-represented. This is something that I’ve been looking for, and it felt so good that it catered to our community,” said De Leon. “I’m proud to have the certificate hanging in my office.”

The cohorts received a proclamation from Arlington Mayor Jim Ross on January 6, 2026 to recognize their work in the community and commitment to entrepreneurship.

The next cohort, geared toward the Food & Beverage industry, will take place in March 2026. To learn more about the program, visit the Business Resources page at ArlingtonTxEDC.com.

In Wyoming, AI Infrastructure Moves Forward

In July 2025, Crusoe Energy LLC, an AI infrastructure provider, announced a partnership with Tallgrass to develop a 1.8 gigawatt (GW) AI data center campus located in southeast Wyoming, in Cheyenne. Designed to scale up to 10 gigawatts, the AI data center campus was stated to leverage a diverse and robust power strategy, integrating multiple energy sources fueled by natural gas and future renewable energy developments in the region.

Last week, the Laramie County Board of Commissioners approved facilities site plans for the data center campus and power plant. Referred to as the BFC Power and Cheyenne Power Hub Project, the endeavor is led by Tallgrass Integrated Logistics Solutions LLC, a sustainable energy infrastructure company based in Denver. The power plant will provide power for the Crusoe data center campus.

Originally announced for a 1.8 gigawatt generation, the most recent news has said the initial development of the power plant will generate up to 2.7 gigawatts of electrical power.

The company’s portfolio of AI data centers includes its flagship 1.2 GW data center under construction in Abilene, Texas, and the company has broken ground on another 1+ GW campus at a new site.",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/incentives-infrastructure-update_icon.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 20:59:32.639391

Douglas explained that today’s primary short-term use in smaller manufacturers involves data aggregation to track quality and vibration analysis to extend machine motor lifespans. Even simpler, cheaper solutions include pointing a camera at an analog dial and having AI log the data.

“AI is very good at going through that data and finding correlations, telling us when things are drifting off the mean, and how to re-center them. It’s a lot of opportunity, but it creates a whole amount of other things we have to do,” Douglas said.

Douglas and Kelly also explained that large manufacturers tend to use the cloud, which raises cybersecurity and connectivity risks, requiring stronger protections around software as AI gets better at encoding process knowledge in these machines.

Kelly specifically advised those in manufacturing to “own your own destiny” by owning their own intellectual property (IP) in designs and patents, and by digitizing it for easier, more profitable distribution and production, similar to how Apple created FairPlay to monetize MP3 files.

“If we can figure out a way to protect IP so that I can have a widget and I can have it as a digital drawing in a CAD file … send you that CAD file … and you’re allowed to make one … or maybe you’re allowed to make 100,” he said, “then you get the margin, and I get the royalty, and the customer gets the product … I’ve now Amazon’ed manufacturing. And what does manufacturing become? An IP plan.”

The trio also discussed the workforce development issues in the industry. Despite what some might say, there is a lot of opportunity for apprenticeships and upskilling for new and existing workers to use AI as an efficiency tool rather than just a job replacement. Douglas and Kelly suggested that removing repetitive work for some machinists and technicians can help them become more creative and engage in higher-value problem-solving and innovation, which supports IP creation for companies.

“We have lots of apprenticeships that we’re pushing people into to try to get more and more skilled trades and upskilling,” Douglas said. “Even the people we do have, we have had to do some retraining [from multimeters to IO-links for diagnostics].”

Further, the three experts implored the audience to improve the industry’s reputation among young people by showing them that these aren’t the messy, antiquated facilities “that their parents told them about,” but instead are filled with robots and automation on a much larger scale, beyond smart lights around the house. Kelly also specifically advised older employees and leaders to be open to learning from young people, as the young adults that are coming out of school are digital natives more so than not.

“The auto industry is one of the few places where you can use AI and software and see the fruits of your labor physically manifest,” Kelly said. “It’s really cool and really powerful, and that hooks kids.”",https://michauto.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2026-Detroit-Auto-Show_5-feature.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 21:59:02.403393

“On one hand, the one-time commitment to support electric vehicle incentives for light-duty drivers is welcome, as it helps offset the lack of federal incentives.","Electric utilities are taking a leading role in addressing the daily affordability of electric vehicles (EV), offering direct-to-consumer subsidies and other incentives at a time when the federal government has pulled back on initiatives to bring down the cost of the vehicles.

Companies in California are planning to launch programs that would make funding available for needy households to use public EV charging networks. Meanwhile, an electricity provider in the state’s Bay Area is helping to subsidize its customers in their purchase of hundreds of electric bikes (e-bikes).

“This supports our mission to deliver clean and affordable energy by reducing the financial barriers to EV charging,” Jeff Monford, senior adviser for Corporate Communications at Edison International, parent company for electric utility Southern California Edison (SCE), said. Doing so, he added, “is the same thing as reducing the barriers to EV adoption.”

SCE, in partnership with San Diego Gas and Electric and Pacific Gas and Electric, will launch a program later this year making pre-loaded debit cards available to income-qualifying households that can prove they do not have access to home EV charging. The debit cards would provide $50 a week, up to $2,600 a year, to be used at public charging locations.

The income qualifications align with SCE’s Pre-Owned EV Rebate credit program and are based on enrollment in public assistance programs like Medi-Cal — the state’s version of Medicaid — or the CalFresh food assistance program, among others.

The program will work in partnership with utility providers in the Bay Area and the San Diego metro region, making millions of low-income households eligible for the $21.8 million, three-year initiative.

In Northern California, Ava Community Energy, a nonprofit electric utility serving about 600,000 customers in Alameda and San Joaquin counties, has issued 9,400 rebates to San Joaquin customers who purchased e-bikes. Rebates start at $400 and can reach $1,000 for income-qualified participants. Rebates for electric cargo bikes bring a higher return; they start at $900 and reach $1,500 for needy qualifiers.

So far, about 2,750 rebates have been redeemed, Lisbeth Gallegos, a marketing associate at Ava Community Energy who heads up the program, said.

“Participants report using e-bikes not just recreationally, but for everyday transportation, such as commuting, errands, and replacing short car trips, helping make biking more accessible and reducing car dependence,” Gallegos said in an email.

The EV bike rebate program launched in June, and more than 14,900 residents applied. Roughly 22 percent of those who did have been qualified based on their income. Funding is still available, and Ava intends to continue the program through December, as part of a longer-term transportation and emissions-reduction strategy, with the final random drawing currently planned for September.

These programs and others center on addressing the affordability of EVs, targeting their overall cost of ownership, a strategy advocates and policy leaders have offered as an updated talking point as the EV movement stalls or retreats in the U.S. in the face of diminished federal support.

California, the state with the largest share of EVs on the road, hopes to blunt any slowdowns in their adoption by its nearly 28 million drivers. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s latest proposed budget would allocate $200 million for EV incentive programs, largely targeting the light-duty market, a move that received mixed reviews from advocates.

“On one hand, the one-time commitment to support electric vehicle incentives for light-duty drivers is welcome, as it helps offset the lack of federal incentives. On the other hand, the budget falls woefully short when it comes to incentives for zero-emission trucks, buses, and community mobility options,” Michael Berube, CALSTART CEO, said in a statement.

The governor’s budget, Berube said, “effectively zeros out” $750 million in discretionary funding to support clean-transportation programs.

“Their size and the risks they pose to resource adequacy make today’s data centers unique,” it said.
As an incentive, the governors and Trump administration officials said the builders of new plants should be provided “revenue certainty” for 15 years.
“Reliable baseload power” is a code phrase for fossil fuel and nuclear plants for Trump administration officials, who dismiss solar and wind power as inherently unreliable.
Yesterday, elected officials held a rally in Pittsburgh denouncing the Trump administration for its failure to lower energy costs for consumers.","Rising electricity costs and the rapid build-out of energy-hungry data centers across the mid-Atlantic region brought a bipartisan group of governors to the White House Friday for an agreement on a joint action plan meant to “ensure data centers pay their fair share.” The proposal also would extend a wholesale price cap that is now in place, possibly shielding consumers from further increases.

The Trump administration laced the announcement with jabs at the Biden administration, and the plan amounted to a nonbinding deal the parties are urging the region’s grid operator, PJM Interconnection, to adopt. Environmental advocates worry that the proposal will prioritize natural gas plants over renewable energy resources that have been stuck in a bottleneck waiting for PJM’s approval to be connected to the regional grid.

Thirteen governors, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum signed a “statement of principles” saying that PJM must extend for two years a price cap that the grid operator last year agreed to place on costs related to making sure the region has enough power plant capacity to meet demand. (Mayor Muriel Bowser of the District of Columbia, also part of PJM’s region, did not participate.) It was not clear how many of the governors came to the White House meeting, and President Donald Trump himself was not scheduled to participate.

The governors’ and Trump administration’s statement said PJM should accelerate the build-out of new power plants by holding an “emergency” special auction for new capacity by September. The costs of any new capacity to serve data centers in those auctions should be allocated to the data centers, the joint statement said. “Their size and the risks they pose to resource adequacy make today’s data centers unique,” it said.

As an incentive, the governors and Trump administration officials said the builders of new plants should be provided “revenue certainty” for 15 years. Such a revenue guarantee has the potential to upend the basics of PJM’s market, which has long relied on market forces and competition to set prices.

It will be up to PJM, the nation’s largest grid operator, to decide whether to implement the plan. The governing board of PJM discussed the issue at a previously scheduled meeting in the afternoon. Late in the day, the board announced some steps that were in line with the proposal from the governors and Trump administration, including that it would initiate a “backstop generation procurement” process to address its short-term needs for more power.

PJM also said it would begin a “holistic review” of incentives throughout its market, acknowledging that it was not seeing adequate resource investment under the current framework of short-term contracts. But the grid operator said it would be seeking more feedback from stakeholders before deciding whether to extend the wholesale price cap.

“PJM is reviewing the principles set forth by the White House and governors,” the grid operator said in a prepared statement, adding the board had been deliberating on the issue for months with input from market participants. “We will work with our stakeholders to assess how the White House directive aligns with the Board’s decision.”

PJM spokesperson Jeff Shields said in an email that the grid operator was not invited to the White House meeting.

PJM manages the flow of electricity on a grid serving 67 million customers in 13 states and the District of Columbia. Electricity rates have been soaring nationwide as demand has been rising. The mid-Atlantic states have been among the hardest hit, with residential prices up 22 percent in Maryland, 16.5 percent in Pennsylvania and Virginia and 14.6 percent in New Jersey in the period from January to October 2025, the most recent data available from the Energy Information Administration.

Electricity prices were a top issue in the November election, with both New Jersey and Virginia choosing Democratic governors who pledged to get a hold on prices.

In announcing the agreement with the governors, however, the Trump administration sought to shift the blame for the prices to its predecessors and states that have voted for Democrats.

“High electricity prices are a choice,” said a fact sheet the Department of Energy issued. “Regions that aligned themselves with the Biden administration’s energy subtraction agenda and shut down reliable baseload power are paying the price.”

“For too long, the Green New Scam has left Mid-Atlantic families in the dark with skyrocketing bills,” Burgum said in a prepared statement.

But the three states that saw the highest electricity price increases—of more than 30 percent—from January to October were Oklahoma, Wyoming and North Dakota, all of which voted for Trump and all of which are fossil fuel-reliant states. “Reliable baseload power” is a code phrase for fossil fuel and nuclear plants for Trump administration officials, who dismiss solar and wind power as inherently unreliable.

The administration’s anti-renewable energy policies are adding to PJM’s woes, the grid operator indicated in a legal brief filed earlier this month. PJM said the Trump administration’s move to block offshore wind projects off the Atlantic coast was harming its ability to provide sufficient reliable power in its region.

On Friday, the federal judge in that case ruled that the project in question—Dominion Energy’s $11 billion Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project—could resume construction while the legal battle on offshore wind continues. It was the third federal court ruling against the Trump administration’s offshore wind policy in a week.

Environmental and climate action advocates said that by side-stepping any discussion of renewable energy in their statement of principles, the governors and the Trump administration were missing a major solution to the region’s electricity problems.

“The omission of clean energy from this announcement is glaring,” Julia Kortrey, director of strategic initiatives for the advocacy group Evergreen Action, said in a statement. “Clean energy sources are the fastest and cheapest way to get power online to meet skyrocketing data center demand. Without fixing PJM’s broken interconnection process and allowing ready-to-build clean energy resources onto the grid, this deal could amount to little more than a band aid over a mortal wound.”

David Masur, executive director at PennEnvironment, an environmental organization in Pennsylvania, said the agreement was not likely to “move the needle” in terms of helping Americans pay their energy bills.

“If that was the goal, I don’t think people should expect that,” he said. Even if data centers are required to build their own power plants, they will still cause major strain on grid infrastructure that was already struggling to meet rising demand and dealing with costs related to climate change and severe weather before the advent of AI.

“Holding data centers accountable and making them responsible for their own costs is a big step in the right direction,” said Elowyn Corby, the mid-Atlantic regional director at Vote Solar, an affordable-solar advocacy group.

But she cautioned that “details matter.” PJM’s absence and the non-binding aspect of the deal raise questions about how it would actually be implemented.

Corby and other clean energy advocates are concerned that by establishing a special emergency process tailored to the data center problem, the agreement could incentivize the construction of more natural gas power plants at the expense of renewable energy projects that have languished in PJM’s queue for years. Increasing the region’s reliance on natural gas would likely add to electricity costs, particularly as gas prices are set to soar in the near future because of several factors, including an increase in exports of U.S. liquified natural gas.

Claire Lang-Ree, a climate and energy advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said it was important that the fast-track process that the agreement outlined for powering data centers did not displace resources already in PJM’s interconnection queue, especially those designed to help meet state clean energy standards.

With thousands of clean energy resources waiting to join PJM, she said, “it would be really unfair to let an onslaught of things like gas plants cut in front of those resources just to privilege data centers.”

In addition to its attacks on renewable energy projects and advocacy for coal, oil and gas, the Trump administration has championed the rapid build-out of data centers. In July, Trump hailed $90 billion in private investments for artificial intelligence in Pennsylvania, calling it “a really triumphant day for the people of the Commonwealth and for the United States of America.”

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat who spearheaded the litigation against PJM that led to the temporary price ceiling the grid operator put in place last year, agreed to participate in Friday’s event at the White House only if extension of that cap would be part of the principles articulated by the group, said a source familiar with the governor’s plan.

In September, Shapiro convened a conference in Philadelphia about PJM, where representatives from 11 of the 13 states that make up the membership in the grid agreed to work together to find solutions. At the time, Shapiro threatened to leave PJM if the operator did not “get serious about making significant reform.” Because Pennsylvania is the largest energy producer in the grid, leaving PJM would have serious repercussions for the states left behind.

Among the reforms Shapiro has pushed for are state influence over who serves on PJM’s board, a faster and more streamlined process for approving new power projects in PJM’s queue and changes to its capacity market.

“If PJM refuses to change, we will be forced to go in a different direction,” Shapiro said in September.

Shapiro filed his complaint against PJM in 2024 over its price hikes. The settlement reached in January 2025 lowered the capacity auction price cap by 35 percent. Shapiro said that the deal would save electricity consumers more than $21 billion over the next two years.

“The Shapiro administration can and should point to the extension of the price cap that is part of this plan as a big win that honestly wouldn’t have happened without them,” Corby said.

Affordability issues are likely to play a key role in the elections this fall, and Shapiro recently announced his campaign for reelection. In his first campaign speech in Philadelphia, Shapiro said “we’ve got to hold those companies that are trying to raise our electric bills accountable.”

Some residents have criticized the governor for his support for building more data centers in the state, arguing it’s at odds with his focus on affordable energy bills. Artificial intelligence is fueling the enormous spike in electricity demand that has sent prices skyrocketing.

Politicians like Shapiro, facing pressure from energy companies, tech corporations, labor unions and members of the public who are angry about their bills, may find it increasingly difficult to manage these competing demands. “I’m not sure that at the end of the day, they can have their cake and eat it too,” Masur said.

Yesterday, elected officials held a rally in Pittsburgh denouncing the Trump administration for its failure to lower energy costs for consumers.

“Donald Trump promised working people he would cut energy bills in half, yet what families got instead was a coordinated assault by him and congressional Republicans on the clean energy investments that lower costs, create good union jobs and protect our future,” said U.S. Rep. Summer Lee (D-Pa.), in a press release about the event.

Masur said the governors’ proposal was taking one step forward and one step back. Progress on the fundamental problem of PJM’s unapproved backlog of electricity projects would be key.

“Advocates have been flagging it for years that there’s a train coming down the track, and we can all see it coming,” and PJM hasn’t done anything about it, he said. “If we could put a man on the moon 60 years ago, PJM should be able to figure out how to get these projects moving rapidly out of their queue.”

Corby agreed with Masur’s assessment.

On Friday, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright and US Interior Secretary (and former Microsoft exec) Doug Burgum met with mid-Atlantic governors to pressure PJM Interconnection - one of the largest grid operators in the country - to hold an emergency auction to address rising energy demand from AI datacenter developments to the tune of $15 billion.

PJM is home to the largest concentration of datacenters in the US. Many new bit barns now exceed 100 megawatts of power capacity, with the likes of OpenAI and Meta already eyeing multi-gigawatt campuses.

These buildouts have sparked fears of higher power bills for local residents, something that hasn't sat well with politicians on either side of the aisle.

Last month, a trio of Democratic senators launched a probe into why consumers were seeing higher rates despite datacenter operators' claims otherwise.

Rising energy prices haven't been popular with the US president either. On Monday, Trump used his personal echo chamber Truth Social to declare ""I never want Americans to pay higher electricity bills because of datacenters.""

The initiative launched on Friday seeks to secure new baseload power generation, with US tech titans putting up the cash for 15-year contracts.

The DoE argues such an auction is justified after PJM's decision to take 17 gigawatts of capacity offline between 2020 and 2025. Much of the capacity which was already retired or slated for retirement was produced by coal-fired steam generators, for which Trump has shown a particular affinity.

""In the coming years, America's reindustrialization and the AI race will require a significantly larger supply of around-the-clock, reliable, and uninterrupted power,"" an Energy.gov fact sheet reads. ""The United States cannot afford to continue down the unstable and dangerous path of energy subtraction previous leaders pursued, forcing the closure of baseload power sources like coal and natural gas.""

In response to the Trump administration's demands, PJM's board of managers released a plan Friday directing the grid operator's staff to ""develop a proposal to both accelerate and execute"" a backstop procurement to supplement the company's last capacity auction.

The idea of datacenters bringing their own power has gained momentum in recent months, as operators have grappled with both long-term and immediate energy demands.

These efforts have included commissioning new gas generator plants along with portable generators to serve as stopgaps. Meanwhile, hyperscalers have placed bets on nuclear power startups like Oklo or X-Energy to satisfy their long-term power demands.

In a blog post on Tuesday, Microsoft formalized its commitments to ""pay its way"" to ensure local utility customers didn't end up footing the bill.

In spite of these initiatives, supply chain challenges continue to dog operators. Gas generators offer an easy path to addressing demand, but the equipment necessary to build and deploy them is locked up, with waitlists stretching out to 2030.

Additionally, the judge noted the Administration failed to respond to most of Empire Wind’s claims, nor did they contest that the construction pause was an arbitrary and capricious action.

Empire Wind 1, which is currently 60 percent complete, is set to provide 810 MW of power generation to New York and has created more than 2,000 jobs to build the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal, sparked investments, and kindled the construction of at least eight new vessels from Pennsylvania, Louisiana and Mississippi shipyards.

To build this project, the developer purchased export cables from a South Carolina factory and cable components from Upstate New York that prompted the construction of a new factory - microcosms of a supply chain that stretches across 30 states. Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind-Commercial (2,586 MW), Sunrise Wind (924 MW), and Vineyard Wind 1 (800 MW) are still subject to the construction pause and lease suspension.

“Oceantic welcomes today’s ruling that allows Empire Wind to once again advance toward delivering reliable, affordable power to 500,000 homes and supporting good-paying jobs to communities across New York” said Oceantic Network CEO Liz Burdock. “Empire Wind is critical to securing New York's electric grid, stabilizing rising energy costs for local communities, creating jobs, and achieving energy independence, underscoring the importance of building out America’s energy infrastructure to meet rising electricity demand.”

There are significant economic consequences associated with pausing the construction of the five US projects during installation:

Once operational, the five projects are expected to bring 5.8 GW of much-needed power generation online, enough for 2.5 million homes, and to help the states keep rising power costs in check.

Stopping these projects means $30 billion of fully permitted economic activity has been paused and threatens more than $11 billion in supply chain assets that have spun up to support construction.

Stopping these projects threatens at least 12,000 American jobs directly supporting their buildout.

Construction of these projects has sparked more than 1,000 supply chain contracts to 675 unique American businesses across 41 states, spanning domestic shipyards, upgraded ports, and a massive resurgence in American steel. More than 24% are coming from Gulf suppliers.

Building and maintaining these projects has initiated at least 40 new vessel orders or specialized retrofits, totaling nearly $2 billion in activity at American steel mills and shipyards.

This latest ruling follows recent industry court victories against the administration’s attempts to slow down offshore wind. Just days ago, a federal judge allowed Revolution Wind to resume work after granting their injunction request against the administration’s lease suspension and stop construction order issued December 22, 2025, citing a lack of urgency to resolve the security concerns which didn’t indicate an emergency suspension was necessary. In December, a federal judge vacated the Administration's previous permitting pause, ruling it unlawful.

Countries have attempted to regulate Chinese EVs from entering their markets for several reasons.
The Mexican auto market has welcomed Chinese EVs, with massive growth last year.","DETROIT (AP) — Chinese automakers have been making inroads around the world with growing sales of their high-tech, stylish and affordable electric vehicles. That has had competitors concerned even before Canada this week agreed to cut its tariffs on Chinese EVs in exchange for concessions on Canadian farm products.

Experts now say an easier path into Canada could be a big boost for Chinese carmakers looking to dominate the global market — particularly as their domestic market weakens. That poses a threat to other auto manufacturers, particularly American companies.

U.S. officials acknowledged that in remarks at an assembly plant for Jeep-maker Stellantis in Toledo, Ohio on Friday. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the Chinese Communist Party invests in its auto industry to “control this industry.”

“Why? They want to take over the auto industry. They want to take away these jobs,” Duffy said. As far as the Canadian trade deal, he added: “They will live to regret the day they partner with China and bring in their vehicles.”

Others say the shift is inevitable.

“This is telling us that Chinese automakers continue to be really popular, and are doing better and better, and not just something that’s sold in global markets that are more marginal or less important to U.S. automakers,” said Ilaria Mazzocco, deputy director and senior fellow with the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

What makes Chinese vehicles stand out?

Chinese-made vehicles are high-quality, stylish and inexpensive, experts say.

“It’s clear that the vehicles made by Chinese brands come at a very competitive cost, but are also technologically quite desirable,” Mazzocco said. “They tend to be connected vehicles, so they have a lot of additional software capabilities that consumers seem to like. But the price point and the competitiveness are really big selling points.”

These vehicles can cost as little as $10,000 to $20,000; in the U.S., new vehicles are running close to $50,000 on average, and EVs even more so.

Chinese companies also have unique advantages as far as auto manufacturing and production, efficiency and making vehicles lighter, which helps extend an electrified vehicle’s driving range.

“They’ve found a way to make small and mid-sized cars — cars that people want — at a reasonable price,” said Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “These are the segments where GM and Ford and almost everybody else have abandoned.”

Many automakers have discontinued smaller vehicles in favor of higher-margin, large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that are far more profitable.

So why are Chinese EVs such a threat to U.S. automakers and others?

Much of the global auto market is electrifying, an ideal opportunity for advanced Chinese automakers to capitalize on. China saw 17% growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles in 2025, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week, and Europe saw a 33% increase.

Meanwhile, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1% last year. As the rest of the world advances, U.S. automakers have weakened their once-ambitious, multibillion dollar electrification plans, instead opting for more efficient hybrid electric and gasoline vehicles amid the Trump administration’s shift away from EV-friendly policy.

That shift threatens U.S. automakers’ competitive edge in the coming years. As is, Tesla lost its crown as the world’s bestselling electric vehicle maker last year, delivering only 1.64 million vehicles in 2025 to Chinese rival BYD’s 2.26 million.

Trump administration policy slashing emissions rules at a time when Chinese companies are advancing quickly has experts worried for the future of American car manufacturers.

Chinese automakers will have to meet standards required for the Canadian auto market for the latest trade arrangement to be successful — standards that are similar to those in the U.S. — which is likely to incentivize Chinese auto manufacturing investment in Canada.

They’ll also have to establish which segment of the market they are targeting there: Higher-end vehicles, or less-expensive ones that sell at higher volumes.

Regardless, “It brings it home to what is needed to compete globally,” said Mark Wakefield, global automotive market lead at AlixPartners. The firm predicts Chinese brands will account for 30% of the global market by 2030.

“They’ve already started in Europe. They started in South America. Now Mexico and Canada,” Wakefield said. American carmakers “don’t want to end up as a Brazil with your ethanol-based cars that aren’t sellable anywhere else in the world and ... like Britain or Australia that used to matter in the auto world, and no longer really matter.”

Why have others sought to regulate Chinese EV-makers’ expansion?

Countries have attempted to regulate Chinese EVs from entering their markets for several reasons.

“China has become this overwhelming machine making inexpensive vehicles. And the fear is that if you give them an inch, they’re going to take a mile,” Fiorani said. “The other issue is technology. These vehicles are data centers... and the idea that a state-owned company in China could have access to where a high portion of drivers are going gives them leverage for all kinds of outlets.”

The European Union hiked tariffs on Chinese EVs last year, though the two have been resolving that at the start of this year.

In 2024, former President Joe Biden set a 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars. Canada matched that import tax on the vehicles until this week. And even with an annual import cap, Canada cutting its tariffs this week means those companies are another step closer to U.S. soil. The Mexican auto market has welcomed Chinese EVs, with massive growth last year.

“The advance of Chinese manufacturers is inevitable. It will happen eventually. Everybody is negotiating to put up the roadblocks to figure out: What data is being processed, how much market share you’re going to allow Chinese manufacturers to have?” Fiorani added.

“There are a lot of guardrails that have to be put up, but eventually they’re going to make their way into all Western markets.”

Federal energy officials and Mid-Atlantic governors are pressing PJM Interconnection to temporarily change its market rules, calling for an emergency auction to boost grid reliability and curb rising electricity prices by accelerating more than $15 billion in new baseload power generation.

“High electricity prices are a choice,” said U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright in a statement released Friday. “The Biden administration’s forceful closures of coal and natural gas plants without reliable replacements left the United States in an energy emergency. Perhaps no region in America is more at risk than in PJM.

“That’s why President Trump asked governors across the Mid-Atlantic to come together and call upon PJM to allow America to build big reliable power plants again,” he added.

Wright, along with U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, today joined Mid-Atlantic governors in urging PJM, the nation’s largest grid operator serving 67 million people in 13 states, to temporarily overhaul its market rules in an effort to improve grid reliability and rein in rising electricity costs.

Wright and Burgum, who serve as vice chairman and chairman, respectively, of the National Energy Dominance Council (NEDC), and the 13 governors signed a “Statement of Principles Regarding PJM,” urging PJM to quickly file proposed tariff revisions with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that reflect their “stated principles.”

The initiative targets escalating electricity prices and what federal officials describe as growing reliability risks across the Mid-Atlantic and parts of the Midwest, much of which is being fueled by large load data centers.

Administration officials argue that years of PJM policies, including the early retirement of coal- and natural-gas-fired power plants, have weakened the grid.

During the Biden administration, for instance, nearly 17 gigawatts of baseload generation were forced offline within PJM, according to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).

And for the first time, PJM’s most recent capacity auction failed to secure enough generation to meet basic reliability standards, raising concerns about higher prices and potential blackouts.

President Donald Trump declared a National Energy Emergency on his first day in office last year, warning that what he called an “energy subtraction agenda” had left the U.S. vulnerable to outages and soaring power bills.

Burgum framed the move as a reversal of prior energy policies and a way to support both traditional manufacturing and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence.

“For too long, the Green New Scam has left Mid-Atlantic families in the dark with skyrocketing bills,” Burgum said, noting that the NEDC’s solution could end high costs, roll back the Biden administration’s policies of energy scarcity, and ensure power for the Mid-Atlantic and part of the Midwest without charging consumers a cent.

“This initiative will ensure we usher in the age of artificial intelligence with new power plants funded by the technology companies, not taxpayers, securing the steel of Pennsylvania, the manufacturing of Ohio, and the ships of Virginia,” said Burgum.

The administration’s recommendations include that PJM:

Provide 15-year revenue certainty for new power plants to accelerate the development of reliable power generation by holding a Reliability Backstop Auction no later than September 2026 to procure new capacity resources.

Protect residential ratepayers by limiting the amount existing power plants can be paid in the PJM capacity market.

Allocate the cost of any new capacity procured through the auction “to load serving entities with new data centers that have not self-procured new capacity or agreed to be curtailable.”

Take other steps to ensure more affordable, reliable, and secure electricity for the American people, including by accelerating ongoing generator interconnection studies, improving load forecasting, and embarking on a stakeholder process to reform the capacity market.

Officials emphasized that the measures are intended to be temporary but critical, particularly for manufacturing-heavy regions facing rapid load growth from data centers.

The state leaders who signed the statement are: Indiana Gov. Mike Braun; Maryland Gov. Wes Moore; Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine; Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro; Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin; West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey; Delaware Gov. Matt Meyer; Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker; Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy; Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee; North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein; and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear.

Utilities, PJM respond

Industry groups weighed in with Edison Electric Institute (EEI) President and CEO Drew Maloney saying utilities support the push for reform.

“We support President Trump and the governors’ focus on swift changes to help lower energy costs for customers and get more power plants online,” Maloney said. “We have called for fundamental reforms to ensure resource adequacy in PJM. We look forward to working with FERC and the state commissions to be part of the solution.”

EEI has previously urged PJM to pursue reforms, including greater procurement flexibility, reduced reliance on capacity markets, expanded transmission planning, and governance changes that prioritize customers.

The PJM Board of Managers on Friday outlined plans to be taken by PJM and its stakeholders in 2026 to address the challenge of integrating new data centers onto the grid while preserving electricity system reliability and affordability.

The Board said its proposals will address the need for new power generation that can come online quickly and is coupled with options for new load customers whose electricity demand can be curtailed in times of system need. PJM said both of those goals will also help address the supply-and-demand imbalance that has the potential to threaten grid reliability and is currently driving up wholesale costs that can impact consumer bills.

“This is not a yes/no to data centers. This is ‘How can we do this while keeping the lights on and recognizing the impact on consumers at the same time?’” said David Mills, PJM board chair and interim president and CEO. “We look forward to implementing, along with our stakeholders, these proposals to manage the phenomenal demand growth we are experiencing.”

The Board’s plan includes proposals to be filed directly with the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission; changes in PJM’s policies and procedures that can be made immediately; and proposed stakeholder processes to inform the Board on complex and urgent issues.

The administration’s push against PJM comes days after Trump said on Truth Social that Americans should not face higher electric bills because of data center growth, and he has expressed support for Microsoft’s “Community-First AI Infrastructure” plan, which aims to prevent data centers’ water and electricity use from driving up local utility rates.

Potosnak has spent the last fourteen years as executive director of the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters.

He is currently a Franklin Township councilman and has served as deputy mayor. He was re-elected to a second term last year with 75% of the vote against Republican challenger Christopher Lenzy. Potosnak, who was sworn in earlier this month, will likely resign his local office, triggering an appointment and special election to fill his unexpired term.

The LCV endorsed Sherrill early in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, and their political action committee spent about $1.7 million in support of her general election campaign.

“Ed Potosnak is a proven leader who will be critical in our efforts to preserve New Jersey’s protect residents from flooding and extreme weather and remediate contaminated sites. He will bring his experience as a licensed contractor to the department to prioritize cutting through red tape and reducing permitting times,” said Sherrill. “Ed has a strong track record of bringing people to the table to develop solutions that work best for the communities they serve. I look forward to working with Ed, energy and business professionals, and advocates to protect our environment while growing our economy.”

As an environmental activist, Potosnak has advocated for the development of offshore wind, reducing single-use plastics, ensuring clean, safe drinking water, reducing “dirty air,” expanding open space, mitigating the state’s risk from rising sea levels associated with frequent storms, and tackling global climate change.

Potosnak also owns a local construction firm and works as a part-time lecturer at Rutgers University. He served on the Franklin Township Board of Education from 2014 to 2021.

In 2010, Potosnak ran for Congress in New Jersey’s 7th district against Republican Leonard Lance (R-Clinton Township), then a freshman congressman. Lance won by 33,156 votes, 59.4% to 40.6%. He was unopposed in the Democratic primary.

A former chemistry teacher, Potosnak worked on the congressional staff of Rep. Mike Honda, a California Democrat.

Potosnak chairs the New Jersey Keep It Green Coalition and the New Jersey State Lead for the Coalition for the Delaware River Watershed. Gov. Phil Murphy appointed him to the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission.

He succeeds Shawn LaTourette, who was named to the cabinet post by Gov. Phil Murphy in January 2021 and has worked at the DEP for the entirety of Murphy’s two terms as governor.

“Throughout her career, Governor-elect Sherrill has delivered for New Jerseyans on key environmental issues like flood mitigation, cleaning up toxic PFAS and Brownfields sites, and investing in cheap, clean energy like solar,” stated Potosnak. “As a licensed contractor, I understand the struggles that business owners face while trying to get state permits, and as Commissioner, I look forward to streamlining that process so we’re ensuring government is being responsive to job creators while protecting our state’s natural resources.”",https://newjerseyglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mikie-Sherrill-Ed-Potosnak-e1768592611869.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 18:01:22.167932

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) closed out 2025 with some of its first risk evaluations of the second Trump Administration under the Toxic Substances Control Act. Our Environment, Land Use & Natural Resources Group considers how the EPA may navigate regulation of high-priority chemicals over the next three years.

New risk evaluations cover five phthalates and 1,3-butadiene

A revised risk calculation for formaldehyde is offered for comment

EPA focuses on workplace exposures, alternatives to the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), and more

The Environment Protection Agency (EPA) closed out 2025 with a flurry of actions involving the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), including final risk evaluations for five phthalates and 1,3-butadiene, and an updated risk calculation for formaldehyde to inform a potential revised final risk evaluation in future.

Phthalates: Final Risk Evaluation and Notice of Intent to Regulate

A group of chemicals commonly used to enhance the flexibility and durability of plastics, phthalates are found in a wide array of products from building materials to consumer goods. In recently completed risk evaluations for butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP), diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), and diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP), the EPA identified “unreasonable” risks for workers during specific exposures (such as inhalation during spray applications and manufacturing processes) and, for four of the five chemicals, for aquatic life from surface-water releases.

The EPA did not identify unreasonable risks for consumers or for communities in close proximity to releasing facilities. The EPA’s assessment of these phthalates under TSCA does not extend to exposures from food, food additives, food packaging, medical devices, cosmetics, and other consumer products regulated by the Food and Drug Administration or the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

The EPA’s next step is to develop a rule to manage the identified risks. The timeline under the TSCA for issuing a draft rule is one year, with some allowance for extension. The EPA is considering risk mitigation measures such as personal protective equipment, engineering controls, and alternative approaches tailored to the specific uses that present risks.

1,3-Butadiene: Final Risk Evaluation and Notice of Intent to Regulate

Following a court order, the EPA issued a final risk evaluation of and notice of intent to regulate 1,3-butadiene, a colorless gas essential in the manufacture of products such as car tires, adhesives, sealants, paints, coatings, and automotive care products. The EPA concluded there is a potential unreasonable risk to workers inhaling this chemical at work in certain instances. The EPA found no unreasonable health risks to consumers using products with 1,3-butadiene, people living near facilities that use 1,3- butadiene, or the environment.

As with phthalates, it now falls to the EPA to develop risk management regulations for exposures.

Formaldehyde: Updated Draft Risk Calculation Memorandum

The EPA also issued an updated draft risk calculation memorandum for formaldehyde, a chemical widely used across numerous industries. The EPA states that this risk calculation may update the final formaldehyde risk evaluation issued in 2024, which incorporated the chronic non-cancer reference concentration and cancer inhalation unit risk developed by the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) program into its risk assessment for certain exposure scenarios.

Citing consistency with Executive Order 14303 (Restoring Gold Standard Science) and feedback from peer reviewers and scientific advisory committees like the Science Advisory Committee on Chemicals (SACC) and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the EPA’s updated draft risk calculation for formaldehyde shifts away from reliance on IRIS’s chronic non-cancer reference concentration and cancer inhalation unit risk. Instead, the EPA proposes, consistent with the recommendations of SACC and other federal advisory committees, that sensory irritation be used “as the most sensitive endpoint for determining human health effects from inhalation exposures.” Managing those risks, said the EPA, will “be protective against other health effects, including cancer.” Functionally speaking, this change would raise the levels of formaldehyde that workers could be exposed to from the lower chronic non-cancer and cancer exposure levels identified by IRIS to higher levels causing sensory irritation. The revised risk calculation also results in the removal of five conditions of use that no longer indicate unreasonable risk for workers due to inhalation.

The public comment period for the December 2025 Updated Draft Risk Calculation Memorandum ends on February 2, 2026. Comments can be submitted through the official docket (EPA-HQ-OPPT-2018-0438) on regulations.gov. The EPA encourages all interested parties, including industry stakeholders, public health advocates, and members of the public, to review the memorandum and provide feedback. This input will be considered as the agency finalizes its risk evaluation and develops proposed risk management rules. Note that formaldehyde’s use as a pesticide is undergoing a separate review under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), with its own risk assessment process.

Takeaways

Recent EPA actions on phthalates, 1,3-butadiene, and formaldehyde indicate that while the EPA is advancing on high-priority chemical regulation, its approach provides potential opportunities for industries subject to those regulations.

The EPA appears to be moving away from reliance on IRIS, a program that has provoked controversy among industry for its conservative assessment of the human health toxicity of chemicals. The EPA also appears to be amenable to considering evidence indicating that a particular chemical may be considered safe below certain thresholds, while attempting to leave the door open for achievable mitigation measures by businesses at the risk mitigation stage.

Its action on formaldehyde, a chemical for which the EPA recently issued a final risk evaluation as recently as 2024, appears to carry forward the EPA’s desire (as communicated in its proposed rulemaking last year) to be able to revise final risk evaluations without having to reprioritize a chemical. This could shorten the timeframe for the EPA to review prior evaluations and issue updates consistent with current administration policy goals and updated reports from science advisory committees.

Given the multistep nature of chemical evaluations and management under TSCA, we encourage interested stakeholders to follow and consider participating in evaluation and regulatory development at all stages to ensure that points of concern are considered at each stage.

WASHINGTON, D.C—Twelve governors representing states in the PJM service area released a joint agreement alongside White House officials Friday related to rising electricity costs and reliability concerns in the region. The proposal may continue to promote dirty and expensive energy sources above projects that are clean, cheap and can be deployed more rapidly.

The agreement takes a first step at addressing one of PJM’s key underlying problems that has been regularly flagged by environmental and consumer advocates: the fact that PJM has one of the longest timelines in the country for bringing new energy projects such as solar and wind farms online in a timely fashion. In fact, it’s not uncommon for some of these projects to take years to get approval.

Advocates have long argued that this is due to the fact that PJM has failed to implement necessary reforms that would allow over 250 GW of power that has been waiting several years to connect to the grid to get approval and start construction. 98% of those delayed projects languishing in PJM’s queue are renewable energy projects—and could produce enough electricity to power 60 million homes.

The proposal announced today urges PJM to commit to improving its processes and reducing interconnection timelines in 2026.

The proposal also directs PJM to create a separate process for energy-hungry data centers to bid on contracts with new power plants. Unfortunately, that process is expected to involve fast tracking dirty energy projects to supply energy for data centers with gas power, and allowing these projects to leapfrog over clean energy projects that are currently waiting in line for PJM approval. If designed poorly, this separate process may incentivize power plants to leave the regular market in favor of lucrative data center contracts, driving up costs for consumers.

Advocates note that it will be critical for PJM to prioritize concrete reforms over short-term projects that benefit data centers and AI companies, arguing that this is the only way for PJM to address its underlying systemic issues that are preventing new clean power from coming onto the grid. This will be critical for bringing down prices for every-day ratepayers, for addressing reliability issues, and to prevent the build out of dirty energy sources across PJM’s service area

In response, Carolena Bellini, PennEnvironment Research & Policy Center’s clean energy associate, issued the following statement:

“The root of this problem is the fact that hundreds of gigawatts of clean, reliable power have languished under PJM’s jurisdiction for years. PJM has failed to make the reforms necessary to bring that ample supply of clean power online. It’s now heartening to see our state leaders commit to putting pressure on PJM to speed up its timeline.

“But at the same time, it appears this could turn into yet another attempt to fast-track dirty new gas plants, which create unnecessary and dangerous air and climate pollution and are often slower and more expensive to build than clean alternatives.

“PJM’s number one priority should be fixing its broken processes so that the renewable energy and storage resources that have been waiting years for approval to connect can come online and provide clean, reliable power to all customers in the PJM region.”

Abe Scarr, PennPIRG Education Fund’s energy and utilities director, issued the following statement:

“No one wants consumers to have to foot the bill for giant tech companies, but the devil is in the details and we don’t yet know if these new large loads will be paying their fair share.

“Short-term solutions like extending the price cap can help consumers, but they won’t solve this problem. As long as PJM stalls on actually making it possible for new, clean power to come online, regular consumers will continue to pay the price – literally.

“Our state leaders need to continue putting pressure on PJM to fix its broken interconnection processes and unleash the abundant clean power waiting in the queue to benefit the 67 million Americans in the PJM region.”",https://environmentamerica.org/pennsylvania/center/wp-content/themes/tpin2022/assets/favicons/ea/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2026-01-16 19:00:40.590813

Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum were joined at the White House by about half of the governors that comprise a coalition urging PJM Interconnection to lower its prices.

PJM, which is headquartered in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, serves about 67 million customers in Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.

The coalition wants PJM to require data centers to pay for the new power that’s being generated on their behalf. They also want the grid operator to cap the price energy plants can charge in electricity market auctions.

“We have a united front standing here today that’s demanding immediate reform,” Burgum said.

Meanwhile, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, said he wholeheartedly agrees with the coalition’s belief in taking a proactive approach to “increase energy supply and to protect consumers from rising costs.”

“The principles proposed today will encourage new energy supply to be built in Ohio and the region and ensure data centers pay their own way as they expand,” he said.

The group’s so-called “Statement of Principles” calls for PJM to:

Provide 15-year price certainty for new energy resources that serve data centers.

If new data centers do not provide their own energy, the proposal asks PJM to allocate the cost of any new procured energy to the data centers. This will protect costs from being passed on to other customers.

State public utilities commissions, such as the Public Utilities Commission in DeWine’s home state of Ohio, will use all available authority to design rate structures to ensure costs incurred by data centers to the larger market are passed on to those data centers and not other customers.

What’s more, data centers remain customers of utilities regulated at the state level.
Even if such state policies were put in place, there’s no guarantee that the prospective data centers would play ball, he said.
Demand for gas turbines has pushed delivery orders for new power plants out to 2028 or later.","The Trump administration wants PJM Interconnection, the country’s biggest power market, to force data center developers to pay directly for the new power plants they need. It’s the latest attempt to curb skyrocketing energy costs for the roughly 67 million people PJM serves from Virginia to Illinois.

On Friday, the National Energy Dominance Council and governors of some PJM states released an agreement that urges the grid operator to take action to solve its massive affordability and grid-reliability problems.

Specifically, it presses PJM to speed up the construction of more than $15 billion worth of ​“reliable baseload” power plants by providing them with 15 years of revenue certainty. It also directs PJM to ​“require data centers to pay for the new generation built on their behalf — whether they show up and use the power or not.”

But industry experts warned that these demands would be difficult, if not impossible, to execute fast enough to make a difference for the region.

“It’s not at all clear how this can actually get implemented,” Rob Gramlich, president of consultancy Grid Strategies, told Canary Media. ​“How would this ever get implemented — and would this require changes that usually take five years?”

The vision, according to an anonymous White House official quoted by Bloomberg, is to require PJM to set up an emergency auction by September, which would compel data centers and other ​“large loads” to pony up the $15 billion to spur new power plant construction.

PJM is already under a December order from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to overhaul its rules for how massive data centers can interconnect to its grid.

The grid operator has also been slowly working on reform of its own. Its monthslong effort to get stakeholders — including utilities, power plant owners, big corporate energy users, data center developers, and consumer advocates — to agree on new structures to deal with the rising cost impacts of data centers ended in deadlock late last year. In a twist of fate, PJM released its decision on this matter later on Friday.

That plan has not yet been reconciled against the Trump administration’s just-released principles — PJM itself was not invited to the Friday White House event at which the agreement was announced, spokesperson Jeffrey Shields told Bloomberg.

Now, ​“PJM is reviewing the principles set forth by the White House and governors,” Shields said in a statement to Canary Media. ​“We will work with our stakeholders to assess how the White House directive aligns with the [large-load plan].”

The agreement’s goal is ultimately to curb PJM’s skyrocketing capacity costs, which are driven by the grid operator’s inability to build new generation or energy storage capacity fast enough to meet booming demand.

PJM’s rising utility rates are driving backlash from consumers — and demands from politicians to take action, including limiting data center growth.

“The principle of new large loads paying their fair share is gaining consensus across states, industry groups, and political parties,” Gramlich said. ​“The rules that have been in place for years did not ensure that.”

But Gramlich highlighted that Friday’s plan will run into the same state-vs.-federal jurisdictional conflicts that have stymied PJM’s efforts to reform data-center interconnection to date.

First off, PJM’s capacity auctions operate by allowing power plants, battery projects, demand-response providers, and other ​“supply-side” providers to bid their capacity into the system. Those capacity costs are then passed along to utilities, he noted. Utility customers themselves — including data centers — are not part of that equation.

“Even if the large loads voluntarily participate, there’s no mechanism currently for direct participation of a retail customer in a wholesale auction,” Gramlich said.

What’s more, data centers remain customers of utilities regulated at the state level. ​“It might require changes in state law in any PJM state” to alter those facts, he said.

Even if such state policies were put in place, there’s no guarantee that the prospective data centers would play ball, he said. ​“It’s easy to hold an auction, but the hard part is compelling anyone to participate.”

The new agreement faces other fundamental challenges, too.

While the text doesn’t specify the exact type of power plants it wants PJM to build, its call for ​“reliable baseload power generation” is code for fossil fuels or nuclear power. That will pose problems. Demand for gas turbines has pushed delivery orders for new power plants out to 2028 or later. Almost all of the new gas-fired power plants secured in PJM’s fast-track procurement last year aren’t set to come online until 2030 or later. And nuclear power plants usually take about a decade to build.

Meanwhile, more than 100 gigawatts of potential new grid resources, the vast majority of which are solar, wind, and batteries, remain stuck in PJM’s badly congested interconnection queue. PJM is still working on efforts to fast-track these resources by, for example, pairing batteries with existing solar and wind farms.

Ultimately, an auction of the kind the White House plan envisions could drive investment in more power plants, according to Julia Hoos, head of USA East at Aurora Energy Research — but it could also ​“exacerbate some other elements of PJM’s challenges.”

“Everyone agrees that PJM is struggling to bring online new generation fast enough, and that some sort of intervention is required,” Hoos wrote in a Friday email. But she added that ​“PJM already has several ongoing reform processes to address these issues — and it’s pretty unprecedented for this sort of top-down intervention to direct PJM’s efforts.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2254844401.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=42d89b2377e033817aa8becc82c9a57e,N,,2026-01-16 18:00:40.516913

In a fact sheet on the proposal published on the Department of Energy’s website, the Trump administration is also encouraging PJM to cap what existing power plants charge in an effort to pass along savings to residential power users. The DOE described the measures as “temporary,” noting that the changes could stave off painful future price increases and make blackouts less likely.

(WAVY) – A federal judge in Norfolk granted a preliminary injunction Friday, in the case involving the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) Project.
That ruling is a big win for Dominion Energy, which had been pushing back against the pause ordered by the White House.

That ruling is a big win for Dominion Energy, which had been pushing back against the pause ordered by the White House. This allows Dominion Energy to resume work on the project.

James Auslander argued for Dominion before Judge Jamar Walker, who was born and raised on the Eastern Shore. Auslander said the Trump administration has “systematically been trying to shut down wind projects.”

The December 22 pause stopped a total of five offshore wind projects along the Eastern seaboard. Three of them were in various federal courts this week, including CVOW. All three ended in rulings that favored resumption of the projects.

Auslander told Walker, an appointee of President Joe Biden, that the government “can’t just claim national security, file a secret report, and then call it a day.”

Walker acknowledged that classified military information was part of the government’s case to stop the construction of the more then 800-foot tall turbines. The Trump administration said the turbines would be a threat to national security without specifics.

Stanley Woodward, Associate Attorney General and the third-ranking official in the Department of Justice, argued for the Department of the Interior.

In the days following the pause order, reaction against it came from both sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill, including Democratic Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, as well as Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans.

Woodward told the court “the Department of War doesn’t care about public comment or opinion. It cares about war fighting.”

Woodward wanted the judge to keep the pause in place for the remaining 65 days – completing the full 90 days called for in the December order. “Dominion will not go belly up,” he argued.

Dominion had cited a cost increase for the CVOW of $5 million for each day the project was offline.

Dominion Energy says the CVOW project will consist of 176 offshore wind energy turbines, which can generate a total of 2.6-gigawatts. That’s enough energy to power up to 660,000 homes.

Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates Don Scott applauded the court’s decision.

“Three judges – appointed by three different presidents, Reagan, Trump, and Biden – have now all rejected President Trump’s attempt to shut down this critical project.

“This ruling is a major win for Virginia families and our economy. The Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project will power more than 10 percent of Dominion Energy’s all-time peak load and supply clean, reliable energy to more than 650,000 homes and businesses – helping keep the lights on and utility costs down.

“This disruption should never have happened. I look forward to the legal process continuing, construction moving forward, and Virginia doing what we do best: building a reliable, affordable energy future.”

Don Scott

Dominion Energy described the next steps for the project, as well as its lawsuit against the government on the merits of the order to stop it, in a statement Friday afternoon:

“Our team will now focus on safely restarting work to ensure CVOW begins delivery of critical energy in just weeks. While our legal challenge proceeds, we will continue seeking a durable resolution of this matter through cooperation with the federal government.”

Warner, Kaine along with Reps. Bobby Scott (D-Newport News) and Jennifer McClellan (D-Richmond) issued a joint statement applauding the injunction lifting the pause and allowing the offshore wind project to proceed:

“This project has already undergone years of rigorous review and is poised to deliver clean, reliable, and affordable energy while creating thousands of good-paying jobs in Hampton Roads. CVOW represents the kind of investment in domestic energy our region and nation need.

“Today’s ruling is a victory for Virginians, who otherwise would face increased energy costs as a result of the Trump Administration’s shortsighted opposition to clean energy. We will continue to work to protect this critical and growing industry and to ensure clean energy projects that have met every legal and regulatory requirement can move forward without undue political interference.”",https://www.wavy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2026/01/69657bdfd09c50.61130219.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-16 19:01:42.512468

A few years later, Louisiana electric utility Cleco hired the engineering firm for several initiatives worth tens of millions, and, by 2014, Entergy began sending even bigger jobs the company's way.

Most people don't waste a second thinking about that kind of thing. They're just glad they can plug their smartphone in at night or heat up leftovers in the microwave.

But ""most people"" doesn't include the founders of Ampirical, a 20-year-old Covington engineering firm that has parlayed its expertise in power delivery to grow from a startup with six employees and a handful of small contracts into a 600-person powerhouse with revenues of roughly $500 million.

Ampirical is one of Louisiana's under-the-radar business successes, and it's one built on good decisions — and fortuitous timing.

The company's founding partners hung their shingle in the early 2000s, when investment in power delivery was increasing because of efforts to upgrade the nation's aging grid infrastructure. Also, policy was shifting toward new, cleaner types of power generation. More recently, a focus on grid resilience and a tech industry-fueled data center construction boom have made power delivery an even bigger priority, fueling growth for companies that know how to design and string together those wires on poles.

Over two decades, Ampirical has steadily expanded its geographical footprint, its team, the size of its contracts, and the products and services it offers. And, in 2024, it landed its biggest job to date: designing and overseeing construction of power transmission for the new Meta Hyperion artificial intelligence data center in north Louisiana.

Matthew Saacks, Ampirical's co-founder and CEO, said the project reflects his company's evolution into a national player.

""It's unprecedented the way the grid is transforming,"" Saacks said during an interview at the firm's 4-year-old Covington headquarters last week. ""It's not the staid old industry of the 20th century, and there's a need for people to come up with solutions.""

Two decades of growth

In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, three New Orleans-based Entergy Services engineers — Saacks, Mike Sulzer and Mark Stephens — decided to establish their own firm. All born and raised in Metairie, the trio worked for an unregulated division of the utility that provided power delivery solutions to industrial clients and other utilities nationwide. But that type of work was increasingly being outsourced, so the colleagues decided to go into business for themselves.

They soon were joined by three other Entergy alumni and got to work on a couple of small contracts handed off from the utility.

Operating out of a small office in Covington, the nascent firm of civil and electrical engineers started landing jobs that involved designing every step of the power delivery system process: the high-voltage power lines that move electricity long distances, the lower-voltage lines that distribute it to users and the substations that connect the two systems.

""I always use a driving analogy to explain to people what we do,"" Saacks said. ""The big transmission lines are like the interstate highway system, and the substations are the on ramps and off ramps. We design it all.""

An engineering job for San Antonio's electric utility was an early win, followed by more gigs for Entergy and other customers in the Gulf South. A project in California in 2009 opened that market. Eventually the company set up permanent offices near San Diego and the Bay Area to take on various jobs, including upgrading existing towers, poles and wires to make them less likely to cause fires.

The jobs kept getting bigger, and the Ampirical staff grew steadily along with them. In addition to its 78,000-square-foot headquarters, the company also has a satellite office near Mandeville, one in Metairie and several out of state. This month, construction crews are driving piles on land adjacent to the headquarters to expand capacity.

Hitting critical mass

From the start, Ampirical's founders aspired to provide engineering, procurement and construction services (known in the industry as ""EPC""), a turnkey approach that's similar to the role a developer has in a real estate project. Instead of acting as a hired consultant, an EPC engineer takes on financial risk and needs the cash on hand to qualify for bonds that protect customers.

Ampirical wasn't big enough at first to take on substantial EPC jobs, but its leaders decided to reinvest profits over the years to build up the capital that could unlock those bigger contracts.

The first one of note came in 2007, when an independent power plant in Colorado hired Ampirical to design more connections to the grid. Another followed soon after near Sacramento, California.

A few years later, Louisiana electric utility Cleco hired the engineering firm for several initiatives worth tens of millions, and, by 2014, Entergy began sending even bigger jobs the company's way. Today, the firm has completed dozens of EPC projects for the regional utility.

“We used to have a project here and there, but when we connected with Entergy’s capital projects group, that's really when our EPC work really hit critical mass,” Saacks said.

Now Ampirical's portfolio of engineering and EPC projects stretches from California to Florida with growing activity in the Mid-Atlantic and Ohio Valley.

Buying and selling

Ampirical also has begun to grow through acquisitions.

In 2020, the company scooped up a boutique Atlanta engineering firm that designs transmission infrastructure throughout the Southeast with a focus on smaller, customer-owned utilities in the Carolinas and Virginia. That deal came just before the boom in construction of data centers along the I-95 corridor on the East Coast and led to several big jobs in the region.

""When that hit, we looked like geniuses,"" Saacks said. ""They needed EPC projects, which co-op utilities typically didn't do, but now they are, and we have the capability.""

Ampirical has acquired two other companies since, but its biggest move to date came in 2024, when, after nearly two decades of bootstrapping, it sought a buyer of its own, finding interest from competitors, private equity funds, public companies and others. Ultimately, the company chose a deal with national private equity firm SkyKnight Capital, which was looking for a way into the energy infrastructure space.

SkyKnight took a 60% stake in Ampirical, left the leadership intact, and collaborated on a five-year plan that includes more acquisitions, more bidding for big jobs, and selling proprietary software for asset management and grid monitoring.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/d4/5d41ffea-58ee-5b91-bbc6-73bf7dd1ac3c/665a3e13c2f02.image.jpg?crop=1787%2C938%2C0%2C110&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2026-01-16 21:59:07.243558

That has had competitors concerned even before Canada this week agreed to cut its tariffs on EVs in exchange for concessions on Canadian farm products.

Experts now say an easier path into Canada could be a big boost for Chinese carmakers looking to dominate the global market — particularly as their domestic market weakens — continuing to threaten other auto manufacturers, particularly American companies.

“This is telling us that Chinese automakers continue to be really popular, and are doing better and better, and not just something that’s sold in global markets that are more marginal or less important to U.S. automakers,” said Ilaria Mazzocco, deputy director and senior fellow with the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

What makes Chinese vehicles stand out?

Chinese-made vehicles are high-quality, stylish and inexpensive, experts say.

“It’s clear that the vehicles made by Chinese brands come at a very competitive cost, but are also technologically quite desirable,” Mazzocco said. “They tend to be connected vehicles, so they have a lot of additional software capabilities that consumers seem to like. But the price point and the competitiveness are really big selling points.”

These vehicles can cost as little as $10,000 to $20,000; in the U.S., new vehicles are running close to $50,000 on average, and EVs even more so.

Chinese companies also have unique advantages as far as auto manufacturing and production, efficiency and making vehicles lighter, which helps extend an electrified vehicle’s driving range.

“They’ve found a way to make small and mid-sized cars — cars that people want — at a reasonable price,” said Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “These are the segments where GM and Ford and almost everybody else have abandoned.”

Many automakers have discontinued smaller vehicles in favor of higher-margin, large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that are far more profitable.

So why are Chinese EVs such a threat to U.S. automakers and others?

Much of the global auto market is electrifying, an ideal opportunity for advanced Chinese automakers to capitalize on. China saw 17% growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles in 2025, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week, and Europe saw a 33% increase.

Meanwhile, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1% last year. As the rest of the world advances, U.S. automakers have weakened their once-ambitious, multibillion dollar electrification plans, instead opting for more efficient hybrid electric and gasoline vehicles amid the Trump administration’s shift away from EV-friendly policy.

That shift threatens U.S. automakers’ competitive edge in the coming years. As is, Tesla lost its crown as the world’s bestselling electric vehicle maker last year, delivering only 1.64 million vehicles in 2025 to Chinese rival BYD’s 2.26 million.

Trump administration policy slashing emissions rules at a time when Chinese companies are advancing quickly has experts worried for the future of American car manufacturers.

Chinese automakers will have to meet standards required for the Canadian auto market for the latest trade arrangement to be successful — standards that are similar to those in the U.S. — which is likely to incentivize Chinese auto manufacturing investment in Canada.

They’ll also have to establish which segment of the market they are targeting there: Higher-end vehicles, or less-expensive ones that sell at higher volumes.

Regardless, “It brings it home to what is needed to compete globally,” said Mark Wakefield, global automotive market lead at AlixPartners. The firm predicts Chinese brands will account for 30% of the global market by 2030.

“They’ve already started in Europe. They started in South America. Now Mexico and Canada,” Wakefield said. American carmakers “don’t want to end up as a Brazil with your ethanol-based cars that aren’t sellable anywhere else in the world and … like Britain or Australia that used to matter in the auto world, and no longer really matter.”

Why have others sought to regulate Chinese EV-makers’ expansion?

Countries have attempted to regulate Chinese EVs from entering their markets for several reasons.

“China has become this overwhelming machine making inexpensive vehicles. And the fear is that if you give them an inch, they’re going to take a mile,” Fiorani said. “The other issue is technology. These vehicles are data centers… and the idea that a state-owned company in China could have access to where a high portion of drivers are going gives them leverage for all kinds of outlets.”

In remarks at the Toledo Assembly Complex in Toledo, Ohio on Friday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the Chinese Communist Party invests in its auto industry to “control this industry.”

“Why? They want to take over the auto industry. They want to take away these jobs,” Duffy said. As far as the Canadian trade deal, he added: “They will live to regret the day they partner with China and bring in their vehicles.”

The European Union hiked tariffs on Chinese EVs last year, though the two have been resolving that at the start of this year.

In 2024, former President Joe Biden set a 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars. Canada matched that import tax on the vehicles until this week. And even with an annual import cap, Canada cutting its tariffs this week means those companies are another step closer to U.S. soil. The Mexican auto market has welcomed Chinese EVs, with massive growth last year.

“The advance of Chinese manufacturers is inevitable. It will happen eventually. Everybody is negotiating to put up the roadblocks to figure out: What data is being processed, how much market share you’re going to allow Chinese manufacturers to have?” Fiorani added.

“Today, power is flowing to Massachusetts through the New England Clean Energy Connect transmission line,” said Governor Healey.
“The NECEC line proves we can do big things here in Massachusetts,” said Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper.

After nearly a decade of work and regional collaboration, the NECEC transmission line will reduce emissions and stabilize electricity prices, supporting affordability and reliability for the residents and businesses of the Commonwealth.""","Boston — Today, Governor Maura Healey celebrated the completion of the New England Clean Energy Connect (NECEC) transmission line and is now delivering affordable, stable hydropower from Canada to Massachusetts. The NECEC line will provide Massachusetts with nearly 20 percent of its overall electricity, deliver $3.38 billion in total net economic benefits to Massachusetts ratepayers over the life of the contracts, and reduce ratepayer bills by around $50 million each year.

“Today, power is flowing to Massachusetts through the New England Clean Energy Connect transmission line,” said Governor Healey. “My administration worked closely with the Legislature, the Attorney General, and private partners to ensure the project moved forward and delivered savings. The NECEC line represents our all-of-the-above approach in action – working with regional partners to bring affordable energy into the state that will lower costs and meet our growing demand. We are proud to flip the switch on this line and bring costs down, and we are continuing to work to bring more energy into Massachusetts.”

“Over $3 billion in benefits will flow into Massachusetts thanks to this major transmission line,” said Lieutenant Governor Kim Driscoll. “That means lower bills, more jobs, and the power we need to grow our economy. Our administration played an important role in keeping this project on track and affordable. We are glad to see NECEC start operation today.”

The NECEC project will deliver 1,090 megawatts of firm baseload power over a line capable of delivering up to 1,200 megawatts from Québec to New England. This line will serve as one of New England’s largest sources of baseload power, strengthening grid reliability and lowering energy costs for consumers.

The fixed prices in the contracts provide power and clean energy attributes at prices well below the projected costs of buying the same amount on the market, and lock in those prices for the next 20 years.

“The NECEC line proves we can do big things here in Massachusetts,” said Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper. “Transmission is key to unlocking savings for ratepayers and businesses, but it requires partnership. To get this done, many people came together toward a common goal: get more affordable energy into Massachusetts. I want to thank the Legislature for their foresight and direction, state energy officials past and present for pushing this project forward, our Canadian partners and Hydro-Quebec for their continued collaboration, the Attorney General and the utilities for their work in the negotiations, Governor Mills for her support, and Avangrid for executing on this project. We’re going to continue to double down on regional collaboration to bring down costs and get more energy projects built.”

“Building and using this line shows us that Massachusetts ratepayers and our clean energy future benefit from planning, partnerships, and perseverance,” said Energy Resources Commissioner Elizabeth Mahony. “The hydroelectric power flowing into our electric grid will lower long-term electricity costs, provide needed winter reliability, help meet rising electricity demand, and bring billions of dollars in economic benefits for Massachusetts. We’ll build on this success with more regional collaboration, and more affordable, clean power for our homes and businesses.”

In addition to lowering electricity prices, this clean, sustainable hydropower will help meet rising electricity demand, provide needed energy reliability in the winter, and reduce harmful pollution in Massachusetts and the region. During cold temperature periods, New England relies on higher-priced, more carbon-intensive fuels. This leads to expensive and volatile winter energy pricing and regional reliability concerns. The NECEC project will help address these challenges by providing consistent clean energy production during cold temperatures.

“This is an historic day; the New England Clean Energy Connect is now delivering enough renewable energy to power a million homes,” said Hydro-Québec Energy Services U.S. COO Serge Abergel. “We are proud to be your partners. We have all overcome many obstacles to get to today. Now we are not just talking; we are delivering. This is a shining example of our regional partnership, which will continue for the next 20 years and beyond.”

In 2018, following a competitive solicitation, the Massachusetts electric distribution companies negotiated and executed contracts with the NECEC project. Following authorization from the Massachusetts Legislature in 2023, the Healey-Driscoll Administration, the Attorney General’s Office, Eversource, National Grid, and Unitil negotiated with NECEC to ensure these contracts remain beneficial for Massachusetts ratepayers. The joint settlement agreement was later approved by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, helping pave the way for the project to finish construction. Under the contracts, NECEC will import 9.55 terawatt-hours annually of 100 percent hydroelectricity from Quebec to the New England electric grid.

Statements of Support:

Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell:

“Today is a beacon of hope for our clean energy future at a time when many of our needed clean energy resources are under threat. After years of collaboration and perseverance, we are thrilled to see this power delivered to Massachusetts residents.”

House Speaker Ronald J. Mariano (D-3rd Norfolk):

“The completion of the NECEC transmission line comes at a critical time for Massachusetts residents. Hydropower from Québec will lower energy costs and improve reliability this winter and beyond, while also helping the Commonwealth to diversify our energy sources and transition to clean and renewable energy. I'm grateful to Governor Healey and her team, as well as my colleagues in the Legislature, for working to make this project a reality.""

State Senate President Karen E. Spilka (D-Middlesex and Norfolk):

“With Donald Trump actively fighting against Massachusetts efforts to bring down our energy costs and push back against climate change, the completion of this transmission line marks a milestone in our collective work to deliver true cost savings for residents. This achievement reflects every lever of government working together toward a shared goal, and I applaud my colleagues in the Senate and the Legislature, the Healey-Driscoll Administration, and our partners in the energy sector for advancing a project that will lower costs, strengthen our energy grid, and further secure a clean energy future for Massachusetts.”

State Representative Mark Cusack, House Chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy (D-5th Norfolk):

“This infusion of clean and affordable hydropower onto the Massachusetts grid is a milestone to celebrate. After nearly a decade of work and regional collaboration, the NECEC transmission line will reduce emissions and stabilize electricity prices, supporting affordability and reliability for the residents and businesses of the Commonwealth.""

State Senator Michael Barrett (D-Middlesex):

""Massachusetts is fighting for its clean energy agenda and gaining ground, President Trump's opposition notwithstanding. We should take hope from this. There is more work to do but breakthroughs are happening.""

State Representative Jeffrey N. Roy, former Chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities & Energy (D-10th Norfolk):

“Bringing Canadian hydropower into Massachusetts is a major milestone that strengthens our energy reliability, advances our clean energy goals, and—most importantly—delivers a robust new source of power to consumers at a reasonable and predictable price. This long-anticipated moment is the culmination of nearly a decade of careful planning, legislating, and implementation, carried forward despite significant legal, political, and logistical obstacles. I had the opportunity to see the source of this power firsthand when I visited the St. James Bay hydropower facilities—an engineering marvel—in Quebec last March, and it is deeply gratifying to see that work come to fruition.”

State Representative House Minority Leader Bradley H. Jones, Jr. (R-20th Middlesex):

“Diversification of our energy portfolio is crucial to ensuring the consistent delivery of reliable services to Massachusetts ratepayers. The completion of the New England Clean Energy Connect transmission line significantly increases the capacity of our existing power grid and provides the Commonwealth with an additional resource that will be critical to meeting the needs of the state’s utility customers moving forward.”

René Sylvestre, Québec Delegate to New England:

“The completion of the New England Clean Energy Connect today marks an important milestone in our shared energy future. It is through regional collaboration and subnational cooperation that this vision becomes a reality. The Québec and New England relationship is built on robust trade and integrated economies as well as shared culture and values. Today, we celebrate our partnership in creating a more sustainable, resilient grid.”

Michael P. Monahan, International Vice-President, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW):

“I applaud the Governor for recognizing the need for an all-of-the-above energy strategy. This new line brings in clean, firm power to meet our growing needs and reliably power our economy. Its construction provided thousands of good-paying jobs with benefits, to IBEW members. New England union workers are building our energy future. More savings and cleaner energy are flowing into Massachusetts thanks to the hard work of our brothers and sisters in Maine and the collaboration between utilities and governments on both sides of the border. It shows what can be done when we prioritize affordability, jobs, and reliable power. ”

That has had competitors concerned even before Canada this week agreed to cut its tariffs on Chinese EVs in exchange for concessions on Canadian farm products.

Experts now say an easier path into Canada could be a big boost for Chinese carmakers looking to dominate the global market — particularly as their domestic market weakens. That poses a threat to other auto manufacturers, particularly American companies.

U.S. officials acknowledged that in remarks at an assembly plant for Jeep-maker Stellantis in Toledo, Ohio on Friday. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the Chinese Communist Party invests in its auto industry to “control this industry.”

“Why? They want to take over the auto industry. They want to take away these jobs,” Duffy said. As far as the Canadian trade deal, he added: “They will live to regret the day they partner with China and bring in their vehicles.”

Others say the shift is inevitable.

“This is telling us that Chinese automakers continue to be really popular, and are doing better and better, and not just something that’s sold in global markets that are more marginal or less important to U.S. automakers,” said Ilaria Mazzocco, deputy director and senior fellow with the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

What makes Chinese vehicles stand out?

Chinese-made vehicles are high-quality, stylish and inexpensive, experts say.

“It’s clear that the vehicles made by Chinese brands come at a very competitive cost, but are also technologically quite desirable,” Mazzocco said. “They tend to be connected vehicles, so they have a lot of additional software capabilities that consumers seem to like. But the price point and the competitiveness are really big selling points.”

These vehicles can cost as little as $10,000 to $20,000; in the U.S., new vehicles are running close to $50,000 on average, and EVs even more so.

Chinese companies also have unique advantages as far as auto manufacturing and production, efficiency and making vehicles lighter, which helps extend an electrified vehicle’s driving range.

“They’ve found a way to make small and mid-sized cars — cars that people want — at a reasonable price,” said Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “These are the segments where GM and Ford and almost everybody else have abandoned.”

Many automakers have discontinued smaller vehicles in favor of higher-margin, large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks that are far more profitable.

So why are Chinese EVs such a threat to U.S. automakers and others?

Much of the global auto market is electrifying, an ideal opportunity for advanced Chinese automakers to capitalize on. China saw 17% growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles in 2025, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week, and Europe saw a 33% increase.

Meanwhile, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1% last year. As the rest of the world advances, U.S. automakers have weakened their once-ambitious, multibillion dollar electrification plans, instead opting for more efficient hybrid electric and gasoline vehicles amid the Trump administration’s shift away from EV-friendly policy.

That shift threatens U.S. automakers’ competitive edge in the coming years. As is, Tesla lost its crown as the world’s bestselling electric vehicle maker last year, delivering only 1.64 million vehicles in 2025 to Chinese rival BYD’s 2.26 million.

Trump administration policy slashing emissions rules at a time when Chinese companies are advancing quickly has experts worried for the future of American car manufacturers.

Chinese automakers will have to meet standards required for the Canadian auto market for the latest trade arrangement to be successful — standards that are similar to those in the U.S. — which is likely to incentivize Chinese auto manufacturing investment in Canada.

They’ll also have to establish which segment of the market they are targeting there: Higher-end vehicles, or less-expensive ones that sell at higher volumes.

Regardless, “It brings it home to what is needed to compete globally,” said Mark Wakefield, global automotive market lead at AlixPartners. The firm predicts Chinese brands will account for 30% of the global market by 2030.

“They’ve already started in Europe. They started in South America. Now Mexico and Canada,” Wakefield said. American carmakers “don’t want to end up as a Brazil with your ethanol-based cars that aren’t sellable anywhere else in the world and … like Britain or Australia that used to matter in the auto world, and no longer really matter.”

Why have others sought to regulate Chinese EV-makers’ expansion?

Countries have attempted to regulate Chinese EVs from entering their markets for several reasons.

“China has become this overwhelming machine making inexpensive vehicles. And the fear is that if you give them an inch, they’re going to take a mile,” Fiorani said. “The other issue is technology. These vehicles are data centers… and the idea that a state-owned company in China could have access to where a high portion of drivers are going gives them leverage for all kinds of outlets.”

The European Union hiked tariffs on Chinese EVs last year, though the two have been resolving that at the start of this year.

In 2024, former President Joe Biden set a 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars. Canada matched that import tax on the vehicles until this week. And even with an annual import cap, Canada cutting its tariffs this week means those companies are another step closer to U.S. soil. The Mexican auto market has welcomed Chinese EVs, with massive growth last year.

“The advance of Chinese manufacturers is inevitable. It will happen eventually. Everybody is negotiating to put up the roadblocks to figure out: What data is being processed, how much market share you’re going to allow Chinese manufacturers to have?” Fiorani added.

“There are a lot of guardrails that have to be put up, but eventually they’re going to make their way into all Western markets.”

Inquiry: GB Energy and the net zero transition

Scottish Affairs Committee

Responding to a Scottish Affairs Committee report on the future of Scotland’s oil and gas industry, the UK Government outlined plans to grow clean energy employment but stopped short of accepting some of the committee’s central findings.

The committee’s report, published in October 2025, warned that clean energy jobs were not being created fast enough to offset job losses from the declining North Sea oil and gas industry. MPs called for urgent action to close this employment gap and urged the Government to avoid accelerating the decline of North Sea production through its policy environment, while this remains the case.

While the UK Government did not acknowledge the report's central conclusion that clean energy jobs are not being created at a fast enough rate, it did signal a clear intention to boost the renewable sector and employment through new investment.

The UK Government points to recently announced initiatives like the Clean Energy Jobs Plan – aiming to “nearly double” the UK’s clean energy workforce by 2030 - and the North Sea Future Plan, announced in November, which introduces Transitional Energy Certificates to help maintain existing fields.

However, the UK Government has not yet evidenced the delivery of many of these initiatives, and it is unclear whether it is on track to meet stated ambitions such as its plans to increase to the clean energy workforce by 2030.

The UK Government also rejected the committee’s recommendation to bring an end to the Energy Profits Levy (EPL) before 2030, arguing the levy was necessary to encourage investment in cleaner energy. This is despite the committee’s warning that, at its current level, the EPL risks further accelerating the North Sea oil and gas industry’s decline. Instead, it re-affirmed plans set out in the 2025 Budget to introduce a new Oil and Gas Price Mechanism in 2030.

Chair's comment

Patricia Ferguson, Chair of the Scottish Affairs Committee, said:

“Our report raised serious concerns that clean energy jobs aren’t being created at the pace or scale needed to keep up with job losses in the North Sea oil and gas sector. Whilst the UK Government didn’t acknowledge this view in their response, it is encouraging to see clear commitments and plans to create more secure clean energy jobs.

“The proof, of course, will be in the delivery. We’ve yet to see concrete evidence of delivery and implementation of these initiatives, and the committee will continue to monitor the UK Government’s progress closely to ensure it delivers for Scottish workers.

“I also welcome the re-affirmation of plans to introduce a reformed windfall tax mechanism after 2030. However, whilst this is a positive step, the UK Government could’ve gone further. Keeping the Energy Profits Levy in place for another four years risks accelerating the industry's decline and job losses, even though it's well-known that the UK will need oil and gas in its energy mix for decades to come as we transition to net zero.”

The group of bipartisan officials is pushing PJM to adopt rules that would get more power on the grid as quickly as possible — without passing new costs onto consumers who are already struggling with higher grocery, housing, and energy bills.

The principles provide consumers critical protection by extending for two more years the price cap that Governor Shapiro won after he sued PJM in 2024 to stop unjustified price hikes.

The Governor made clear that his involvement was contingent on extending the price cap he negotiated following his lawsuit — ensuring consumer protections remained at the center of all discussions.

If implemented as proposed, the extended price cap would save more than 67 million consumers — including 13 million Pennsylvanians — within the PJM region approximately $27 billion over the next two years with $5 billion in Pennsylvania alone.

These savings would be in addition to $18.2 billion already saved as a direct result of Governor Shapiro’s 2024 lawsuit.

Secretary Wright, Secretary Burgum, Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin, Maryland Governor Wes Moore, and Ohio Governor Mike DeWine signed the Statement of Principles at the event.

In total, all 13 governors from PJM states have signed onto the Principles, underscoring broad bipartisan support for extending the price cap and advancing PJM reform.

“For two years, I’ve been sounding the alarm, explaining that without fundamental changes to PJM — Pennsylvanians were going to be paying more and more, and getting nothing in return,” said Governor Shapiro. “I sued PJM when they refused to act and secured a price cap that saved consumers tens of billions of dollars on their energy bills.

“Since then I’ve been working with my fellow governors and federal energy officials to push PJM to make needed reforms, and I’m glad the White House is following Pennsylvania’s lead and adopting the solutions we’ve been pushing for — including the extension of the price cap that I insisted be included today.

“In Pennsylvania, we’ve been focused on creating more energy, permitting faster, and protecting consumers — we’re showing what’s possible when government leads the way and gets stuff done.”

The agreement comes as the PJM Board is considering revised rules for the upcoming 2028-29 Capacity Auction, to be held in June.

Governor Shapiro called on the PJM Board to immediately adopt the Statement of Principles for the upcoming auction to ensure that consumers are protected from further energy price spikes.

The Statement of Principles being advanced would require PJM to:

-- Trigger a special “backstop” capacity auction offering generators up to 15-year commitments to accelerate the construction of new power plants

-- Allocate the cost of those long-term contracts to data centers and new large users that have not brought their own power — instead of shifting those costs onto households and small businesses

-- Significantly accelerate PJM’s interconnection process, including a firm 150-day deadline and expedited treatment for shovel-ready projects

-- Launch a new PJM process to deliver long-term market reforms while extending Governor Shapiro’s negotiated price cap for the next two auctions

Together, these reforms are designed to lower costs, strengthen reliability, and finally fix PJM’s broken process — allowing economic growth and data center development to continue without burdening ratepayers, Gov. Shapiro said.

Even before today, Pennsylvania was leading the nation on energy. The Commonwealth is the second-largest energy producer in the country and the second-largest net exporter of energy, behind only Texas.

Under Governor Shapiro’s leadership, Pennsylvania is producing more energy than ever before — including restarting operations at Unit 1 on Three Mile Island, converting former coal-fired power plants into modern natural gas facilities, and adding approximately five gigawatts of new generation to the regional grid.

At the same time, Governor Shapiro has prioritized making government move faster.

Through his Lightning Energy Plan, the Governor is working with the General Assembly to streamline permitting, cut red tape, and connect new energy projects to the grid more quickly — a model that complements and reinforces the PJM reforms being advanced today.

US DOE/Interior Comments

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, vice-chair and chair of the National Energy Dominance Council respectively, had these comments on the Statement of Principles they said would help “build big power plants again”--

“High electricity prices are a choice,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright. “The Biden administration’s forceful closures of coal and natural gas plants without reliable replacements left the United States in an energy emergency. Perhaps no region in America is more at risk than in PJM.

“That’s why President Trump asked governors across the Mid-Atlantic to come together and call upon PJM to allow America to build big reliable power plants again.

“Our directives will restore affordable and reliable electricity so American families thrive and America’s manufacturing industries once again boom. President Trump promised to unleash American energy and put the American people first. This plan keeps that promise.""

""For too long, the Green New Scam has left Mid-Atlantic families in the dark with skyrocketing bills,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. “Today, under President Trump's leadership, the National Energy Dominance Council has come up with a solution to end these high costs, roll back the Biden administration’s policies of energy scarcity, and ensure we are powering the Mid-Atlantic and part of the Midwest’s future without charging its citizens a cent.

“This initiative will ensure we usher in the age of artificial intelligence with new power plants funded by the technology companies, not taxpayers, securing the steel of Pennsylvania, the manufacturing of Ohio, and the ships of Virginia. The Trump administration is keeping the lights on, the factories humming, and the American Dream affordable.""

Fact Sheet: President’s Administration Outlines Plan To Build Big Power Plants Again

Reaction

Claire Lang-Ree, Natural Resources Defense Council’s advocate for the Sustainable FERC Project, issued this statement--

“This announcement represents rare bipartisanship – governors from PJM states have united to protect the 67 million Americans in PJM from skyrocketing energy bills and the risk of blackouts due to the rapid pace of new data centers and fossil fuel un-reliability.

“Rightfully, there is a recognition that the time to act is now, but two key elements are missing in addressing costs and reliability.

“PJM needs to require that data centers bring their own new power supply or otherwise face interruptions when there’s not enough power to go around.

“It also needs to make sure that new power plants for data centers don't get to cut in line in front of power plants that are trying to connect to bring down prices.

“Everyday people can’t afford to pay the price and bear the risks of data center growth, and we need solutions that will actually deliver on that promise.

“If the Trump administration wants to secure ‘energy dominance,’ it needs to clear the way for the power sources that are the cheapest and fastest to build.

“That means reversing course, ending its cynical attacks on solar and wind power, and helping to get those projects built and connected as soon as possible. Propping up old, dirty energy sources makes no sense.”

PJM grid covers 67 million people in 13 mid-Atlantic and inland states

Rising power bills cause political backlash in PJM region

WASHINGTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - The White House on Friday urged the largest U.S. electric grid to conduct an emergency power auction to protect against rolling blackouts as energy demand from data centers grows faster than the country can build new generation plants.

The Trump administration initiative calls on PJM Interconnection, which serves 67 million customers in 13 states and Washington, D.C., to conduct an emergency procurement auction to address escalating electricity prices and growing reliability risks across the mid-Atlantic region of the United States.

PJM later on Friday unveiled its own plan, which called for big data centers to voluntarily bring their own new generation or face the potential of having their power supply curtailed during peak demand periods. The grid operator also called for the creation of an accelerated interconnection track for state-sponsored generation projects.

At a White House event, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum joined several state governors to discuss initiatives to speed the construction of more than $15 billion in new power generation on PJM, which has been criticized for being too slow to build a cushion against rotating blackouts as demand rises.

Rapid expansion of data centers to fuel things like artificial intelligence has stretched the resources of PJM and other regional U.S. electric grids. President Donald Trump is seeking to combat consumer price inflation that risks undermining support for Republicans ahead of November's midterm elections.

The White House is seeking caps on the amount existing power plants can charge in the PJM capacity market. A recent PJM capacity market auction set record-high prices for power generators that were more than 800% higher than the previous year, increasing electricity prices for homes and businesses.

The agreement would also require data centers to pay for the new generation built on their behalf – whether they show up and use the power or not - rather than buying up existing power. The concept is called BYOG, or ""bring your own generation.""

PJM said it is reviewing the principles set forth by the White House and governors. PJM was not invited to the event, a PJM spokesperson told Reuters.

PJM has forecast that the grid's peak usage in the summer will climb by about 70 gigawatts to 220 gigawatts over the next 15 years. The record summer peak for PJM was 165 gigawatts in 2006.

Since 2023, PJM says it has processed more than 170 gigawatts of new generation requests. Nearly 60 gigawatts of projects have completed PJM's study process and have either signed or been offered generation interconnection agreements.

RISING POWER BILLS HAVE LED TO BACKLASH

Rising power bills in PJM's region have led to a political backlash over the last year and threats by some governors to abandon the regional grid. Last summer, nine state governors wrote an open letter to the PJM board of managers criticizing the grid operator for not doing enough to address an escalating electricity affordability crisis.

""Unfortunately, what we have seen in our region is that PJM has been too damn slow to let new generation onto the grid at a time where energy demand is going up,"" Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said at the White House event on Friday.

Burgum said PJM has been lucky so far in avoiding widespread blackouts.

Meanwhile, countries like Japan and South Korea are already integrating ammonia into national energy strategies, spurring demand for low-emission imports.","Long seen as essential to global agriculture, ammonia is now being re-evaluated as a potential clean fuel—thanks to its high energy density and existing infrastructure for storage and transport. With demand poised to grow in sectors like shipping and power generation, the question is no longer just whether low-carbon ammonia is technically possible, but whether it can scale affordably and sustainably.

The MIT Energy Initiative (MITEI) has released a study that aims to answer that. Using the largest harmonized dataset of its kind, researchers modeled ammonia supply chains across 63 countries to compare six different production pathways—factoring in energy prices, emissions, shipping logistics, and financial variables. Their findings provide one of the most comprehensive global assessments yet of what it might actually take to make ammonia a viable clean energy vector.

Decarbonizing Ammonia: No Silver Bullet

Currently, most ammonia is produced via the fossil-fuel-intensive Haber-Bosch process, contributing nearly 2% of global greenhouse gas emissions. While this ""gray ammonia"" remains cost-competitive in many markets, it's the most carbon-heavy option.

The MITEI analysis lays out the tradeoffs involved in switching to lower-carbon alternatives. Pairing conventional systems with carbon capture (blue ammonia) can cut emissions by about 71%, while pushing production costs up more than 23%. Switching to electrolyzed ammonia powered by renewables or nuclear (green ammonia) reduces emissions by nearly 100%, but raises costs by up to 46%.

Interestingly, not all low-carbon technologies perform equally. Autothermal reforming with carbon capture can outperform retrofitted systems both in cost and emissions. Nuclear-powered pathways also stand out for their low emissions and relatively stable costs, depending on location.

These regional differences are key. Countries with cheap natural gas or clean electricity sources—such as parts of the Middle East or China—are well-positioned to lead in low-carbon ammonia production. Meanwhile, countries like Japan and South Korea are already integrating ammonia into national energy strategies, spurring demand for low-emission imports.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20260114-104306-8e0-MIT-Ammonia-Supply-Chain-01-press_0.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 00:58:32.074626

The terms of the potential agreement are still under negotiation, with some sources suggesting that Ford could import batteries from BYD to its plants outside the United States. However, officials emphasized that talks are ongoing and a deal may not ultimately be reached.

If finalized, the agreement would link Ford with China’s largest automaker, BYD, a company that has raised concerns within the American auto industry due to its ability to manufacture affordable vehicles with advanced technology.

For Ford, the partnership would help address a critical battery supply challenge as the company shifts focus away from fully electric vehicles while expanding its hybrid vehicle lineup. BYD, known for its expertise in premium automobile batteries, could supply the needed components.

Much of the blame has been laid at the feet of tech companies and data center operators, which have been using increasing amounts of power for AI.
Building new fossil fuel power plants is a years-long proposition costing hundreds of millions of dollars.
If the AI boom fizzles, they could be left with unprofitable power plants that are built to operate for decades.","The Trump administration wants the largest electricity grid to add $15 billion worth of new power generation — and he wants tech companies to pay for it, even if they don’t need the capacity.

The White House and the governors of several states in the region want grid operator PJM to hold an auction for 15-year contracts for new generating capacity. The administration said it wants tech companies to bid on the contracts even if they don’t ultimately need the power for their data centers. Demand from data centers is expected to increase nearly threefold over the next decade.

PJM said it was reviewing the “statement of principles” and that it would soon release the results of a months-long planning process that is looking to add new capacity to the grid.

The statement is nonbonding, though, and behind the scenes, PJM doesn’t appear to be jazzed about the administration attempting to force its hand. “We don’t have a lot to say on this,” PJM spokesman Jeffrey Shields told Bloomberg yesterday. “We were not invited to the event they are apparently having tomorrow and we will not be there.”

PJM Interconnection, which covers 13 states in the Mid-Atlantic and the Midwest, serves more than 65 million people and includes the data center hotspot of northern Virginia. Electricity rates in 2025 were up about 10% to 15% in the region compared with the year before.

In the last decade, PJM’s peak load has increased 10%, according to Monitoring Analytics, and it’s expected to increase another 6.5% in 2027.

Much of the blame has been laid at the feet of tech companies and data center operators, which have been using increasing amounts of power for AI.

The price of natural gas is also to blame. PJM is heavily dependent on the fossil fuel, and the price has soared recently. Monitoring Analytics, PJM’s independent monitor, says that about 60% of 2025’s price increases are the result of high prices for fossil fuels.

Grid operators have been put in a bind as data centers have ramped up demand for electricity after more than a decade of zero growth.

Building new fossil fuel power plants is a years-long proposition costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Many utilities and power providers are hesitant to commit to those timelines and outlays. If the AI boom fizzles, they could be left with unprofitable power plants that are built to operate for decades.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/qeftC6RZLJirZZ9D.bkOTg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/techcrunch_finance_785/acfe05b43f5b077609159402616b731a,N,,2026-01-16 18:01:12.065285

CRGA created a commission called Integrated Resource Planning [IRP] to research lowering energy prices and making a more efficient grid.
The 2021 law set a goal using only clean energy in the Illinois electrical grid by 2050 and investing more in clean energy jobs.
Pritzker, when signing the bill, said soaring energy prices in Illinois are directly attributable to President Trump’s tariffs on products needed for clean energy construction.
They also introduced a measure to get data on how current energy laws are affecting energy prices.","Illinois will see more investment into renewable energy, based on a new bill Gov. JB Pritzker has signed into law.

The Clean and Reliable Grid Act [CRGA] is intended to expand the state’s energy capacity in hopes of lowering energy prices. Opponents say it's unclear if the measure will do that.

CRGA created a commission called Integrated Resource Planning [IRP] to research lowering energy prices and making a more efficient grid. The bill will also lift the moratorium on new large-scale nuclear power plants.

CRGA will invest in solar and wind energy and battery storage. This is a continuation of Illinois' goal to use more renewable energy, and aims to meet the goals of the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act [CEJA]. The 2021 law set a goal using only clean energy in the Illinois electrical grid by 2050 and investing more in clean energy jobs.

State Rep. Sharon Chung, a Democrat from Bloomington, said there is a finite amount of coal and natural gas, and CRGA will make Illinois less reliant on non-renewable energy.

“It's just trying to figure out the balance between looking forward ... maybe also balancing that with past technologies, trying to figure out how we can also, at the same time, keep costs down,” Chung said.

She said the bill might not bring down costs for consumers but it will prevent more price increases.

Chung said McLean County has been at the forefront of building wind farms and battery storage that can help distribute energy more efficiently.

“Taking that energy that we're getting from wind and solar, harnessing it and then to be able to use it to meet higher demand periods,” she said.

Chung said she supports an expansion of nuclear energy and she still has concerns about the power usage of data centers.

Chung said there is only so much Illinois can do to lower energy costs and it is up to the federal government to also provide relief for consumers.

Pritzker, when signing the bill, said soaring energy prices in Illinois are directly attributable to President Trump’s tariffs on products needed for clean energy construction.

“More fossil fuels will be used to produce electricity, and that drives property insurance bills up. It threatens our agriculture industry. It pollutes the air that we breathe. It's a reckless energy agenda that's taking us backward,” Pritzker said.

State Sen. Sally Turner, R-Beason, who voted ""no"" on CRGA, said she is concerned about the reliability of wind energy, solar energy and battery storage technology.

“There's going to be shortages and reliability risks, and those risks are out there, and they're not going to be met with what we presently have and it's not going to be met with simply wind, solar and battery power backup,” Turner said.

Turner said Illinois should invest more into natural gas because it is more reliable and cost effective.

Turner said this bill will give money to energy companies instead of lowering energy costs for families.

“When it comes to ‘I need assistance with my energy bill,’ because we know that's out of control right now, a lot of what I think we see that it's going to special interests,” Turner said.

She said the creation of a research process to help slow rising costs is a good idea but thinks it might be too late for it to effectively lower energy costs.

Turner said the legislature should look to increase taxes on solar, wind and data centers. She said they are not paying their fair share now.

Sen. Chris Balkema, R-Channahon, also voted against CRGA. He said the Illinois government should not be giving incentives to any energy companies.

“I would support energy providers being able to provide energy on their own dime, investing their own capital, and then being able to turn a profit,” Balkema said.

Balkema said since CEJA is moving toward only relying on clean energy by 2050, there is no incentive for companies to build new coal or natural gas plants.

“I think that we are in an OK spot in that we have to be careful to not regulate ourselves back to the point where we drive prices even higher than we anticipate now,” Balkema said.

Turner and Balkema said they agreed with allowing more nuclear plants to be built.

“The opportunity to install small nuclear power plants, or micro plants, to provide additional energy around the state is a wonderful thing,” Balkema said.

Turner and Senate Republicans want to give more local control when building energy infrastructure.

The Senate GOP is pushing to repeal the state’s self-imposed mandate to be 100% reliant on renewable energy, in hopes that the state would see more investment by all energy companies, which could lower prices.

They also introduced a measure to get data on how current energy laws are affecting energy prices.

An environmental advocate who supports the energy bill pointed out there is no stipulation preventing fossil fuels from being factored into the state’s short-term energy plan, as the state ramps up investment in renewables.

“What is the right grid mix to ensure both reliability, so that the lights are staying on for folks and not creating an outage front, but also that utility bills are manageable and not skyrocketing?” said Samira Hanaessian, director of policy for the Illinois Environmental Council.

Hanaessian said the process can lower costs for consumers and continue building on Illinois’ climate goals.

She said the next step is to regulate data centers by making them build their own electrical infrastructure.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1ee0c6e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+25/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F86%2F03%2Fc94532b548dc93bb4551c4a2017e%2Falta-farms-operational-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 17:00:24.493022

“These three things we didn’t have,” said Jacob Cooke, the CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, which helps exporters navigate the Chinese market.
China responded by imposing duties of 100% on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25% on pork and seafood.
Collectively, the import taxes effectively closed the Chinese market to Canadian canola, an industry group has said.
“For the exchange of a small piece of the Canadian market, we have a commitment.","Breaking with the United States, Canada has agreed to cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Friday.

Carney made the announcement after two days of meetings with Chinese leaders. He said there would be an initial annual cap of 49,000 vehicles on Chinese EV exports to Canada, growing to about 70,000 over five years. China will reduce its total tariff on canola seeds, a major Canadian export, from 84% to about 15%, he told reporters.

“Our relationship has progressed in recent months with China. It is more predictable and you see results coming from that,” Carney said.

Carney hasn’t been able to reach a deal with President Trump to reduce some tariffs that are punishing some key sectors of the Canadian economy and Trump has previously talked about making Canada the 51st state.

Earlier Friday, Carney and Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged to improve relations between their two nations after years of acrimony.

Xi told Carney in a meeting at the Great Hall of the People that he is willing to continue working to improve ties, noting that talks have been underway on restoring and restarting cooperation since the two held an initial meeting in October on the sidelines of a regional economic conference in South Korea.

Carney looks to improve global governance

Carney, the first Canadian prime minister to visit China in eight years, told Xi that better relations would help improve a global governance system that he described as “under great strain.”

Later, he said at the news conference that the system may give way at least in part to country-to-country or regional agreements rather than the global ones that have underpinned economic growth in the post-World War II era.

“The question is: What gets built in that place? How much of a patchwork is it?” he said.

The new reality reflects in large part the so-called America-first approach of Trump. The tariffs he has imposed have hit both the Canadian and Chinese economies. Carney, who has met with several leading Chinese companies in Beijing, said ahead of his trip that his government is focused on building an economy less reliant on the U.S. at what he called “a time of global trade disruption.”

A Canadian business owner in China called Carney’s visit game-changing, saying it re-establishes dialogue, respect and a framework between the two nations.

“These three things we didn’t have,” said Jacob Cooke, the CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, which helps exporters navigate the Chinese market. “The parties were not talking for years.”

Canada had been aligned with U.S. on tariffs

Canada had followed the U.S. in putting tariffs of 100% on EVs from China and 25% on steel and aluminum under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Carney’s predecessor.

China responded by imposing duties of 100% on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25% on pork and seafood. It added a 75.8% tariff on canola seeds last August. Collectively, the import taxes effectively closed the Chinese market to Canadian canola, an industry group has said. Overall, China’s imports from Canada fell 10.4% last year to $41.7 billion, according to Chinese trade data.

Carney tried to address the concerns of Canadian automakers and auto workers by saying the initial cap on Chinese EV imports was about 3% of the 1.8 million vehicles sold in Canada annually and that, in exchange, China is expected to begin investing in the Canadian auto industry within three years.

“We’re building (a) new part of our car industry, building cars of the future in partnership, bringing affordable autos for Canadians at a time when affordability is top of mind, and doing it at a scale that allows for a smooth transition in the sector,” he said.

“For the exchange of a small piece of the Canadian market, we have a commitment. We are waiting for an investment commitment in Canada. The real leaders of the new industry. So it’s an agreement that will create the future for our industry.”

But Ontario Premier Doug Ford, the leader of Canada’s most populous province where the country’s auto sector is based, blasted the deal.

“Make no mistake: China now has a foothold in the Canadian market and will use it to their full advantage at the expense of Canadian workers,” Ford posted on social media.

“Worse, by lowering tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles this lopsided deal risks closing the door on Canadian automakers to the American market, our largest export destination.”

China sees an opening under Trump

China is hoping Trump’s pressure tactics on allies such as Canada will drive them to pursue a foreign policy that is less aligned with the United States. The U.S. president has suggested Canada could become America’s 51st state.

Carney, though, noted Canada’s relationship with the U.S. is much more multifaceted, deeper and broader. Canada and China have different systems and disagree on issues such as human rights, he said, limiting the scope of their engagement even as they seek ways to cooperate on areas of common interest.

The Canadian leader leaves China on Saturday and visits Qatar on Sunday before attending the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum in Switzerland next week.

The US electric car industry is entering a new phase.","The American market for electric cars hit a speed bump in 2025. For the first time in many years, the number of people buying these high-tech machines actually went down. Dealerships usually see more shoppers every year, but 2025 ended with about 1.28 million units sold. This was a 2 percent drop from the 1.3 million sales recorded in 2024.

There were several reasons for this shift, including the end of government tax credits and prices that stayed way too high for many families. Even though there are more choices than ever, some drivers decided to wait before making the switch to electric.

Top 10 US EV Brands Sales Volume 2024 v 2025 - source: ArenaEV

Tesla kept its spot as the biggest name in the American EV market, but its grip on customers is loosening. In 2024, nearly half of all electric cars sold in the US carried the Tesla badge. By the end of 2025, that number fell from 48.7 percent to 46.2 percent. The company sold 589,160 vehicles during the year, which was a 7 percent decrease compared to the year before. The Tesla Model Y is still the most popular electric car in the country, with 357,528 units delivered, but even its sales slipped by 4 percent.

Tesla might be getting the cold shoulder treatment, but General Motors had a very successful year. The company sold 169,887 EVs in 2025, which is a massive 48 percent jump over its 2024 performance. Chevrolet was a major reason for this win. The Chevrolet Equinox EV became a favorite for many buyers, doubling its sales to reach 57,945 units.

Cadillac also had a great year, growing its sales by over 69 percent to reach 49,152 vehicles. GM is proving that offering a variety of different models can attract people who were not interested in electric cars before.

Not every traditional car brand shared in the success. Ford struggled to keep up, seeing its sales drop by over 14 percent to 84,113 units. The Ford F-150 Lightning saw an 18.5 percent decline as only 27,307 people drove one home. Other brands like Kia and BMW also saw fewer customers. Kia had a particularly rough time, with sales crashing nearly 40 percent. These numbers show that just having an electric car for sale is not enough anymore. Buyers are looking for specific features and better deals before they open their wallets.

Some international brands managed to find a few bright spots in the data. Volkswagen saw its sales grow by nearly 57 percent, led by the ID.4 model, which sold 22,373 units. Honda also moved up the ladder with its Prologue model, selling 39,194 vehicles. Hyundai stayed steady as well, with its Ioniq 5 selling 47,039 units. These companies are fighting hard for the customers who are moving away from Tesla. Even though the total market shrank a little bit, the competition between the brands is getting much more intense.

The US electric car industry is entering a new phase. We are no longer seeing the wild, rapid growth of the early years. Instead, the market is maturing. With 1.28 million sales, EVs are still a huge part of the American car world. Car makers will have to work a little bit harder to lower prices and offer better technology if they want to see those numbers go back up in 2026.",https://st.arenaev.com/news/26/01/gm-gains-ground-as-us-ev-sales-cool-down/-828x414/arenaev_000.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 17:00:18.871965

Big Number

3,789. That’s the number of data centers active across the U.S., according to the Data Center Map. By 2030, these centers will account for more than 10% of the country’s total electricity consumption, according to projections from the International Energy Agency.

Key Background

Excessive power usage by AI data centers boomed with increased adoption and has been a cause of concern for years, particularly in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions, which have a population of more than 67 million people and are managed by PJM. This has increased household electricity bills, contributing to the cost-of-living crisis, which is threatening Republicans’ re-election prospects. Trump has suggested building new power plants as a solution repeatedly.

China will reduce its tariff on canola seeds, a major Canadian export, from about 84% to about 15%, he told reporters.
“It can be said that our meeting last year opened a new chapter in turning China–Canada relations toward improvement,” China's top leader said.
China responded by imposing duties of 100% on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25% on pork and seafood.
Collectively, the import taxes effectively closed the Chinese market to Canadian canola, an industry group has said.","BEIJING (AP) — Breaking with the United States, Canada has agreed to cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Friday.

Carney made the announcement after two days of meetings with Chinese leaders. He said there would be an initial cap of 49,000 vehicles on Chinese EV exports to Canada, growing to 70,000 over five years. China will reduce its tariff on canola seeds, a major Canadian export, from about 84% to about 15%, he told reporters.

“It has been a historic and productive two days,” Carney said, speaking outside against the backdrop of a traditional pavilion and a frozen pond at a Beijing park. “We have to understand the differences between Canada and other countries, and focus our efforts to work together where we’re aligned.”

Earlier Friday, he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged to improve relations between their two nations after years of acrimony.

Xi told Carney in a meeting at the Great Hall of the People that he is willing to continue working to improve ties, noting that talks have been underway on restoring and restarting cooperation since the two held an initial meeting in October on the sidelines of a regional economic conference in South Korea.

“It can be said that our meeting last year opened a new chapter in turning China–Canada relations toward improvement,” China's top leader said.

Carney looks to improve global governance

Carney, the first Canadian prime minister to visit China in eight years, said better relations would help improve a global governance system that he described as “under great strain.”

He called for a new relationship “adapted to new global realities” and cooperation in agriculture, energy and finance.

Those new realities reflect in large part the so-called America-first approach of U.S. President Donald Trump. The tariffs he has imposed have hit both the Canadian and Chinese economies. Carney, who has met with several leading Chinese companies in Beijing, said ahead of his trip that his government is focused on building an economy less reliant on the U.S. at what he called “a time of global trade disruption.”

A Canadian business owner in China called Carney's visit game-changing, saying it re-establishes dialogue, respect and a framework between the two nations.

“These three things we didn’t have,” said Jacob Cooke, the CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, which helps exporters navigate the Chinese market. “The parties were not talking for years.”

Canada had been aligned with US on tariffs

Canada had followed the U.S. in putting tariffs of 100% on EVs from China and 25% on steel and aluminum under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Carney’s predecessor.

China responded by imposing duties of 100% on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25% on pork and seafood. It added a 75.8% tariff on canola seeds last August. Collectively, the import taxes effectively closed the Chinese market to Canadian canola, an industry group has said. Overall, China's imports from Canada fell 10.4% last year to $41.7 billion, according to Chinese trade data.

China is hoping Trump’s pressure tactics on allies such as Canada will drive them to pursue a foreign policy that is less aligned with the United States. The U.S. president has suggested Canada could become America's 51st state.

Carney departs China on Saturday and visits Qatar on Sunday before attending the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum in Switzerland next week. He will meet business leaders and investors in Qatar to promote trade and investment, his office said.

In an industry known for its booms and busts, higher oil prices have historically spurred greater drilling activity, and therefore more hiring. But this link broke after years of poor returns to investors following the bursting of the shale bubble in the mid-2010s.

New technologies to drill faster for cheaper, corporate mergers and robots replacing humans on rigs resulted in the disappearance of some 250,000 jobs since the sector's employment peaked in 2014. Production surged 50% during that time.

In 2025, even as output reached new highs and a pro-drilling president returned to the White House, payrolls are hovering at the lowest level in three years.

“This industry has always been cyclical. You ride the wave when it’s good, and you brace for the downturn,” said Karr Ingham, president of the Texas Alliance of Energy Producers. “But what’s different now is, even when prices recover, we don’t see the same hiring bounce we used to.”

That means fewer career opportunities for people like Shaun Carter, a geologist who was laid off when the Oklahoma-based exploration and production company he was working for in 2019 unexpectedly shuttered.

Carter took up truck driving out of Houston — crisscrossing the Southeast and Midwest — assuming it would be temporary. More than six years later, he’s still driving, and his dreams of returning to the industry are fading.

“My hopes aren’t very high,” Carter said, calling from his truck while waiting at a loading dock.

In the years after the 2014 oil price crash, investors pushed companies to focus on profits instead of growth, triggering a wave of consolidation and job losses. Mergers and acquisitions activity in the sector has exceeded $500 billion since the start of 2023, according to Bloomberg calculations, more than a 20% increase compared with the prior three years. Major players continued to reduce headcount in the past year as crude prices fell, with Chevron Corp., ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil Corp. all announcing job cuts in 2025.

US oil producers are pumping a record 13.8 million barrels of crude a day, and they’re doing so with less than a third of the active drilling rigs than in 2014. That means each rig is now producing roughly four times as much oil as it did a decade ago — “brutally efficient,” as Ingham says — thanks to powerful equipment, refined techniques, automation as well as incentives to encourage workers to drill faster.

While the Trump administration apprehended former Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro in part to access the nation's vast oil reserves, major US oil executives have expressed caution about investing in the country. Analysts similarly doubt that the move will open up more jobs in the sector for Americans, as the domestic workforce is available and probably much cheaper, said Fernando Valle, managing director at Hedgeye Risk Management LLC.

Since taking office last year, President Donald Trump has made it a priority to increase US oil and gas production by relaxing environmental regulations and pushing to open more federal land and waters to drilling. But some experts doubt that proposals to expand offshore drilling will result in new jobs. Those rigs will be unmanned in the future, said Ramanan Krishnamoorti, an energy professor at the University of Houston.

“They’ll be entirely run by robots and automation, with much of it handled onshore,” Krishnamoorti said. “We’re likely to see a very different oil and gas industry — far fewer jobs, and the remaining ones out of harm’s way.”

With oil currently priced around $60 a barrel, producers in some regions are right around that breakeven level that’s just high enough to keep wells running but too low to fatten profits. It’s a fine line for Trump too, who wants to advocate for the industry’s profitability but lower gas prices for everyday Americans.

Energy executives polled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas said oil prices need to be around $65 a barrel to justify drilling a new well. Prices have remained below that level for the past three months, and even a spike would need to be sustained to persuade producers to ramp up spending.

“There’s this squeeze of trying to wring out as much cost as possible,” said Trey Cowan, an analyst with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “Labor is the first place that really takes the punch.”

Thanks in part to the efficiencies, some of the producers who have slashed jobs are performing better than expected. In the latest quarter, ConocoPhillips’ production exceeded its own highest estimate despite a decline in capital spending. Similarly, Chevron saw increased output in the Permian Basin even with fewer rigs.

Carter has come close to getting back into the industry multiple times. Most recently, Marathon Oil called him in May 2024: After he was a runner-up for an earlier position, the company wanted him to consider a different opening. He said he was interested, and was told to expect a call in the coming days.

Days later, driving his rig to a Costco in Tulsa, Oklahoma, he heard on the radio that ConocoPhillips had submitted a bid to buy Marathon.

“I was like, ‘Oh no, I know what that means,’” Carter said. He never heard about the position again.

BYD, the world’s top seller of electric vehicles, is among several battery suppliers Ford is talking to, said the people, who asked not to be identified revealing internal discussions. No deal is imminent, they said.

The discussions are aimed at supplying Ford’s international factories with batteries for the automaker’s expanding line of hybrids, the people said.

The hybrids built in Ford’s overseas factories would be exported worldwide, including to the United States, the people said. But most hybrids Ford sells in the United States would continue to come from factories in North America.

BYD didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Ford said the automaker “talks to lots of companies about many things. We don’t comment on rumors or speculation about our business.”

Ford has sourced batteries from BYD since 2020 for its joint-venture Chinese factories with state-owned Changan Automobile Co. It also has a battery deal with China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. to use its technology for production at a plant in south-central Michigan.

The potential pact with BYD drew immediate political blowback, with White House trade adviser Peter Navarro and Michigan member of Congress questioning the deal.

House China Panel Chair John Moolenaar, R-Caledonia, said Ford “should work with our allies, not our adversaries.”

“If reports that Ford is in discussions to potentially partner with a second Chinese battery company were to come true, it would diminish Ford’s status as an iconic American company,” Moolenaar said in an emailed statement.

BYD overtook Telsa Inc. as the world’s biggest seller of electric vehicles last year. While the Chinese company is effectively shut out of the U.S. market by punitive tariffs, it is making inroads in markets from South America to Europe and Southeast Asia with its range of affordable tech-forward EVs.

Hybrid sales have grown worldwide as the market for pure electric vehicles has slowed. Ford is ramping up hybrid production and has plans to roll out more gas-electric models. The automaker recently launched an extended-range electric version of the Bronco in China that'll be exported internationally.

Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley told reporters on the sidelines of the Detroit Auto Show that there are no plans yet to bring the EREV Bronco to the United States, but added, “you should expect a lot of exciting powertrains for Bronco.”

“We’re really accelerating our investment in EREVs and hybrids,” Farley said. “We’ve been really successful with the F-150 hybrid. Now we want to go across the range with hybrids and EREVs.”

News of Ford’s talks with BYD, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, sent ADRs of the Chinese automaker up 3.6% Thursday. Ford shares fell less than 1% to close at $13.81.

The Trump Administration's EPA: Deregulation in 2026

Two recent actions by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) show the Trump administration’s commitment to the coal industry and to redefine the landscape of electricity generation over the next decade.

The Great Energy Contradiction of 2026

“Oil markets are oversupplied heading into 2026, pressuring prices and favoring integrated majors and midstream infrastructure over pure upstream exposure.”

While oil supply has historically signaled energy security, the landscape is rapidly changing. Reliable, dispatchable power is now the determining factor for energy security. The article contends that the power grid is thus becoming the most consequential energy story of 2026. PJM Interconnection's most recent capacity auction resulted in a surge in prices due to the shortage of firm power. Infrastructure and reliable power production plants are now the key constraints on economic growth. --- Steven W. Lee

How American Companies could Access World's Largest Oil Reserves Through Venezuela

“While the U.S. action is unlikely to have an immediate impact on crude prices given the current glut in the market, it could upend energy markets and have an impact on the geopolitical landscape.”

Why this is important: Venezuela produces heavy crude oil, which is essential for the production of diesel fuel, asphalt, and other fuels for heavy equipment. This is important as this heavy crude oil is in short supply around the world after the United States placed sanctions on the oil from Venezuela and Russia, where it is also produced.

The Venezuelan oil industry has been neglected and will likely require billions of dollars to repair its infrastructure; accessing the oil would have a significant impact. Although the United States’ action in Venezuela is unlikely to cause near-term impact on these heavy crude oil prices, it could eventually influence the energy market and geopolitical landscape. Per the article, Venezuelan oil, in combination with massive oil finds off the coast of Guyana, can have a major impact on international energy markets, putting the United States in a position to have about 30 percent of the world's total global oil reserves. --- Taiesha K. Morgan

Rein in CWIP to Protect Ratepayers from Bloated Infrastructure Costs: Report

“When utilities use ‘construction work in progress’ accounting, ‘cost overruns become profit opportunities rather than financial penalties,’ the authors of a Manhattan Institute brief said.”

Why this is important: The article summarizes an academic report issued by the Manhattan Institute that critiques the use of Construction Work in Progress or “CWIP” accounting and surcharge cost recovery, which monopoly utilities seek to use in collecting the costs of projects that they undertake, such as building a new power plant or a transmission line. This method shields the utility and its shareholders from the risk of those investments by recovering those costs from ratepayers before the projects are complete and providing a useful service. This has the effect of operating as a tax on consumers, and the article highlights examples of how CWIP can result in cost overruns and extended timelines. Ultimately, the paper recommends that public utility commissions disallow CWIP to protect consumers as we enter into an “infrastructure-building super cycle” for new electric transmission and generation projects. --- Derrick Price Williamson

How Clean Energy could Save Us Trillions

“As clean energy prices fall, a fast transition to renewable energy is the cheapest option on the table.”

Why this is important: The article claims that transitioning to clean energy is a major economic opportunity that gets overshadowed by environmental talking points. A quick transition to clean energy could save the global economy trillions of dollars because the more renewable energy technology being made, the cheaper it becomes. This theory is known as a “learning curve,” which is akin to what happened to aircraft, cars, computers, and DNA sequencing over the past century. The article posits that, like those industries, clean energy prices will continue to drop as more technology is developed. In the past 10 years, solar panel costs have dropped by around 90 percent, and wind power and renewable energy battery storage have also experienced price drops of 70 percent and 85 percent over the past 15 years. But not all clean energy technologies offer the same economic benefits; for example, nuclear power has continued to grow more expensive over time due to its high construction, maintenance, and operating costs, limiting its potential to deliver the trillions in savings seen with some renewable sources.

The article notes that, conversely, even with the infrastructure already in place, fossil fuels will remain costly because of the high operating costs associated with mining, transportation, and heavy machinery required to extract and process these fuels. Clean energy like solar and wind has high up-front costs, but once the infrastructure is in place, there are low operating costs, thus overall energy spending does not need to increase; instead, existing resources can be redirected from non-renewable fuels to renewable energy sources to accelerate the savings and growth. --- Nicholas A. Muto

An Uncertain Future Looms for Clean Energy Investment in West Virginia

“West Virginia and other Appalachian states counting on federal investment in clean energy are seeing funds vaporize, leaving communities uncertain about jobs, reduced emissions and their economic future.”

Why this is important: There is a real and immediate economic uncertainty facing West Virginia as clean energy investment stalls, a development that could have deep implications for jobs and regional growth. Federal funding and private clean energy investment that had begun to flow into the state and broader Appalachian region are now evaporating, creating an unpredictable future for communities that were counting on these projects to replace declining coal-related jobs and stimulate economic diversification. The article claims that this shift not only threatens promising clean energy infrastructure projects but also undermines efforts to modernize West Virginia’s energy sector at a time when broader U.S. clean energy investment has faced setbacks.

In addition, the article sheds light on how policy decisions and shifts at the federal level directly affect local economies and workforce opportunities in historically fossil-dependent regions. With billions previously committed to transforming West Virginia into a hub for clean technology manufacturing and energy production now at risk, the state’s ability to create more sustainable, high-quality jobs is in jeopardy. This story underscores the broader national debate over energy policy, the role of government incentives, and the competitive landscape for clean energy investment, all of which matter not just to West Virginia but to the future direction of the U.S. energy economy. --- Nicholas A. Muto

As Pa. Energy Prices Rise, Advocates Skeptical that Lawmakers will Put Aside Partisan Differences

“Consumers could feel an even greater squeeze in the years ahead, as utility companies predict that efforts to build data centers across the state to meet the artificial intelligence demand will worsen the crunch.”

Why this is important: Energy prices have increased precipitously in recent years, with data center demand accelerating. PJM Interconnection's 2024 auction resulted in prices increasing 800 percent from the prior year. In the December 2025 auction, prices hit a record high.

The Pennsylvania Legislature's solution to the price increase and rise in electricity demand is to focus on increasing energy production. Partisanship, however, may hinder Pennsylvania's ability to pass legislation to alleviate electricity costs and increase production. There are multiple proposals for different solutions – speeding up permitting, building more renewable energy or natural gas plants, developing more nuclear power, etc. While reducing energy costs is the goal, there is currently little agreement on how to achieve it. --- Steven W. Lee

The Data Center Rush in Appalachia

“According to a September 2025 report from the Energy & Manufacturing in Appalachia initiative, approximately 92 gigawatts of data center capacity are currently in the pipeline across the United States, with seven gigawatts being added monthly by the end of 2024.”

Why this is important: The U.S. Department of Energy projects that data centers could consume between 6.7 and 12 percent of total U.S. electricity by 2028. This growth requires new power generation. With the 300 traditional data center hubs becoming saturated in Northern Virginia, data center developers and tech companies are pushing for growth in the depopulated communities where coalfields used to populate in Kentucky, West Virginia, and Virginia. This growing industry could have an impact on tax revenue, the job market, and the environment. --- Taiesha K. Morgan

States are Powering the U.S. Electric Vehicle Transition – Even Amid Federal Uncertainty

“The results are unmistakable: every state has taken steps to advance electric vehicles, and many are deploying innovative policies that deliver cleaner air, lower costs, and create economic opportunity.”

Why this is important: A new state survey by the Environmental Defense Fund finds that while the federal government under the new administration has attempted to weaken or eliminate support for the transition to electric vehicles (EVs), states have continued to support the growth of EVs in private and public transportation. A 50-state survey finds all states are supporting EV transportation in a variety of ways. In rating states in 16 categories, including financial incentives, charging infrastructure, and support for public fleet electrification, the survey finds diverse states such as Arizona, Illinois, Alabama, and Colorado are supporting the transition to EVs. Colorado has rebates of $9,000 for new EVs and $6,000 for used ones; incentives in California range from $1,500 for plug-in hybrids to $330,000 for replacing fleet vehicles; and Texas is supporting using EVs to replace diesel vehicles. States are also incentivizing the installation of additional fast chargers and all states and DC are working on developing fast charging corridor plans. Finally, Connecticut and Maine are supporting public transportation vehicles by making the transition from diesel to 0 percent emission vehicles. While the elimination of federal tax credits has hurt the consumer market for EVs, state efforts will likely continue to cause the EV market to grow. --- Mark E. Heath

In Rooftop Solar, Advocates See a ‘Missed Opportunity’ for Clean Energy in Pennsylvania

“Pennsylvania lawmakers have been at an impasse on clean energy legislation for years. “

Why this is important: Once a leader in renewable energy, Pennsylvania has since fallen behind neighboring states in large part because of division in the State Legislature over energy policy. That could be changing. The passage of the $25 million Solar for Schools bill, which survived contentious state budget negotiations late last year, signals that there could be bipartisan support in Pennsylvania for distributed energy projects. Distributed energy projects are energy generation projects—such as small solar arrays—that serve customers in an immediate area and do not need to be connected to the grid. This makes them less complicated when it comes to passing legislation to fund or regulate these projects—and, as a result, could provide an opportunity for renewables to regain a foothold in the state. --- Jamie L. Martines

How the Ohio Supreme Court could Decide the Future of Ohio’s Solar Energy

“Ohio's highest court is reviewing multiple cases that hinge on how ‘public interest’ should be defined when approving large solar projects, with significant implications for Ohio's energy landscape.”

Why this is important: In addition to receiving approval from the Ohio Power Siting Board, developers interested in siting large-scale solar projects in Ohio are increasingly being asked to clear an additional hurdle: They must also convince the Ohio Supreme Court that a project is worth building in a particular area. More specifically, appeals from Ohio Power Siting Board decisions are asking the Court to consider whether projects “serve the public interest,” as required by Ohio state law, and how that phrase should be defined. As the article points out, the Court’s decisions in these cases will affect “what kinds of power Ohio generates, where it’s generated, and how quickly new solar energy comes online—if it comes online at all.” Developers planning projects in Ohio may want to consider how appeals from Ohio Power Siting Board decisions could affect project timelines and look to recent Court decisions for strategies to preempt those challenges. --- Jamie L. Martines

Duke Energy Florida Unveils Nation's First System Capable of Producing, Storing and Combusting 100% Green Hydrogen

“The resulting oxygen is released into the atmosphere, while the green hydrogen is delivered to reinforced containers for safe storage.”

Why this is important: On January 7, 2026, Duke Energy Florida (DEF) revealed exciting news for those interested in diverse, on-demand and clean electricity generation: the development of a hydrogen production storage system. DEF’s demonstration project is located at its DeBary solar facility in Volusia County, Florida, and is capable of producing, storing, and combusting up to 100 percent green hydrogen. The project design includes two electrolyzer units that separate water into oxygen and hydrogen, then release the oxygen into the atmosphere, leaving behind “green hydrogen” that is safely stored in containers. At times of peak energy demand, the system releases the green hydrogen to the site’s GE Vernova combustion turbine that is fueled by either 100 percent hydrogen or a combination of natural gas and hydrogen. This innovative project will be evaluated by DEF and by clean energy advocates for its ability to offset some of the need for natural gas during times when solar generation is not available. Over time, it is believed that green hydrogen projects such as the one in Volusia County will help offset natural gas demand, which can reduce sometimes volatile fuel costs, as well as provide clean energy production. --- Stephanie U. Eaton

Senate Democrats End Permitting Reform Talks Over Offshore Wind Freeze

“The move comes after the Trump administration ordered work to halt on five offshore wind projects totaling 7 GW.”

Why this is important: Senate Democrats have ended efforts to pass legislation to speed up permitting for energy projects in response to the Trump administration’s halting previously approved permits for offshore wind farms. The Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act, “the SPEED Act,” was designed to revise the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to assess how their actions affect the environment. In recent years, many gas pipelines and other critically needed energy projects have been tied up in endless permit reviews and litigation that not only slowed the construction of major energy infrastructure but also greatly increased costs. The House passed the SPEED Act in December and a bipartisan group of senators was working on getting it through the Senate. But that work stopped following the Trump administration’s decision to pause leases and order work to halt for 90 days for undisclosed national security reasons that affect five offshore wind projects: the 2.6-GW Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, the 2-GW Empire Wind and 924-MW Sunrise Wind off of New York, the 800-MW Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts, and the 700-MW Revolution Wind offshore Rhode Island. Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., the ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, announced that the administration’s permit action on previously approved and fully permitted wind projects stops all work on the SPEED Act. The two thanked West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., and Senator Mike Lee, R-Utah, chairs of the Environment and Public Works and Energy and Natural Resources Committees, for their work on the bill prior to the suspension of the offshore wind project permits. Without legislation, almost all new energy projects will continue to face protracted delays from permitting and litigation once permits are issued. --- Mark E. Heath

As a clean and reliable resource, nuclear energy aligns well with carbon-neutral objectives and the significant load requirements of data centers and other energy-intensive users.

Combined with vocal federal support and access to federal tax incentives established under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) and extended by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), nuclear power is well positioned to play a larger role in the US energy market. Following a series of strong federal policy signals, market confidence in nuclear offtake has increased, with renewed interest in long-term procurement emerging from technology companies scaling data centers.

Headlines have focused on the life extension of existing light-water reactor (LWR) nuclear plants and the commercial advancement of small modular reactors (SMRs). Such projects are often supported by long-term data center offtake agreements or federal guarantees, and economics have been further strengthened by the availability of production tax credits (PTCs) and investment tax credits (ITCs) enacted under the IRA.

In Depth

Existing nuclear plants: Section 45U PTC

To discourage retirement of existing nuclear facilities, the IRA added Section 45U (the zero-emission nuclear power PTC) to the Internal Revenue Code.

Section 45U provides an income tax credit for electricity that is (i) produced at a qualified nuclear power facility and (ii) sold to an unrelated person during the period from December 31, 2023, through January 1, 2033. A “qualified nuclear power facility” is one that was placed in service before enactment of the IRA and uses nuclear energy to generate electricity.

The credit is calculated by:

Multiplying the number of megawatt-hours of electricity produced and sold during the taxable year by 0.3 cents (as adjusted annually for inflation)

Subtracting the applicable “reduction amount”

Multiplying the result by five if prevailing wage requirements are satisfied.

The reduction amount is the lesser of (i) the total credit amount otherwise available or (ii) 16% of the excess (if any) of gross receipts from electricity sales over a benchmark price of 2.5 cents per kilowatt-hour (adjusted for inflation). As a practical matter, no credit is available when the electricity sales price equals or exceeds approximately $43.75 per megawatt-hour.

New nuclear projects: Sections 45Y and 48E

The IRA also introduced Sections 45Y (the clean electricity PTC) and 48E (the clean electricity ITC) for electricity-generation facilities that achieve a zero-greenhouse-gas emissions rate. For facilities to qualify, they must be placed in service after December 31, 2024.

Proposed US Department of the Treasury regulations confirm that facilities using nuclear fission or fusion technologies are eligible for either the PTC under Section 45Y or the ITC under Section 48E (but generally not both). Project owners must elect which credit to claim.

If prevailing wage requirements are satisfied:

The Section 48E ITC equals 30% of a project’s qualified basis.

The Section 45Y PTC equals $15 per megawatt-hour of electricity generated, subject to annual inflation adjustments.

Both credits may be increased through additional “adders” if the facility is located in an energy community and/or meets domestic content requirements.

Importantly, ITCs under Section 48E and PTCs under Sections 45U and 45Y may be transferred for cash to unrelated taxpayers, providing flexibility for developers that cannot fully utilize the credits themselves.

Financing outlook

Public sentiment toward nuclear power has shifted meaningfully in many regions, with increasing recognition of (and enthusiasm for!) its potential to meet growing electricity demand. While significant hurdles remain, particularly development and construction capital intensity, the availability of federal tax credits for existing facilities and new SMR projects materially improves project feasibility.

As the policy landscape continues to evolve, the OBBBA’s enactment in July 2025 stands out as a pivotal moment for the nuclear sector. US Congress ultimately chose not to alter the Section 45U PTCs, a notable decision given earlier legislative drafts that sought to accelerate its repeal. While this inaction may appear uneventful, it is telling: The decision to leave nuclear untouched, even as wind, solar, and hydrogen incentives were substantially pared back, signals a firm and deliberate endorsement of nuclear energy’s long‑term role in the US energy mix. The legislation goes a step further by introducing a new nuclear‑specific energy community bonus for facilities located in metropolitan statistical areas with historical ties to nuclear employment, underscoring policymakers’ intention to support the technology and the communities that have sustained it. Together, these measures position nuclear power to play an increasingly consequential role in US energy’s future.

In the near term, LWR projects benefiting from long operating histories and proven technology are likely to remain the most financeable component of a nuclear resurgence. At the same time, interest from offtakers in advanced reactor technologies, including SMRs, continues to grow.

Any large-scale nuclear development will require innovative financial structures. These projects are likely to involve a combination of common equity, preferred equity, multiple debt tranches, and tax credit monetization, all within a complex regulatory framework that demands careful and sophisticated structuring.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.5223_4824.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 15:59:43.199734

The spending package also includes budget cuts that would eliminate the Department of Energy’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations and defund the Office of Energy Justice and Equity.

At the same time, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin is rolling out his promised “biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history,” aimed at eliminating 31 environmental and public health protections. Just this week, the EPA announced it would stop considering the impact on human health when reviewing power plant pollution emissions.

“The compromise budget for the EPA is a sign that common-sense environmental protections can be a bipartisan issue, but unfortunately it won’t stop the damage being done by Administrator Zeldin’s vicious assault on our environmental and public health laws,” said Anya Fetcher, a Federal Policy Advocate at the Natural Resources Council of Maine. “We’ll continue to stand with the people of Maine in opposing reckless attacks on Maine’s environment that undermine our clean water, thriving forests, and healthy communities.”

Maine’s Congressional delegation played an outsized role in negotiating the compromise spending package. Senator Susan Collins serves as Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Congresswoman Chellie Pingree sits on the House Appropriations Committee, serving as the Ranking Member for the Subcommittee on Interior and the Environment.

“We appreciate the hard work of Senator Collins and Congresswoman Pingree to reach a bipartisan agreement that will fund the basic needs of the EPA and other vital agencies,” said Fetcher.

China will reduce its total tariff on canola seeds, a major Canadian export, from 84% to about 15%, he told reporters.
Carney said China has become a more predictable partner to deal with than the U.S., the country's neighbor and longtime ally.
Canada had been aligned with U.S. on tariffs Canada had followed the U.S. in putting tariffs of 100% on EVs from China and 25% on steel and aluminum under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Carney's predecessor.
Overall, China's imports from Canada fell 10.4% last year to $41.7 billion, according to Chinese trade data.","Breaking with the United States, Canada has agreed to cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Friday.

Carney made the announcement after two days of meetings with Chinese leaders. He said there would be an initial annual cap of 49,000 vehicles on Chinese EV exports to Canada, growing to about 70,000 over five years. China will reduce its total tariff on canola seeds, a major Canadian export, from 84% to about 15%, he told reporters.

Carney said China has become a more predictable partner to deal with than the U.S., the country's neighbor and longtime ally.

""Our relationship has progressed in recent months with China. It is more predictable and you see results coming from that,"" Carney said.

Carney hasn't been able to reach a deal with President Trump to reduce some tariffs that are punishing some key sectors of the Canadian economy and Mr. Trump has previously talked about making Canada the 51st state.

The prime minister, speaking outside against the backdrop of a traditional pavilion and a frozen pond at a Beijing park, said meetings in China have been historic and productive.

Earlier Friday, he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged to improve relations between their two nations after years of acrimony.

Xi told Carney in a meeting at the Great Hall of the People that he is willing to continue working to improve ties, noting that talks have been underway on restoring and restarting cooperation since the two held an initial meeting in October on the sidelines of a regional economic conference in South Korea.

""It can be said that our meeting last year opened a new chapter in turning China-Canada relations toward improvement,"" China's top leader said.

Carney looks to improve global governance

Carney, the first Canadian prime minister to visit China in eight years, told Xi that better relations would help improve a global governance system that he described as ""under great strain.""

Later, he said at the news conference that the system may give way at least in part to country-to-country or regional agreements rather than the global ones that have underpinned economic growth in the post-World War II era.

""The question is: What gets built in that place? How much of a patchwork is it?"" he said.

The new reality reflects in large part the so-called America-first approach of Mr. Trump. The tariffs he has imposed have hit both the Canadian and Chinese economies. Carney, who has met with several leading Chinese companies in Beijing, said ahead of his trip that his government is focused on building an economy less reliant on the U.S. at what he called ""a time of global trade disruption.""

A Canadian business owner in China called Carney's visit game-changing, saying it re-establishes dialogue, respect and a framework between the two nations.

""These three things we didn't have,"" said Jacob Cooke, the CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, which helps exporters navigate the Chinese market. ""The parties were not talking for years.""

Canada had been aligned with U.S. on tariffs

Canada had followed the U.S. in putting tariffs of 100% on EVs from China and 25% on steel and aluminum under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Carney's predecessor.

China responded by imposing duties of 100% on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25% on pork and seafood. It added a 75.8% tariff on canola seeds last August. Collectively, the import taxes effectively closed the Chinese market to Canadian canola, an industry group has said. Overall, China's imports from Canada fell 10.4% last year to $41.7 billion, according to Chinese trade data.

Carney tried to address the concerns of Canadian automakers and autoworkers by saying the initial cap on Chinese EV imports was about 3% of the 1.8 million vehicles sold in Canada annually and that, in exchange, China is expected to begin investing in the Canadian auto industry within three years.

More than half of the Chinese EVs exported to Canada would have an import price of less than 35,000 Canadian dollars ($25,000) within five years, he said, making them accessible to consumers.

""We're building (a) new part of our car industry, building cars of the future in partnership, bringing affordable autos for Canadians at a time when affordability is top of mind, and doing it at a scale that allows for a smooth transition in the sector,"" he said.

""For the exchange of a small piece of the Canadian market, we have a commitment. We are waiting for an investment commitment in Canada. The real leaders of the new industry. So it's an agreement that will create the future for our industry.""

China sees an opening under Trump

China is hoping Mr. Trump's pressure tactics on allies such as Canada will drive them to pursue a foreign policy that is less aligned with the United States.

Carney, though, noted Canada's relationship with the U.S. is much more multifaceted, deeper and broader.

Carney made the announcement after two days of meetings with Chinese leaders. He said there would be an initial annual cap of 49,000 vehicles on Chinese EV exports to Canada, growing to about 70,000 over five years. China will reduce its total tariff on canola seeds, a major Canadian export, from 84% to about 15%, he told reporters.

“It has been a historic and productive two days,” Carney said, speaking outside against the backdrop of a traditional pavilion and a frozen pond at a Beijing park. “We have to understand the differences between Canada and other countries, and focus our efforts to work together where we’re aligned.”

Earlier Friday, he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged to improve relations between their two nations after years of acrimony.

Xi told Carney in a meeting at the Great Hall of the People that he is willing to continue working to improve ties, noting that talks have been underway on restoring and restarting cooperation since the two held an initial meeting in October on the sidelines of a regional economic conference in South Korea.

“It can be said that our meeting last year opened a new chapter in turning China–Canada relations toward improvement,” China's top leader said.

Carney looks to improve global governance

Carney, the first Canadian prime minister to visit China in eight years, told Xi that better relations would help improve a global governance system that he described as “under great strain.”

Later, he said at the news conference that the system may give way at least in part to country-to-country or regional agreements rather than the global ones that have underpinned economic growth in the post-World War II era.

“The question is: What gets built in that place? How much of a patchwork is it?” he said.

The new reality reflects in large part the so-called America-first approach of U.S. President Donald Trump. The tariffs he has imposed have hit both the Canadian and Chinese economies. Carney, who has met with several leading Chinese companies in Beijing, said ahead of his trip that his government is focused on building an economy less reliant on the U.S. at what he called “a time of global trade disruption.”

A Canadian business owner in China called Carney's visit game-changing, saying it re-establishes dialogue, respect and a framework between the two nations.

“These three things we didn’t have,” said Jacob Cooke, the CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, which helps exporters navigate the Chinese market. “The parties were not talking for years.”

Canada had been aligned with US on tariffs

Canada had followed the U.S. in putting tariffs of 100% on EVs from China and 25% on steel and aluminum under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Carney’s predecessor.

China responded by imposing duties of 100% on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25% on pork and seafood. It added a 75.8% tariff on canola seeds last August. Collectively, the import taxes effectively closed the Chinese market to Canadian canola, an industry group has said. Overall, China's imports from Canada fell 10.4% last year to $41.7 billion, according to Chinese trade data.

Carney tried to address the concerns of Canadian automakers and auto workers by saying the initial cap on Chinese EV imports was about 3% of the 1.8 million vehicles sold in Canada annually and that, in exchange, China is expected to begin investing in the Canadian auto industry within three years.

More than half of the Chinese EVs exported to Canada would have an import price of less than 35,000 Canadian dollars ($25,000) within five years, he said, making them accessible to consumers.

“We’re building (a) new part of our car industry, building cars of the future in partnership, bringing affordable autos for Canadians at a time when affordability is top of mind, and doing it at a scale that allows for a smooth transition in the sector,” he said.

China sees an opening under Trump

China is hoping Trump’s pressure tactics on allies such as Canada will drive them to pursue a foreign policy that is less aligned with the United States. The U.S. president has suggested Canada could become America's 51st state.

Carney, though, noted Canada's relationship with the U.S. is much more multifaceted, deeper and broader. Canada and China have different systems and disagree on issues such as human rights, he said, limiting the scope of their engagement even as they seek ways to cooperate on areas of common interest.

The Canadian leader departs China on Saturday and visits Qatar on Sunday before attending the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum in Switzerland next week. He will meet business leaders and investors in Qatar to promote trade and investment, his office said.

The Public News Service Friday afternoon update.

I'm Mike Clifford.

Three quarters of Americans say they oppose the United States attempting to take control of Greenland.

According to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS, CNN reports the poll finds little appetite for border policy of US expansionism, even as Trump extols the military capture of Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro, declaring afterward that the US would run the country, and as he threatens Iran's leadership over their violent crackdown on street protests.

And from Reuters, Canada and China have struck an initial trade deal that will slash tariffs on electric vehicles and canola.

Prime Minister Mark Carney said on Friday, as both nations promise to tear down trade barriers while forging new strategic ties.

Meantime, the White House has outlined a new health care plan, just as Texans and many across the nation are facing steep increases in Affordable Care Act premiums.

What the administration is calling the Great Health Care Plan proposes, among other things, to replace insurance company subsidies with direct payments to consumers, presumably through health savings accounts.

The plan is dependent on legislative action.

Yvette Fontenot, CEO of Health Impact Policy Partners, says Congress is currently focused on other things.

The House has just passed a three-year clean extension of the enhanced premium tax credits that has been sent over to the Senate.

So that's what Congress is focused on getting done.

Some other pieces, while they may be considered by Congress, it is not the healthcare emergency that Congress is currently trying to deal with.

She says the plan doesn't address the immediate problem millions of people who are facing a doubling of their health insurance premiums on the ACA marketplace.

The administration claims its plan would save taxpayers over $36 billion and reduce ACA policy premiums by more than 10 percent.

Brett Peveto reporting.

And a bill to make cars with the electronic door handle safer was part of a hearing this week in the Congress.

Stakeholders spoke before members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee about a slew of auto-related bills including the recently introduced safe exit act which would require all vehicles with electronic door latches to include accessible clearly labeled manual releases that function without vehicle power.

Cooper Lohr with Consumer Reports says investigations have linked electronic door failures to at least 15 deaths.

We've had people die in incidents because they couldn't exit to their vehicle whereas if they were in that same incident and had a vehicle with a old-time door handle, they would have easily been able to get out of the car.

I'm Suzanne Potter.

And in Michigan, the closure of several Planned Parenthood clinics last spring is renewing debate over access to reproductive health care and the impact of federal funding restrictions, especially in rural and northern parts of the state.

Paula Thornton Greer is CEO of Planned Parenthood of Michigan.

It isn't a story about health centers closing.

It's a story about what happens when health care becomes a political target.

The Jackson and Petoskey was driven by federal funding changes.

This story with original reporting by Rebecca Sager with the Michigan Independent.

Next to Indiana where lawmakers are moving forward with a proposal that would greatly limit student cell phone use during the school day.

The Senate Education Committee passed Senate Bill 78 with bipartisan support.

Our Joe Ulori explains.

The bill would prohibit students from using personal cell phones and electronic devices from the start of the school day until dismissal.

Supporters say phones distract students from learning and contribute to academic and mental health concerns.

Committee Chair Jeff Reitz said the bill focuses on keeping distracting devices out of students' reach while school is in session.

What we try to accomplish here is be stored away and inaccessible to a student throughout the school day, which would prevent a student from carrying it.

School-issued laptops and tablets would still be allowed, and the bill includes exceptions for medical needs, language translation, and situations approved by a superintendent.

And Biden-era funding is helping to pay for lead pipe removal in nearly 30 Wisconsin communities.

Officials say the efforts reduce potential health risks and expand access to clean drinking water.

The funding being used by the state's lead service line replacement program largely comes from the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, which dedicated $15 billion to identifying and replacing lead pipes nationwide.

Wisconsin faces a significant lead pipe challenge with more than 260,000 known public and private lead service lines and more than 200,000 that may contain lead.

James Robby with Public Works in Oshkosh says communities like his are already seeing major investments.

It's huge for our community because it helps us as an organization help our property owners get rid of those lead pipes.

Experts say lead exposure can harm brain development in children and increase the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure and kidney or nervous system problems I'm Judith Ruiz Branch reporting.

This story was produced with original reporting from Jonah Balekas for the Wisconsin Independent.

Finally, as the nation prepares to honor the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr., concerns about the growth of artificial intelligence and its impact on communities of color is increasing.

Experts say AI will disproportionately impact black workers through displacement and the environmental burden of data centers, which are more likely to be located in marginalized communities.

Keisha Bross, director of the NAACP Center for Opportunity, Race and Justice, says black workers are overrepresented in entry-level jobs, as well as manufacturing and logistics work.

The best thing that these companies can do is really provide educational tools and resources because we don't want people displaced from the workforce.

We want people to be back in the workforce, but also earning a wage that's livable.

The impact of data centers is more clear.

They've already been linked to health impacts for communities that live near them.

Illinois is a top destination for data centers, estimated to have nearly 200 across the state.

Governor Whitmer Signs Executive Directive to Explore Clean Energy Resources

Executive directive establishes Michigan as a leader in geologic hydrogen, a resource with the potential to create good-paying jobs, attract long-term investments, and lower energy costs for Michiganders

LANSING, Mich. – Today, Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed an executive directive creating an initiative to explore geologic hydrogen as a usable, clean fuel alternative. Michigan’s unique geology makes it one of the most promising regions in the world for geologic hydrogen, a naturally occurring clean energy resource. This new initiative will determine the possibility of tapping into Michigan’s geologic hydrogen and using this natural fuel to build the future of clean energy.

“Michigan is a leader in clean-energy solutions,” said Governor Whitmer. “This initiative will uncover more about Michigan’s geologic hydrogen stores, which have the potential to attract long-term investments in our state and create thousands of good paying jobs for Michiganders. Together, we’re building the future of clean energy in Michigan.”

“Geologic hydrogen represents a transformative opportunity for Michigan, a state historically rich in natural resources and innovation,” said Jim Saber, President and CEO of NextEnergy. “By tapping into this abundant, naturally occurring resource, Michigan can lead the way in sustainable energy, create new jobs, and drive technological advancement. This isn’t just about energy—it’s about securing Michigan’s future as a leader in environmental stewardship and economic resilience, ensuring prosperity for generations to come.”

“It’s not every day we discover new, abundant energy sources — the last one was nuclear power over 80 years ago,” said Ishan Sharma, who directs geologic hydrogen efforts at Renaissance Philanthropy. “It’s even better when the new resource is potentially 90% less expensive than the way we make clean hydrogen today. Michigan’s one of the best places to show the world how geologic hydrogen can lower the costs of goods like steel & fuels, while cutting emissions in those industries decades earlier than anyone thought possible.”

""Michigan has the natural resources and industrial know-how to lead in clean fuels and hydrogen production,” said Jane McCurry, Executive Director of Clean Fuels Michigan. “This Executive Directive takes an important step toward responsibly developing geologic hydrogen, helping position the state to attract private investment, support manufacturing growth, and create high-quality jobs.""

“Governor Whitmer’s directive sends a clear signal that Michigan is serious about leading in geological hydrogen,” said Judd Herzer, Director of Mobility Research and Innovation at Michigan State University. “With the right coordination across state agencies, research institutions, and the private sector geological hydrogen can move rapidly from scientific promise to practical application, supporting hydrogen-powered mobility, clean energy independence, and the advanced manufacturing opportunities that will define Michigan’s next era of innovation.”

Geologic Hydrogen

Geologic hydrogen is a natural energy resource with the potential to serve as a fuel source at a scale and price that is competitive with fossil fuels. This uniquely clean resource can decarbonize some of the highest emission-producing industries, such as heavy-duty transportation, maritime shipping, and manufacturing. Michigan’s high potential for large, natural stores of geologic hydrogen has drawn significant national and international attention. Today’s initiative will build on Michigan’s leadership in clean-energy solutions.

Investments in geologic hydrogen will solidify Michigan’s place at the forefront of the U.S. hydrogen economy, which is projected to reach tens of billions of dollars in new economic activity. Opportunities in clean hydrogen will create new, high-wage jobs for Michiganders, lower industrial production costs, encourage long-term, statewide investments, and keep Michigan competitive in a global marketplace.

Michigan’s Clean Energy Future

Today’s executive directive builds on Governor Whitmer’s commitment to a clean-energy future for Michigan. Since taking office, the Whitmer-Gilchrist Administration has:

Michigan named a leader in clean energy race, ranked 6th nationally for clean energy jobs, #1 state for energy sector job growth, automotive industry and electric vehicle investments.

Signed a historic legislation package to deliver on the MI Healthy Climate Plan and develop a road map for Michigan to reach 100% carbon neutrality by 2050.

Signed a package of bills making Michigan a national leader in clean energy with the adoption of a 100% clean energy standard and more.

Signed bipartisan budgets investing millions in climate-resilient infrastructure, electric school buses, renewable energy for low-income families, and more.

Launched a new office to help Michigan workers take advantage of high-tech, high-paying jobs in automotive and clean energy sectors.

The public comment period for the December 2025 Updated Draft Risk Calculation Memorandum ends on February 2, 2026.
This input will be considered as the agency finalizes its risk evaluation and develops proposed risk management rules.","The Environment Protection Agency (EPA) closed out 2025 with a flurry of actions involving the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), including final risk evaluations for five phthalates and 1,3-butadiene, and an updated risk calculation for formaldehyde to inform a potential revised final risk evaluation in future.

Phthalates: Final Risk Evaluation and Notice of Intent to Regulate

A group of chemicals commonly used to enhance the flexibility and durability of plastics, phthalates are found in a wide array of products from building materials to consumer goods. In recently completed risk evaluations for butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), dicyclohexyl phthalate (DCHP), diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), and diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP), the EPA identified “unreasonable” risks for workers during specific exposures (such as inhalation during spray applications and manufacturing processes) and, for four of the five chemicals, for aquatic life from surface-water releases.

The EPA did not identify unreasonable risks for consumers or for communities in close proximity to releasing facilities. The EPA’s assessment of these phthalates under TSCA does not extend to exposures from food, food additives, food packaging, medical devices, cosmetics, and other consumer products regulated by the Food and Drug Administration or the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

The EPA’s next step is to develop a rule to manage the identified risks. The timeline under the TSCA for issuing a draft rule is one year, with some allowance for extension. The EPA is considering risk mitigation measures such as personal protective equipment, engineering controls, and alternative approaches tailored to the specific uses that present risks.

1,3-Butadiene: Final Risk Evaluation and Notice of Intent to Regulate

Following a court order, the EPA issued a final risk evaluation of and notice of intent to regulate 1,3-butadiene, a colorless gas essential in the manufacture of products such as car tires, adhesives, sealants, paints, coatings, and automotive care products. The EPA concluded there is a potential unreasonable risk to workers inhaling this chemical at work in certain instances. The EPA found no unreasonable health risks to consumers using products with 1,3-butadiene, people living near facilities that use 1,3- butadiene, or the environment.

As with phthalates, it now falls to the EPA to develop risk management regulations for exposures.

Formaldehyde: Updated Draft Risk Calculation Memorandum

The EPA also issued an updated draft risk calculation memorandum for formaldehyde, a chemical widely used across numerous industries. The EPA states that this risk calculation may update the final formaldehyde risk evaluation issued in 2024, which incorporated the chronic non-cancer reference concentration and cancer inhalation unit risk developed by the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) program into its risk assessment for certain exposure scenarios.

Citing consistency with Executive Order 14303 (Restoring Gold Standard Science) and feedback from peer reviewers and scientific advisory committees like the Science Advisory Committee on Chemicals (SACC) and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the EPA’s updated draft risk calculation for formaldehyde shifts away from reliance on IRIS’s chronic non-cancer reference concentration and cancer inhalation unit risk. Instead, the EPA proposes, consistent with the recommendations of SACC and other federal advisory committees, that sensory irritation be used “as the most sensitive endpoint for determining human health effects from inhalation exposures.” Managing those risks, said the EPA, will “be protective against other health effects, including cancer.” Functionally speaking, this change would raise the levels of formaldehyde that workers could be exposed to from the lower chronic non-cancer and cancer exposure levels identified by IRIS to higher levels causing sensory irritation. The revised risk calculation also results in the removal of five conditions of use that no longer indicate unreasonable risk for workers due to inhalation.

The public comment period for the December 2025 Updated Draft Risk Calculation Memorandum ends on February 2, 2026. Comments can be submitted through the official docket (EPA-HQ-OPPT-2018-0438) on regulations.gov. The EPA encourages all interested parties, including industry stakeholders, public health advocates, and members of the public, to review the memorandum and provide feedback. This input will be considered as the agency finalizes its risk evaluation and develops proposed risk management rules. Note that formaldehyde’s use as a pesticide is undergoing a separate review under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), with its own risk assessment process.

Takeaways

Recent EPA actions on phthalates, 1,3-butadiene, and formaldehyde indicate that while the EPA is advancing on high-priority chemical regulation, its approach provides potential opportunities for industries subject to those regulations.

The EPA appears to be moving away from reliance on IRIS, a program that has provoked controversy among industry for its conservative assessment of the human health toxicity of chemicals. The EPA also appears to be amenable to considering evidence indicating that a particular chemical may be considered safe below certain thresholds, while attempting to leave the door open for achievable mitigation measures by businesses at the risk mitigation stage.

Its action on formaldehyde, a chemical for which the EPA recently issued a final risk evaluation as recently as 2024, appears to carry forward the EPA’s desire (as communicated in its proposed rulemaking last year) to be able to revise final risk evaluations without having to reprioritize a chemical. This could shorten the timeframe for the EPA to review prior evaluations and issue updates consistent with current administration policy goals and updated reports from science advisory committees.

Given the multistep nature of chemical evaluations and management under TSCA, we encourage interested stakeholders to follow and consider participating in evaluation and regulatory development at all stages to ensure that points of concern are considered at each stage. Our team is ready to assist you in understanding any recent or upcoming actions under TSCA, submitting comments, or achieving compliance.

Wally’s and Casey’s are among the first IONNA EV charging sites in Illinois. | IONNA

A Wally’s site in Pontiac, Illinois, and two Casey’s stores in McHenry and Vernon Hills are three of five locations where IONNA launched charging stations, or “rechargeries,” across Illinois on Wednesday.

Wally’s has 10 charging bays. While the two locations at Casey’s, an Ankeny, Iowa-based convenience-store chain, have six each, with power provided by ComEd.

Casey’s General Stores Inc. is No. 3 on CSP’s 2025 Top 202 ranking of convenience-store chains by store count.

The launch also includes six charging bays with power provided by ComEd in Hanover Park, Illinois, and 10 charging bays with power provided by energy company Ameren in Gilman, Illinois.

Six additional IONNA charging sites in Springfield, Chicago, North Aurora, St. Charles, Arlington Heights and Des Plaines are either contracted or scheduled to go live, IONNA said.

“Wally’s—the Home of the Great American Road Trip—is proud to partner with IONNA to bring EV charging to Pontiac, strengthening the Midwest travel corridor while delivering the convenience, comfort and reliability our guests expect,” said Michael Rubenstein, St. Louis-based Wally’s co-founder and CEO.

Other convenience-store chains that have partnered with IONNA include Altoona, Pennsylvania-based Sheetz and Wawa, Pennsylvania-based Wawa.

EV growth in Illinois

The State of Illinois has fought to ensure federal resources are delivered as promised, securing the release of critical funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) grants, according to the Office of the Governor.

So far, a total of $148 million has been allocated to the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) to deliver the NEVI program in Illinois. To date, IDOT has awarded $43.8 million in NEVI grants for 62 projects throughout the state, which will facilitate the construction of 349 new charging ports, the governor’s office said.

“Whether you’re headed out on a long-range road trip, taking the kids to school or on the job site, EV ownership should be easy, affordable and reliable,” said Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who attended the ribbon cutting for the Wally’s location. “Here in Illinois, we’ve put shoulder to the wheel to get the EV industry off the ground, and we’ve seen significant investments in our state as a result. Over the next few years, Illinois’ EV ecosystem will continue to grow—creating more quality jobs, building out more charging infrastructure and making EVs an even more accessible and affordable option for our families.”

As federal EV tax credits are no longer available, Illinois continues to operate its own state EV rebate program. Illinois’ EV rebate program—which delivers a check to eligible purchasers—includes $4,000 for low-income Illinoisans, $2,000 for others purchasing an EV and $1,500 for electric motorcycles.

Illinois now has 162,375 battery electric vehicles on the road, and 2025 saw a 32.5% increase in battery electric vehicles, the governor’s office said.

In 2025 alone, the state added 411 new public charging locations, bringing the number of fast-charging ports to approximately 2,300 statewide, according to the governor’s office.

While grants have been instrumental in promoting charging, nearly half of these new charging locations—including IONNA—opened without federal or state grant support, demonstrating strong private-sector confidence in Illinois’ EV market, the governor’s office said.

For all the efforts of the Trump administration to trample on the renewable energy momentum, the hits just keep on coming. Gigantic utility-scale solar plants get most of the attention, of course, but according to the US Energy Information Agency, as of last October, a total of 58.1 gigawatts’ worth of solar panels have been distributed among rooftops, parking lot canopies, and other small-scale locations around the US.

The US Solar Power Footprint Keeps On Growing

In years past, wind energy dominated the growth of renewables in the US, and that pattern is expected to continue in 2026. As capably summarized by Ken Bossong of the Sun Day Campaign,* the EIA anticipates that pattern will continue into 2026. Wind will account for about 11.4% of electricity generation in the US in 2026, with utility-scale solar fairly close behind at 8.1% and hydropower coming in at 6%. Including biomass and geothermal (but excluding small-scale, distributed solar), renewables will account for 26% of US electricity generation in 2026.

By way of comparison, the same mix of renewables (including utility-scale solar but excluding small-scale) accounted for 22.5% of electricity generation in 2026 and is projected to increase to almost 28% in 2027.

This year could also see utility-scale solar’s share of capacity surpassing wind for the first time, as the wind industry encounters significant pushback, particularly in the offshore sector. EIA projects that wind will grow by only 6% in 2026 and 6% in 2027, too.

In contrast, EIA anticipates that utility-scale solar solar capacity additions will increase by 21% in 2026 and another 21% in 2027, for a total of almost 70 gigawatts.

“EIA’s latest STEO confirms the SUN DAY Campaign’s consistent forecast of the past three years: utility-scale solar capacity should surpass that of wind at some point in 2026 (probably sometime mid-year),” Bossening notes.

The wild card is US President Donald Trump’s personal vendetta against offshore wind turbines. On December 22, the Interior Department abruptly halted work on five offshore wind farms totaling 8 gigawatts. However, federal judges have already allowed work to restart on two of the projects, making it more likely that the remaining three will be greenlit as well.

Solar Power Persists

Solar power has been established as the most economical, and quickest, way to add more kilowatts to the nation’s grid. It also provides property owners with a fast, economical way to add more revenue to their holdings, particularly in the case of brownfields and industrial sites where opportunities for other forms of development are limited.

One recent example is the leading US waste management firm WM. Over the years, WM has been installing solar panels and wind turbines on some of its landfills, working with different wind and solar installers on an ad hoc basis. Apparently the company has seen enough to convince them to dive in head first. Last week WM announced a new landfill-to-solar partnership with the Reactivate branch of the A-list energy firm Invenergy. If all goes according to plan, the two partners will convert 50, and possibly more, of WM’s properties to solar power.

Another fresh spark of life in the small scale distributed solar field also emerged earlier this week, when the US firm Aspen Power announced a fresh round of $200 million in funding from Deutsche Bank. “The financing positions Aspen Power to respond quickly to increasing demand for clean energy solutions, enabling expansion of its project pipeline, including community solar, commercial & industrial solar, small utility scale and storage offerings,” Aspen explained in a press statement.

“Solar continues to expand as one of the fastest-growing U.S. energy sectors, driven by declining costs, improving storage options, and strong demand from communities and commercial customers,” the company added.

In the same announcement, the Head of Infrastructure and Energy Financing at Deutsche Bank, Jeremy Eisman, affirmed that money talks. “Deutsche Bank recognizes the growing demand for distributed clean energy and the related need for flexible development capital,” Eisman said.

Deutsche Bank is not the only one. The leading firm Carlyle has also been supporting Aspen’s growth model, and they took note of the demand-side pressure for distributed energy solutions.

“Aspen Power has built a strong, resilient, and well-capitalized platform positioned to meet growing demand for distributed solar and storage nationwide,” said Carlyle Managing director Saurabh Anand.

Irrigation & The Farm-To-Solar Trend

If all goes according to plan, Aspen will deploy the new capital raise to expand beyond its existing footprint in to develop new solar projects nationwide.

In the meantime, another factor supporting the growth of solar power is the de-growth of irrigated farmland. In California, for example, the Westlands Water District has determined that it can’t sustain irrigation for farms in its territory. The agency is considering repurposing the land for roughly 21 gigawatts of solar and storage projects.

If past experience bears out, the stressed land beneath the solar panels will also benefit from the cooler, shadier environment, with the potential for native species restoration and other biodiversity improvements.

To cite one recent example, researchers at the 690-megawatt Gemini solar power plant in Nevada (pictured above) have been monitoring a rare plant in the pea family called threecorner milkvetch. Instead of falling in number as may be expected, milkvetch sightings increased after construction. “The results were striking, with 93 plants found on site in 2024 compared to 12 plants found before construction in 2018,” the researchers reported. The research team also found that plants growing within the solar array outperformed those outside the site on key metrics including width, height, and the number of flowers and fruits.

With that in mind, last fall the farmland conservation organization American Farmland Trust partnered with Reactivate and the Kentucky firm Edelen Renewables to launch a new initiative called Farmers Powering Communities initiative. The idea is to help farmers earn new revenue from solar power, with a focus on deploying solar panels on marginal lands for biodiversity and soil restoration, as well as using rooftops and other infrastructure.

Coal Power Is Kaput

Against this backdrop, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright has taken to issuing legally questionable emergency orders forcing old, outdated coal power plants to keep running. However, lawsuits are beginning to pile up alongside the expense of operating obsolete power plants, while the evidence for economical, affordable solar power is piling up, too.

A new report prepared by the firm Synapse Energy Economics for the organization Coalition for Community Solar Access (CCSA), for example, describes how New York State can reduce electricity bills by adding 20 gigawatts to its distributed solar power profile, along with distributed energy storage.

As if on cue, the EIA posted a new analysis today, January 16, affirming its finding that “utility-scale solar is the fastest-growing source of electricity generation in the United States.”

“Almost 70 gigawatts (GW) of new solar generating capacity projects are scheduled to come online in 2026 and 2027, which represents a 49% increase in U.S. solar operating capacity compared with the end of 2025,” EIA emphasized.

The outlook for coal, on the other hand, is not so good, despite the legally questionable support of Secretary Wright. “With existing policies and scheduled retirements planned by plant operators, we expect that coal plant retirements will lead to U.S. coal-fired generation declining an average of 5% annually over the next two years,” EIA observed. By 2027, that will land coal at just 15% of power generation in the US, down from 17% in 2025 and down 50% from its peak in 2005.

Trump failed to save coal jobs during his first term in office, so it’s no surprise to see him fail this time around, too. For that matter, Trump has been failing at a lot of things, such as failing to win a Nobel Prize, and failing to ensure the timely release of the Epstein files as required by an Act of Congress. If you have any thoughts about that, drop a note in the comment thread.

Better yet, find your representatives in Congress and let them know what you think.

The transaction is expected to provide immediate and significant adjusted free cash flow per share accretion in excess of 15% annually through 2030E. Additionally, these assets are expected to achieve an approximately 85% unlevered free cash flow conversion rate before recognition of any tax benefits.

“When this transaction is complete, Talen will have approximately doubled its expected annual generation output inside of two years, meaningfully diversified our fleet, and materially increased our free cash flow per share,” said Terry Nutt, Talen President. “We are also excited to welcome ECP as a significant Talen shareholder.”

The 1,218-MW Lawrenceburg and 869-MW Waterford facilities have an average heat rate of approximately 7,000 Btu/kWh and capacity factors greater than 80%. The 480-megawatt Darby facility also operates as a peaking unit. Talen argues that the addition of the facilities to its portfolio enhances the company’s ability to offer low-carbon capacity to hyperscale data centers and large commercial off-takers.

The Trump administration and a bipartisan group of governors on Friday asked the country’s largest wholesale electricity market to hold a one-time “emergency” auction to provide data centers with new sources of power.

They urged the PJM Interconnection to hold an auction so data center owners could bid on 15-year power purchase agreements in what would be a stark departure from how the grid operator normally operates. The auction could support $15 billion in new power plants, according to a U.S. Department of Energy fact sheet on the agreement.

The data centers would be required to pay for the new generation built for them, whether they use the power or not, DOE said.

PJM is reviewing the proposal, the grid operator said in a social media post. The grid operator said it will work with its stakeholders to see how the emergency auction proposal aligns with a plan for handling data center interconnections that PJM’s board is set to release today.

PJM was not invited to a White House event Friday to announce the move, according to Jeffrey Shields, a spokesman for the grid operator.

Any emergency auction would need to be approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. At her first open meeting as FERC Chairman in November, Laura Swett said connecting data centers to the grid was her top priority along with ensuring grid reliability at reasonable rates.

Capstone analysts said in a client note after Bloomberg News first reported the initiative Thursday that the statement from the governors and the federal officials lacks binding authority, “reinforcing that this is policy signaling, not an imminent market reform.”

They suggested a six to 12 month timeline before an auction could be held, “at the earliest.”

Why hold a special auction?

The U.S. has seven major grid operators, each with their own structures, covering most of the country.

PJM runs the grid and wholesale power markets in 13 Mid-Atlantic and Midwest states and in the District of Columbia where about 65 million people live.Normally, it ensures that it has enough power supplies to meet its needs through capacity auctions held in advance of when the power is actually needed.

Under that system, power plant owners are paid to be available to produce electricity in the upcoming delivery year — which normally begins about three years after the auction is held. Because it’s a forward market, the auctions are run based on estimates of how much power will be needed.

Parts of the PJMfootprint, such asnorthern Virginia, have seen massive data center development, leading to growing demand for electricity. Some of that demand is based on existing or confirmed load, but much of it is based on projections.

This mismatch between the sudden increase in demand — both real and predicted — and power supply has caused capacity prices to spike in the last three auctions PJM held.

The role of data centers in those price increases has become a focus in the debate over affordability in PJM.

Existing and planned data centers accounted for $23.1 billion, or nearly half, of the $47.2 billion in cost from PJM’s last three capacity auctions, according to a report released earlier this month by the grid operator’s independent market monitor.

Monitoring Analytics, the market monitor, has called for PJM to require data centers to only get electricity from new sources of power so they don’t reduce existing supplies. The market monitor contends that unfettered data center development threatens grid reliability. It has also voiced concern over the speculative and uncertain nature of the load forecasts.

What are they asking for?

PJM’s most recent auction held in December for the 2027-28 delivery year beginning June 1, 2027, saw the same record-high prices as its previous two.

Now, Trump officials and governors want PJM to hold a separate “emergency” auction for data centers.

They also called on PJM to reimpose a price cap and floor on its annual capacity auctions. The temporary mechanism was originally developed through an agreement between PJM and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, D.

In the two auctions the price floor/cap was in effect, it reduced capacity costs by $13.1 billion, according to the market monitor’s estimate. Currently, the mechanism won’t be used in PJM’s capacity auction for the 2028/29 delivery year that is set to be held from June 30 to July 4.

Capstone said any change to PJM’s reliability backstop or capacity procurement framework would require tariff revisions, either proposed by PJM under the Federal Power Act’s Section 205 or initiated by FERC under Section 206.

Proposal supported by IOUs, some environmental advocates

The Edison Electric Institute, a trade group for investor-owned utilities, said it supported the auction initiative, as did some environmental groups.

“We support President Trump and the Governors’ focus on swift changes to help lower energy costs for customers and get more power plants online,” EEI President and CEO Drew Maloney said in a statement. “We look forward to working with FERC and the state commissions to be part of the solution.”

EEI in October urged PJM to support ways to add more generation in its footprint, including through utility-owned power plants and greater procurement flexibility outside the grid operator’s capacity market.

Paul Segal, CEO of LS Power, an independent power producer, said hyperscalers should pay for new capacity they need.

“An emergency auction funded by large loads can be a useful bridge if it’s truly competitive,” he said. “That means no price-cap extensions, real performance requirements (not paper capacity), and a competitive, technology-neutral process that prices grid access upfront and uses pathways suitable for new load.”

The Sierra Club is also backing the plan, saying it will help protect consumers from data center-related costs.

The Trump administration had a tough week in court, starting with a Monday ruling that could pave the way for states and cities to unlock billions of dollars in revoked clean-energy grants.

Back in October, the Trump administration terminated a massive $7.6 billion in federal funding for climate and clean energy projects. There was a clear pattern to the clawback: Nearly every grant would’ve benefitted a state that voted for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

And the White House wasn’t exactly hiding its politically driven motivations. In a post on X announcing the rollback, Russ Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, referred to the revoked grants as ​“Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda.”

St. Paul, Minnesota, was among the cities, states, and organizations that lost funding — $560,844 for expanding EV charging, to be exact. So the city partnered with a handful of environmental groups to fight back in a lawsuit that resulted in a big admission from the Trump administration. In a December filing, Justice Department lawyers said they would not contest the assertion that a state’s votes for Democrats influenced the termination decisions.

U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta called out that assertion in his ruling, writing that ​“defendants freely admit that they made grant-termination decisions primarily — if not exclusively — based on whether the awardee resided in a state whose citizens voted for President Trump in 2024.”

While Mehta ordered the Trump administration to release about $28 million to St. Paul and its fellow plaintiffs, billions of dollars’ worth of other grants remain frozen. But one former U.S. Energy Department official told Latitude Media the win lays a clear path for other awardees to sue: ​“If the administration doesn’t reverse all of the terminations, then they should prepare for hundreds of additional similar lawsuits.”

Three big wins for offshore wind

Offshore wind is beginning to move and groove again after the Trump administration’s December order that the nation’s five in-progress wind farms halt construction.

On Monday, a federal judge allowed Revolution Wind to resume work off the coast of Rhode Island. Equinor won a similar ruling on Thursday to keep building its Empire Wind project near New York. And Friday brought a third victory, with a judge letting Dominion Energy’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind forge ahead. There’s no word yet on whether the two other affected installations can restart construction.

The federal stop-work order has put billions of dollars, thousands of jobs, and gigawatts of much-needed power in jeopardy. Grid operator PJM Interconnection intervened in the Virginia project’s lawsuit late last week, saying its delay would threaten power supplies in the region. Equinor had said it may need to cancel Empire Wind altogether if it couldn’t restart work this week.

Meanwhile, Revolution Wind developer Ørsted said it’s not taking the court win for granted, and will hurry to install its final seven turbines before more setbacks arise.

A disappointing rebound in carbon emissions

After two years of declines, U.S. carbon emissions rose in 2025, according to a new Rhodium Group report. The 2.4% year-over-year increase is the third largest the U.S. has seen in the past decade, and shows that while the country is still heading toward decarbonization, major hurdles stand in its way.

Part of the increase can be chalked up to statistical ​“noise,” including an extra-cold winter that increased buildings’ space-heating needs, Rhodium Group analyst Michael Gaffney told Canary Media’s Julian Spector. But electricity usage also surged, largely thanks to data centers and other large power consumers, and carbon-spewing coal plants ramped up to meet that demand.

“This year is a bit of a warning sign on the power sector,” Gaffney said.​“With growing demand, if we continue meeting it with the dirtiest of the fossil generators that currently exist, that’s going to increase emissions.”

Carney made the announcement after two days of meetings with Chinese leaders. He said there would be an initial annual cap of 49,000 vehicles on Chinese EV exports coming into Canada at a tariff rate of 6.1%, growing to about 70,000 over five years. China will reduce its total tariff on canola seeds, a major Canadian export, from 84% to about 15%, he told reporters.

“Our relationship has progressed in recent months with China. It is more predictable and you see results coming from that,” Carney said.

Carney hasn’t been able to reach a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump to reduce some tariffs that are punishing some key sectors of the Canadian economy and Trump has previously talked about making Canada the 51st state.

Trump commended Carney for making a deal with Beijing.

“Well, it’s OK. That’s what he should be doing and it’s a good thing for him to sign a trade deal. If you can get a deal with China, you should do that,” Trump said.

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer earlier told CNBC Canada’s decision to allow Chinese EV imports at a low tariff is “problematic” and said that Canada may regret that in the long term.

Earlier Friday, Carney and Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged to improve relations between their two nations after years of acrimony.

Xi told Carney in a meeting at the Great Hall of the People that he is willing to continue working to improve ties, noting that talks have been underway on restoring and restarting cooperation since the two held an initial meeting in October on the sidelines of a regional economic conference in South Korea.

Carney said that “this agreement will drive considerable Chinese investment in Canada’s auto sector, creating good careers in Canada and accelerating our progress toward a net zero (emissions) future and the auto industry of the future.’'

Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Toronto, called Friday’s deal good for both China and Canada. “Canada is diversifying its bets economically,” Wiseman said. “And China is succeeding in driving a small wedge between Canada and the U.S.’'

Improve global governance

Carney, the first Canadian prime minister to visit China in eight years, told Xi that better relations would help improve a global governance system that he described as “under great strain.”

Later, he said at the news conference that the system may give way at least in part to country-to-country or regional agreements rather than the global ones that have underpinned economic growth in the post-World War II era.

“The question is: What gets built in that place? How much of a patchwork is it?” he said.

The new reality reflects in large part the so-called America-first approach of Trump. The tariffs he has imposed have hit both the Canadian and Chinese economies. Carney, who has met with several leading Chinese companies in Beijing, said ahead of his trip that his government is focused on building an economy less reliant on the U.S. at what he called “a time of global trade disruption.”

A Canadian business owner in China called Carney’s visit game-changing, saying it reestablishes dialogue, respect and a framework between the two nations.

“These three things we didn’t have,” said Jacob Cooke, the CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, which helps exporters navigate the Chinese market. “The parties were not talking for years.”

Canada had been aligned with US on tariffs

Canada had followed the U.S. in putting tariffs of 100% on EVs from China and 25% on steel and aluminum under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Carney’s predecessor.

China responded by imposing duties of 100% on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25% on pork and seafood. It added a steep tariff on canola seeds last August. Collectively, the import taxes effectively closed the Chinese market to Canadian canola, an industry group has said. Overall, China’s imports from Canada fell 10.4% last year to $41.7 billion, according to Chinese trade data.

Carney tried to address the concerns of Canadian automakers and auto workers by saying the initial cap on Chinese EV imports was about 3% of the 1.8 million vehicles sold in Canada annually and that, in exchange, China is expected to begin investing in the Canadian auto industry within three years.

“We’re building (a) new part of our car industry, building cars of the future in partnership, bringing affordable autos for Canadians at a time when affordability is top of mind, and doing it at a scale that allows for a smooth transition in the sector,” he said.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford, the leader of Canada’s most populous province where the country’s auto sector is based, blasted the deal.

“Make no mistake: China now has a foothold in the Canadian market and will use it to their full advantage at the expense of Canadian workers,” Ford posted on social media.

“Worse, by lowering tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles this lopsided deal risks closing the door on Canadian automakers to the American market, our largest export destination.”

China sees an opening under

Trump

China is hoping Trump’s pressure tactics on allies such as Canada will drive them to pursue a foreign policy that is less aligned with the United States.

Carney, though, noted Canada’s relationship with the U.S. is much more multifaceted, deeper and broader. Canada and China have different systems and disagree on issues such as human rights, he said, limiting the scope of their engagement even as they seek ways to cooperate on areas of common interest.

The Canadian leader leaves China on Saturday and visits Qatar on Sunday before attending the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland next week. He will meet business leaders and investors in Qatar to promote trade and investment, his office said.

Decisions on data centers, water and corporate accountability will determine whether families face higher costs or stronger protections. Michigan Sierra Club will be there to ensure people and communities come before corporate interests.

Below is a snapshot of some (not all) legislative priorities for 2026.

Data Centers

Without clear guardrails, these massive facilities can drive up electric bills, increase fossil fuel use, strain local water supplies and sideline community voices. Michigan needs a people-first framework that requires transparency, protects ratepayers and water resources and ensures data centers bring new clean energy rather than crowding out households and small businesses.

Defending Michigan’s Clean Energy Law

We expect a continued, coordinated effort in 2026 to weaken or roll back the Clean Energy & Jobs Act, the landmark 2023 law modernizing Michigan’s power system, improving reliability and driving clean energy investment statewide. Legislative leaders aligned with monopoly utilities and fossil fuel interests have already signaled their intent to undermine its core protections. We will be working to defend this law and the savings and clean energy jobs it delivers.

Microplastics

Microplastic pollution is contaminating Michigan’s Great Lakes, drinking water and food supply, yet the state still lacks a full picture of where it comes from and . Strong legislation in 2026 can close those gaps, protect public health and position Michigan as a national leader in tackling this growing crisis before it becomes irreversible.

Community Solar

Expanding community solar is key to making clean energy accessible to renters, low-income households and small businesses shut out of rooftop solar. Updated laws can enable shared and community-owned solar projects that lower bills, strengthen local resilience and keep utilities from blocking progress.

Sign up for their newsletter here.

A jury in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, thought it had put the issue to rest.

In April 2025, after an 18-day trial, the group of south Louisianans awarded two coastal parish governments $744.6 million in damages, finding that Chevron had contributed to the decline of the state’s shoreline and wetlands.

In the face of that landmark ruling, Chevron and oil companies facing similar suits fought back.

On Monday, eight of the U.S. Supreme Court’s nine justices heard the companies’ appeal. Lawyers representing Chevron, Texaco and Exxon Mobil argued that the case should be litigated in federal, not state, court. Justice Samuel Alito recused himself from further consideration of the case, though he’d already participated in the court’s decision to address the issue.

Lawyers for Chevron argued that the company should be permitted to remove lawsuits against it from state to federal court because its actions, which stretch back to the World War II era, were at times done at the encouragement and direction of the federal government.

Paul Clement, a seasoned advocate before the nation’s highest court now representing Chevron, told the justices the controversy amounted to a “relatively straightforward case.” Because of the federal government’s outsized involvement in the oil market beginning in the 1940s, he argued, the court should require that suits over oil companies’ related actions should be heard by federal, not state, judges.

Justice Elena Kagan questioned whether the oil company’s suggested legal theory would lead to absurd outcomes, like requiring suits against vertically integrated producers to be heard in federal court while suits against oil refiners, for example, would remain in state courtrooms.

Clement suggested the court ignore the contradiction, calling it “a surface anomaly.”

Ben Aguiñaga, Louisiana’s solicitor general, told justices that Clement’s argument before the court, focused in large part on oil companies’ actions during the World War II era, strayed far from the on-the-ground, contemporary evidence that was presented during the state court trial in Pointe à la Hache.

“They do not dispute that they dumped billions of gallons of produced water from oil wells directly into our marsh,” he said of Chevron’s executives.

Aguiñaga pointed the court to its own decision in Watson, a 2007 case where the body unanimously decided that Phillip Morris, a tobacco company, could not remove lawsuits against it to federal court simply because it operated under the close supervision of government regulators.

The parishes’ successful lawsuit, which alleged Chevron had violated a 1978 Louisiana coastal management law, was rightly heard in state courts, Aguiñaga argued, because that’s where the expertise on the relevant law lies.

“We want the actual experts interpreting state law, especially when we get the Louisiana Supreme Court on an important statute like this, and especially with respect to a problem that is so sweeping in scope,” he said.

Legal experts say the oil companies view the federal courts as a friendlier venue that will be more receptive to their arguments that they are owed some protection from liability because of their role in national security. The court’s decision will determine the venue for a slew of similar cases, including 40 lawsuits by Louisiana officials. It also could have bearing on litigation now underway around the country over oil company liability for the costs of climate change.

While the legal outlines of the Louisiana case don’t seem to fall along traditional political lines, the court’s liberal justices appeared more skeptical of the oil companies’ insistence that the cases be moved to federal courts during Monday’s arguments.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that the companies’ suggested scope of when a case should be forced into a federal courtroom was too broad.

“They way you’re defining this, but for a nail, something could fall apart,” Sotomayor said.

But Clement told justices that federal law is broad in its categorization of cases that can be removed from state courts.

“If we are going to get into a big debate about exactly what happened in World War II, boy, I think that should take place in federal court,” he said.

The case puts lawyers for Republican-led Louisiana up against both Chevron and the Trump administration, which filed a brief in the case and delivered arguments at Monday’s hearing supporting the removal of the case to federal court.

The implications of the court’s decision could be significant, with both the $744 million judgement and future precedent at stake.

Whatever the court’s decision, Louisiana’s loss of coastline is likely to continue. The state has lost more than 2,000 square miles of land in the last century, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, though Chevron maintains it has not caused the state’s coastal woes.

An environmental impact like that shouldn’t be ignored, Aguiñaga said. “That’s why this is such a massive deal for the state of Louisiana.”

AVON LAKE, Ohio, Jan 16 (Reuters) – U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the Canadian government’s decision to allow in up to 49,000 Chinese ‍electric vehicles at a low tariff rate is “problematic” and that Canada may come to regret the decision.

“I think it’s problematic for Canada,” Greer told CNBC on Friday.

Greer said Canada was seeking agriculture tariff relief as part of the EV agreement. “I think in the long run, they’re not going ​to like having made that deal.”

Greer said rules adopted in January 2025 on vehicles that are connected ‍to the internet and navigation systems ​are a significant impediment to Chinese vehicles ​in the U.S. market.

“I think it would be hard for ‍them to operate here,” Greer said. “There are rules and regulations in place in America about the cybersecurity of our vehicles and the systems that go into those, so I think it might be hard for the ‍Chinese to comply with those kind of rules.”

President Donald Trump, as well as a group of governors from northeastern states, are expected to ask PJM Interconnection to host an emergency energy auction, Bloomberg first reported. There, tech companies will be able to bid on 15-year contracts for electricity generation from newly-constructed power plants. The proposal is an unprecedented attempt to reign in skyrocketing power costs stemming from massive data center buildouts and booming artificial intelligence demand.

Per the plan, tech companies will only be able to hook up to the grid if they pay their share.

The electricity auctions typically only cover one-year time frames.

Meanwhile, PJM is home to the largest concentration of data centers in the country. Its power market spans 13 states from New Jersey to Kentucky.

PJM during its auction last month failed to match supply with demand. The company forecasts demand will continue to increase through 2027/2028, and attributes most of the growth to data center demand.

""This auction leaves no doubt that data centers' demand for electricity continues to far outstrip new supply,"" Stu Bresler, chief operating officer for PJM Interconnection said following its December energy auction. ""The solution will require concerted action involving PJM, its stakeholders, state and federal partners, and the data center industry itself.""

The Senate on Thursday approved an $8.8 billion budget for the U.S. EPA through the end of the fiscal year in September. The approval is part of a three-bill funding package that also approves certain science spending and budgets for the departments of Justice, Interior, Commerce and Energy.

The bill, which now heads to President Donald Trump for signature, includes funding for key programs such as Superfund, but 47% less than the previous year’s budget. It also provides funding for various research projects involving PFAS, landfill methane, eRINs and numerous water quality and safety programs.

The funding amount is about 4% less than last year’s budget of about $9 billion, but both environmental groups and lawmakers said the cuts were less dire than the White House had previously signaled. The president’s original budget proposal for the agency was around $4.16 billion.

Dive Insight:

The draft budget package approved by the House and Senate offers far more funding than previously expected, including for scientific research efforts. The Trump administration had previously called for major cuts across multiple agencies — including the National Science Foundation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The bill heading to Trump’s desk reverses some of those efforts to slash funding.

The Environmental Protection Network said the draft budget is a sign of a “bipartisan effort” to maintain key funding for environmental health and safety programs. Yet the group said in a statement that the EPA’s budget “remains historically low when adjusted for inflation, continuing a decade-long erosion of the agency’s capacity as its responsibilities have grown.”

Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., who led the House’s passage of the bill last week, characterized the budget as cutting unnecessary spending while maintaining funding for critical initiatives such as “ the stewardship of America’s resources.”

The bulk of the proposed EPA budget aims to continue operation of its key programs, such as CERCLA enforcement operations, water quality and infrastructure work, grantmaking and other day-to-day operations. It calls for $282.7 million for CERCLA, known as the Superfund program, which is a major decrease from the fiscal year 2025 budget and the same amount proposed in Trump’s proposed budget from last summer. The administration has previously said that 47% reduction reflects an overall need for “efficiencies and operational improvements” within the agency.

The budget also calls for about $27 million toward research projects. An explanatory document included with the draft budget outlined some of the types of research it expects EPA to continue in 2026, including continued landfill emissions research. It also proposes giving the agency 90 days to deliver a report on its approach to eRINS within the Renewable Fuel Standards program. The document also directs EPAto report whether it plans to include fuel derived from plastic waste or tires in the Renewable Fuel Standard and gives a 30-day deadline for the agency to do so. It also mentions programs like the Science To Achieve Results grant program, a competitive grant and graduate fellowship program, which was paused last year but now appears to be funded in the draft budget.

The document also proposes dedicating $9 million for work to help farmers, ranchers and rural communities “manage PFAS in agricultural settings” as well as drinking water-related grants for well owners to mitigate PFAS.

While not specifically mentioned in the budget, the EPA is still working on various aspects of PFAS research and rule development, some of which could have implications for waste and recycling industry operations in coming years, according to those familiar with the agency’s day-to-day work say

The draft budget also stipulates the agency could hire up to 100 people a year to “maintain staffing levels in order to fulfill the mission and statutory obligations of the agency.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/2NaNHQq4P_0rfrWwTNMScS6Sxngs0vE2mnG-ywXO9_E/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9UMllUNDQuanBn.webp,N,,2026-01-16 13:00:48.189772

Yet over the past three years, its stock surged 655% as the S&P 500 rose 74%. If we include its reinvested dividends, it delivered a total return of 690%. Let's see why Vistra's stock crushed the market, and if it can head even higher over the next year.

What does Vistra do?

Vistra provides power generation and retail electricity services. Its diverse portfolio of natural gas, nuclear, coal, solar, and battery energy storage facilities has a combined capacity of approximately 44,000 megawatts -- which is enough to power about 22 million homes.

The company owns the country's second-largest fleet of nuclear power plants, and it's repurposing retired coal plants to generate and store solar energy. It aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 by expanding its nuclear and solar facilities.

Vistra's retail energy business -- which owns TXU Energy, Dynegy, Homefield Energy, Ambit, and other brands -- sells electricity to roughly five million residential, commercial, and industrial customers. It operates across all of the country's wholesale markets and offers more than 50 renewable energy plans as part of its long-term strategy for achieving net-zero emissions.

How fast is Vistra growing?

From 2020 to 2024, Vistra's revenue and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) both grew at a CAGR of 11%. The market's soaring demand for electricity -- especially from the power-hungry cloud infrastructure, high-performance computing (HPC), and artificial intelligence (AI) markets -- fueled its organic growth.

To support that demand, Vistra expanded its nuclear fleet by acquiring Energy Harbor in 2024, acquired seven natural gas plants from Lotus Infrastructure Partners for $1.9 billion in October 2025, and recently agreed to acquire Cogentrix Energy's ten natural gas plants for $4.7 billion.

This January, Vistra signed a deal to provide Meta Platforms (META +0.98%) with thousands of megawatts of nuclear energy over the next 20 years. Other tech companies will likely follow Meta's lead and sign additional long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with the company to support their expanding cloud, AI, and data center businesses.

As Vistra expanded, it bought back 11% of its shares over the past three years. It recently authorized another $1 billion buyback plan, equivalent to 1.6% of its current market capitalization of $61 billion, which will last through 2027. Its forward dividend yield of 0.5% won't attract any serious income investors, but its low trailing payout ratio of 32% gives it plenty of room for future hikes. It has already raised its dividend for six consecutive years.

What are Vistra's near-term catalysts?

From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect Vistra's revenue and adjusted EBITDA to both grow at a CAGR of about 13%. The nuclear market's secular growth, its acquisition of Cogentrix's natural gas plants, and its massive deal with Meta should drive that acceleration. It will also likely continue to acquire more nuclear, natural gas, and solar companies to increase its capacity.

Vistra's commitment to expanding its low-carbon and renewable energy businesses also makes it eligible to earn government subsidies and incentives. In the near term, it will likely benefit from the Nuclear Production Tax Credit (PTC), created under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, and from federal nuclear support policies. Companies that are incentivized to use more clean energy could also sign more long-term PPAs with Vistra.

Where will Vistra's stock be in a year?

With an enterprise value of $78 billion, Vistra's stock still looks reasonably valued at 11 times this year's adjusted EBITDA. If it matches analysts' estimates and maintains the same forward EV/EBITDA ratio, its stock could rise about 13% over the next year.

That gain might seem modest, but it could stay ahead of the S&P 500 -- which has delivered an average annual return of around 10% since its inception. It could deliver even bigger gains if it acquires more companies or secures larger deals with top cloud and AI companies. Therefore, Vistra still looks like a safe place to park your cash for market-beating gains this year.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F851648%2Fgettyimages-1699619381.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-16 14:00:41.397616

“From a water perspective, we use about 1/1000th the water to produce the same amount of nitrogen,” Abbott said.
From an emissions perspective, replacing a ton of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer with Pivot Bio’s product prevents the equivalent of around 11 tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere.
Many countries don’t publish emissions and economic data, and those that do use a variety of methods to report it.
“Using spending data to estimate supply chain emissions provides only a first-order approximation at best!”","Studies estimate that fertilizer production and use alone account for roughly 5% of global emissions. That includes emissions from the energy-intensive Haber–Bosch process, which synthesizes ammonia by combining nitrogen from the air with hydrogen at extremely high temperatures, as well as nitrous oxide released from the soil after fertilizer is applied. N2O is about 265 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a 100-year timeframe and accounts for roughly 70% of fertilizer-related emissions, as soil microbes convert excess nitrogen that crops can’t immediately absorb into nitrous oxide.

“If we don’t solve nitrous oxide, it on its own is enough of a radiative force that we can’t meet all of our goals,” Rinzler said, referring to global climate targets at large.

Enter what some consider one of the most promising agricultural innovations, perhaps since the invention of the Haber–Bosch process itself over a century ago — Pivot Bio. This startup, founded 15 years ago, engineers soil microbes to convert about 400 times more atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia than non-engineered microbe strains naturally would. “They are mini Haber–Bosch facilities, for all intents and purposes,” Pivot Bio’s CEO Chris Abbott told me, referring to the engineered microbes themselves.

The startup has now raised over $600 million in total funding and is valued at over $2 billion. And after toiling in the ag tech trenches for a decade and a half, this will be the first full year the company’s biological fertilizers — which are applied to either the soil or seed itself — will undercut the price of traditional fertilizers.

“Farmers pay 20% to 25% less for nitrogen from our product than they do for synthetic nitrogen,” Abbott told me. “Prices [for traditional fertilizers] are going up again this spring, like they did last year. So that gap is actually widening, not shrinking.”

Peer reviewed studies also show that Pivot’s treatments boost yields for corn — its flagship crop — while preliminary data indicates that the same is true forcotton, which Pivot expanded into last year. The company also makes fertilizers for wheat, sorghum, and other small grains.

Pivot is now selling these products in stores where farmers already pick up seeds and crop treatments, rather than solely through its independent network of sales representatives, making the microbes more likely to become the default option for growers. But they won’t completely replace traditional fertilizer anytime soon, as Pivot’s treatments can still meet only about 20% to 25% of a large-scale crop’s nitrogen demand, especially during the early stages of plant growth, though it’s developing products that could push that number to 50% or higher, Abbott told me.

All this could have an astronomical environmental impact if deployed successfully at scale. “From a water perspective, we use about 1/1000th the water to produce the same amount of nitrogen,” Abbott said. From an emissions perspective, replacing a ton of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer with Pivot Bio’s product prevents the equivalent of around 11 tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. Given the quantity of Pivot’s fertilizer that has been deployed since 2022, Abbott estimates that scales to approximately 1.5 million tons of cumulative avoided CO2 equivalent.

“It’s one of the very few cases that I’ve ever come across in climate tech where you have this giant existing commodity market that’s worth more than $100 billion and you’ve found a solution that offers a cheaper product that is also higher value,” Rinzler told me. BEV led the company’s Series B round back in 2018, and has participated in its two subsequent rounds as well.

Meanwhile, Nitricity — a startup spun out of Stanford University in 2018 — is also aiming to circumvent the Haber–Bosch process and replace ammonia-based and organic animal-based fertilizers such as manure with a plant-based mixture made from air, water, almond shells, and renewable energy. The company said that its proprietary process converts nitrogen and other essential nutrients derived from combusted almond shells into nitrate — the form of nitrogen that plants can absorb. It then “brews” that into an organic liquid fertilizer that Nitricity’s CEO, Nico Pinkowski, describes as looking like a “rich rooibos tea,” capable of being applied to crops through standard irrigation systems.

For confidentiality reasons, the company was unable to provide more precise technical details regarding how it sources and converts sufficient nitrogen into a usable form via only air, water, and almond shells, given that shells don’t contain much nitrogen, and turning atmospheric nitrogen into a plant-ready form typically involves the dreaded Haber–Bosch process.

But investors have bought in, and the company is currently in the midst of construction on its first commercial-scale fertilizer factory in Central California, which is expected to begin production this year. Funding for the first-of-a-kind plant came from Trellis Climate and Elemental Impact, both of which direct philanthropic capital toward early-stage, capital-intensive climate projects. The facility will operate on 100% renewable power through a utility-run program that allows customers to opt into renewable-only electricity by purchasing renewable energy certificates,

Pinkowski told me the new plant will represent a 100‑fold increase in Nitricity’s production capacity, which currently sits at 80 tons per year from its pilot plant. “In comparison to premium conventional fertilizers, we see about a 10x reduction in emissions,” Pinkowski told me, factoring in greenhouse gases from both production and on-field use. “In comparison to the most standard organic fertilizers, we see about a 5x reduction in emissions.”

The company says trial data indicates that its fertilizer allows for more efficient nitrogen uptake, thus lowering nitrous oxide emissions and allowing farmers to cut costs by simply applying less product. According to Pinkowski, Nitricity’s current prices are at parity or slightly lower than most liquid organic fertilizers on the market. And that has farmers really excited — the new plant’s entire output is already sold through 2028.

“Being able to mitigate emissions certainly helps, but it’s not what closes the deal,” he told me. “It’s kind of like the icing on the cake.”

Initially, the startup is targeting the premium organic and sustainable agriculture market, setting it apart from Pivot Bio’s focus on large commodity staple crops. “You saw with the electrification of vehicles, there was a high value beachhead product, which was a sports car,” Pinkowski told me. “In the ag space, that opportunity is organics.”

But while big-name backers have lined up behind Pivot and Nitricity, the broader ag tech sector hasn’t been as fortunate in its friends, with funding and successful scale-up slowing for many companies working in areas such as automation, indoor farming, agricultural methane mitigation, and lab-grown meat.

Everyone’s got their theories for why this could be, with Lara Pierpoint of Trellis telling me that part of the issue is “the way the federal government is structured around this work.” The Department of Agriculture allocates relatively few resources to technological innovation compared to the Department of Energy, which in turn does little to support agricultural work outside of its energy-specific mandate. That ends up meaning that, as Pierpoint put it, ”this set of activities sort of falls through the cracks” of the government funding options, leaving agricultural communities and companies alike struggling to find federal programs and grant opportunities.

“There’s also a mismatch between farmers and the culture of farming and agriculture in the United States, and just even geographically where the innovation ecosystems are,” Emily Lewis O’Brien, a principal at Trellis who led the team’s investment in Nitricity, told me of the social and regional divides between entrepreneurs, tech investors and rural growers. “Bridging that gap has been a little bit tricky.”

Still, investors remain optimistic that one big win will help kick the money machines into motion, and with Pivot Bio and Nitricity, there are finally some real contenders poised to transform the sector. “We’re going to wake up one day and someone’s going to go, holy shit, that was fast,” Abbott told me. “And it’s like, well you should have been here for the decade of hard work before. It’s always fast at the end.”

“We find very large differences in not only the magnitude of the upstream carbon footprint for a given business, but the hot spots, like where there are more or less emissions happening, and thus where a company would want to gather better data and focus on reducing,” said Steven Davis, a professor of Earth system science in the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and lead author of the paper.

Several of the authors of the paper, including Davis, are affiliated with the software startup Watershed, which helps companies measure and reduce their emissions. Watershed already encourages its clients to use its own proprietary multi-region model, but the company is now working with Stanford and the consulting firm ERG to build a new and improved tool called Cornerstone that will be freely available for anyone to use.

“Our hope is that with the release of scientific papers like this one and with the launch of Cornerstone, we can help the ecosystem transition to higher quality open access datasets,” Yohanna Maldonado, Watershed’s Head of Climate Data told me in an email.

The study arrives as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a nonprofit that publishes carbon accounting standards that most companies voluntarily abide by, is in the process of revising its guidance for calculating “scope 3” emissions. Scope 3 encompasses the carbon that a company is indirectly responsible for, such as from its supply chain and from the use of its products by customers. Watershed is advocating that the new standard recommend companies use a multi-region modeling approach, whether Watershed’s or someone else’s.

Davis walked me through a hypothetical example to illustrate how these models work in practice. Imagine a company that manufactures exercise bikes — it assembles the final product in a factory in the U.S., but sources screws and other components from China. The typical way this company would estimate the carbon footprint of its supply chain would be to use a dataset published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that estimates the average emissions per dollar of output for about 400 sectors of the U.S. economy. The EPA data doesn’t get down to the level of detail of a specific screw, but it does provide an estimate of emissions per dollar of output for, say, hardware manufacturing. The company would then multiply the amount of money it spent on screws by that emissions factor.

Companies take this approach because real measurements of supply chain emissions are rare. It’s not yet common practice for suppliers to provide this information, and supply chains are so complex that a product might pass through several different hands before reaching the company trying to do the calculation. There are emerging efforts to use remote sensing and other digital data collection and monitoring systems to create more accurate, granular datasets, Alexia Kelly, a veteran corporate sustainability executive and current director at the High Tide Foundation, told me. In the meantime, even though sector-level emissions estimates are rough approximations, they can at least give a company an indication of which parts of their supply chain are most problematic.

When those estimates don’t take into account country of origin, however, they don’t give companies an accurate picture of which parts of their supply chains need the most attention.

The new study used Watershed’s multi-region model to look at how different types of companies’ emissions would change if they used supply chain data that better reflected the global nature of supply chains. Davis is the first to admit that the study’s findings of higher emissions are not surprising. The carbon accounting field has long been aware of the shortcomings of single-region models. There hasn’t been a big push to change that, however, because the exercise is already voluntary and taking into account global supply chains is significantly more difficult. Many countries don’t publish emissions and economic data, and those that do use a variety of methods to report it. Reconciling those differences adds to the challenge.

While the overall conclusion isn’t surprising, the study may be the first to show the magnitude of the problem and illustrate how more accurate modeling could redirect corporate sustainability efforts. “As far as I know, there is no similar analysis like this focused on corporate value chain emissions,” Derik Broekhoff, a senior scientist at the Stockholm Environment Institute, told me in an email. “The research is an important reminder for companies (and standard setters like the Greenhouse Gas Protocol), who in practice appear to be overlooking foreign supply chain emissions in large numbers.”

Broekhoff said Watershed’s upcoming open-source model “could provide a really useful solution.” At the same time, he said, it’s worth noting that this whole approach of calculating emissions based on dollars spent is subject to significant uncertainty. “Using spending data to estimate supply chain emissions provides only a first-order approximation at best!”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjcxMjU2NS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5MjU4OTEwMX0.8dOiw0_l3egMRKD6uBoxAEAW2qAelLbLfb07W1eFJp0/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2026-01-16 14:00:26.138652

At the Detroit Economic Club, President Trump doubled down on his protectionist trade strategy, declaring “tariff” his favorite word and touting the 25% tariff imposed on foreign automobiles. He credited these measures, along with the threat of further tariffs, for spurring new investments from automakers like Ford and General Motors. The President argued that this aggressive stance has successfully reduced the trade deficit and forced foreign companies to utilize American labor.

In contrast, Gov. Whitmer used her Auto Show keynote to warn against an isolationist approach, particularly regarding North American allies. While acknowledging that tariffs have their place, she cautioned that a “go-it-alone” strategy could backfire, ultimately benefiting global competitors like China. Whitmer emphasized the critical importance of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which is up for renewal this summer, noting that collaboration is a strength, not a weakness, for a supply chain where no vehicle is made with 100% U.S. parts.

Related | MichAuto Advocates for Extension of Critical Trade Agreement, USMCA

The leaders also offered distinct views on how to power the industry’s future. Trump highlighted his administration’s move to “terminate the insane electric vehicle mandate” and end the “war on internal combustion engines,” framing these regulatory rollbacks as essential for consumer choice and industry health. He also touted a new tax policy, making interest on car loans fully tax-deductible for U.S.-made vehicles.

Whitmer, conversely, focused on securing Michigan’s leadership in next-generation technologies. She announced a new executive directive to explore geologic hydrogen as a clean energy source, positioning it as a potential economic driver. Her address underscored the need to double down on innovation and collaboration, citing state investments in R&D and the release of a new economic transition strategy to help suppliers pivot to emerging sectors like aerospace and defense.

For the Region, 2026 presents a landscape of both opportunity and volatility. The Trump administration’s focus on deregulation and domestic production incentives offers potential cost relief, while the state’s emphasis on R&D and talent development aims to secure long-term competitiveness. However, the looming renegotiation of the USMCA and the continued use of aggressive tariffs introduce a degree of uncertainty for supply chains. As the industry navigates these shifting currents, the Region’s ability to adapt by leveraging both federal incentives and state-level innovation will be paramount.",https://www.detroitchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Detroit-Auto-Show-2026-feature.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 15:00:50.286435

Collectively, the import taxes effectively closed the Chinese market to Canadian canola, an industry group has said.","BEIJING (AP) — Breaking with the United States, Canada has agreed to cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Friday.

Carney made the announcement after two days of meetings with Chinese leaders. He said there would be an initial annual cap of 49,000 vehicles on Chinese EV exports to Canada, growing to about 70,000 over five years. China will reduce its total tariff on canola seeds, a major Canadian export, from 84% to about 15%, he told reporters.

Carney said China has become a more predictable partner to deal with than the U.S, the country’s neighbor and longtime ally.

“Our relationship has progressed in recent months with China. It is more predictable and you see results coming from that,” Carney said.

Carney hasn’t been able to reach a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump to reduce some tariffs that are punishing some key sectors of the Canadian economy and Trump has previously talked about making Canada the 51st state.

The prime minister, speaking outside against the backdrop of a traditional pavilion and a frozen pond at a Beijing park, said meetings in China have been historic and productive.

Earlier Friday, he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged to improve relations between their two nations after years of acrimony.

Xi told Carney in a meeting at the Great Hall of the People that he is willing to continue working to improve ties, noting that talks have been underway on restoring and restarting cooperation since the two held an initial meeting in October on the sidelines of a regional economic conference in South Korea.

“It can be said that our meeting last year opened a new chapter in turning China–Canada relations toward improvement,” China’s top leader said.

Carney looks to improve global governance

Carney, the first Canadian prime minister to visit China in eight years, told Xi that better relations would help improve a global governance system that he described as “under great strain.”

Later, he said at the news conference that the system may give way at least in part to country-to-country or regional agreements rather than the global ones that have underpinned economic growth in the post-World War II era.

“The question is: What gets built in that place? How much of a patchwork is it?” he said.

The new reality reflects in large part the so-called America-first approach of Trump. The tariffs he has imposed have hit both the Canadian and Chinese economies. Carney, who has met with several leading Chinese companies in Beijing, said ahead of his trip that his government is focused on building an economy less reliant on the U.S. at what he called “a time of global trade disruption.”

A Canadian business owner in China called Carney’s visit game-changing, saying it re-establishes dialogue, respect and a framework between the two nations.

“These three things we didn’t have,” said Jacob Cooke, the CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, which helps exporters navigate the Chinese market. “The parties were not talking for years.”

Canada had been aligned with US on tariffs

Canada had followed the U.S. in putting tariffs of 100% on EVs from China and 25% on steel and aluminum under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Carney’s predecessor.

China responded by imposing duties of 100% on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25% on pork and seafood. It added a 75.8% tariff on canola seeds last August. Collectively, the import taxes effectively closed the Chinese market to Canadian canola, an industry group has said. Overall, China’s imports from Canada fell 10.4% last year to $41.7 billion, according to Chinese trade data.

Carney tried to address the concerns of Canadian automakers and auto workers by saying the initial cap on Chinese EV imports was about 3% of the 1.8 million vehicles sold in Canada annually and that, in exchange, China is expected to begin investing in the Canadian auto industry within three years.

More than half of the Chinese EVs exported to Canada would have an import price of less than 35,000 Canadian dollars ($25,000) within five years, he said, making them accessible to consumers.

“We’re building (a) new part of our car industry, building cars of the future in partnership, bringing affordable autos for Canadians at a time when affordability is top of mind, and doing it at a scale that allows for a smooth transition in the sector,” he said.

“For the exchange of a small piece of the Canadian market, we have a commitment. We are waiting for an investment commitment in Canada. The real leaders of the new industry. So it’s an agreement that will create the future for our industry.”

China sees an opening under

Trump

China is hoping Trump’s pressure tactics on allies such as Canada will drive them to pursue a foreign policy that is less aligned with the United States. The U.S. president has suggested Canada could become America’s 51st state.

Carney, though, noted Canada’s relationship with the U.S. is much more multifaceted, deeper and broader. Canada and China have different systems and disagree on issues such as human rights, he said, limiting the scope of their engagement even as they seek ways to cooperate on areas of common interest.

The Canadian leader leaves China on Saturday and visits Qatar on Sunday before attending the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum in Switzerland next week. He will meet business leaders and investors in Qatar to promote trade and investment, his office said.

The United States Senate should restore the $125 million cut from the effort to replace lead service lines responsible for contaminating drinking water across the country by slashing funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth (@senduckworth) told WTTW News on Thursday.

A spending package approved by the U.S. House of Representatives that included funding for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency clawed back an unspent portion of the $15 billion set aside in November 2021 to remove the lines that can pollute drinking and bathing water, outraging Duckworth, who helped lead the push to rebuild the nation’s water systems. The Senate will now take up the measure.

“We need fix this problem as soon as possible, so that children are no longer drinking poison water, women who are pregnant are not drinking poison water, and so you and I are not drinking poison water,” said Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois. “All I’m doing is trying to bring back something that a bipartisan group of senators had agreed to.”

There is no safe level of lead in drinking water, according to federal officials. Lead is a neurotoxin and can be especially damaging to children and pregnant women.

For the Trump administration to take funds set aside to ensure Americans have access to clean drinking water to “to use this money for ICE so they can come in and intimidate people in Chicago and other places is obscene, as far as I am concerned,” Duckworth said.

The spending plan signed by President Donald Trump set aside $30 billion for ICE during the fiscal year that began in October, records show. Congress should cut the agency’s “exorbitant $2 billion slush fund,” Duckworth said.

An additional $635 million from ICE’s budget should be used to fund programs designed to reduce methane gas in the environment and reduce pollution from abandoned coal mines, Duckworth said.

“No family should ever wonder if they can afford to keep their home warm during the winter months,” said Congressman Pappas.
Under Pappas’s legislation a family in New Hampshire that makes $50,000 and pays the average cost of energy in New Hampshire, about $2,676 per year ($223 a month), would receive a refundable credit of $882, effectively reducing their energy costs by a third.

His bipartisan Energy Burden Tax Credit Act, introduced with Congressman Mike Lawler (NY-17) would provide a refundable tax credit to families struggling with high energy costs, saving households hundreds of dollars a year on energy.

“No family should ever wonder if they can afford to keep their home warm during the winter months,” said Congressman Pappas. “I’ve heard from a constituent in Dover who told me that her December electric bill was the highest she has ever received, a household in Ossipee whose bill increased by over a hundred dollars last month, and a family on the Seacoast who spend nearly as much on energy as they do on their mortgage each month. That’s why I’m introducing several bipartisan bills today that create a new energy tax credit to put money back in people’s pockets, help military families weatherize their homes, and improve energy transmission so that we can bring down energy costs at the source.”

New Hampshire has some of the highest energy costs in the nation and for lower and middle income families, including the 25% of New Hampshire households that earn less than $50,000 each year, energy costs pose a significant burden. Pappas’s bill provides individuals and households who spend more than 3% of their income on energy with a refundable tax credit equal to 75% of the excess amount they spend on energy.

Under Pappas’s legislation a family in New Hampshire that makes $50,000 and pays the average cost of energy in New Hampshire, about $2,676 per year ($223 a month), would receive a refundable credit of $882, effectively reducing their energy costs by a third.

Pappas is also introducing the following new legislation today:

His bipartisan Transmission Facilitation Program Reauthorization Act, which would restore DOE’s program providing states and municipalities with federal support for projects developing new transmission lines or upgrading existing transmission lines, helping accelerate project timelines and increase grid capacity.

His Heroes Home Energy Savings Act, which would reauthorize and increase funding for the Weatherization Assistance Program Enhancement and Innovation Grant to spur innovation in weatherization and provide active duty and reserve military families with grants to help lower their energy costs.

Pappas is a fierce advocate for efforts that lower energy costs for Granite Staters and programs that help low-income families pay their bills, and has repeatedly called on both Democratic and Republican administrations to stop the export of oil to foreign adversaries and protect and strengthen the LIHEAP program, including successfully pressing the Department of Health and Human Services to take all necessary steps to ensure that the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funds were distributed to the states by November 30, 2025. He has also previously introduced, cosponsored, or called for the passage of the following legislation:

Pappas leads the bipartisan Bolstering Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve Act(link is external), which would require the Department of Energy (DOE) to conduct a long-range strategic review of the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve (NEHHOR) and report to Congress on opportunities to strengthen it.

He supports the bipartisanBanning Oil Exports to Foreign Adversaries Act(link is external), which would prohibit the sale or export of our nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR) to foreign adversaries including China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, closing a dangerous loophole that threatens U.S. energy and national security

He supports the Energy Independence and Affordability Act(link is external), which would reinstate clean energy tax credits established by the Inflation Reduction Actand repealed by Republicans last year.

Part 1 showed why outages and price spikes will pull on-site assets like generators and battery storage into weekly service. This continuation focuses on what equipment must do to succeed. Availability comes first with economics a close second.

Fast forward to 2030: we’ll have demand outrunning firm capacity, and the grid shows it:

Aging thermal plants are cycled hard, so forced outages creep up, while the gear that could relieve some of the pressure – large transformers, combined cycle gas turbine powerplants and new transmission – takes years to arrive. Grid batteries help for hours, but not for days of wind and solar drought. The result: more curtailments and more requests to dispatch on-site storage and power generation systems. Prices mirror the strain: negative at night, punishingly high in the afternoon and evening. On-site power will soon be on weekly or even daily duty rather than on standby.

Now, if you want your system to become 2030-ready, it must be able to do two jobs: to keep critical loads online during blackouts, and generate cash by decoupling peak power usage away from periods of peak power pricing.

Availability comes first with economics a close second.

This will result in a dramatic change in the requirements for on-site power. You will need storage that tolerates frequent cycling, bidirectional conversion that charges batteries quickly and can export back to the grid, and controls that let the plant act as a grid-synchronized resource without adding safety risk.

What on-site power will look like in 2030

While it’s too early to predict specific technologies or suppliers, we can reasonably identify some general requirements:

The general concept of power flow in 2030 is that electricity will in many places flow into and out of customer facilities much like oceanic tides roll in and out. Although the reversal of flows will be much less predictable than tidal movement, changing flows of power are the consequence of increasing renewables penetration. Daily cycles of the sun, power demand, and the seasons mean that power generation will be increasingly difficult to match with demand. The only solution will be on site power generation and energy storage. These assets will be necessary to stabilize the inevitable mismatches between demand and renewable generation.

Storage

Daily or weekly cycling materially changes the requirements for energy storage. Technologies to support an expected 200 cycles per year and 15-to-20-year calendar life places very different demands on batteries than legacy “standby” applications, such as UPS or switchgear backup duty.

Batteries for revenue service must be sized much larger than today’s standby batteries. On top of the “insurance” job of powering critical systems during blackouts the batteries of 2030 will stack another job. This second job is the time-shifting of facility loads such that peak demand occurs during periods of low electricity prices, rather than during when energy is consumed. Many sites would need to upsize today’s stationary battery systems by ten times or more to satisfy the time-shifting requirement.

The much larger size of future high-capacity batteries, combined with fire safety concerns, will drive these stacked application batteries out of basements and outside the building.

The outdoor location and the electrical and fire safety, seismic and other AHJ requirements mean that tomorrow’s critical power battery systems will look a lot like best practice for outdoor BESS systems.

Power conversion

The single-purpose, uni-directional charger of yesteryear will give way to power conversion that can charge, support loads, and export back to the grid. It will be capable of reversing direction (i.e. charger to inverter, and vice-versa) quickly, and follow both site commands and external dispatch signals from a virtual power plant operator or other grid source.

Fast recharge speed will become an economic requirement. The former 24-hour recharge requirement typical of standby battery sites could shrink to four hours to exploit unpredictable opportunities of negative electric power prices. This sixfold faster charging requirement combined with batteries ten times larger than today’s standby batteries means the capacity of tomorrow’s power conversion could be sixty times greater than the power of today’s stationary chargers. Today’s 10 kW charger becomes tomorrow’s 600 kW bi-directional power converter.

Because the concept of negative prices for electricity is a mind-bender, an analogy to explain the much larger size of power converters is in order. Imagine for a moment that food is super expensive most of the day. For a few hours most days, however, you’re paid to eat. You take breakfast and lunch in short succession – because this deal only lasts a few hours. Plus, the more you can eat during the short “pay to eat” window, the more money you earn.

The motivation is to eat a lot in a short period. That’s exactly what the big power converter does: delivers a lot of power into a big battery in a short time.

To handle the much higher power, operating voltage must increase to maintain reasonably sized conductors. A higher storage bus, at least 800 volts DC, enables reduced wire cross section and circuit breaker ratings. Legacy 250, 125, and 48 V buses must then be fed through DC-DC conversion. Isolation, protection, and low-voltage disconnect behavior must be clearly defined.

Meanwhile physical design should be for availability and service. Modular power stages allow N+1 operation and replacement under lockout without dropping the plant. Technicians will need adequate clearances, lifting paths, and access they need to do the job safely. The shift to higher voltages and power demands new operator training in high energy and arc flash hazards.

A quick ​​sizing example to align expectations

Suppose a site currently has 100 kWh of standby storage maintained at float with a 10 kW charger. To support both a one-hour ride-through reserve and daily four-hour time shifting, battery capacity is increased to 500 kWh, with 30% capacity (150 kWH) left in reserve in case of blackout. This leaves 350 kWH for time shifting. To recharge 350 kWh in four hours, the converter needs roughly 90 kW at the DC bus after efficiency. Allowing for conversion losses and margin, a 110 to 120 kW converter is a practical minimum. If the site wants to exploit two-hour negative-price windows, double that power. This is why many facilities end up with both larger batteries and much higher conversion power than legacy systems.

This is more than idle speculation. Forces are already in motion that, by the end of this decade, will result in electricity shortages. Blackouts will become more frequent, longer, and more widespread than ever. The price of electricity will reach staggering heights, while at other times, businesses will be paid to consume. As grid disruptions and volatile prices affect bottom lines, many C&I enterprises will add or repurpose stationary batteries.

If “standby” power is going to work every week, it will look quite different from the equipment we use today. Storage must cycle, conversion must move power both ways, and operations must treat on-site power not just as an insurance policy, but also as a cash-generating asset.

The good news

While predictions of growing grid instability and looming blackouts are alarming, the very industries demanding the most from our grids are actually in the best position to support the grid. Commercial and industrial facilities have at their disposal an incredibly powerful resource: standby power. According to an address at the EGSA 2025 Spring Conference, the combined capacity of C&I standby generators installed in the United States is between 130 and 200 gigawatts, with about 45 gigawatts of that capacity located at hyperscale data centers.

Properly harnessed with the surrounding infrastructure outlined above, this installed base could replace retiring dispatchable generation faster than any other option, with minimal upgrades to distribution.

For us in the on-site power industry, the old ways of thinking are facing unprecedented challenges. As an industry, we will need to seize the opportunities this presents – or make way for those who do.

This concludes Part 2. If you need the case behind these recommendations, see Part 1, which explains why load growth, plant retirements, and aging assets are pushing critical power into daily service in the first place.

For deeper explanations, examples, and references behind these requirements, see the paper Bill delivered at Battcon 2025.

Shuo Li

Director of the China Climate Hub, Asia Society Policy Institute

After decades of the rapid growth that made China the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, independent analyses suggest China’s CO2 emissions may have plateaued or even begun to decline in 2025.

Strong growth in renewable power has, for the first time outside economic contraction, outpaced rising electricity demand, pushing power-sector emissions down and contributing to an overall modest drop in total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. This latest trend was picked up by China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), as something that should continue over the next five years, marking an official nod to a peak in energy-related CO2 emissions years ahead of the 2030 timeline Beijing previously set.

The transition from emissions growth to stabilisation and early decline will be the key watch point for 2026 and will be shaped by the forthcoming 15th five-year plan. [This plan will set key economic goals, including energy and climate targets, for 2030.] Early policy signals suggest that the plan will introduce more explicit controls on total emissions alongside China’s traditional reliance on intensity-based targets.

However, the precise timing, scale and enforceability of these absolute emissions control measures remain under active debate. Chinese experts broadly agree that if the 2021-2025 period was characterised by continued emissions growth, and 2031-2035 is expected to deliver a clear decline, then 2026-2030 will serve as a critical “bridge” between the two.

The central questions are what this transitional period will look like in practice, how it will lay the groundwork for a sustained and timely emissions decline and whether meaningful reductions can be achieved before the end of the decade.

Xinyi Shen

China team lead and researcher, Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air

In 2026, I’ll be closely watching whether China moves beyond high-level industrial decarbonisation targets and begins to address the domestic, structural constraints that have slowed progress so far.

In heavy industry, particularly steel, the main barriers are not technological readiness, but persistent blast furnace overcapacity and the lack of clear economic incentives for low-carbon production pathways, which continue to lock in emissions-intensive assets.

Against this backdrop, carbon-related trade measures, such as the EU’s carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), will make 2026 an important test of how China balances export competitiveness with climate commitments. In addition, we will see whether growing international scrutiny accelerates more substantive demand-side and policy reform in industry, rather than prolonging a reliance on incremental efficiency gains.

Min Hu

Director and co-founder, Institute for Global Decarbonization Progress

Of course, I’ll be tracking all the critical energy and climate targets under the 15th five-year plan.

More importantly, I’m watching whether a coherent package of measures can truly take hold to unlock green electricity on the demand side – not just expand renewable capacity – and translate policy intent into a genuine market pull for renewable electricity, especially from the manufacturing sector.

Given the challenge of balancing rapidly growing electricity demand with the pace of grid decarbonisation, progress on this front will be decisive for the long-term trajectory of emissions.

I’m also watching how provincial and municipal governments translate the dual-carbon goals into concrete targets and sectoral implementation. Subnational action – through overarching dual-carbon plans and sector-specific measures – will be fundamental to achieving national objectives. It will be critical to ensure that the subnational momentum around zero-emission industrial parks and clean-tech manufacturing competition results in measurable, additional emissions reductions.

Biqing Yang

Energy Analyst for Asia, Ember

2026 marks the first year of China’s 15th five-year plan, the planning cycle that ends with China’s target year of 2030 for carbon peaking. China’s fossil-fuel use in power generation is seeing an early sign of peaking and the upcoming years will be crucial in driving the plateau into an absolute decline.

As renewables expand, system flexibility and stability will increasingly become the priorities. By 2027, China aims to retrofit its existing coal-power fleet “as much as possible” and deploy more than 180 gigawatts (GW) of battery energy storage. Development in coal retrofit and further policies to support battery development will both be important to watch in 2026.

On the other hand, maximising flexibility potential will rely on continued reforms in the power market and system operations, following the milestone year of 2025, which saw substantial policy development in China’s ambition to establish a unified national power market.

Yan Qin

Principal analyst, ClearBlue Markets

In 2026, I am monitoring three pivotal developments in China.

First, the 15th five-year plan inaugurates the “dual control of carbon” system. This year marks the first time industries and local governments face binding caps on total emissions, not just intensity. Watching how these national constraints cascade down to the local level will be critical.

Second, the national carbon market is aggressively tightening. With the inclusion of steel, cement and aluminum this year, regulators are executing a “market reset” – de-weighting older [emissions] allowances and enforcing stricter benchmarks to bolster prices ahead of the EU CBAM’s full rollout.

Finally, expect a surge in zero-carbon industrial parks. Following the NDRC’s announcement of 52 pilot sites, new guidelines now mandate 60% on-site renewable consumption. These “green microgrids” are becoming the primary vehicle for reducing grid reliance and certifying low-carbon exports.

Xiaopu Sun

Senior China counsel, Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development

2026 marks China’s first year of advancing a comprehensive shift from “dual control” of energy consumption to “dual control” of carbon emissions. At the policy level, it will be essential to track how this transition strengthens the governance architecture for controlling non-CO2 greenhouse gases (GHGs), particularly methane.

Key developments to watch for may include efforts to strengthen measurement, monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) systems that enable facility- and company-level accountability.

It will also be essential to monitor progress on the voluntary GHG emission trading scheme, and the extent to which methane and other non-CO2 GHG controls are embedded in broader policy frameworks, including the environmental impact assessment system.

Finally, it will be critical to understand how non-CO2 GHG data collection and management requirements are incorporated into industry policy developments, including those addressing supply chains and product carbon-footprint initiatives.

Tu Le

Managing director, Sino Auto Insights

China’s electric vehicle (EV) industry has been the primary force pushing the global passenger vehicle market toward clean energy. Its domestic market has already crossed a more than 50% new-energy vehicle (NEV) retail take rate, while exports surged 86% year-on-year to around 2.4m units [in 2025]. That momentum should continue – especially as US legacy automakers pull back from EV investment in 2026.

As China’s domestic demand cools this year, export pressure will intensify. But a growing headwind has emerged: tariffs. Mexico, Brazil, Europe and the US are just a few of the countries raising barriers, complicating the next phase of global NEV expansion.

At the same time, 2026 looks like a prove-it year for next-generation battery technologies. Longer life, lower volatility and new chemistries could unlock more range, broader use cases and wider adoption – including in tougher markets like the US.

One new wildcard: the US now effectively controls Venezuelan oil. If that meaningfully impacts global oil prices, it could either slow – or unexpectedly accelerate – the shift toward clean-energy vehicles.

Yingjie Chen

Climate and energy program manager, Greenovation Hub

In 2026, a key focus will be how China translates its 2035 “climate-adaptive society” goal into inclusive action. Finance for adaptation is a critical enabler, requiring both policy guidance and scalable financing models. As climate risks increase, financing resilience in sectors such as energy, transportation, infrastructure and public health is paramount. While China’s green finance taxonomy already includes some climate-adaptive activities, clear labeling and expanded coverage are important next steps.

Additionally, the global goal on adaptation (GGA) indicators can help measure project impact and inform policy. We have observed good practices already in motion, such as integrating meteorological technology with finance to enhance agricultural resilience.

Looking forward, expanding these innovative models to other sectors and regions is a key step, as these pilots can enhance policymaking and be replicated. In this process, identifying and managing risks for vulnerable groups, such as women and children, in public health and education is essential for an inclusive transition.

Prof Scott Moore

Practice professor of political science and director of China Programs and Strategic Initiatives, University of Pennsylvania

First and foremost, I’ll be looking for details on climate and energy targets in China’s next five-year plan cycle, which we expect to be approved as usual in March. This will essentially operationalise China’s recent nationally determined contribution and its longstanding commitment to peak emissions before 2030.

It will also give us a sign of the tempo we can expect for non-fossil energy capacity growth and whether China will be aiming for the high end of its stated emissions-reduction range. One area I’m especially focused on is the promised expansion of China’s emissions trading system.

Second, given my particular interest in and focus on geopolitics, I’m looking for signs of how the geopolitical disruption we’ve seen in Venezuela, Iran and other regions might affect China’s energy policy – in particular, in terms of long-term contracts for liquified natural gas.

Finally, I’m looking for signs of changes to China’s climate diplomacy following the US withdrawal from both the Paris Agreement and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This leaves a big hole in global climate governance and many countries will be looking increasingly to China for leadership – and funding – in this area.

China’s solar manufacturing overcapacity is prompting Beijing’s first serious consolidation efforts. The government is introducing stricter licensing requirements and tighter energy-consumption caps for polysilicon facilities, while export-tax rebates for solar products will be abolished.

At the same time, China’s offshore wind technology is advancing rapidly. In early 2026, China installed the world’s first 20 megawatt (MW) offshore wind turbine and plans mass production of 50MW dual-rotor designs, with deployment expected from 2027-2028. MingYang’s £1.5bn announced investment in Scotland signals that Chinese wind companies are pursuing entry into European markets through local production, mirroring strategies adopted by battery manufacturers.

Together, these dynamics suggest that the next phase of cleantech competition will be shaped less by trade defense alone and more by the interaction between Chinese supply-side reforms and global market-absorption capacity.

Meanwhile, following a first wave of rare-earth restrictions in April 2025, Beijing announced controls in October that extended licensing requirements to additional rare earths and introduced unprecedented extraterritorial provisions. While China suspended the October controls for one year, the April controls on seven heavy rare earths remain fully operational.

This creates persistent procurement risk for European cleantech supply chains reliant on Chinese-processed rare earths, although China has begun issuing general export licenses, providing some operational predictability.

The biggest question is obviously the emission peak, because it’s essential to confirm if China’s carbon and greenhouse gas emissions are actually flattening or even falling. I really hope China has already reached its peak and the net-zero transition is underway.

Another important area is the evolution of China’s cleantech industries, which have become a new pillar of the country’s economy in recent years. In 2026, it is critical to see if this momentum can be sustained in China.

Given fierce competition and the gradual saturation of the domestic market, I’m also watching how Chinese cleantech companies expand their global footprint through investments in overseas manufacturing, especially as a growing number of countries want Chinese investors to create more “green jobs” and transfer cutting-edge technologies.",https://www.carbonbrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2WNW728.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 14:00:31.491225

New York State Department of Transportation Commissioner Marie Therese Dominguez said, “Under the leadership of Governor Kathy Hochul, Central New York is on the cusp of generational growth thanks to the emergence of Micron Technology and the ongoing progress of the I-81 Viaduct Project — the largest infrastructure project in New York State DOT’s history. The Region is teeming with activity on all fronts, with a ton of momentum and opportunities for enduring progress for all of upstate New York. Soon, the Department of Transportation will begin its own project to reimagine how traffic flows in and around the Micron campus, and we look forward to working with all of our partners and the surroundings communities throughout the region to deliver on the potential of this project in the near future.”

State Senator Rachel May said, “Since Micron announced its decision to build a semiconductor manufacturing facility in the Town of Clay, Central New York has been anticipating this historic moment. This nation-leading investment will create thousands of good-paying jobs, strengthen our local economy, and create opportunity for generations to come. I am confident that Central New York is ready to meet this moment, thanks to our hardworking workforce, strong partnerships at every level of government, and outstanding schools that will help train the skilled workers needed for this industry. I want to thank Governor Hochul and our local, state, and federal partners whose commitment helped bring this once-in-a-lifetime investment to our region.”

State Senator Christopher J. Ryan said, “This groundbreaking celebrates the historic investment that will reshape the economy and future of Central New York. By strengthening workforce development opportunities and educational pathways, this community has shown that we are ready, willing and able to host the next era of innovation, manufacturing and economic growth. This effort represents strong partnership among local, state and federal leaders, along with community partners, and residents who share a common vision for Central New York’s future, and we are here to support Micron’s success and prosperity for the entire region.” “This groundbreaking celebrates the historic investment that will reshape the economy and future of Central New York.

This effort represents strong partnership among local, state and federal leaders, along with community partners, and residents who share a common vision for Central New York’s future, and we are here to support Micron’s success and prosperity for the entire region.”

Assemblymember Pamela Hunter said, “Today’s groundbreaking marks an important step forward for Central New York and for the working families who have waited far too long for large scale investment and good paying jobs in our region. Micron’s commitment has the potential to create real opportunity across our community, and it is essential that the economic benefits of this project reach workers, small businesses, and neighborhoods throughout Central New York. As this project moves ahead, I will remain focused on making sure these jobs are accessible, wages are fair, and the growth we are seeing is shared by all.”

Assemblymember William Magnarelli said, “We are happy to see this historical groundbreaking for Micron. As a member of the Assembly, I look forward to working with Micron and the State to make sure that this project moves along smoothly. This investment in our community is unprecedented. We look forward to great things in the coming years.”

President and CEO of CenterState CEO Robert M. Simpson said, “It is impossible to overstate the significance of this moment for our community. Micron’s groundbreaking reflects years of dedicated effort and the start of a new era of growth for Central New York. The positive impact of the megafab will be felt quickly and broadly across our region through the creation of thousands of jobs, the growth of new businesses, and expanded opportunity for our residents. We are grateful to Governor Kathy Hochul for her leadership which has been instrumental in bringing this transformational project to fruition. We are proud to work alongside Micron and our public- and private-sector partners to ensure this project delivers lasting benefits for our entire community.”

MACNY President Randy Wolken said, “The Micron Technology project will be transformative for the Central New York Community and all of New York State. Not only will the project create tens of thousands of advanced manufacturing jobs and other positions, but it will elevate New York’s profile as the high-tech manufacturing hub for the nation. MACNY applauds Governor Kathy Hochul, U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and Onondaga County Executive Ryan McMahon for their tireless and collective efforts to make this project a reality. The MACNY Team is excited, ready, and committed to collaborate with our community partners and to be part of this historic endeavor.”

Today’s groundbreaking represents years of planning, collaboration and community input, and signals the latest in a new era of economic growth for Central New York. Under Governor Hochul’s leadership, New York State continues to partner with Micron to ensure the project delivers lasting benefits for workers, families, and small businesses, while advancing environmental sustainability, workforce development, and community engagement. The state’s commitment includes investments in site readiness, infrastructure, and workforce pipelines designed to prepare New Yorkers for careers in cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturing.

Micron's $100 billion+ commitment is the largest private investment in New York’s history and will create the largest cleanroom in the United States. By the end of the decade, one in four U.S.-made chips will be produced within 350 miles of Upstate New York — more than any other region in the nation. Micron’s investment is generating a ripple effect across the regional and statewide economies, spurring growth in construction, advanced manufacturing, research and development, and workforce training. The project is also driving significant investments in infrastructure, housing, and education to ensure local communities benefit fully from this unprecedented opportunity.

This includes:

9,000 new, good paying jobs at all levels of education on site

Up to 50,000 new permanent jobs in the region over next 30 years

Tens of thousands of construction jobs over the next 20 years to build the campus

An additional $9.5 billion in regional economic output annually starting in 2027, ramping up to over $16 billion annually by 2041

An additional $6.8 billion in annual disposable income for New Yorkers over the next thirty years.

Nearly $20 billion in revenue for state and local governments to improve schools and other public services

After decades of stagnation, the Central New York population is expected to increase thanks to strategic efforts to foster high-growth industries. Micron’s project is expected to attract upwards of 84,000 people to New York — the vast majority of them (76,000+) to the Central New York Region. To handle this growth, planned investments include:

Long-term infrastructure and energy investments to support regional growth, including expanded water, wastewater, gas, electric, nuclear generation and transportation systems

The $500 million Green CHIPS Community Investment Fund developed to ensure inclusive economic growth, workforce development and quality of life enhancements for Central New York

The flagship location of the state’s new $200 million ON-RAMP workforce development program on the South Side of Syracuse

Governor Hochul’s historic housing policies include multiple initiatives and funding programs at the state level, and local policies are being developed to stimulate the regional market to increase the supply of affordable, high quality housing choices to meet high demand.

Governor Hochul is executing a strategic vision to leverage the historic success of Micron’s investment to cement New York’s role as the nation’s primary hub for semiconductor innovation and manufacturing. By integrating world-class research infrastructure with a growing supply chain ecosystem, the Governor is ensuring that the momentum generated in Central New York catalyzes a statewide economic transformation.

In December, Governor Hochul celebrated the “topping out” of NanoFab Reflection, the cornerstone of the Governor’s $1 billion investment in NY Creates’ Albany NanoTech Complex. This ceremony marked a major milestone for the $10 billion initiative to strengthen America’s semiconductor leadership and leverage $9 billion in private sector investment. The new facility will house the nation’s first publicly owned High NA EUV Lithography Center, featuring the most advanced chip research and development capabilities in the world. This progress was further bolstered by the announcement of a $75 million partnership with SCREEN, a Japanese supply chain leader that will utilize 10,000 square feet of the new cleanroom space to conduct leading-edge R&D on advanced wafer processing.

To ensure New Yorkers are prepared for the thousands of high-paying jobs created by these investments, Governor Hochul is leading an ambitious statewide workforce development strategy. This effort is anchored by the $200 million ON-RAMP initiative, which is establishing four advanced manufacturing workforce centers across Upstate New York. This includes the flagship ON-RAMP facility on the Southside of Syracuse, a hub designed to provide critical skills training and wraparound services — such as childcare and transportation — to create accessible career pathways at Micron and beyond. These efforts are complemented by the recently opened $15 million Micron Cleanroom Simulation Lab at Onondaga Community College and the expansion of free community college for adult learners in high-demand fields including advanced manufacturing.

To capitalize on Micron’s progress, Governor Hochul deployed a comprehensive suite of economic tools designed to attract the global semiconductor supply chain and create a ""multiplier effect"" of jobs across the state as part of the FY26 Enacted Budget. This strategy is anchored by an expanded Excelsior Jobs Program specifically for semiconductor supply chain companies, alongside a first-of-its-kind large-scale semiconductor R&D tax credit. To prepare sites for rapid investment, the Governor introduced POWER UP, a $300 million initiative to create ""power-ready"" sites by proactively investing in electric infrastructure, paired with an additional $100 million for FAST NY to maintain a steady inventory of shovel-ready tracts. By coupling these infrastructure wins with a new on-the-job training tax credit — which covers up to 75 percent of costs for training new manufacturing workers — New York provides a turnkey solution for businesses looking to co-locate near the nation's premier memory-manufacturing hub.

Most recently, Governor Hochul’s commitment has extended from manufacturing to the critical research and design phase. This year’s State of the State included a proposal for a new semiconductor design center located downstate, ensuring that New York’s leadership spans the entire semiconductor lifecycle — from initial concept to high-volume fabrication.

Semiconductors are vital to the nation's economic strength, serving as the brains of modern electronics, and enabling technologies critical to U.S. economic growth, national security and global competitiveness. The industry directly employs over 300,000 people in the U.S. and supports more than 1.8 million additional domestic jobs. Semiconductors are a top five U.S. export, and the industry is the number one contributor to labor productivity, supporting improvements to the effectiveness and efficiency of virtually every economic sector — from farming to manufacturing.

New York is home to a robust semiconductor industry of 156 semiconductor and supply chain companies that employ over 34,000 New Yorkers. Under Governor Hochul’s leadership, the industry is continuing to expand with major investments from semiconductor businesses and supply chain companies like Micron, GlobalFoundries, onsemi, AMD, Edwards Vacuum, Menlo Micro and TTM Technologies to expand their presence in New York.",https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/styles/cover_image_660x400_/public/2023-11/semiconductor-chip-manufacturing.jpg?h=b5f6a62e&itok=AGSIhaH6,N,,2026-01-16 13:00:05.027670

President Trump believes that they should have a role in building this infrastructure because the Magnificent 7—companies like , , , , and —are expected to make roughly $2 trillion from artificial intelligence this year.
This approach should benefit both consumers and companies: the companies will need reliable energy, which requires a better power grid, and they will have to help pay for it.
Is the market too sure President Trump will not attack Iran this weekend?
The U.S. military is deploying additional defensive and offensive capabilities to the region in preparation, should President Trump decide to order a strike on Iran.","Naureen Malik at Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal both are reporting that the Trump Administration today will propose that the nation’s largest power grid operator hold an emergency auction in which tech companies would have to bid to build new power plants. This move is to increase the affordability for consumers of electricity because the artificial revolution has been a major reason why electricity prices, unlike other energy prices, have been on the rise.

This move is going to be what the journal calls an unprecedented attempt by the federal government to check rising prices within the PJM Interconnection which is the largest regional transmission organization (RTO) in the United States. It coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity, operates competitive markets, and ensures grid reliability across a massive region. And manages the high-voltage electric grid serving approximately 67 million people in all or parts of 13 states (Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia) and the District of Columbia. Headquartered in the Philadelphia area, it acts as a neutral, independent operator.

This move is aimed at keeping electricity prices from spiraling out of control as these data centers continue to demand more power. President Trump believes that they should have a role in building this infrastructure because the Magnificent 7—companies like , , , , and —are expected to make roughly $2 trillion from artificial intelligence this year. While Trump supports their success, he also recognizes that their growing energy demands are driving up costs for consumers, and this plan is his way of alleviating that burden. This approach should benefit both consumers and companies: the companies will need reliable energy, which requires a better power grid, and they will have to help pay for it. The goal is to achieve this without passing higher prices on to consumers.

Although this is unprecedented, similar situations exist in the market. For example, many companies have interruptible contracts so they use less natural gas when temperatures drop and consumer demand rises. Overall, this is a creative way to address affordability concerns while giving the artificial intelligence revolution an opportunity to help rebuild the power grid for the benefit of both the companies relying on it and the consumers, all while keeping prices lower.

President Trump’s actions in Venezuela are putting downward pressure on prices. You could see that pretty dramatically, especially when the market got a sense that President Trump was not going to attack Iran, and that, of course, put the focus back on the fact that the US is starting to pull in substantial amounts of Venezuelan oil into US refineries and its commanding a fair price and not the usual dictator discount.

Reuters reported that U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on Thursday the U.S. is getting a 30% higher price for than Venezuela got before U.S. special forces captured President Nicolas Maduro this month. “We’re getting about a 30% higher realized price when we sell the same barrel of oil than they sold the same barrel of oil three weeks ago,” Wright said at a U.S. Energy Association event. This extra oil that US refiners love to refine is creating a cushion of supply especially if we don’t attack Iran.

Is the market too sure President Trump will not attack Iran this weekend? Reports of increased US military presence in the Middle East could keep investors cautious, especially with the three-day Martin Luther King Jr. holiday approaching. The U.S. military is deploying additional defensive and offensive capabilities to the region in preparation, should President Trump decide to order a strike on Iran.

Despite the possibility for a near term spike in prices, the reality is that President Trump’s foreign policy is going to be a major factor that will keep oil prices from spiraling out of control. Not only do we have more stability in the globe but more supply as well and that should help keep us in this era of lower prices. And with the incredible demand growth that we expect to see over the coming years, we’re going to need that supply to not only feed the artificial intelligence revolution but the growth in our manufacturing sector as well as our trading partners as well.

The other thing that traders are going to watch is this incredible cold front that’s coming back. But now with reports that we saw some LNG outages this week due to planned and unplanned maintenance, the key will be this sustainability of coal to really make a long-term impact on supply. Yet further south the storm goes and if the cold dips into Texas, it could impact production if it doesn’t it won’t be as a big impact on the overall supply side of the market.

According to Fox Weather, there is a chance that snow could fall in Florida and Georgia this weekend as freezing temperatures move throughout the South. While the exact amounts are still uncertain, accumulations sufficient for plowing are possible, which could result in major travel disruptions in southern regions that rarely see winter weather.

Aidala,,,,,https://www.lawbc.com/chemical-regulatory-policy-in-a-period-of-political-attrition/,"While political realignments are not new, the current trend raises important questions about how sustained turnover and fragmentation may affect environmental and chemical regulatory policy.
Historically, chemical policy in the United States has been shaped by relatively small cohorts of lawmakers with deep subject-matter expertise, particularly on committees overseeing environmental protection, commerce, agriculture, and energy.
These priorities can intersect meaningfully with chemical policy, especially where chemicals are framed as critical inputs to infrastructure, defense, agriculture, and consumer goods.
The challenge for chemical regulatory policy in 2026 will be whether these emerging priorities translate into constructive engagement with regulatory systems or institutional instability continues to limit Congress’s capacity to act as a forum for durable compromise.
The face of chemical regulatory policy in 2026 will not be defined solely by partisan alignment.","As the 2026 election cycle comes into sharper focus, Congress is entering a period of unusual transition. A growing number of Republican lawmakers as well as some Democrats have announced retirements, resignations, or decisions not to seek re-election. This reflects internal strain within the party and broader dissatisfaction with the pace and structure of congressional governance. While political realignments are not new, the current trend raises important questions about how sustained turnover and fragmentation may affect environmental and chemical regulatory policy. For regulated industries, the implications are less about ideology and more about institutional capacity, legislative continuity, and policymaking bandwidth.

Historically, chemical policy in the United States has been shaped by relatively small cohorts of lawmakers with deep subject-matter expertise, particularly on committees overseeing environmental protection, commerce, agriculture, and energy. When experienced legislators depart, they take with them their policy preferences, but also procedural and subject matter expertise and working relationships that often determine whether legislation advances or stalls.

Much speculation surrounds the possibility of a change in party control of the House (less so about the Senate). For the immediate future, this will mean that actions in Congress or reactions to Administration decisions will become part of the midterm election fray. Separate from the outcome of party control, the retirement of members of either party who have developed expertise or interest in chemical safety issues will be a loss of institutional knowledge and experience.

Recent Republican departures have included members involved in appropriations, oversight, and regulatory reform debates. Even when replacements come from within the same party, the loss of institutional memory can slow legislative processes and complicate bipartisan negotiation. This is especially true with respect to technically complex issues such as chemical risk assessment, data transparency, and international regulatory alignment.

This dynamic matters. Chemical regulation is rarely driven by sweeping new statutes. Instead, it depends on incremental adjustments, reauthorizations, appropriation decisions, and oversight clarity — all of which benefit from continuity. Interest groups of all stripes lobbying for their agendas develop (or hope to develop) relationships with the committee members and their staffs. As incumbents retire to be replaced by new members, those relationships must be reestablished. This also is affected by any changes in committee leadership and assignments.

Internal divisions within the Republican caucus have increasingly shaped how Congress functions. Competing priorities, ranging from fiscal restraint, to deregulatory commitments, to broader populist concerns, have made it harder to sustain focus on technical regulatory and scientific issues that lack immediate political visibility.

From a policy standpoint, this fragmentation does not necessarily signal hostility toward chemical regulation. Rather, it often results in legislative congestion, where attention is diverted to procedural disputes, leadership challenges, or short-term fiscal crises. In that context, complex regulatory topics are more likely to be deferred to agencies or addressed piecemeal through riders and oversight hearings. For chemical manufacturers and downstream users, this reinforces a trend already underway, namely greater reliance on administrative action and state-level policymaking, with Congress playing a more reactive role.

When Congress is unable to provide consistent direction, regulatory agencies inevitably assume a larger role in shaping policy outcomes. This is not unique to one party or administration; it is a structural response to legislative gridlock. The current Administration’s emphasis on “de-regulation” provides both an agenda for Republican members and a target of criticism by Democrats. New members of either party are likely to have campaigned to some degree on supporting this binary opinion of environmental regulation, and that will also define the possible impacts on chemical and pesticide issues in the next Congress.

Agencies implementing statutes such as the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) or sector-specific chemical programs must interpret congressional intent through guidance, rulemaking, and enforcement discretion. In periods of political turnover, agencies often proceed cautiously — but they proceed nonetheless, driven by statutory deadlines, court orders, and resource constraints.

For stakeholders across the political spectrum, these dynamics underscore a shared interest in predictability and transparency, regardless of ideological alignment.

It is important to distinguish between political transition and policy abandonment. While some Republican lawmakers are stepping away from Congress, others, particularly newer members, are articulating distinct views on domestic manufacturing, supply chain resilience, and regulatory burden. These priorities can intersect meaningfully with chemical policy, especially where chemicals are framed as critical inputs to infrastructure, defense, agriculture, and consumer goods.

The challenge for chemical regulatory policy in 2026 will be whether these emerging priorities translate into constructive engagement with regulatory systems or institutional instability continues to limit Congress’s capacity to act as a forum for durable compromise.

As Bergeson & Campbell’s 2026 Global Chemical Forecast notes, regulatory risk in the coming year is shaped less by sweeping statutory change than by implementation dynamics, institutional resilience, and political durability. Congressional turnover, particularly when combined with internal party fragmentation, adds another layer of uncertainty to that landscape.

For regulated entities, this environment calls for close attention to legislative developments, appropriation signals, oversight activity, and agency-level decision-making. For policymakers, it highlights the value of continuity, expertise, and procedural stability in governing complex regulatory systems.

The face of chemical regulatory policy in 2026 will not be defined solely by partisan alignment. It will be shaped by how effectively institutions function during a period of political attrition, and whether governance structures can adapt without losing coherence.",https://www.lawbc.com/wp-content/uploads/cap02-scaled-e1757979889547.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 12:02:39.480206

The inaugural study draws on a survey of 1,000 U.S. homeowners and extensive market data to assess emerging trends in the housing market.

The report highlights that environmental risks have become a central consideration for a significant share of homeowners.

Nearly half of respondents say they are considering relocating in 2026 due to climate-related concerns, with extreme weather risk shaping preferences for certain regions. A large majority of homeowners also expect climate-driven damage to their homes in the coming years, underscoring how environmental anxiety is translating into tangible housing choices.

Among those considering relocation due to climate concerns, a quarter are considering moving to a different state entirely. Florida (58%) and California (52%) topped the list of states that homeowners said they would avoid moving to because of extreme weather risks, followed by Hawaii (24%), Louisiana (22%), Texas (21%), and Alaska (21%).

Of those polled, 93% expressed concern about damage to their home in the next two to three years due to a changing climate. Meanwhile, 68% of those polled expect the frequency of extreme weather events in their area to increase in 2026 compared to 2025.

Rising costs associated with homeownership — particularly insurance premiums — are also cited as key factors influencing the timing and nature of buying decisions. With insurance rates having climbed sharply in recent years, many prospective buyers are weighing these financial burdens alongside traditional variables such as price and location when evaluating potential homes.

""We went through a period of economic instability, but it was driven by macroeconomic factors like inflation and interest rates that have since been absorbed,"" said Kin Founder and CEO Sean Harper. ""Elevated inflation was one of the big drivers of premium increases last year, but inflation is now occurring at a more predictable pace. Substantial premium increases were the story in 2024, but they weren't the story in 2025 except for some places like California. And, they won't be the story in 2026.""

The report cited that the average home insurance premium increased by 24% between 2021 and 2024, 11% higher than inflation over the same period, insurance costs are now a major factor in homebuying decisions. Of those polled, 49% said insurance costs weigh ""very heavily"" or ""seriously"" on their home purchasing decisions; 70% said insurance costs weighed more heavily on their decisions than they did five years ago; 31% felt they would be able to maintain adequate coverage in 2026; and 19% plan to switch home insurance providers this year.

For senior Melani L. Clark, undergraduate research has been more than a requirement. It has been a three-year journey that sharpened her confidence, clarified her purpose, and positioned her as an emerging changemaker at the intersection of agriculture, environmental science, and animal health.

Clark, an agriculture major and participant in the Research and Innovation Success and Excellence (RISE) program, studies how climate-smart farming practices affect greenhouse gas emissions in crop production. Under the mentorship of Dr. Ali Fares, her research explores how biochar, a charcoal-like material used to improve soil, and animal waste can reduce environmental impact while maintaining crop productivity. Her research reflects a broader effort to develop sustainable agricultural solutions that balance environmental responsibility with the need to feed a growing population.

That work has taken her well beyond the classroom. From collecting CO₂ samples in the field to running computer analyses and mastering statistical coding, Clark developed both technical expertise and a deeper respect for the environment she studies.

“The highlight of my experience in the Faculty-RISE Program has been seeing the progressive nature of my research over the span of three years and being able to effectively describe its importance to experts and students at conferences,” Clark said. “It’s rewarding when people are interested in what I’m talking about, and I feel like it impacts how they view environmental issues.”

That growing confidence followed her to national stages. Clark presented her findings at the Association of 1890 Research Directors Conference in Nashville, Tennessee, and the Emerging Researchers National Conference in Atlanta, Georgia, experiences that strengthened her communication skills and affirmed the relevance of her work.

“Malani has consistently demonstrated an exceptional research work ethic; she is curious, committed and detail oriented,” Dr. Fares said. “From her work on climate-smart practices and soil CO₂ emissions in grain sorghum systems to presenting at national and international conferences, she approached every task with professionalism and determination. Mentoring her has been a rewarding experience; I have watched her grow into a confident researcher whose dedication and passion for science will serve her well.”

While rooted in environmental science, Clark’s research serves as a foundation for her future career in veterinary medicine. She plans to attend Purdue Veterinary College in Fall 2026, where she intends to specialize in livestock animals with a focus on reproduction and nutrition. Her long-term goals include earning a master’s in public health and becoming a veterinary school professor.

“My research gave me a newfound respect for how we treat the environment,” Clark said. “Through RISE, I also gained a well-rounded foundation for pre-veterinary medicine because of my colleagues’ expertise in different areas of environmental science.”

Clark credits both her research experience and her internship in Purdue’s Vet Up program with reinforcing a One Health perspective, the understanding that human, animal, and environmental health are deeply interconnected.

Her journey reflects the power of undergraduate research to bridge disciplines, refine career paths, and prepare students for leadership in science and medicine. For Clark, RISE was not simply a program; it was a proving ground for becoming the kind of pioneer equipped to tackle complex, real-world challenges.

The PVAMU Faculty-RISE Program, led by Vice President for Research and Innovation Dr. Magesh Rajan, empowers students through comprehensive research training, dedicated mentorship, and interdisciplinary collaboration. The program is designed to prepare the next generation of scientists and innovators to drive transformative discoveries and leadership at Prairie View A&M University and beyond.

Science funding has been spared the worst cuts for now, but don’t believe the hype — and know that the White House has more tricks up its sleeve.

The topline headlines look great:

CNN: Trump wants to slash funding for federal climate and weather research. Congress is about to tell him ‘No’

Reuters: US Senate passes bill to boost federal science spending after White House sought major cuts

NBC: Congress passes bill to fund U.S. science agencies, rebuffing Trump’s requested cuts

And there is some truth to this. Despite the Regime’s Lysenko-ist War on Science, it looks like Congress is pushing back. The White House had proposed ludicrous cuts in scientific research agencies such as NOAA, NASA, and NSF. In its recent “minibus” appropriations bill for the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, Congress has restored most of the funding that the Regime wanted wipe out.

Good news, right? Well, sort of.

Keep in mind that the ridiculous cuts were avoided, but as far as I can tell, at least at this point, all this bill does is avoid the worst damage, and makes the cuts not so bad. The overall bill reduces spending. NOAA’s funding remains flat; NASA’s science programs will get a 1% cut. Given inflation – which has increased since Trump took office – these cuts are a little deeper. As the CNN report noted:

Rick Spinrad, who headed NOAA during the Biden administration, said beating back the cuts is important, but insufficient compared to the need to increase the weather and climate products that NOAA provides.

“I’m glad Congress is providing a voice of reason, but real improvement in services… will require more than just a stabilization to levels of past investments,” he said.

And of course all of this does not answer the question of what will happen if and when OMB – led by knuckledragger Russ Vought, who said he wants federal workers “in trauma” – simply decides to impound funding and insists that Article II gives the President unilateral authority to do it. (And then gets a lawless Supreme Court to agree with him). CNN reports that:

This administration has long flouted Congress’ budget. For example, OMB has held money back from federal science agencies that Congress had previously appropriated. And some agencies, including parts of NOAA and NASA, were told to begin implementing the President’s budget request, rather than waiting for Congress to act.

Language in the House and Senate appropriations bills would give the White House less maneuvering room to get creative with its spending and agency guidance absent congressional approval.

But of course, if the President has such unilateral authority under Article II, who cares what the language says?

Put another way, this ain’t over yet. I expect major rescissions and impoundments in the months to come. Republicans in Congress are anxious to do this to avoid a shutdown. But in five months, Vought will come back to Congress and say that he won’t spend the money. And you can’t filibuster a rescission. I hope I am wrong about this.

In any event, it seems like the White House has used a technique long used by negotiators and now given a name by behavioral economists: anchoring. A more formal definition is when an initial number given causes the recipient to make judgments about subsequent numbers, even if the initial number has nothing to do with those numbers. Put another way, it’s “a particular form of priming effect whereby initial exposure to a number serves as a reference point and influences subsequent judgments. The process usually occurs without our awareness.”

Many years ago, I went to a department story that offered the so-called “fleet price” for a car. But the salesman wouldn’t show me the fleet price until he showed me the MSRP. Then the fleet price looked really great! It actually was a pretty good deal – but I only knew that because I had done a lot of research beforehand. Millions of consumers don’t, which is why so many salesmen use anchoring.

And it looks like the press was snookered again, proclaiming a victory or a “boost” in science spending when it is, in fact, a cut.

They were assisted in this by Democratic Senators Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, both of Washington State, who chair the relevant subcommittees in the process. I don’t blame them: they want to claim that they are pushing back, and they are. They have gotten the best deal that they could. But under the GOP, that deal is a lot worse than it should be.",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/NOAA-Logo.png,N,,2026-01-16 12:02:43.340331

(26/P04) TRENTON – The Murphy Administration today released an annual update of climate resilience work being undertaken by state agencies to better protect properties, lives, infrastructure, natural resources and the economy from the impacts of a changing climate.

In addition to providing important updates on a wide range of state climate resilience efforts, the second annual New Jersey Interagency Council on Climate Resilience report highlights the longstanding commitment by the Murphy Administration to advance science-based solutions, strong partnerships and public engagement to address climate threats.

“The Interagency Council’s continued work demonstrates our commitment to increasing the state’s resilience and taking action to protect future generations by planning for the impacts caused by climate change,” said Governor Murphy. “New Jersey’s commitment to combating and adapting to climate change is unwavering. I am confident in our continuing, collaborative work to protect our natural resources and build a more sustainable future.”

“New Jersey remains on the front lines of experiencing the impacts of climate change but has not wavered thanks to first-in-the-nation reforms to protect our communities, economy and the public,” Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn M. LaTourette said. “The work of the Interagency Council is groundbreaking and ongoing, creating strategic and lasting change that will enhance our quality of life for years to come.”

“I’m deeply grateful to my agency partners who have devoted their time to the Interagency Council on Climate Resilience over the last six years,” said Nick Angarone, New Jersey’s Chief Resilience Officer. “Together, we are making real progress in preparing for and responding to climate change impacts here in New Jersey. I look forward to continuing that work in 2026 and beyond.”

“Disasters are becoming more frequent and more complex as our climate changes, and the best time to respond is before they happen,” said Acting State Director of Emergency Management and Acting Superintendent of the New Jersey State Police Lt. Col. David Sierotowicz. “Emergency planning brings together people, resources, and information so communities can act quickly, protect lives, and recover faster. Planning ahead ensures we are ready to act the moment an emergency begins, not after it is already unfolding.”

“As weather events become more frequent and severe in New Jersey, it is essential for communities to proactively plan and put into place strategies that can help mitigate the effects of natural disasters,” said Department of Community Affairs Commissioner Jacquelyn A. Suárez. “The Interagency Council’s work has produced resources that communities can use in this effort such as the Resilient Communities grant program for public infrastructure projects and the Smart Move initiative to help people relocate to neighborhoods with a lower disaster risk. Preparation is key and these resources allow municipalities to better adapt to the changing climate.”

The Interagency Council on Climate Resilience

Governor Murphy established the Interagency Council on Climate Resilience (Interagency Council or IAC) by Executive Order 89 in 2019, creating a venue to address climate change resilience across all state agencies. The Interagency Council, initially formed with 17 executive branch agencies, has expanded to 26 member agencies and departments, underscoring the importance of resilience in every sector of the state’s economy and environment.

In 2025, the IAC published the New Jersey Statewide Flood Resilience Initiatives report, which coincided with the state’s first-ever Flood Safety Week in August. The Interagency Council also incorporated new action commitments into New Jersey’s Extreme Heat Resilience Action Plan, released in November.

Other highlights involve the advancement of special projects across three key workgroups working to better understand the climate needs and concerns of New Jerseyans, improve messaging related to extreme heat preparedness, and improve interagency coordination and information-sharing regarding climate-related risks and vulnerabilities.

Building a Broad Resilience Legacy

Over the past eight years, Governor Murphy has worked to mitigate the impacts of climate change – a significant threat to the state’s natural resources and environment, public health, infrastructure, security, and economy. Through a coordinated, whole-of-government approach, the Murphy Administration has been working decisively to implement science-based policies and strategies to protect residents, businesses, and communities from worsening climate impacts.

DEP has made progress in several areas, including:

Following the Science:

The landmark 2020 Scientific Report on Climate Change, and subsequent updates, synthesize the latest and most reliable scientific information on the current and predicted future impacts of climate change on New Jersey, providing essential information for taking action to make the state more resilient and reduce greenhouse gases linked to climate change and impacts to human health. An addendum to the report on climate change impacts to human health and communities followed in 2022 and a comprehensive update to the report was finalized in 2025.

The Rising Seas and Changing Coastal Storms study, commissioned by DEP and prepared by Rutgers University and leading climate change experts, provided critical information on projected sea-level rise in New Jersey, concluding that it is increasing in the state at more than two times the average global rate.

Making the Coastline More Resilient:

DEP follows science-based modeling to address sea-level rise and to ensure that coastal communities understand the need for more resilient infrastructure that can withstand future climate change conditions, such as increased and repetitive flooding events.

Through flood resilience infrastructure projects such as Rebuild By Design-Hudson, Rebuild By Design-Meadowlands, Storm Risk Reduction Projects at Port Monmouth and Keansburg, and the Union Beach Coastal Storm Risk Management Project, as well as ongoing beach nourishment projects, the DEP continues to ensure that coastal communities are protected from increasingly severe storms through robust beaches, dunes, and infrastructure.

Helping Communities Become More Resilient:

More than 70 local governments are participating in resilience planning efforts coordinated through DEP’s Resilient NJ program, which supports the development of local and regional resilience action plans that use the best available climate science to plan for climate change impacts.

DEP’s Blue Acres voluntary buyout program enables homeowners to sell their flood-prone properties to the state, relocate to safer areas and create open space that serves as a buffer against future storms.

Addressing Inland Flooding and Aging Infrastructure:

Through the State Revolving Fund and I-Bank funding programs, the Murphy Administration has provided more than $212 million through the New Jersey Water Bank to help communities upgrade antiquated local stormwater and drinking water infrastructure to better handle increased and more intense precipitation events.

Advancing Climate Change Mitigation:

Through auction proceeds from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) carbon dioxide cap-and-invest program, New Jersey has invested more than $230 million in climate change, clean energy, and equity programs across the state since 2020.

More than $54 million in funding through DEP’s Natural Climate Solutions grant program has been made available to create, restore, and enhance New Jersey’s natural carbon sinks through projects such as tree plantings, living shoreline creation and salt marsh restoration.

Protecting the Public from the Impacts of Extreme Heat:

New Jersey’s Extreme Heat Resilience Action Plan for the first time in state history is coordinating actions across state agencies to help the public take action to be better protected as the climate continues to warm.

The user-friendly online resource Heat Hub NJ makes it much easier for the public, particularly vulnerable populations, to become more resilient to the impacts of extreme heat.

Responding to Growing Wildfire Risks:

As climate change makes wildfire seasons longer and more unpredictable, the Murphy Administration launched NJ Wildfire SMART (Safety, Mitigation, Awareness, Response, Training), a series of actions that emphasize steps and informational resources for reducing wildfire risk and spread.

DEP’s Forest Fire Service targets treatment of 25,000 acres of forest and grasslands annually through a proactive prescribed fire program. Prescribed fire mitigates the risk of more frequent and intense wildfires in a changing climate, enhances habitats for plants and animals, and safeguards ecosystems.

Making Ecosystems More Resilient:

Developed in partnership with Rutgers University, the Coastal Ecological Restoration and Adaptation Planning Tool provides the locations of at-risk areas, coastal resource restoration sites, and other data to help coastal municipal planners and non-profit organizations coordinate coastal restoration projects that support the health of coastal ecosystems.

DEP Fish and Wildlife, in collaboration with conservation partners, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and New Jersey Department of Transportation’s Office of Maritime Resources, is advancing nature-based solutions—such as the beneficial use of clean dredged material—to restore and enhance wildlife habitat within New Jersey’s Wildlife Management Area System. Hundreds of acres of wildlife habitat have been restored to date, including habitats critical to threatened and endangered species.

Accomplishments of the Past Year

The IAC publishes a new annual report at the start of each year, documenting progress and successes from Council membership. Among some of the 2025 Annual Report’s highlights:

Flood Safety:

In July 2025, it released the first Statewide Flood Resilience Initiatives report in conjunction with New Jersey’s first-ever Flood Safety Week.

As storm events in the state become more frequent and intense, coastal and inland flooding risks increase significantly. The flood report summarizes the many programs and projects being implemented to make residents and communities more resilient to flooding, and highlights programs and initiatives undertaken by 26 state agencies to reduce the state’s risk of damage and destruction from floods.

Drought Awareness:

Below-average precipitation levels for more than a year have led to multiple information initiatives to educate the public about drought conditions and how to protect drinking water supplies statewide.

Commissioner LaTourette in November 2024 issued an Administrative Order putting the state in Drought Warning and calling for voluntary water conservation. The order was lifted in June 2025, but worsening dry conditions led Commissioner LaTourette to designate Drought Warning status again in December, which remains in place. He has noted that precipitation and water supply uncertainty in New Jersey for more than a year is a symptom of climate change.

DEP consults with water suppliers to ensure no single supplier or region faces a significant shortfall if dry weather and high customer demand continue. Weekly updates on precipitation and drought conditions are also provided here.

Extreme Heat:

To address extreme heat in densely developed areas with limited green space, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities launched the Urban Heat Island Mitigation Grant Program in 2025, a $5 million program awarding $50,000 grants to help the state’s most vulnerable communities develop cooling projects that mitigate extreme heat.

Urban heat islands occur in cities and densely developed areas where concrete, pavement, and buildings retain heat and green spaces are limited. Cities such as Newark, Trenton, Camden, and Jersey City are among the Northeast’s most intense urban heat islands, often registering temperatures 5 degrees to 20 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than surrounding areas, leading to public health risks, increased energy bills and additional stress on power grids.

Climate Science Report Update:

The DEP, along with colleagues at Department of Agriculture, Department of Health, and Department of Human Services, published the 2025 New Jersey Scientific Report on Climate Change which summarizes the current state of knowledge regarding the observed and projected effects of climate change on New Jerseyans and the environment.

The report identifies and presents the best available peer-reviewed scientific research to inform the current and anticipated challenges of climate change with an emphasis on New Jersey. Some key components of the report include updated sea-level rise, temperature, and precipitation trends and projections.

The planned auction could help add much-needed electricity supply to the region and lower costs for the 67 million residents who are served by the PJM grid.
The company blamed runaway demand from data centers.
These centers, which have cost the tech industry billions of dollars to make, use up a gargantuan amount of electricity.
Microsoft, for example, said it will ask to pay higher electricity bills in areas where it’s building data centers.","The Trump administration and a consortium of governors from northeastern states are asking PJM, the country’s largest electrical grid operator, to hold an emergency power auction as part of an effort to make technology giants pay for surging power costs from new data centers.

In the auction, tech companies will be able to bid on 15-year contracts for electricity generation from newly constructed power plants, Bloomberg first reported. Although power auctions are standard practice and routine, they are typically for one-year periods of electricity supplies and are open to public utilities and private power companies.

The proposed auction – which the White House and governors cannot mandate – is unusual both for the extraordinary length of the contract and because it will be limited to technology companies that build power-hungry data centers. The billions of dollars raised from the auction would support construction of new power plants in the region that the tech companies would use to satisfy their growing demand for energy over the next decade and a half.

Utilities used to directly generate the electricity they sold to customers. But deregulation over the past few decades has led to the introduction of outside providers, who generate much of the power sold by utilities to both residential and business customers. The auctions play the role of an intermediary, balancing the anticipated demand for electricity from utilities with the power available from various energy producers, like natural gas plants or solar or wind farms.

The rates paid by consumers for electricity is regulated by the state regulators. But those rates are based on the costs utilities have to pay for that energy, either from their own plants or at free market auctions. The growing demand for power due to a rash of AI data center construction has put upward pressure on the rates regulators allow utilities to charge their customers.

The planned auction could help add much-needed electricity supply to the region and lower costs for the 67 million residents who are served by the PJM grid.

“Under President Trump’s leadership, the administration is leading a unprecedented bi-partisan effort urging PJM to fix the energy subtraction failures of the past, prevent price increases, and reduce the risk of blackouts,” said White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers. “Ensuring the American people have reliable and affordable electricity is one of President Trump’s top priorities, and this would deliver much-needed, long-term relief to the Mid-Atlantic region.”

PJM for the first time in its history last month failed to match supply with demand at an auction. The company said it could not reliably meet the anticipated electricity needs of the customers it serves between June 2027 and May 2028: PJM said it could generate 5.2% less electricity than needed.

The company blamed runaway demand from data centers.

“This auction leaves no doubt that data centers’ demand for electricity continues to far outstrip new supply, and the solution will require concerted action involving PJM, its stakeholders, state and federal partners, and the data center industry itself,” said Stu Bresler, PJM’s chief operating officer, in a statement following the December auction.

But it’s not clear that PJM will be on board with the government’s directive. The company said it was given no advance notice of the plan.

“Apparently they will make an announcement,” the company said in a statement to CNN. “We have not been invited and will not be there.”

PJM is the country’s largest grid, covering thirteen states and the District of Columbia.

While some states like Virginia are in the midst of an AI-fueled data center boom, all that server power is straining the interconnected grid and spiking energy costs throughout the entire region. Virginia’s largest utility is increasing rates by roughly 9%, and New Jersey utility bills jumped by more than 20% this year.

The cost of electricity is up 6.7% nationwide over the last year, according to the Consumer Price Index, the government’s key inflation measure. The cost is up nearly 30% since the end of 2021.

Americans have been facing sticker shock when opening their electricity bills, as the tech industry rapidly builds data centers and other infrastructure to power AI systems across the United States. These centers, which have cost the tech industry billions of dollars to make, use up a gargantuan amount of electricity.

Some communities have rung the alarm on environmental impacts as well as worries about AI eliminating jobs.

Trump has directed his attention toward the rising costs, teasing plans in January to address the rising bills with Big Tech.

“Therefore, my Administration is working with major American Technology Companies to secure their commitment to the American people, and we will have much to announce in the coming weeks to ensure that Americans don’t ‘pick up the tab’ for their POWER consumption, in terms of higher Utility bills,” Trump said in a Truth Social post.

Some tech giants have already been trying to come up with solutions. Microsoft, for example, said it will ask to pay higher electricity bills in areas where it’s building data centers. It said it would also cover the cost of updating and adding necessary electricity to the grid.

“We don’t have a lot to say on this,” PJM spokesman Jeffrey Shields said in an email to Bloomberg.
The move is in response to growing concerns that power demand emanating from the data center sector is far outpacing supply across the PJM market.

Under the terms of the initiative, the Trump administration and governors within the PJM Interconnection market will push the RTO to launch a reliability power auction, giving tech companies and hyperscalers the chance to bid on 15-year contracts for new electricity generation.

According to reports, if the plan were to go ahead, it could deliver contracts worth more than $15 billion to facilitate the construction of new power plants.

With the passage of today’s third minibus, the House has now advanced more than half of the twelve appropriations bills required to reach the finish line.
6938, “As a member of the House Committee on Appropriations, I was happy to vote for H.R.
This package builds upon the progress of the previous three bipartisan appropriations bills, which were signed into law this past November.” Rep.
With critical deadlines approaching, Congress must do its work and move the remaining funding bills across the finish line.","Washington, D.C. – The House Appropriations Committee has driven results for the American people by doing exactly what we told the nation we would: breaking the failed status quo and putting discipline and accountability back in charge. The start of January has been defined by action, as we have successfully advanced small, targeted packages that reflect savings for the taxpayers, the America First agenda, and a member-driven process.

Even with media headlines and time constraints vying against us, we’ve taken every obstacle head-on and continued to move forward. In her 250 years, America has never shied away from a challenge – and neither will we. That unified message is not only seen through the decisive and back-to-back passage of H.R. 6938(link is external) and H.R. 7006(link is external), but through the work, support, and leadership of our determined appropriators.

This momentum reflects a shared commitment to governing with purpose and follow-through. As these conferenced measures advance, our appropriators have made clear what this work represents: fiscal discipline, regular order progress, and achievements that build a stronger future. Their words tell that story best, so here are some highlights on the two packages that are now another step closer to President Trump’s desk:

Image

Chairman Tom Cole (R-OK) praises(link is external) the work of appropriators to fund the government through diligent, responsible work on H.R. 7006, “Another step forward – another promise kept. The House just passed our next bipartisan, bicameral FY26 appropriations package, reflecting a simple truth: funding the government is a responsibility, and doing it right requires steady, deliberate progress. This two-bill measure strengthens economic opportunity, supports small businesses and families, and modernizes government operations. It protects taxpayers by shifting IRS resources toward customer service as families head into a historic tax filing season – one in which the benefits of the Working Families Tax Cuts will be realized. Just as this package strengthens financial security and accountability, it also reinforces America’s safety and leadership at home and abroad. We turn President Trump’s doctrine of peace through strength into action by realigning funding toward national security priorities that uphold U.S. values, guidance, and diplomacy on the world stage. We counter drug and human trafficking, confront the malign influence of our adversaries, and institute accountability. The blank checks of past administrations are over – and America First governing is back. That discipline shaped this package, resulting in billions of dollars in savings. Subcommittee Chairmen David Joyce and Mario Díaz-Balart guided this legislation to deliver results for the country and implement President Trump’s agenda of a future defined by clarity of purpose and confidence in America.""

Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Chairman Hal Rogers (R-KY) supports(link is external) the critical law enforcement and public safety measures included in H.R. 6938, “From national security and law enforcement to American innovation and space exploration, the CJS bill before us puts the nation on a path to greatness while reinforcing President Trump’s bold agenda on trade and combating illicit drug trafficking. To continue the fight against drug cartels that are ravaging American communities, the Drug Enforcement Administration receives an increase of $63 million in this bill. The bill also streamlines and enhances support for the National Weather Service to ensure Americans receive lifesaving information in times of need. This bill is pro-law enforcement. It includes increased funding for state and local police through Byrne formula grants and COPS hiring grants while also making cuts to wasteful grant programs. I want to thank Chairman Cole for his steady leadership. I also want to recognize Ranking Member Meng and Ranking Member DeLauro for their partnership, as well as staff for their hard work on the bill. This legislation is a product of good faith, bipartisan negotiations. I urge a yes vote and I yield back the balance of my time.”

Labor, Health and Human Services, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Chairman Robert Aderholt (R-AL) touts(link is external) the America First wins in H.R. 6938: “Republicans are delivering America First results by restoring U.S. energy dominance, strengthening nuclear deterrence, bolstering public safety, and eliminating Biden-era policies. This is responsible, transparent work in action. Appropriators are committed to restoring regular order to the committee process and are doing exactly what we said we would for the American people. Delivering real results.”

Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Chairman Mike Simpson (R-ID) lauds(link is external) a bipartisan bill that reflects American values: “The passage of the Fiscal Year 2026 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Act sends a strong message that House Republicans are determined to advance President Trump's America First policy agenda by reducing energy costs, protecting America's public lands, and reversing harmful Biden-era regulations. As Chairman of this subcommittee, I am pleased that this bill protects important programs that states and local communities rely on. This legislation fully funds the Payment in Lieu of Taxes program and prioritizes funding for Indian Country and Wildland Fire Management. I am grateful to Chairman Cole for his leadership and my colleagues' support across the House floor. I look forward to this critical legislation getting signed into law by President Trump.”

Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Chairman John Carter (R-TX) shares(link is external) how Congress is restoring regular order with responsible governance, “This legislation reflects a deliberate, transparent process that respects Congress’s constitutional responsibility over federal spending. Passing full-year appropriations bills through regular order provides stability, accountability, and certainty for the American people. By voting in favor of this bill the House took a key step to fully fund key agencies through the end of the fiscal year. The package supports priorities important to Texas and the nation, including strengthening national security, restoring American energy leadership, and equipping law enforcement with the resources needed to combat fentanyl trafficking and violent crime. It includes investments in grid security, critical minerals, geothermal energy, and the continued modernization of the nation’s nuclear deterrence. Additionally, the legislation provides funding for responsible management of public lands, wildland firefighting, tribal public safety initiatives, and national parks, while preserving longstanding protections for the Second Amendment and preventing taxpayer dollars from being used to fund abortions. This is responsible governance. By avoiding last-minute omnibus bills and passing full-year appropriations, Congress is doing its job and delivering results for the American people.”

Defense Subcommittee Chairman Ken Calvert (R-CA) supports(link is external) local wins in H.R. 7006, “As a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, I was proud to support another package of bills that fund important priorities for our region, state, and country. The bill passed today addresses longstanding frustrations of Eastvale residents and businesses, including not having a post office in the city, as well as their lack of a single, unique zip code. To combat fentanyl and other drugs in our communities, the bill provides critical resources for law enforcement agencies at all levels of government.”

National Security, Department of State, and Related Programs Subcommittee Chairman Mario Díaz-Balart (R-FL) celebrates(link is external) national security wins that protect our nation while eliminating billions in wasteful spending, “I commend Chairman Tom Cole’s leadership in restoring regular order to the appropriations process and protecting hard-earned U.S. taxpayer dollars and thank my colleagues for advancing this third tranche of full-year appropriations bills that deliver real solutions for the American people. These bills cut waste, fraud, and abuse, ensure accountability and efficiency, combat drug trafficking, and strengthen U.S. national security, all while advancing President Trump’s America First agenda. As chairman of the subcommittee responsible for funding America’s foreign policy and national security priorities, I am proud that my NSRP Fiscal Year 2026 bill delivers the largest spending reduction of any appropriations bill this year, reducing spending by 16%, while strengthening U.S. national security and prioritizing American interests. Under President Trump’s leadership, American strength and credibility on the world stage are back. This legislation advances the President’s Peace Through Strength vision by strengthening mutually beneficial partnerships that lead to economic prosperity for the United States and our hemisphere, standing firmly with our allies, confronting malign actors that threaten our security, combating drug trafficking, and controlling irresponsible and dangerous migration.”

Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Chairman Steve Womack (R-AR) praises(link is external) Congress’ progress towards regular order, and encourages members to continue the work in order to avoid another damaging shutdown or stop-gap measure, “With the passage of this bill, we are halfway towards fully funding the government for the remainder of the fiscal year, ensuring that federal spending is aligned with the needs and priorities of the American people. This legislation invests in critical pieces of our federal government to unleash American energy, keep our natural resources safe and clean, and support law enforcement’s efforts to end narcotics trafficking. While I am proud of the progress we have made, I must underscore the need to complete the remaining Fiscal Year 2026 appropriations bills. Resorting to another long-term continuing resolution is unacceptable and shortchanges the hardworking Americans whose taxpayer dollars keep our government running. Time is of the essence, and I encourage my colleagues to have the same sense of urgency so we can get 2026 priorities enacted and leave 2024 behind.”

Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Subcommittee Chairman Chuck Fleischmann (R-TN) emphasizes(link is external) the Republican priority to unleash American energy, “As part of President Trump’s and House Republicans’ mission to renew our great nation, we promised to unleash American-made energy, invest in our military, and modernize infrastructure nationwide. The Fiscal Year 2026 Energy and Water Appropriations Act, which I led and successfully passed in the House, strengthens America by investing in our nuclear deterrent to counter aggression from Russia and China, funding essential upgrades for our ports and waterways infrastructure – including full funding for the Chickamauga Lock: a critically important project for Tennessee, and strengthening our electrical grid to enhance its resiliency. The Energy and Water bill also makes historic commitments to decrease our reliance on China’s monopoly of critical minerals, makes America the global leader in the technologies of tomorrow like AI, quantum, and supercomputing, continues to provide robust funding for America’s next-generation Nuclear Navy, and ensures that we continue unleashing American energy dominance to lower energy prices. I am proud that the FY26 Energy and Water bill puts America First and delivers for our great nation. I thank the Trump Administration, Chairman Cole, and my bipartisan colleagues in the House and Senate for their collaboration and support to pass my Energy and Water bill. I look forward to President Trump signing my bill into law.”

Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee Chairman Dave Joyce (R-OH) applauds(link is external) the work to align spending with the Trump Administration’s priorities, “Under the previous administration, taxpayers saw their hard-earned dollars go to waste on reckless federal spending. Passage of this bill is a significant step towards restoring fiscal responsibility and prioritizing the American public in our federal agencies. This legislation cuts waste and provides critical funding that supports the Department of the Treasury, Small Business Administration, High Intensity Drug Trafficking programs, the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, the Federal Judiciary, and over 20 other independent agencies. I want to thank my colleagues on the committee and Chairman Cole for their hard work, and I look forward to working to pass the remaining appropriations bills in the coming weeks.”

Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Chairman Andy Harris (R-MD) touts(link is external) the funding he secured for his district in H.R. 6938, “I’m proud to have led a bipartisan effort among 15 Members of Congress from coastal states to secure $40 million and put the necessary language in the bill to address a critical gap in the Army Corps’ dredging capacity. The aging Dredge Currituck has required frequent maintenance, limiting the Corps’ ability to maintain navigation channels. As Senator Ben Cardin prepared to leave office, he urged me to see this long-delayed project through to completion. It was my honor to deliver the funding to replace Dredge Currituck with a new dredging vessel serving Maryland and the East Coast. I look forward to working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to support the timely delivery and placement into service of the new vessel.”

Homeland Security Subcommittee Chairman Mark Amodei (R-NV) applauds(link is external) the work appropriators are doing to fund the government the responsible way, “Chairman Cole is leading an effort many doubted was possible and one that has not been accomplished in some time: restoring regular order in the appropriations process. With the passage of today’s third minibus, the House has now advanced more than half of the twelve appropriations bills required to reach the finish line. Each of these bills has been finalized through good-faith negotiations in both chambers and on both sides of the aisle. This two-bill package protects Americans by combating illicit drugs entering our country, promotes stability by focusing resources on allies that advance U.S. interests, and enhances accountability by preventing adversaries from exploiting U.S. assistance. It also modernizes government operations by reining in a weaponized IRS, bolsters economic growth by supporting entrepreneurship and small business development, and counters malign cyberattacks by strengthening technology defenses. Not only is this a fiscally responsible package that cuts billions in spending, it demonstrates a stronger approach to governing that delivers cost-saving results for taxpayers.”

Legislative Branch Subcommittee Chairman David Valadao (R-CA) promotes(link is external) the funding he secured for community projects in H.R. 6938, “As a member of the House Committee on Appropriations, I was happy to vote for H.R. 6938 and advance the next three full-year funding bills. This package will help bolster our national security efforts, strengthen domestic energy production, and invest in public safety improvements. Importantly, I was proud to have secured key investments –totaling $14 million – for several critical water and infrastructure projects across the Central Valley. From strengthening groundwater recharge and preventing land subsidence to replacing aging wells and water storage infrastructure, these funds will help safeguard our water supply, support our farmers and communities, and ensure continued access to clean water. Passing this funding package brings us one step closer to completing our full-year funding bills, and I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in the House and Senate to continue this important process.”

Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-WA) praises(link is external) efforts to combat China in H.R. 7006, “This government funding package invests in some of our most important national security interests while cutting overall spending by over nine billion dollars. In this legislation, we refocused tax dollars on our domestic security, prioritizing threats by Communist China, the illegal flow of fentanyl from South America, and terror groups who look to do us harm. In the Financial Services funding bill, we fully funded the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States as we work to expand its authority to protect American farmland and our natural resources. I thank Chairman Cole, and Subcommittee Chairs Diaz-Balart and Joyce, for their hard work in getting these funding bills through committee, to the floor, and now on the way to the Senate.""

Rep. John Moolenaar (R-MI) supports(link is external) the local impact of funding from H.R. 6938, “These bills fund important programs that are crucial to Michigan families. They increase funding to fight the fentanyl crisis, protect the Great Lakes, combat online scams, and invest in STEM education. They also fund the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to continue construction of the Soo Locks, and maintain our harbors.”

Rep. John Rutherford (R-FL) touts(link is external) the America First priorities in H.R. 7006, “We must protect the American taxpayer, advance government efficiency, strengthen national security, and promote America First priorities. That’s why I was proud to vote yes on this bill to deliver strength abroad, security at home, a smarter government, and stronger financial security for the American people. This bill cuts billions in spending, delivering real wins and savings for Americans. It also brings a lot of great wins for Northeast Florida, including funding for the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) fund to support entrepreneurship and small businesses in our area and the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) program to stop the flow of dangerous illegal drugs into our communities. As an honorary Rotarian, I am proud this bill maintains funding to fight for global eradication of polio and against AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria worldwide.""

Rep. Ben Cline (R-VA) praises(link is external) Republicans’ efforts to govern responsibly with full-year funding bills, “Last week marked a significant milestone as the House passed three critical FY26 appropriations bills covering Energy and Water Development, Commerce-Justice-Science, and the Interior Department. More than just routine legislation, these bills demonstrate House Republicans’ unwavering commitment to restoring regular order and completing the appropriations process without resorting to a last-minute omnibus package. By doing so, we’re responsibly funding the government while advancing key priorities that protect hardworking Americans and deliver on the America First agenda. These bills provide full-year funding at a lower cost than another continuing resolution (CR) and build crucial momentum toward completing the annual appropriations process through committee-led negotiations. This package builds upon the progress of the previous three bipartisan appropriations bills, which were signed into law this past November.”

Rep. Guy Reschenthaler (R-PA) plugs(link is external) the benefits of H.R. 6938 for his district, “Southwestern Pennsylvania’s waterways, infrastructure, and public safety systems are critical to our regional economy and quality of life. This bipartisan funding package passed the House overwhelmingly and delivers $199 million I requested to modernize our locks and dams, strengthen local infrastructure, and support law enforcement. I am eager to see these critical investments become law in the near future.”

Rep. Ashley Hinson (R-IA) celebrates(link is external) millions in community project funding for her district, “As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, I am focused on ensuring Iowans’ taxpayer dollars are protected by reducing wasteful spending and prioritizing investments in Iowa communities. I was proud to secure key funding for Iowa in this package to support law enforcement and improve rural infrastructure. I’ll continue working to end wasteful overspending in Washington while delivering investments in Iowa.”

Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-TX) supports(link is external) the pro-law enforcement measures included in H.R. 6938, “As a member of the House Appropriations Committee and a fiscal conservative, ensuring that our taxpayer dollars are spent on priorities that directly improve Texans' lives is top of mind. From my time on the road across South and West Texas, one of the main concerns I’ve heard time and time again from folks on the ground is public safety. One of the key elements in stopping crime is making sure that our law enforcement officers have the tools they need to succeed. This year, I secured over $22 million in funding that will go to our district. This funding will be utilized to improve counterterrorism, anti-gang, and anti-drug trafficking efforts, school safety initiatives, and law enforcement equipment upgrades. Bringing tax dollars home to do good is always the goal. I am incredibly grateful Texans will benefit from these community investments.”

Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Vice Chair Julia Letlow (R-LA) expresses(link is external) support for continued work on the remaining appropriations bills, “My goal is for Congress to ultimately pass every appropriations bill in a timely manner. The American people expect no less! Under Chairman Tom Cole, we are making progress in responsibly and transparently stewarding taxpayer dollars.”

Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Subcommittee Vice Chair Michael Cloud (R-TX) gives strong support(link is external) to the pro-American energy priorities in H.R. 6938, “Unleashing American energy dominance means truly building our production and infrastructure to meet the modern demands, not just coming up with more and more regulation. I spoke in support of the FY26 Energy and Water Appropriations Act, which invests in infrastructure, strengthens our power grid, supports nuclear energy, water resources, and ports like Corpus Christi – keeping America secure and competitive.”

Rep. Michael Guest (R-MS) praises(link is external) the elimination of wasteful government spending in H.R. 7006, “This week, House Republicans voted to keep our government open and running. The latest appropriations bill for Financial Services stops waste, fraud, and abuse of your taxpayer dollars.”

Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-MT) promotes(link is external) millions secured in community project funding for his district, “These bills reflect Montana values: strong communities, safe streets, reliable infrastructure, and access to our public lands. I fought to ensure Montana wasn't an afterthought. From sheriff's departments and clean water systems to forest management and Tribal public safety, these investments put resources directly into our communities.""

Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-GA) applauds(link is external) the local wins in H.R. 6938, “The critical provisions related to Lake Lanier in the FY26 Energy and Water Development appropriations bill represent a momentous victory for Northeast Georgia. For years, I’ve worked to use every tool at my disposal to secure measures that preserve and improve our beloved landmark for locals and visitors alike. Due to my hard-fought efforts, this House-passed spending bill includes wins that protect Lake Lanier’s name and help keep its parks open for folks to safely enjoy. I’m pleased that these initiatives are one step closer to becoming law – delivering effective solutions to Ninth District families, small businesses, and local governments.”

Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Vice Chair Stephanie Bice (R-OK) touts(link is external) funding for nuclear defense projects that keep Americans safe, “This responsible package delivers real results for Oklahoma and the American people. These bills bolster our nuclear defense systems, reinforce water infrastructure, and restore American energy dominance. It also helps fight against the scourge of fentanyl, provides funding for emergency weather services, defends the Second Amendment and supports law enforcement. These bills also eliminate wasteful Biden-era polices that have held our country back while advancing pro-growth initiatives. I was proud to support this package which delivers tangible wins for Oklahoma families, and look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the rest of the appropriations bills.”

Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Vice Chair Scott Franklin (R-FL) commends(link is external) the work to responsibly fund the government with H.R. 7006, “As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, I take seriously our responsibility to fund the federal government in a disciplined and transparent way. With critical deadlines approaching, Congress must do its work and move the remaining funding bills across the finish line. These bills reflect the kind of responsible, oversight-driven decisions required to keep the government operating and meet our national security obligations.”

Defense Subcommittee Vice Chair Jake Ellzey (R-TX) supports(link is external) appropriators’ work to safeguard Americans’ tax dollars, “This is how Congress is supposed to work. We’re returning to a transparent, member-driven process that respects Article I of the Constitution, strengthens accountability, and gives the American people confidence that their tax dollars are being spent wisely.”

Homeland Security Vice Chair Juan Ciscomani (R-AZ) touts(link is external) funding secured for his district in H.R. 6938, “This funding is critical for community projects in Southeastern Arizona.

I’m especially grateful to our local partners for their collaboration and leadership in helping take the next step to secure these funds and making sure federal resources are put to work locally.”

National Security, Department of State, and Related Programs Subcommittee Vice Chair Chuck Edwards (R-NC) applauds(link is external) accountability measures included in H.R. 7006, “My focus is on making sure federal resources are managed responsibly and deliver real results for the people of Western North Carolina.

Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Vice Chair Mark Alford (R-MO) praises(link is external) cuts to wasteful spending in H.R. 7006, “With this latest government funding package, Congress is well on its way to completing our appropriations work and stopping another Democrat shutdown. This legislation delivers real savings, real security, and real America First wins. It codifies DOGE cuts to woke and wasteful foreign aid programs, while funding those critical to our national security at reasonable levels. This is what responsible governing looks like, prioritizing economic growth, safety, strength, and freedom.”

Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee Vice Chair Nick LaLota (R-NY) spoke(link is external) on the House floor in support of H.R. 7006, “Mr. Chairman, the FY26 bill – FSGG bill reflects the values Americans sent us here to uphold, and I urge support of the bill. I thank the Chairman for his leadership and for yielding.”

Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Vice Chair Dale Strong (R-AL) promotes(link is external) local aerospace wins in H.R. 6938, “This legislation makes crucial investments that secure the future of the Space Launch System, Human Landing System, and nuclear thermal propulsion. These targeted investments reinforce U.S. leadership in space, strengthen national security, and directly support the Marshall Space Flight Center.

At the same time, President Donald Trump has opposed the fastest growing sources of new energy – renewables.

Trump’s big tax bill last year effectively ended renewable energy tax credits, slowed renewable projects on public lands and – most recently – his Interior department cited national security in pausing federal permits on several big offshore wind projects.

The Allegheny Front’s Reid Frazier spoke about the intersection of these policies and the nation’s rising electric demand with Julian Spector, a reporter at Canary Media, an independent non-profit news outlet that covers renewable energy, about Spector’s recent article on the issue.

LISTEN to their conversation

https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/media.alleghenyfront.org/AF011626_RF_EnergySupply.mp3

Reid Frazier: You write that the U.S. could be headed toward an electricity crisis of its own making. What do you mean by that?

Julian Spector: This is something that I started worrying about last year when we kept seeing different actions by the Trump administration targeting renewable energy. Solar has become the biggest source of new power plant construction by a long shot. The type of power that the utility industry and the broader utility sectors are building now is largely renewables with just a little bit of gas.

So…you have a White House that’s actively blocking new offshore wind projects, onshore wind projects, they’ve been making things harder for developers building solar on public lands. There’s a whole slew of actions that are happening, reducing the biggest source of new power plant construction.

The type of power that the utility industry and the broader utility sectors are building now is largely renewables with just a little bit of gas.

At the same time the demand for electricity is going up and up, and that’s [due to] AI data centers, but also there has been a reshoring of manufacturing and those factories use a lot of energy, and people are buying electric cars, and they need more electricity.

So there’s all these very strong trends pushing the demand side way up and much faster than it’s grown in decades at the same time that we’re seeing this contracting of power supply that could have been built, if the government was not choosing to intervene and stop it.

Reid Frazier: Walk me through what some of the actions the administration has taken that are blocking advancement of more renewable energy?

Julian Spector: The most recent really big news came in December, like right before Christmas. The federal government halted offshore wind projects that were already fully permitted. [Editor’s note: Since this interview was recorded, federal judges have issued temporary orders reinstating some of these projects.]

There were five of them under construction off the Atlantic coast. This really was concerning for the industry, because these projects had gone through these arduous, years’ long processes to get the federal permits and the companies behind them have staked billions of dollars collectively building these huge offshore projects, and mobilizing the type of ships you need, and refurbishing ports to be able to supply them. So to have those sort of suddenly halted mid-construction based on some sort of vague assertion of national security risks. That’s been a big concern for the industry most recently.

But there are other [actions]. There’s been an effort at the Department of the Interior to not allow new solar and wind projects on federal lands unless they get a personal sign-off from the Secretary Doug Burgum. That has not produced many permissions this past year — only one [project] has gotten new permission to build on federal lands.

There used to be federal tax credits for building wind and solar projects that were set up during the Biden administration in the Inflation Reduction Act, and in the budget bill that the Republican majority in Congress passed last summer, they greatly shortened the number of years that those tax credits exist, specifically for wind and soil. There are [tax credits that are] still going for nuclear and geothermal and batteries, but there’s a specific effort to reduce the credits for wind and solar.

Reid Frazier: So what effect have all these cancellations meant on the electricity sector? Are people tracking how much renewable energy is now not going to be built?

Julian Spector: It’s a little tricky because a lot of clean energy did get built last year despite all this. So that was actually a record year for solar construction [and] battery construction. But those projects were in the works for several years leading up to 2025. So the concern here would really be about a few years out that the projects that we’re expecting to come online suddenly aren’t [going to be] there anymore.

Reid Frazier: Besides the strain on the growth of the electric supply, what’s happening on the demand side? Why is there so much demand for electricity right now?

Julian Spector: It’s probably the most dynamic time in the electricity sector in decades. For the last few decades, the demand growth has been pretty much flat. And that’s thanks to things like efficiency and LED light bulbs. We’re getting more [efficiency] out of our appliances. So we just didn’t need to grow the grid very much.

Now that’s changing. The AI revolution is a huge part of that. It hasn’t really materialized in a huge way just yet, but the literally hundreds of billions of dollars going into building out AI data centers across the country, they’re all gonna be just gobbling up power. That’s how they operate. They’re basically just huge rooms full of computers. They use electricity to run the algorithms that you’re either training the AI or using AI to do tasks for people. There’s some water usage as well in there, but really the key input is electricity to run those systems.

Reid Frazier: And to cool off equipment and things like that?

Julian Spector: Yeah. And a lot of the leaders in the AI industry have talked a lot about this, that access to electricity is a key barrier for them. Because the way the planning works is if the AI company wants to build somewhere, they have to talk to the utility and if the utility runs their study and just doesn’t think they have enough power, you can’t build that data center until you figure that out.

So the AI companies are seeing this as a barrier that might delay a project they want by several years if you’re waiting for the utility to build more wires, or build more power plants. That’s forcing [companies] to get creative too, because there’s a lot of companies trying to figure out ways to build their own energy infrastructure along with their data center so they don’t have to wait for that power.

Reid Frazier: And in your reporting, did you encounter any bright spots where we could see some solutions emerge? For instance, are some of these companies coming up with different ways to meet their own electricity needs?

Julian Spector: Last fall, I covered a project up in the Pacific Northwest where a data center company is actually paying for a new grid battery that the utility will build and then own. This is going to cover the key hours of peak demand that the grid wouldn’t have been able to supply.

The data center company gets to build potentially years earlier than if they’d for the kind of regular grid upgrades. All the people living in this area get to benefit from this grid infrastructure that they didn’t have to pay for, because the data center company paid for it. So far I’ve only heard of that one example of this that’s kind of publicly out in the open now, but from my conversations with sources, a lot of other folks are looking at that model.

So you could imagine a world where the data center companies that have billions of dollars to spend are in fact helping build clean and efficient grid infrastructure.

So you could imagine a world where the data center companies that have billions of dollars to spend are in fact helping build clean and efficient grid infrastructure that everyone can benefit from, as opposed to a world where the cost of new gas power plants are subsidized across all the regular customers who happen to live in that area, even though they’re primarily benefiting some data center that may or may not get built.

Reid Frazier: What has the Trump administration said about this issue, this rising electricity costs in the U.S.?

Julian Spector: They have acknowledged it. They tend to assert it’s a hangover from Biden-era policies that were pro-clean energy. I think there is some realization that affordability is going to be a big issue in the election, just as it was last fall in the Virginia governor’s race and New Jersey governor’s race.

[Spector’s article reported: “A Department of Energy spokesperson did not respond to questions about what the administration is doing about the declared energy crisis.”]

That said, I think there’s there’s seems to be some disconnect where if you’re recognizing that there’s a need for more electricity, the efforts to block [renewable] power plants like the huge offshore wind [project] for Virginia, specifically, where so much AI activity is happening, it’s hard to square those actions with the stated goal of winning the AI race.

Earlier Friday, Carney and Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged to improve relations between their two nations after years of acrimony.
“These three things we didn’t have,” said Jacob Cooke, the CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, which helps exporters navigate the Chinese market.
Collectively, the import taxes effectively closed the Chinese market to Canadian canola, an industry group has said.
“For the exchange of a small piece of the Canadian market, we have a commitment.","BEIJING (AP) — Breaking with the United States, Canada has agreed to cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Friday.

Carney made the announcement after two days of meetings with Chinese leaders. He said there would be an initial annual cap of 49,000 vehicles on Chinese EV exports coming into Canada at a tariff rate of 6.1%, growing to about 70,000 over five years. China will reduce its total tariff on canola seeds, a major Canadian export, from 84% to about 15%, he told reporters.

“Our relationship has progressed in recent months with China. It is more predictable and you see results coming from that,” Carney said.

Carney hasn't been able to reach a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump to reduce some tariffs that are punishing some key sectors of the Canadian economy and Trump has previously talked about making Canada the 51st state.

Earlier Friday, Carney and Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged to improve relations between their two nations after years of acrimony.

Xi told Carney in a meeting at the Great Hall of the People that he is willing to continue working to improve ties, noting that talks have been underway on restoring and restarting cooperation since the two held an initial meeting in October on the sidelines of a regional economic conference in South Korea.

Carney said that ""this agreement will drive considerable Chinese investment in Canada’s auto sector, creating good careers in Canada and accelerating our progress towards a net zero (emissions) future and the auto industry of the future.''

Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Toronto, called Friday's deal good for both China and Canada. “Canada is diversifying its bets economically,"" Wiseman said. ""And China is succeeding in driving a small wedge between Canada and the U.S.''

Improve global governance

Carney, the first Canadian prime minister to visit China in eight years, told Xi that better relations would help improve a global governance system that he described as “under great strain.”

Later, he said at the news conference that the system may give way at least in part to country-to-country or regional agreements rather than the global ones that have underpinned economic growth in the post-World War II era.

“The question is: What gets built in that place? How much of a patchwork is it?” he said.

The new reality reflects in large part the so-called America-first approach of Trump. The tariffs he has imposed have hit both the Canadian and Chinese economies. Carney, who has met with several leading Chinese companies in Beijing, said ahead of his trip that his government is focused on building an economy less reliant on the U.S. at what he called “a time of global trade disruption.”

A Canadian business owner in China called Carney's visit game-changing, saying it re-establishes dialogue, respect and a framework between the two nations.

“These three things we didn’t have,” said Jacob Cooke, the CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, which helps exporters navigate the Chinese market. “The parties were not talking for years.”

Canada had been aligned with US on tariffs

Canada had followed the U.S. in putting tariffs of 100% on EVs from China and 25% on steel and aluminum under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Carney’s predecessor.

China responded by imposing duties of 100% on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25% on pork and seafood. It added a 75.8% tariff on canola seeds last August. Collectively, the import taxes effectively closed the Chinese market to Canadian canola, an industry group has said. Overall, China's imports from Canada fell 10.4% last year to $41.7 billion, according to Chinese trade data.

Carney tried to address the concerns of Canadian automakers and auto workers by saying the initial cap on Chinese EV imports was about 3% of the 1.8 million vehicles sold in Canada annually and that, in exchange, China is expected to begin investing in the Canadian auto industry within three years.

“We’re building (a) new part of our car industry, building cars of the future in partnership, bringing affordable autos for Canadians at a time when affordability is top of mind, and doing it at a scale that allows for a smooth transition in the sector,” he said.

“For the exchange of a small piece of the Canadian market, we have a commitment. We are waiting for an investment commitment in Canada. The real leaders of the new industry. So it’s an agreement that will create the future for our industry.”

But Ontario Premier Doug Ford, the leader of Canada's most populous province where the country's auto sector is based, blasted the deal.

""Make no mistake: China now has a foothold in the Canadian market and will use it to their full advantage at the expense of Canadian workers,"" Ford posted on social media.

“Worse, by lowering tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles this lopsided deal risks closing the door on Canadian automakers to the American market, our largest export destination.”

China sees an opening under Trump

China is hoping Trump’s pressure tactics on allies such as Canada will drive them to pursue a foreign policy that is less aligned with the United States. The U.S. president has suggested Canada could become America's 51st state.

Carney, though, noted Canada's relationship with the U.S. is much more multifaceted, deeper and broader. Canada and China have different systems and disagree on issues such as human rights, he said, limiting the scope of their engagement even as they seek ways to cooperate on areas of common interest.

The Canadian leader leaves China on Saturday and visits Qatar on Sunday before attending the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum in Switzerland next week. He will meet business leaders and investors in Qatar to promote trade and investment, his office said.

The Columbia Wind project would be a 277-megawatt wind farm with more than 40 wind turbines.
Alliant estimates the Columbia Wind project will generate more than $100 million in tax revenue for Columbia County.
Environmental groups have been critical of natural gas infrastructure because natural gas contributes to climate change and has been linked to negative health effects.
“Alliant Energy is doing the right thing by looking at wind and understanding how important it is to invest in that clean wind energy,” Barrilleaux said.","Alliant Energy hopes to build a new roughly $730 million wind farm in Columbia County that will provide enough electricity to power about 100,000 homes annually.

The utility, through a limited liability company, filed an application with the Public Service Commission to build the project in late December. Alliant also plans to seek commission approval to acquire the project from the LLC and construct the facility.

The Columbia Wind project would be a 277-megawatt wind farm with more than 40 wind turbines. More than 300 landowners have signed lease agreements for the project.

According to the utility, the project has been in development for nearly five years.

Justin Foss, the Columbia Wind project manager and manager of resource development for Alliant Energy, said the project will use “the next generation of wind turbines,” which are taller and larger.

If a project of this scale were built a decade ago, he said it would require two or three times as many turbines.

“A project like this, because it has these larger wind turbines that are able to grab more wind, is much more spread out,” he said. “When you look around the countryside, instead of seeing just a dense forest of wind turbines, you’ll see one (or) two in an area (that’s) much more spread out.”

While the project has a more than $700 million price tag, Foss said the wind farm still represents a “huge savings” for customers because the utility won’t have to pay volatile fuel costs for the power it produces.

“We expect that savings to be upwards of $463 million over the next 35 years,” he said.

Alliant estimates the Columbia Wind project will generate more than $100 million in tax revenue for Columbia County.

Meanwhile, Foss said the lease payments will help rural land owners “diversify their income streams.” Alliant also anticipates the project will generate 100 to 150 construction jobs. Foss says those will likely be union jobs.

But the project has already faced some community pushback. Last August, residents in the town of Columbus expressed concerns about the project related to health, safety and local control.

Foss said Alliant has since worked to educate the public about the project and receive feedback through community presentations.

“We’ve heard from several other townships that are asking now for additional presentations, and we’re working to make sure that we reach out to them and make ourselves available to answer all of their questions,” he said. “We’ve presented at some of the townships. Part of what we work through is, it’s a change, and we recognize that sometimes change comes with uncertainty.”

Amy Barrilleaux, a spokesperson for the nonprofit Clean Wisconsin, welcomed the project, calling wind and solar the “two cheapest ways to produce energy in this state.”

“You’re not paying to truck in coal or to pipe in liquefied natural gas,” she said. “You’re not dealing with the dangers of that. You pretty much have a free energy source there turning those turbines.”

But Alliant does have plans to invest in natural gas. In 2024, the utility announced that it hoped to convert its coal-burning power plant in Sheboygan County into a natural gas plant in 2028.

And last year, Alliant filed an application with the Public Service Commission to build a liquified natural gas storage facility near its gas-fired Riverside Energy Center in Rock County.

Environmental groups have been critical of natural gas infrastructure because natural gas contributes to climate change and has been linked to negative health effects.

“Alliant Energy is doing the right thing by looking at wind and understanding how important it is to invest in that clean wind energy,” Barrilleaux said. “But (it) cannot continue to also invest in fuels of the past that are actively hurting people and are more expensive.”

Foss said making sure the utility continues to provide reliable electricity so customers have energy when they need it is its number one job.

“We know that we can’t power Wisconsin with one single resource, or one single type of resource that really exposes everyone to risk if something were to happen,” he said. “We believe in a diverse energy mix.”

Alliant hopes to receive a decision from the Public Service Commission early next year and to bring the wind farm into service by the end of 2028.",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/aerial_wis_farmland18_0638.jpeg,N,,2026-01-16 12:01:19.553693

The Buffalo River Watershed Alliance and 42 other environmental organizations (collectively, “BRWA”) submitted a Petition to the United States Department of Agriculture Rural Business-Cooperative Service (“RBCS”) styled:

PETITION FOR RULEMAKING TO DEEM MANURE DIGESTERS INELIGIBLE FOR FUNDS UNDER THE RURAL ENERGY FOR AMERICA PROGRAM (“Petition”).

BRWA argues that RBCS should issue a rule deeming manure digesters ineligible for Rural Energy for America Program (“REAP”) grants and loan guarantees.

BRWA argues that:

… Even if manure digesters fit within the definition of renewable energy systems ordinarily eligible for funding under REAP, RBCS has the authority to decline to fund them because they directly undermine Congress’s intent that REAP “promote rural economic development” while “provid[ing] environmental and public health benefits such as cleaner air and water.”

The organizations further argue that Congress’s intent is undermined because they failed to provide many of the benefits that RBCS considers when awarding REAP funding.

Anaerobic digestion is a process through which bacteria break down organic matter – such as animal manure, wastewater biosolids, and food waste. This occurs in the absence of oxygen.

Anaerobic digestion for biogas production takes place in a sealed vessel called a reactor, which is designed and constructed in various shapes and sizes specific to the site and feedstock conditions. These reactors contain complex microbial communities that break down or digest the waste and produce resultant biogas and digestate (the solid and liquid material end-products of the BD process) which is discharged from the digester.

Anaerobic digestion can produce two valuable outputs:

Biogas.

Digestate.

Energy and biogas can be used like natural gas to provide heat, generate electricity, and power cooling systems. Further, it can be purified by removing the inner or low-value constituents to generate renewable natural gas.

The digestate is the residual material left after the digestion process. With appropriate treatment, both the solid and liquid portions of digestate can be used in beneficial applications such as animal bedding, nutrient-rich fertilizer, foundation material for bio-based products, and/or as soil amendment.

BRWA’s Petition argues:

Digesters contribute to the loss of small farms in rural communities.

Cause water and air pollution that harms human health.

Fail to provide many of the benefits that RBCS must identify and consider when awarding REAP funding.

RBCS gives preference to projects that seek a grant of $250,000 or less, yet the manure digesters that received grants from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2025 required an average of $855,701, over three times more than RBCS’s preferred maximum.

Studies show that manure digesters typically are unlikely to recoup their high costs.

Manure digesters that received loan guarantees from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2025 generate an average of 4.5 times less energy per public dollar than solar projects.

Manure digesters offer only uncertain and incomplete GHG emissions reductions at major cost to taxpayers.

Making manure digesters ineligible for REAP will free up funds for projects that satisfy REAP’s purposes by benefitting small farms, rural communities, the environment, and taxpayers.

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) on January 9 notified that it is cancelling cooperative agreements and over $300 million in funding for solar energy installations for thousands of low-income households, including a community solar project led by Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), Foundation for a Better Puerto Rico and Mujeres de Islas, in the island municipality of Culebra, Puerto Rico. The organizations regret the DOE’s decision, as it will prevent more than 100 families in Culebra and thousands throughout Puerto Rico from receiving clean, affordable, and reliable electricity via solar and battery storage systems.

“The government’s decision to cancel this project is baffling, and fundamentally at odds with its own stated goals on energy security, abundance, independence and affordability,” said Daniel Whittle, Associate Vice President, Resilient Caribbean at Environmental Defense Fund. “Our project is designed to achieve all those goals, and simply put, would make people’s lives better. Canceling it will inevitably make lives worse by denying a proven, life-saving clean energy solution to a community that has already endured deadly, prolonged power outages.”

Culebra, located northeast of Puerto Rico, is often the first island, together with Vieques, to be hit by hurricanes and the last to receive assistance. The installation of rooftop solar systems and battery storage on family homes is a proven solution that significantly improves the quality of life in Culebra's communities, especially during hurricane season.

“As a last-mile community and the last ones to get power after Hurricane Maria, the cancellation of this wonderful program makes you wonder: How could it not be consistent with the current administration’s goals?” questioned Theresa Bischoff, President of the Foundation for a Better Puerto Rico.

Since 2022, 45 families in Culebra have had solar systems installed on their roofs as part of EDF's first residential solar pilot project in the island municipality. These families can preserve their food, operate essential appliances, and keep medical equipment and medications refrigerated thanks to the solar energy these systems provide during power outages, which are increasingly common in Puerto Rico.

“We are outraged by this decision and demand social justice for our community of Culebra now,” said Dulce del Rio-Pineda, Founder and Organizational Coordinator, Mujeres de Islas.

EDF seeks to identify effective and fair energy solutions that can bring clean, affordable, and reliable electricity to Puerto Rico's communities and meet the daily needs of their families, making the island more resilient to climate change. EDF’s team in Puerto Rico, together with partner organizations, remains committed to supporting the community in Culebra in its goal to achieve energy security and independence, and, in the wake of this regrettable decision, will explore all options for helping it do so.

House Appropriations Committee Releases Funding Bill Covering International Climate Financing

The FY26 National Security, Department of State, and Related Programs (NSRP) bill includes continued, but substantially reduced, investments in climate and environmental programs. There is $131.8 million for sustainable landscapes to protect forests and marine resources, $125 million for renewable energy through the Clean Technology Fund, and $192 million for climate adaptation and disaster preparedness in high-risk regions. Despite significant reductions, the bill preserves key international climate and conservation funding that the administration had proposed eliminating, without imposing new anti-climate policy restrictions. The House passed the package 341-79 on January 14, and it’s making its way to the Senate.

Minibus Largely Spares EPA Funding but Cuts Deeper into Interior

House and Senate appropriators unveiled another fiscal 2026 spending package to fund the Interior Department and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Compared with earlier Republican proposals, the measure largely preserves EPA funding, while imposing modest additional cuts at Interior. EPA would receive $8.816 billion, about 4 percent below its 2025 level, but more than double the administration’s proposed budget.

This package shields funding for several programs. For example, financing for geographic restoration initiatives would rise to $690 million, reversing major proposed cuts. State and tribal assistance grants will similarly see increased funding of up to $4.41 billion, including support for region-specific environmental and infrastructure projects.

Unfortunately, lawmakers did accept sharp cuts to the Superfund program, which pays for the cleanup of hazardous waste sites across the country. Thankfully, we expect reinstated excise taxes on major polluters to offset the cut by imposing fees on sales of polluting substances. The bill also directs EPA to maintain federal oversight of the Energy Star program rather than privatizing it.

Interior would receive $14.54 billion, slightly less than the $14.8 billion in 2025, but well above the administration’s request. The bill still trims funding for land management, parks, science programs, and renewable energy development, while increasing support for oil and gas activities.

News and Updates

Oil Company Receives Record Fine for 2023 Louisiana Oil Spill

On January 5, federal pipeline regulators imposed a record civil penalty on Panther Operating Co. over safety problems that led to a massive 2023 oil spill off the Louisiana coast. Panther Operating Co. runs over a thousand miles of crude oil and gas pipelines through onshore and offshore areas in the Gulf of Mexico. The spill released roughly 1.1 million gallons of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico.

The Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) is seeking $9.6 million, the largest fine ever proposed under federal pipeline safety enforcement. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the action underscores the administration’s intent to pursue serious penalties when operators fail to meet regulatory standards.

U.S. Withdraws from Landmark Climate Change Treaty

President Donald Trump announced that the United States will withdraw from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the main global agreement guiding international efforts to address climate change. The decision would make the U.S. the only country to ever leave the treaty.

The UNFCCC, adopted in 1992, is the foundation for international climate talks, including the Paris Agreement. The U.S. withdrawal will become official one year after notice is submitted to the United Nations.

The move is part of a broader withdrawal from dozens of international organizations the White House claims promote policies that conflict with U.S. sovereignty and economic priorities. Trump officials have argued that global climate agreements place unfair limits on the U.S. while offering little benefit in return.

Despite the instability, Buttigieg expressed confidence that the American market still has an opportunity to set the pace for global mobility innovation.

“We don’t need nostalgia about the auto industry because we are living in the most transformational moment for transportation since the combustion engine was developed,” Buttigieg said.

While adoption of EVs has been hesitant, he shared that their mere existence represents a permanent technological shift; policymakers cannot “put the toothpaste back in the tube.” This poses the question: Is the U.S. able to lead that shift or watch global competitors define it?

Buttigieg also added that America must approach the transition with equal seriousness if it intends to “own the 21st Century just as much as we did the 20th century,” but it won’t happen on its own.

Thinking about what the future would look like, he noted that the public will notice vast differences in land-use patterns, vehicle designs, and even ownership compared to the past. During his time as secretary, he noted that federal regulations still dictate mirror placement — even in driverless vehicles — reflecting outdated assumptions and can pose risks to both the nation’s safety and competitiveness.

“A lot of the people making decisions about technology in our country, I fear, do not understand the technologies that they are regulating or proposing to make decisions about,” he warned. “People expect from their leaders a level of literacy around these technologies that are going to shape so much about our day-to-day lives, not to mention our economy.”

Reflecting on his service in the U.S. Navy, where he drove officers and equipment along dangerous routes in Afghanistan, he said the most important lesson he learned was the role of trust. No one cared about politics or personal background; they cared about competence and preparedness. Trust, he said, is the operating system of society and innovation. Whether deploying autonomous vehicles, modernizing infrastructure, or integrating AI into daily life, trust is the invisible infrastructure that makes progress possible and innovation is cultivated.

“Nothing works without trust, even the most basic things,” he said. “If that sounds like an extreme or exotic consideration, consider the fact that every time you’re at a green or a red light, you are trusting. You’re making a life-or-death decision to trust your personal survival to a whole bunch of people that you’ve never met, because your survival depends on whether everybody follows the same convention of the stoplight.”",https://michauto.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ButtigiegArticle.png,N,,2026-01-16 10:01:07.575447

Previously, the San Francisco native studied mechanical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, where she earned her bachelor’s degree, and at Santa Clara University, where she earned her master’s. After working at a variety of semiconductor and power control companies in California, designing mechanical components, she decided to move to Alaska amid a whirlwind of global and personal events, including the dot-com bubble burst and bad relationships.

After driving to Alaska in her old Subaru with her two rabbits in tow, Dr. Huang bought a dry cabin, but she immediately discovered the challenges of living in such a northern state. “I very quickly learned that shoveling the driveway is a lot of work, and staying warm is a lot of work,” she said while giving a presentation ten years ago. In Silicon Valley, she did not have to think about where her power came from, and any outages were resolved in under an hour. In Alaska, she faced high energy bills amid skyrocketing oil prices and the need to keep herself and her two newly adopted retired sled dogs warm. Others in the state suffered from hunger and even died from extreme temperatures.

Dr. Huang switched to burning wood to save money. When she began working as a research engineer at the university’s Alaska Center for Energy and Power (ACEP), she found that “wood heat, as it benefitted me, also benefitted communities.” One of her first jobs there was to conduct a community survey of Alaska Energy Authority grantees that used funding to deploy biomass systems. She reflected that discovering that they had built local economies around the energy source “made me think that maybe not all solutions are what you think they’ll be… It turns out the solutions are not always the flashy, high-tech ones.” Beyond saving money, these communities used the savings to relaunch preschool programs that had previously shuttered due to lack of funding, used excess biomass energy to heat greenhouses and grow fresh vegetables, and learned to insulate future buildings more effectively.

These learnings fueled Dr. Huang’s passion for promoting energy efficiency and clean energy sources. At ACEP, she continues to research methods for reducing energy costs for isolated Alaskan power grids. One project found that adding an ElectraTherm organic Rankine cycle (ORC) product called the Green Machine to village generators in Alaska could help them reclaim heat that would otherwise be lost by operating at less than full capacity during off-peak hours. A follow-up 2015 technical paper summarized guidelines for effectively deploying such a system. In 2019, Dr. Huang worked on a journal article that introduced the MicroFEWs approach to help Alaskan communities evaluate renewable energy decisions that promote food, energy, and water (FEW) security, asserting that energy is inherently connected to adequate food and water supplies in the Arctic and Subarctic. For example, the study claims that the addition of a third hydroelectric turbine at the Power Creek generation facility in the fishing community of Cordova would “cover most of the energy demand from the seafood processing plants.”

Much of Dr. Huang’s work has focused on how the adoption of renewables in Alaskan communities can save money and benefit local communities. “Rural communities in Alaska face the highest energy costs in the nation,” Dr. Huang and her fellow authors wrote in a 2022 journal article, noting that diesel and heating fuel have to be delivered via plane or boat. In 2016, she worked on a report that specified the best renewable energy sources for Peter Ballantyne Cree Nation communities, which lack natural gas and therefore face even higher business and household costs. The authors recommended biomass heating, solar PV, and water-source heat pumps. “Through investing in and incorporating more locally sourced renewable energy,” the report explains, “PBCN is ultimately aiming to increase energy self-reliance, provide new opportunities for local jobs and economic development, and combat climate change.”

Over the past several years, some of Dr. Huang’s projects have received government funding. In 2023, the National Science Foundation awarded ACEP $6 million for a five-year project, called “STORM: Data-Driven Approaches for Secure Electric Grids in Communities Disproportionately Impacted by Climate Change,” to advance the country’s smart grid. As principal investigator, Dr. Huang is working with communities such as Cordova, Galena, and Kotzebue to design microgrid and clean energy projects, which will involve “sustained community engagement toward productive research and workforce development,” she said.

It is not the first time that Dr. Huang has emphasized the importance of workforce development, as she previously told the Daily Yonder that she is interested in building STEM programs, “The idea is looking from a community perspective – what their energy needs are, and how we can translate that – in parallel – developing educational programs around kids learning about energy systems, [like] engineering or STEM in general, math, physics.” In past years, she has attended STEM Night at Pearl Creek Elementary in Fairbanks and given lectures and facility tours for ACEP interns, demonstrating her commitment to the area’s youth and her community’s energy future. Her dedication to ever-expanding knowledge has been evident since her California days, when she spent time after learning astronomy at Foothill College for fun, taught by a physicist at the Stanford Solar Center. “Kickass!” she exclaimed on LinkedIn.",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DaisyHuang_JR_Ancheta-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 13:00:08.312474

Look at Texas, which, despite being the nation’s largest oil producer, has embraced clean energy.
“It is, I think, appropriate to call what the Trump administration is doing around its attacks on renewables a real and true scandal,” McNamara said.
Ember also reported in October that worldwide, wind and solar are meeting or even exceeding the additional requirement for juice.
The Trump administration can slow that change, but it can’t stop it.","A year ago, Donald Trump assumed the presidency for a second time and immediately got to work dismantling the climate progress that Joe Biden’s administration had made. Among other sweeping efforts, the White House boosted fossil fuels over renewables, tried to stop states from reducing emissions and adapting to climate change, and paused wind projects despite rising demand for electricity. Later, in July, the administration succeeded in gutting the clean-tech incentives provided by the Inflation Reduction Act, which among other things were meant to expand wind and solar. That landmark legislation was the most ambitious climate action the United States had ever taken.

Experts say the administration’s moves have done real damage to the nation’s ability to fight climate change. But they also stress that strong countervailing forces — including falling prices for renewables, surging demand for electricity, and aggressive campaigns by states and cities to slash emissions — continue to drive the transition to clean energy. The result is a growing tension between federal policy and market reality, one that is likely to define U.S. climate and energy outcomes for years to come.

“A lot of this will have mounting consequences in the time ahead,” said Julie McNamara, an associate policy director with the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “I still fundamentally believe that renewables will continue to be the thing that utilities across the country will be turning to, because they just make sense. But the administration is making that decision harder than it should be, costlier than it should be, and slower than it should be.”

Going green now makes better economic sense than fossil fuels. Look at Texas, which, despite being the nation’s largest oil producer, has embraced clean energy. Its many wind and solar operations generate far more renewable electricity than any other state — nearly double that of the next highest, California — because it’s a cheaper and more reliable way of juicing the grid. Indeed, over the past decade, the price of onshore wind has fallen 70 percent, solar panels by 90 percent, and batteries — essential for storing energy when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining — by even more than that. Trump has a famous disdain for wind in particular and successfully paused five offshore projects last year, but this week, federal judges ordered projects off Rhode Island and New York to restart. “It is, I think, appropriate to call what the Trump administration is doing around its attacks on renewables a real and true scandal,” McNamara said. “It is coordinated, it is across agencies, and it is actively discriminating against wind and solar.”

Still, market forces are a major factor in driving states to decarbonize, despite federal policy roadblocks. California, for instance, added nearly 70 percent more battery storage in 2024 than the year before, and generated 4.4 percent more renewable electricity over the same period. “The fact that renewables tend to be more cost-effective solutions is something that’s really going to hopefully promote their development moving forward, as we’re looking to add more and more capacity,” said Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at Project Drawdown, which recently launched a platform that tracks the effectiveness of climate-friendly interventions like heat pumps, e-bikes, and renewable energy. “Something that’s very frustrating is that the current administration is actively working against that by canceling new wind and solar projects, by actively promoting the expansion of fossil fuels.”

The country’s growing electricity needs are further incentivizing the rollout of renewables. The growth of data centers in particular is straining the grid, and without sufficient clean energy, utilities are relying on fossil fuels to meet the demand. The Department of Energy also has issued emergency orders delaying the retirement of coal-fired power plants, at an enormous cost to ratepayers. According to a new report, the country’s greenhouse gas emissions rose by 2.4 percent in 2025. The authors, though, attribute that more to the proliferation of data centers, plus colder temperatures requiring more heating, than to the Trump administration’s fossil-fuel boosterism. But they expect that those policies will increase future emissions.

As demand for electricity grows, renewables are meeting much of the challenge. According to a report released Thursday by the energy think tank Ember, solar power generation in the U.S. grew 27 percent in 2025, meeting 61 percent of that rise in consumption. In some places, that figure was much higher: In Florida, the growth of solar exceeded the growth of demand by a wide margin, and across the Southwest, Northwest, Southeast, and in California, photovoltaics met about all of the increase.

Ember also reported in October that worldwide, wind and solar are meeting or even exceeding the additional requirement for juice. “We’ve hit these economic tipping points where solar is just simply the cheapest new form of generating more electricity,” said Nicolas Fulghum, a senior data analyst at Ember. “The age-old question for power system experts is always: When is solar growth kind of slowing down? And every year, the assumption is this is the year that it happens, and then it never happens.”

Beneath these larger market forces runs a steady current of smaller — yet highly impactful — climate campaigns. Even as the IRA’s clean-energy credits evaporate, for instance, states continue providing their own incentives. Maine, for example, is going all-in on electric heat pumps, which move warmth from even frigid outdoor air into a home. In 2023, the state blew past its goal of installing 100,000 devices two years ahead of schedule, and plans another 175,000 by 2027. As federal incentives go away, Maine is providing up to $9,000 for its residents to install heat pumps.

States, cities, and industries are doing so many things to fight climate change, and adapt to what’s coming, that the federal government simply can’t counter them all, experts say. Communities are planting gardens to lower urban temperatures and increase food security. Startups are growing animal products in bioreactors to slash the high emissions from the meat industry. Positive tipping points are creating runaway change to, for example, accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles. And utilities are starting to use those EVs as a vast network of backup power, thus helping meet all that extra demand on the grid.

Ultimately, the states and cities that don’t commit to the clean transition risk getting left behind, experts say. The Trump administration can slow that change, but it can’t stop it. “We have seen numerous states step up across the country and reiterate that they are still committed to that long-term view,” McNamara said. “It is undeniable that a competitive economy is a clean economy going forward.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2198226868.jpeg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2026-01-16 13:00:12.543014

Expanding Access to Rural Health Care in Western North Carolina

Rural communities across Western North Carolina face unique health care challenges, from hospital closures and workforce shortages to traveling long distances for care. To help address these issues, I voted to establish the Rural Health Transformation Fund as part of the Working Families Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Through this initiative, North Carolina will receive $213,008,356 to expand access to quality health care in rural areas. This funding will strengthen local hospitals, support rural clinics and providers, and improve care coordination so families can receive reliable medical services closer to home.

Investing in rural health care infrastructure and workforce support helps ensure families across our mountains can continue accessing the care they need without leaving their communities to get it.

Delivering Housing for Our Veterans

The Asheville Veterans Restoration Quarters (VRQ) provides critical housing and support for homeless veterans across Western North Carolina. After Hurricane Helene destroyed their facility, my office worked closely with VRQ to navigate the FEMA process, successfully securing $1.6 million in assistance, covering 94 percent of rebuilding costs.

Once rebuilt, the renovated VRQ will provide 158 beds, and the adjacent Quality Inn will be converted into 120 apartments, creating housing and services for an estimated 350 homeless veterans in our region. We urge the City of Asheville to provide lenient and expedited permitting so repairs can begin as early as March so our veterans can receive timely support.

Modernizing Veteran Affairs to Serve Our Veterans Better

North Carolina is home to more than 600,000 veterans, and ensuring they receive the benefits and services they’ve earned remains one of my top priorities in Congress. Since January 2025, the backlog of veterans waiting for VA benefits has dropped by 57 percent, a direct result of improved coordination between Congress and the Department of Veterans Affairs to streamline claims and expand access.

These reforms are delivering real results for veterans across our region, speeding access to health care, disability benefits, and other essential services. By modernizing outdated systems and directing resources where they are needed most, Congress is helping ensure veterans get timely, reliable support that reflects their service and sacrifice.

Hurricane Helene Recovery by the Numbers

Recovery from Hurricane Helene continues across Western North Carolina, with significant resources deployed to help families and local industry, including:

$547.6 million approved for 160,853 households, including assistance for rent, basic home repairs, and other disaster-related needs.

$983 million obligated to the state for 1,947 Helene recovery projects, with total Public Assistance for all North Carolina disaster declarations now exceeding $1 billion.

$274.3 million disbursed by the U.S. Small Business Administration in low-interest disaster loans.

12,395 families receiving $33.8 million for repair to or replacement of private access roads and bridges.

Over 7 million cubic yards of debris cleared from public rights-of-way.

$216.7 million paid in claims by the National Flood Insurance Program.

In recognition of the extensive recovery work undertaken in 2025, the Land of Sky Regional Council honored me with the Hurricane Helene Recovery Champion Award. In the year since the storm hit, my team and I have worked relentlessly — solving hundreds of cases for families and businesses and partnering with federal and state officials — to help Western North Carolina recover and rebuild stronger. This work is far from finished, and we will not slow down until our communities have the resources they need to fully recover.

Ensuring Reliable Connectivity Across Western North Carolina

North Carolina has received final approval on our BEAD (Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment) proposal, a major step toward expanding reliable broadband access across rural communities in our mountains. Through this effort, the state has been awarded $1,532,999,481 to expand broadband infrastructure statewide. Reliable connectivity is essential for education, health care, small businesses, and public safety, and this investment will help our region gain access to the tools they need to compete, grow, and thrive.

Fighting for Responsible Public Lands Management

From the Blue Ridge Parkway to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the public lands in our mountains are the crown jewel of our region. As a member of the bipartisan U.S. House Public Lands Caucus, I work to protect America’s public lands while ensuring they remain accessible and responsibly managed. My work with the caucus is guided by a simple principle: we can protect our forests and waterways while supporting hunters, anglers, hikers, small businesses, and the rural communities that depend on them.

Deadline Extended to Apply for Single-Family Housing Assistance

Western North Carolina homeowners now have until January 31 to apply for assistance through the Renew NC Single-Family Housing Program. If your home was damaged by Hurricane Helene, you may still qualify for additional support, even if you have already received assistance from FEMA or your insurance provider.

The relationship between Cherry Street and Inman Solar goes back over a decade, CEO Michael Chanin told Hypepotamus, as the two grew and scaled in Atlanta’s renewable energy space.
The State of Solar Energy Early Cherry Street customers included municipalities and universities, schools, houses of worship, and hospital networks.
But recently, Chanin said that Cherry Street has been seeing more interest from industrial and manufacturing companies, particularly in the Southeast region.
“[Solar power] technology has existed for quite a long time.","Surging electricity demand from data centers, electric vehicles, and onshore manufacturing sites have brought big opportunities for Cherry Street, the Atlanta-based solar technology company that provides distributed power generation.

Cherry Street is primed to capitalize on those opportunities following a new acquisition of 16 operating distributed generation projects from fellow Atlanta company Inman Solar.

The acquisition, announced this week, brings an additional 12.7 megawatts of capacity across Georgia, Florida, Washington D.C., South Carolina, and Michigan under Cherry Street’s umbrella. This matters because that has the potential to power thousands of homes.

Most of the acquired projects are in the State of Georgia. Their energy and renewable attributes are sold to Georgia Power as part of the utility’s Georgia Public Service Commission approved solar programs, according to a company press release.

Financial information around the site acquisition were not disclosed, but the acquisition of the sites “present excellent opportunities for future battery storage integration, which will enhance their value to the grid and support the continued economic development across the Southeast,” Chanin added in a press statement.

The relationship between Cherry Street and Inman Solar goes back over a decade, CEO Michael Chanin told Hypepotamus, as the two grew and scaled in Atlanta’s renewable energy space. Dan Fossitt has served as Inman Solar’s President and CEO since 2009. The transaction proved mutually beneficial: Inman Solar is refocusing on its core EPC (Engineering, Procurement, Construction) services and development business, while Cherry Street expands its portfolio of long-term generating assets.

“We’re going to continue to need to expand the availability of reliable and affordable electricity, and so these solar fields are going to enable flexibility and durability in our system,” Chanin told Hypepotamus.

The State of Solar Energy

Early Cherry Street customers included municipalities and universities, schools, houses of worship, and hospital networks. The company has Emory University, the Atlanta Airport, Gulfstream, and Porsche as some of its clients. But recently, Chanin said that Cherry Street has been seeing more interest from industrial and manufacturing companies, particularly in the Southeast region.

“Historically, we would not have been able to be in a place to provide competitively priced electricity. Because of such material growth in the market, the supply and demand economics make our electricity very competitive,” Chanin said.

He added that he remains optimistic about the future of solar energy in the Southeast and its “ability to serve the communities where we are.”

“[In the Southeast] we have abundant and incredible natural resources from the sun,” he added. “[Solar power] technology has existed for quite a long time. It’s incredibly reliable and what it produces is very predictable.”

It modernizes our electric sector’s approach to this new part of the economy, creating an orderly process for connecting data centers and ensuring that data centers are flexible and clean.","Today, U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) announced his introduction of the Power for the People Act, legislation to rein in the rising electricity costs Americans are facing by addressing the huge amounts of energy required by data centers.

Amid the growing use of artificial intelligence (AI), corporations and big technology companies’ build out of data centers has exploded in the past decade and is projected to continue to rapidly increase. As more and more data centers aim to connect to the power grid, consumers are footing the bill for the infrastructure required to bring them online. Because data centers use so much power, they are also increasing energy demand which is further driving up electricity prices and placing a heavy burden on our electric grid – raising the risk of reliability issues such as blackouts. The Power to the People Act holds data center operators accountable for their role in driving up energy prices through reforms that would prevent consumers from subsidizing data center development through their utility bills. It also ensures that data centers connecting to the grid do not overwhelm it, preventing grid reliability issues that result in power outages, and ensuring that all of this work is done with strong labor standards in place, creating good-paying jobs.

Joining Senator Van Hollen as cosponsors of this legislation are Senators Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), and Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.).

“Americans are already struggling to make ends meet – they shouldn’t have to foot the bill for big corporations’ massive expansion of data centers. But right now, the richest corporations on the planet are constructing new data centers at working families’ expense – driving up monthly electricity bills for consumers. The principle behind this legislation is simple: the huge corporations building and running data centers should cover the costs of the energy they need – not push those costs onto the backs of consumers,” said Senator Van Hollen.

In the mid-Atlantic grid region (PJM), the nation’s largest electric grid serving 67 million Americans in 13 states – including Maryland – and Washington, D.C., because of data centers, consumers have paid or will pay:

As least $4.6 billion in 2024 and $3.1 billion in 2025 for local transmission upgrades, or $7.7 billion total for local transmission upgrades over two years according to Union of Concerned Scientists.

Over $21 billion in capacity costs in the last three capacity auctions (July 2024, July 2025, and December 2025) alone (which are the costs to secure available energy supply for future years) due to projected data center demand. These costs were to secure supply for the period of June 2025 - May 2028, according to PJM’s Independent Market Monitor.

By 2028, the average household in PJM will see their energy bills increase by $70 per month because of data centers – that’s $840 per year – and that’s just due to rising capacity costs (not even taking into account all the other factors impacting energy bills like the price of wholesale energy and transmission costs). Capacity costs alone could balloon to $163 billion through 2033 if no action is taken to address the imbalance of supply and demand in PJM’s capacity market, according to NRDC.

The Power for the People Act is supported by: The Consumer Federation of America, National Consumer Law Center, Public Citizen, Maryland People’s Counsel, Illinois Citizens Utility Board, New Jersey Division of the Rate Counsel, Oregon Citizens Utility Board, Delaware Division of the Public Advocate, NRDC, and Union of Concerned Scientists.

Additional background on the Power for the People Act

Data centers are huge energy consumers. In 2024, the average size of a proposed data center in the US was 300 megawatts, which is as much energy as it takes to power around 240,000 homes. There are currently over 3,700 data centers in the U.S. with new facilities being proposed every day. Although they are not the only factor causing electricity prices to rise, it is clear that new data center energy demand is having a significant and growing impact on Americans’ utility bills.

The enormous energy needs of data centers push costs for consumers higher in two ways: 1) they increase overall electricity demand, outpacing available electricity supply – resulting in higher utility bills across the grid and windfall profits for power generators; and 2) they require expansions of the electric grid and the cost of these infrastructure upgrades are passed onto all electricity customers – not just the new data centers.

What’s more, the rapid influx of data center energy demand combined with power supply constraints is pushing electric grids across the country dangerously close to their limits, which increases the risk of blackouts.

To address these affordability and reliability issues, the Power for the People Act:

Ensures data centers are paying for the energy costs they cause by:

Directing states to evaluate the need for new rate classes specifically for data centers to more effectively assign costs caused by that customer class, while providing technical support to states to support this process.

Directing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to issue a rule to ensure data centers are paying for the local transmission upgrades that would not be needed if the new data center did not exist – increasing accountability in local transmission projects which often lack oversight.

Creates a system to manage data center interconnection to the grid that would protect affordability and grid reliability by incentivizing data centers to:

Offset their impact on the electric grid by bringing their own new and additional power generation and battery storage systems to the grid, as well as by agreeing to certain flexibility requirements.

Mitigate pollution by using clean energy resources.

Create good paying jobs with strong labor standards by paying locally prevailing wage, and using registered apprenticeship programs.

Provides resources to improve data center load forecasting, including weeding out duplicative or speculative requests, as accurate data center energy demand projections are key to ensuring proper investment in the grid and preventing overly inflated energy bills.

The text of the Power for the People Act is available here.

“As data centers continue to grow and burden our electrical grids, consumers are forced to bankroll skyrocketing electricity costs, leaving them with soaring utility prices. This bill represents an important opportunity to hold data centers accountable for increased energy prices,” said Senator Blumenthal.

“For the United States to lead responsibly in AI, the benefits must be broadly shared, and the costs—especially higher electricity prices—must not be shifted onto working families in places like New Jersey that are seeing spiking utility bills,” said Senator Booker. “The Power for the People Act is about fairness and shared progress: it ensures data centers pay for the costs of their own development, prioritizes the clean energy critical to protecting our public health, protects consumers from rising electricity bills, strengthens grid reliability, and keeps America at the cutting edge of innovation.”

“The American people are already struggling to keep up with the rising costs of groceries, housing, health care and more—the last thing they need is to foot the bill for data center energy costs,” said Senator Duckworth. “This commonsense bill would help ensure that data centers don’t pass along their operating costs to Americans’ monthly energy bills or jeopardize the grid—while also supporting the development and improvement of data centers across the country.”

“The data centers behind the AI boom are consuming more energy than ever before—that demand is only expected to grow. At the same time, energy prices are spiking across the country, saddling working families with higher utility bills and threatening the reliability of the grid. Data centers must be held accountable for the costs of their connection,” said Senator Welch. “We cannot force everyday Americans to subsidize profits of the multi-billion dollar AI industry.”

“Marylanders are struggling to get by – the costs of groceries, rent, and health care are skyrocketing. That’s why it is absolutely essential that data centers cover the costs of increased energy prices they are creating: not hardworking American families. Data centers are critical to our national security, job creation, and economic development, but we cannot subsidize the costs of these data centers with our energy bills – which are already way too high,” said Senator Alsobrooks.

“It’s unconscionable that people’s utility rates are rising because of data centers being built by billion dollar companies to fuel their AI products,” said Ben Winters, Director of AI and Privacy at the Consumer Federation of America. “This bill is a critical step in remedying this injustice that brings the very real issues of affordability and Big Tech abuse to the forefront.”

“The Power for the People Act helps shield families from unfair and unaffordable data center subsidization on their electric bills,” said Olivia Wein, Senior Attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. “It is outrageous that households are stuck paying billions of dollars to energy companies for costs that should be borne by data centers. The added expense is particularly harmful for low-income households who already face impossible choices between paying the monthly electric bill and paying for food, medicine, and rent.”

“The way we currently regulate electricity doesn't work for the city-sized power demands of data centers. The Power for the People Act modernizes regulation to protect residential customers from subsidizing wealthy data centers, saving residential customers in Maryland and across the country from paying billions of dollars in electricity costs to support data center growth,” said Maryland People's Counsel David S. Lapp.

""Across the country, the rapid growth of data centers is the number one threat to affordable electricity—energy costs will continue to hit record highs if we don't act now. The Power for the People Act would hold data centers accountable for their impact on the grid, helping ensure reliability and affordability for everyone,” said Sarah Moskowitz, Executive Director at the Citizens Utility Board of Illinois. “These companies are among the wealthiest in the world, and it is simply unacceptable for everyday consumers to foot the bill for their energy guzzling. The Power for the People Act would rein these companies in and help restore balance to our energy system.""

“The Power for the People Act takes a balanced approach. It holds data centers accountable for their impact on the grid while providing them with tools to manage their energy needs,” said Brian Lipman, Director for the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel. “Without this legislation, residential customers will be unprotected from higher rates and potential blackouts and brownouts at peak times - during the hottest summer days and coldest winter nights. We must protect customers from these risks, while enabling data centers to plan responsibly. This bill is an important first step toward that goal.”

“Oregon is becoming a top destination for data center growth in the country and we have seen that growth in home power bills rising by more than 50% in five years,” said Bob Jenks, Executive Director of Oregon Citizens' Utility Board. “This federal legislation would allow us to go further than state policy allows, supporting more affordable energy bills for American families.”

“Data centers are transforming the energy sector at a speed and a scale unlike anything in decades, increasing electricity costs for worse reliability at a time when families can least afford spiking costs. Individual data centers can have the energy needs of cities, impacting the energy system and the communities around them. Collectively, the explosive growth in data centers is worsening the reliability of our energy system and imposing enormous costs – expensive transmission upgrades, rapidly increasing capacity prices, increasing energy prices – that will be paid by electricity customers. We must ensure that the economic opportunities that data centers provide for some does not come at the expense of everyone else,” said Jameson Tweedie, Public Advocate for the State of Delaware. “The Power for the People Act helps do just that, protecting the reliability of our energy system by ensuring new power generation is built to match the power demands of data centers, while requiring data centers to pay for the costs they impose on the system to protect existing customers.”

“Congress needs to step in and make sure utility customers don't get stuck with the bill for the data center construction boom, or the increased pollution that boom will cause if those companies don't bring their own new, clean energy. This commonsense legislation will hold data centers accountable and make sure they are paying the real costs for all the power they are using. Power for the People is an important step in the right direction, and Congress should act on it pronto,” said Jackson Morris, Director, State Power Sector at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“We applaud Senator Van Hollen for stepping forward to address the critical grid reliability and consumer cost issues associated with the build-out of data centers. The Power for the People Act pushes direct fixes to the regulatory shortcomings that leave consumers on the hook for data centers’ transmission upgrade costs, emphasizes the need to ensure reliable service, and prioritizes clean energy solutions to meet growing data center demand. UCS encourages Congress to move swiftly to consider the Power for the People Act and ensure the data center boom does not threaten electricity reliability or affordability,” said Mike Jacobs, Senior Energy Manager at Union of Concerned Scientists.

“This legislation answers an urgent challenge: how to grow the economy while insulating mom & pop retail customers from rising electric bills caused by data centers. It modernizes our electric sector’s approach to this new part of the economy, creating an orderly process for connecting data centers and ensuring that data centers are flexible and clean. These are necessary steps to address rapidly rising bills and ensure that data centers pay their fair share,” said Abe Silverman, Assistant Research Scholar at the Ralph O'Connor Sustainable Energy Institute, Johns Hopkins University.",https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/assets/images/sharelogo.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 12:01:23.724228

The biggest question about the final repeal is what it will say about climate science.
But last summer’s proposal also took a swipe at established climate science through what it called an “alternative rationale” for the repeal.
The endangerment finding was issued under Section 202 of the Clean Air Act, which covers car and truck pollution.
The proposed rule asserts that EPA sees the endangerment repeal as only applying to motor vehicle sector regulations.","EPA is on the verge of finalizing its sweeping rollback of the endangerment finding — the scientific cornerstone that allows it to regulate climate pollution — in a move that would help President Donald Trump topple multiple rules aimed at forcing American industries to reduce their carbon emissions.

It stands to be a game changer for a president who has rejected the basic tenets of climate science as he works to accelerate the production of fossil fuels, the main source of pollution that has led global temperatures to reach levels never seen before by modern humans. Repealing the 2009 finding would eliminate the regulatory authority that EPA relied on to enact climate rules on sources such as power plants and vehicles, easing Trump’s ability to revoke them — and making it harder for future presidents to replace them.

Yet the repeal will almost certainly face court challenges. Whether EPA’s action is successful could hinge on three things: its legal rationale for revoking the finding, its treatment of the scientific record and the strength of its regulatory analysis and responses to public comments. Those factors will come to light when the agency releases its final rule, expected within weeks.

“If the courts decide that this is valid, then … you can definitely see a scenario where you can wipe out a lot of the rules on the books that have been justified using the endangerment finding,” said Tom Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, an advocacy group that opposes regulations. “That’s kind of a big deal.”

The proposed repeal is under review by the White House, along with a rollback of Biden-era climate standards for cars and trucks. The rules were submitted to the Office of Management and Budget last week and are expected to be released together in January or February.

Here are three things that could determine whether the repeal succeeds or fails, according to lawyers and environmental advocates.

Law and science, or just law?

The biggest question about the final repeal is what it will say about climate science.

The proposal issued by EPA on July 29, 2025, centered on a new statutory interpretation of EPA’s Clean Air Act authorities instead of science. It argued that the landmark environmental law did not permit EPA to regulate pollution from motor vehicles unless direct exposure to it endangered the public.

But last summer’s proposal also took a swipe at established climate science through what it called an “alternative rationale” for the repeal. It argued that the Obama EPA based the endangerment finding on projections and empirical data and analyses that were “unduly pessimistic” about the atmosphere’s sensitivity to spiking greenhouse gas emissions and the dangers of warming for the public.

To support this contention, EPA relied overwhelmingly on a report written by five climate contrarians assembled by Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

But the group and its report have run into significant legal and reputational problems in the months since the endangerment proposal was released. The Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists are suing the Department of Energy, which they say skirted public records laws in convening the so-called Climate Working Group in secret last May. A judge overseeing the case criticized the government for describing the contrarians’ work as an objective review of climate science, when instead it was a clear attempt, he said, to infuse established science with doubt about the effects of rising temperatures. Wright later disbanded the group.

Meanwhile, in September the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine issued its own report reaffirming that the use of fossil fuels is producing dangerous warming. The scientific panel plays a unique role by statute in informing Clean Air Act regulations.

All told, experts predicted that if EPA highlights the DOE report in the final repeal of the endangerment finding it could come back to bite the agency in court.

“I think the disbanding of the Climate Working Group, the court decisions and the litigation brought by EDF and UCS, the complete rebuttal by the National Academies and many scientists, certainly weakens any basis for EPA to rely or depend on that report,” said Meredith Hankins, legal director for federal climate policy at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “And so, if they try and continue to include it in the final rule, that’ll just be one more arbitrary and capricious argument that we’ll be pushing in court.”

Jeff Holmstead, who served as EPA’s air chief under President George W. Bush, said he was “pretty confident they’ll rely on the legal rationale” in the final repeal — and not the contrarians’ climate report.

Joe Goffman, the air chief under former President Joe Biden, said EPA would likely lean into arguments that it thinks could persuade the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court to issue a decision that “precludes or dispositively sandbags a future administration from regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act.”

Public comments

Holmstead, an attorney at Bracewell LLP, said that dropping the so-called alternative rationale based on climate science from the final rule could stem from practical considerations. The draft rule’s public comment period closed in late September, and EPA hasn’t had time to process and meaningfully respond to all the public criticism it received about its scientific assertions. The DOE report that advanced those claims has been described by climate scientists as promoting misinformation, cherry-picking data to downplay the dangers of global warming and regurgitating debunked arguments.

If EPA’s rationale for the repeal continues to be partly based on scientific arguments, rather than relying on legal ones exclusively, it would have an obligation to respond to all of the scientific information in the public comments — including the report by the National Academies, the federal government’s preeminent advisory body on scientific matters.

“If they’re basing it entirely on their legal rationale, they may still want to sort of downplay the science. But they don’t have an obligation to respond to all the scientific arguments that were made,” said Holmstead.

Advocates and lawyers said they’d be looking to see how EPA responded to comments about the draft — not only on its science-based assertions, but on its legal arguments as well. The agency reports having received 572,000 public comments on the draft by the September 22 deadline, but it has uploaded only 31,000. If its response to those comments is deemed to be inadequate, the repeal could fail in court.

“The agency got hundreds of thousands of comments on this, including really extensive and detailed comments, and comments from people who would be adversely impacted by this action,” said Peter Zalzal, associate vice president for clean air strategies at EDF. “Seeing how the agency is responding and considering those — as it’s required to do under the law — has EPA done anything to analyze or consider those very real and harmful impacts on people?”

One rule to end all rules

Lawyers and advocates will also search the final rule for any intel about how EPA sees its repeal impacting regulations beyond the motor vehicle sector. The endangerment finding was issued under Section 202 of the Clean Air Act, which covers car and truck pollution.

The proposed rule asserts that EPA sees the endangerment repeal as only applying to motor vehicle sector regulations.

“Note this does not include stationary sources, which are regulated under a completely different section of the Clean Air Act,” said EPA press secretary Brigit Hirsch in an email to POLITICO’s E&E News. “To report otherwise would show a lack of understanding of EPA’s statutory authority.”

Mike Sommers, president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, said in a call with reporters on Monday that the oil and gas trade group supports EPA’s repeal of the finding for motor vehicles.

“We would not support repealing the endangerment finding for stationary sources, and one of the reasons why we wouldn’t support that is because we do support the federal regulation of methane,” he said.

But there isn’t a separate endangerment finding for stationary sources of climate pollution.

Since 2009, the finding on climate pollution from new motor vehicles has legally supported standards for oil and gas methane and power plant carbon. It could do the same in the future for landfill methane and carbon from other industries.

“It’s incorporated by reference in all of the other rules,” said Meghan Greenfield, an attorney with Jenner & Block LLP. “So, if you set that aside, it’s unclear how any of them can stand on their own.”

She said she’ll be looking for indications within the final rule about how scrapping the endangerment finding could cascade into repealing other rules.

“Does it by its own operation, affect the other standards outside of motor vehicles, like power plants, landfills, oil and gas?” she said. “Or, if the EPA were to change direction on those, how much extra effort does it require for them to repeal those other rules?”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/ca/d7/a6f902a54cf4a98f128589dc3f46/epa-2025-year-in-review-10973.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 09:59:50.308896

Rather than retiring those sites, developers are repowering projects with taller towers, longer blades, and more efficient technology, creating unexpected leverage for landowners, according to a report from Peoples Company by Jake Costanzo.

Repowering is attractive to developers because existing sites are already permitted and connected to transmission, making upgrades faster and cheaper than new construction. For landowners, however, repowering is not a simple equipment swap. It typically requires new infrastructure, expanded access, and updated easements.

Those changes often reopen lease terms that were negotiated decades ago under very different market conditions. Landowners may have opportunities to secure higher annual payments, updated production-based compensation, construction impact payments, and compensation for new roads or electrical work.

Construction impacts are significant and should be addressed upfront. Heavy equipment, trenching, soil disturbance, drainage changes, and crop loss are common during repowering. Updated agreements can include restoration standards, crop-damage payments, and bonding requirements.

The strongest leverage comes with easement renegotiation.

PJM is now being asked to extend the price cap for auctions held through this year, the White House official said.","“I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,” Trump wrote in his post.

Cost-of-living concerns are already weighing heavily on Republicans’ bid to maintain control of the House and Senate in this November’s congressional elections. While Trump has stressed the plummeting cost of oil and gasoline since he took office last January, electricity prices have climbed due to rising demand — and there’s a building backlash against data centers that are fueling the surge.

The average US retail price for electricity gained 7.4% in September to a record 18.07 cents per kilowatt-hour, the biggest gain since December 2023. Residential prices have jumped even higher, rising by 10.5% between January and August 2025, marking one of the largest increases in more than a decade, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.

Friday’s action is being cast as a one-time emergency intervention into the PJM market, necessary because of the rapid rise in electricity prices in the Mid-Atlantic region. The Trump administration and governors will urge the grid operator to return to market fundamentals after the acute problem is addressed, the White House official said.

The administration’s prescription for PJM is what’s known as a reliability backstop auction — something the grid operator already envisioned in the wake of repeated failed sales. But the administration and governors’ plan would mean holding the emergency auction right away after one clear failure – with unusual terms meant to foster a wave of rapid, new construction and the only bidders being data center owners and operators.

While PJM already holds auctions procuring electricity supplies, those are 12-month periods. In the auction encouraged by Trump and the governors for 15-year contracts, start-up times for the new power plants are likely to be staggered. The White House and governors are urging PJM to hold the special one-time auction by the end of September.

“It sounds like a significant improvement and a logical extension of bring-your-own new generation,” Joe Bowring, president of PJM’ s independent watchdog Monitoring Analytics LLC, said in a telephone interview.

“While a ‘statement of principles’ doesn’t appear to include a legal mandate for PJM to act, pressure from the Trump administration and a bipartisan coalition of PJM states is very likely to motivate a considerable response” from the grid operator, said Timothy Fox, an analyst with the research firm ClearView Energy Partners.

This plan also could fast track the development of natural gas generation and potentially nuclear plants by guaranteeing revenues – and profits – specifically to support data campuses needed to deploy artificial intelligence.

The approach could benefit larger tech companies at the expense of smaller firms.

Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Google and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) are less exposed to electricity price fluctuations since they can pass those costs on to customers, said Gil Luria, analyst at DA Davidson & Co. However, dozens of smaller companies, including Nebius (NBIS) and CoreWeave (CRWV) that offer artificial intelligence infrastructure to cloud-computing companies on multi-year contracts, could be more exposed to big price swings since they are on the hook to absorb higher electricity costs, he said.

“If they have to pay more for electricity, their margins will get squeezed,” Luria said.

The effort has the potential to help PJM tackle a significant roadblock: improving the accuracy of its forecasts for demand growth. With tech giants paying for the power plants they need, the approach could weed out speculative projects that have skewed demand growth projections.

The involvement of governors – including Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and Maryland’s Wes Moore, both Democrats – is seen by the Trump administration as helping to anchor the effort, since state policies have driven recent changes in the power mix, including the retirement of coal and gas plants. The initiative is also seen aiding hyperscalers by ensuring reliable power supply, and it could be a model for other parts of the country, the White House official said.

Governors are committing to implement and assign these costs to the data centers, ensuring the price of these new power plants doesn’t land on the average household, the White House official said.

PJM’s auctions have emerged as a political flashpoint in the national debate about affordability after prices reached record levels in 2024. Although Pennsylvania’s Shapiro struck a deal with PJM to cap prices in future auctions, costs hit new highs in two subsequent sales.

The most recent auction, in December, also fell 6.6 gigawatts short of supplies, which PJM blamed on the frenzy to build massive data centers.

PJM is now being asked to extend the price cap for auctions held through this year, the White House official said.

While the statement of principles being signed Friday isn’t a binding legal document, administration officials have discussed the plan with a host of stakeholders, from PJM executives and state officials, to utilities, power-plant developers, Wall Street and the hyperscalers building these data centers, the official said.

But the most decisive element in transforming cars into active energy resources is the human factor.","During AFC Ajax match days at the Amsterdam Johan Cruijff ArenA, the spectacle is not confined to the pitch. As tens of thousands of fans stream into the stadium, long rows of electric vehicles remain parked outside, quietly storing solar energy collected over the afternoon and later feeding part of it back to the stadium when demand surges. A scene that would have sounded futuristic only a few years ago is now technically feasible, and researchers developing advanced charging systems say the foundations are already there. As Professor Gautham Ram Chandra Mouli of TU Delft explains, this scenario illustrates a broader point emerging from advanced charging research: “An electric vehicle is not just a load but a potential micro–storage unit, capable of supporting the grid when managed through precise modelling and controlled charging.” In his view, “mobility and energy are no longer separate systems: if managed correctly, the EV becomes part of the energy infrastructure.”

The timing is relevant: according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA), in 2025, battery electric vehicles accounted for around 16% of new-car registrations in the EU, reflecting strong growth in EV uptake. This growth overlaps with a grid increasingly strained by electrification, local congestion and renewable variability. As highlighted in the IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2023, Europe faces more than €3.5 trillion in required grid investments by 2035 to modernise and digitalise its electricity networks. In this context, turning EVs into distributed storage is not a futuristic idea but one of the most realistic forms of flexibility available at scale. As Mouli adds, the logic is simple: “The vehicles are already there, already plugged in, already carrying large batteries.”

Yet today’s EV ecosystem has a core limitation: most vehicles can receive energy but not return it to the grid. Many models technically could, but this function is deactivated due to uncertainty. “Battery lifetime, thermal behaviour and charging dynamics must be modelled precisely before exposing users to additional cycles,” Mouli notes. Automakers remain cautious because ageing mechanisms vary widely across chemistries and thermal systems, and warranties must be built around predictable patterns. From the grid operator’s perspective, the challenge is scale. Luiz Dias of EDP NEW, a DriVe2X project partner, summarises it clearly: “To unlock flexibility at the scale Europe needs, vehicles must become two-way devices — not just consumers of electricity but contributors to local stability.”

The long-term vision is neighbourhoods, workplaces and mobility hubs where EVs provide electricity when demand spikes and absorb excess when renewables surge. This intersection of technology, infrastructure and user behaviour is exactly what DriVe2X is testing across several European cities. Solutions that perform well in simulations are being validated in open, real-life environments to see how EVs behave under daily constraints. Beyond the ArenA, tests in Budapest are taking place in private homes where charging routines interact with rooftop solar generation and tariff optimisation. At Porto Airport, vehicles remain plugged in for long stays, offering insight into predictable charging patterns and user satisfaction. In Maia, northern Portugal, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) is being added to a dense network of charging points. The project also explores tourism-driven charging behaviour on the Isle of Wight in the UK, where EVs remain parked for extended periods, and the ASM living lab in Terni, Italy, where blockchain-enabled energy transactions are complementing incentives for smart and bidirectional charging.

The demonstrations show that bidirectional charging works best when users trust the system. This trust depends on infrastructure availability, clear information and the certainty that the car will always be ready. As Dias notes, “We face challenges in each of these dimensions, but two are particularly present: the lack of vehicles truly compatible with bidirectionality and the need to design operations that are as open to the public as possible.” At the technical level, research within DriVe2X indicates how advanced modelling can reduce battery stress. Mouli’s team integrates empirical and physics-based ageing models to simulate how different lithium-ion chemistries react under bidirectional cycles. “We model applications, battery types and thermal behaviour together,” he explains, “so we can predict ageing accurately and ensure V2G does not compromise user needs.” Their work suggests that, when managed carefully, V2G can even reduce certain forms of degradation by keeping batteries at moderate charge levels rather than fully charged for long periods — an insight that challenges the common fear that bidirectional charging necessarily accelerates ageing.

But the most decisive element in transforming cars into active energy resources is the human factor. A large-scale survey was designed to understand how people think about, use and emotionally relate to EV charging. It captures technical preferences as well as cultural habits, socioeconomic conditions and behavioural patterns that will shape electrified societies. “One of the clearest barriers emerging is a persistent lack of clarity,” explains Carlos Montalvo, Senior Scientist on Strategy and Innovation Policy at TNO. “People don’t really know how the battery will behave in the long run, how much they could earn, or who is responsible if something goes wrong. This makes the survey a mirror of a changing society.” The paradox is that several EVs already have the technical capacity for V2X, yet the function remains disabled because responsibilities and warranties are not standardised. Montalvo highlights how striking the survey results were: “Beyond cost and convenience, emotion emerged as one of the strongest predictors of willingness to engage in V2X: feelings of pride, usefulness and contribution to the common good correlate strongly with acceptance.” Participants who already own solar panels, home batteries or efficient heating systems “are far more inclined to try V2X because they already understand energy flows and see the vehicle as part of a broader household ecosystem.”

After mapping these emotional, behavioural and informational patterns, the implications become clear: bidirectional charging will scale only if technology and infrastructure evolve alongside people’s expectations, habits and uncertainties. The scene at the Amsterdam ArenA offers a glimpse of what this transition could look like: in the long term, millions of EVs — which spend 92% of their time parked — could become the distributed storage backbone of Europe’s energy system. Its deployment will depend on scientific progress, market readiness and public acceptance. As Mouli notes, “There is still a lot to be done, from battery lifetime to uniform grid codes, but once these challenges are addressed, mass adoption becomes possible.” Dias agrees: “The experience must be smooth, practically intuitive. Smart charging should be the default — with ‘dumb’ charging as the last resort.” What ultimately determines adoption, Montalvo concludes, is “whether citizens feel that V2X is safe, fair, understandable and compatible with daily life.”",https://www.youris.com/imgpub/2218532/0/0/550x400.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 08:59:13.703397

The decision was made during Prime Minister Mark Carney’s visit to Beijing to improve strained Canada–China relations.

The move breaks with the U.S. on anti-China tariffs, and opens the doors to much more affordable EV imports—possibly around $35,000 Canadian, or $25,000 U.S.

The Chinese automotive industry received the green light to make a deeper incursion into North America on Friday as Canada agreed to cut its 100% tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, opening the door to cheap imports and potentially upending the car industry on this continent.

According to the AP, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that anti-Chinese EV tariffs would be slashed after two days of meetings with Chinese leaders in Beijing. In return for lower tariffs on EVs, Canada has agreed to reduce its tariffs on Canadian farm goods, including canola seeds.

But Chinese EV imports won't flood into the country just yet. Carney said that the deal includes an initial annual cap of 49,000 vehicles on Chinese EV exports to Canada, although that grows to about 70,000 over five years. Carney said Canadians purchase about 1.8 million vehicles annually, almost a tenth of the U.S.' sales volume.

Still, the move represents a major break between Canada and the U.S., which once moved in lockstep to protect a deeply intertwined North American automotive industry.

Carney, according to the AP, touted the move as part of the growth of a whole new auto sector, and a win for Canadians seeking more affordable new-car options at a time of record-high prices. He added that most of these cars would have an import price of less than $35,000 Canadian, or about $25,000 U.S. The average new vehicle costs around $63,000 Canadian.

“We’re building a new part of our car industry, building cars of the future in partnership, bringing affordable autos for Canadians at a time when affordability is top of mind, and doing it at a scale that allows for a smooth transition in the sector,” Carney said.

The deal is a groundbreaking one on several levels. First and foremost, it represents arguably the biggest automotive break in trade relations yet between the U.S. and Canada, whose once-close relations have become deeply strained in the era of President Donald Trump's tariffs and his remarks about the country becoming ""the 51st state.""

Previously, Canada acted with the U.S. to enact 100% tariffs on Chinese-made EVs as a way to protect the North American automotive industry. Automakers, parts suppliers and other components of the car business run between both countries, and the growth of Chinese imports into Canada was widely seen as a threat to the operations of companies like General Motors, Ford, Honda, Toyota and so on, who collectively employ millions of people in both countries.

It is not clear which, if any, Chinese automakers could announce a move toward Canadian imports. In theory, doing so would be the first move toward more localized North American production, a long-sought goal of Chinese companies eager to expand into this continent and its massive auto market. As sales in China slow down after years of explosive growth, most large Chinese automakers are seeking growth by expanding into Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa.

Sales of plug-in cars rose globally in 2025, except for North America, due to an end to U.S. EV tax credits and fuel economy rules driving a more-electric market. One exception was Mexico, which saw 29% more plug-in sales in 2025—most of which were imported from China.

In Detroit earlier this week, Trump also expressed an openness to Chinese automakers coming to the U.S., as long as they build cars stateside, too. “If they want to come in and build a plant and hire you and hire your friends and your neighbors, that’s great, I love that,” Trump said during a meeting of the Detroit Economic Club. “Let China come in.”

Duke Energy’s proposal includes installing battery storage at the county’s former coal plant sites on the Catawba River- Allen, in Belmont and Riverbend, in Mount Holly.
Fluence supplies BESS for BrightNight and Cordelio Power’s 1,200MWh Arizona project US-headquartered energy storage system integrator Fluence Energy has announced it will supply its Gridstack Pro BESS for the solar-plus-storage Pioneer Clean Energy Centre in Yuma County, Arizona.
The Pioneer Clean Energy Centre, being developed by independent power producers (IPPs) BrightNight and Cordelio Power, pairs a 300MWac solar facility with a 300MW/1,200MWh BESS.
In 2025, Swift Current Energy, a renewables and energy storage developer based in Massachusetts, secured US$242 million in financing for Prospect Power.","Both lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery systems are eligible for federal investment tax credits (ITCs), covering 40% of the cost for Duke Energy customers. This amount includes an additional 10% for reinvestment into an energy community, following the coal plant’s retirement in December 2024.

Duke Energy says it intends to expand its battery storage across several counties in the Carolinas.

According to the company’s 2025 Carolinas Resource Plan, currently under review by state regulators, it plans to add 6,550MW of battery capacity by 2035 to ensure reliable service and accommodate increasing demand in North and South Carolina.

Duke forecasted that, if the plan is implemented, the proposed changes would lead to a 2.1% rise in customer bills. The company states this increase is lower than the projected costs of their previously approved plan.

The 2023 Carolinas Resource Plan aimed for 2,700MW of battery storage by 2031, resulting in a total of 5,600MW, a 2,900MW increase to support immediate growth and take advantage of tax credits.

The utility added that the plan upholds Gaston County’s—where the BESS is located—tradition of supporting its customers across both states.

Duke Energy’s proposal includes installing battery storage at the county’s former coal plant sites on the Catawba River- Allen, in Belmont and Riverbend, in Mount Holly. The Riverbend project, a 115MW/460MWh BESS, is scheduled to start construction in late 2026 and become operational by late 2027.

The utility has also proposed a third BESS at Allen to be operational by the end of 2028, along with a regional facility for operations, training, and storage of batteries and renewables, capable of supporting 20-50 employees. Both plans are still in development and awaiting regulatory approval.

Fluence supplies BESS for BrightNight and Cordelio Power’s 1,200MWh Arizona project

US-headquartered energy storage system integrator Fluence Energy has announced it will supply its Gridstack Pro BESS for the solar-plus-storage Pioneer Clean Energy Centre in Yuma County, Arizona.

The Pioneer Clean Energy Centre, being developed by independent power producers (IPPs) BrightNight and Cordelio Power, pairs a 300MWac solar facility with a 300MW/1,200MWh BESS.

In February 2025, BrightNight and Cordelio announced a power purchase agreement (PPA) for Pioneer with utility Arizona Public Service (APS).

The Pioneer Clean Energy Centre is expected to generate hundreds of construction and operational jobs, according to Brightnight, along with significant tax revenue for the local community. The facility is anticipated to start commercial operations in April 2027.

Fluence’s Gridstack Pro will include US-made cells, modules, enclosures, and thermal management systems, “supporting the advancement of domestically produced energy storage technology while strengthening American energy security.”

In October 2023, the company introduced the Gridstack Pro solution, which provides customers with improved performance and reduced operating costs by enhancing state of charge (SOC) accuracy, enabling string-level control, and incorporating pre-integrated asset performance management intelligence, the company stated.

BrightNight has collaborated with its joint venture (JV) partner Cordelio on several occasions, including the Box Canyon project, a 300MW solar PV and 600MWh BESS in Pinal County, Arizona. A PPA for this project was finalised in July 2022.

In late 2025, Cordelio and BrightNight announced financial close of the 200MW/800MWh Greenwater BESS in Piece County, Washington state. It will provide capacity and grid services to the utility Puget Sound Energy.

Elevate Renewables acquires 150MW Virgina BESS

Developer and IPP Elevate Renewables has acquired the 150MW/600MWh Prospect Power Storage BESS project near Northern Virginia’s ‘Data Centre Alley.’

According to Elevate, the BESS, located in Rockingham County, is the largest standalone battery storage asset in the PJM Interconnection. It is currently under construction and scheduled to begin operations in mid-2026.

In 2025, Swift Current Energy, a renewables and energy storage developer based in Massachusetts, secured US$242 million in financing for Prospect Power. This marked Swift Current Energy’s first large-scale battery project, which they acquired in 2023 from Clean Planet Energy, a joint venture between Open Road Renewable Energy and Eolian.

Clean Plant Energy is a JV between the developers Open Road Renewable Energy and Eolian.

Prospect Power is committed to a 15-year PPA with utility Dominion Energy Virginia, “positioning the project as an essential energy resource to ensure cost-effective grid reliability and meet the rapidly growing demand for power across the Mid-Atlantic region.”

In 2024, Elevate revealed plans for a 15MW/60MWh battery storage project at the Arthur Kill Power Station in Staten Island, NY. Once finished, Elevate claims it will be the biggest battery storage system in New York City.

In the same year, Elevate revealed plans to install a grid-forming BESS at a fossil fuel peaker plant in Connecticut, funded with US$27.5 million from the US Department of Energy (DOE). Elevate’s Innovative Inertia Project aims to upgrade the 244MW Devon Generating Station peaker unit by integrating a BESS that can deliver inertia, synchronous condensing (‘green sync’), and other vital grid services, according to the company.

According to a report by the independent market monitor for PJM Interconnection, Northern Virginia’s ‘Data Centre Alley’ is the largest concentration of data centres worldwide, and lies within PJM’s jurisdiction. PJM’s departing CEO, Manu Asthana, has highlighted the importance of the US “winning the race” for global AI leadership. This outlook aligns with statements from the White House and major Silicon Valley firms.

Partly due to ‘Data Centre Alley’s’ large energy demand, data centres are projected to increase power demand overall by nearly 12,000MW this summer.",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/energy-storage-products.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 09:00:08.117437

Ford is exploring BYD as a battery supplier to support its growing hybrid vehicle lineup.

The talks highlight Ford’s shift away from EVs and toward hybrids amid changing demand.

Any deal would face political scrutiny given BYD’s status as a major Chinese automaker.

Ford Motor is in discussions with China’s BYD over a potential partnership in which the U.S. automaker would purchase batteries for some of its hybrid vehicles, according to an exclusive WSJ report.

The companies are currently negotiating the terms of this arrangement, and the discussions remain nonbinding. One proposal under consideration involves Ford importing batteries from BYD for use in Ford factories outside the United States. However, it’s possible that a deal may not ultimately be reached.

If completed, the partnership would pair Ford with the world’s largest Chinese automaker, a company that has unsettled much of the U.S. auto industry with its ability to produce affordable vehicles equipped with advanced technology.

For Ford, the talks address a growing need. As the automaker pulls back from electric vehicles amid softer demand and accelerates its push into hybrids, it requires additional battery supply tailored to hybrid powertrains. BYD, which began as a battery manufacturer and has since become a global auto giant, has extensive experience producing batteries for both electric and hybrid vehicles.

BYD produces most of its batteries in China, but is expanding manufacturing capacity overseas as it expands into markets such as Southeast Asia, Europe, and Brazil.

Following publication of the Journal report, President Donald Trump’s trade adviser, Peter Navarro, publicly criticized the idea, questioning whether the arrangement would make Ford more vulnerable to Chinese supply chains.

Last month, Ford announced it would further scale back its EV plans, taking an expected $19.5 billion in charges, largely tied to its EV business. The company said it now expects hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and all-electric vehicles to account for roughly half of its global sales by 2030, while it expands its lineup of gas-powered and hybrid models.

Hybrid vehicles have emerged as a relative bright spot for the automaker, with its hybrid sales rising 18% in the Q4 of last year to about 55,000 vehicles, and executives have pointed to strong demand for models such as the F-150 hybrid. Speaking at the Detroit Auto Show this week, Jim Farley said the company plans to expand its hybrid and extended-range vehicle offerings.

Ford is also pursuing other battery strategies. The company is building a battery plant in Marshall, Michigan, where it plans to produce lower-cost cells using licensed technology from Chinese battery maker CATL. The project has faced scrutiny from Republican lawmakers but is expected to begin operations this year.

While Chinese automakers remain largely barred from selling vehicles in the U.S. due to tariffs and regulatory restrictions, industry executives continue to view companies such as BYD as a long-term competitive threat. For now, Ford and its peers increasingly see hybrids as the most viable growth segment as consumer demand shifts and EV adoption slows.",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ford-BYD-01162025-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 08:59:21.809155

The transaction covers Aethon's shale gas assets primarily in Texas and Louisiana's Haynesville formation-one of the largest natural gas reserves in the southern U.S.
This deal follows a wave of Japanese investment in U.S. energy, reflecting Tokyo's strategic view of natural gas as a transition fuel well beyond 2050.
Mitsubishi's move signals it's playing in a league increasing its exposure to American shale gas.
What's clear is that the company is positioning itself to capture more of the U.S. shale gas pie-territory that sits at the heart of the country's energy exports and global supply chains.","Mitsubishi Corp (TSE: 8058) is making a big bet on U.S. natural gas, agreeing to purchase shale gas production and infrastructure assets from Aethon Energy Management for a hefty $7.53 billion. This marks Mitsubishi's largest deal so far as they double down on their gas supply chain, especially along the strategic U.S. Gulf Coast corridor.

The transaction covers Aethon's shale gas assets primarily in Texas and Louisiana's Haynesville formation-one of the largest natural gas reserves in the southern U.S. Notably, Mitsubishi is buying $5.2 billion in equity interests plus taking on $2.33 billion in net debt from Aethon. Aethon retains the option to buy back up to 25% of the stakes within six months after closing, which is scheduled sometime between April and June 2026.

CEO Katsuya Nakanishi pointed out the assets' strong productivity and competitiveness, underscoring their significance as Japan leans on natural gas to bridge its energy needs while managing the transition toward greener alternatives. Mitsubishi's foothold along the Gulf Coast pairs with ongoing LNG export facility developments in the region, potentially expanding their global gas distribution capacity.

For context, Mitsubishi is no stranger to the LNG game. Aside from this U.S. acquisition, they hold stakes in LNG operations across Australia, Canada, Malaysia, Oman, Russia, and elsewhere in the U.S., with around 15 million metric tons per year in equity LNG production. Meanwhile, Aethon is one of the biggest private U.S. gas producers with output hitting 2.1 billion cubic feet per day, roughly matching Mitsubishi's annual LNG equity output.

Looking ahead, production at these assets is expected to ramp up, peaking at 2.6 billion cubic feet per day in fiscal 2028. Mitsubishi forecasts a net profit contribution of between 70 and 80 billion yen ($443 million to $506 million) by fiscal 2027. Funding is slated to come from a mix of cash and debt.

This deal follows a wave of Japanese investment in U.S. energy, reflecting Tokyo's strategic view of natural gas as a transition fuel well beyond 2050. The expected surge in demand driven by sectors such as data centers-fueled by the AI boom-further cements gas' role in Japan's energy future.

The market didn't exactly cheer this announcement, with Mitsubishi's shares dipping 2% post-news, outpacing the Nikkei 225 index's mild 0.3% drop. Traders might be weighing the hefty price tag or shifting sentiment around energy stocks in general.

Earlier deals mirror this trend: JERA, Japan's largest power generator, picked up U.S. gas assets for $1.5 billion in October, while Japan Petroleum Exploration snapped up a U.S. tight oil and gas firm for $1.3 billion back in December.

Here are some key insights from the study:

The U.S. has some of the highest average solar installation costs globally, at $2,800 per kW installed.

With residential electricity prices averaging $0.18 per kWh, American homeowners earn less from self-generated power than countries like the U.K., where prices reach $0.40 per kWh.

China will reduce its tariff on canola seeds, a major Canadian export, from about 84% to about 15%, he told reporters.
""It can be said that our meeting last year opened a new chapter in turning China–Canada relations toward improvement,"" China's top leader said.
China responded by imposing duties of 100% on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25% on pork and seafood.
Collectively, the import taxes effectively closed the Chinese market to Canadian canola, an industry group has said.","BEIJING — Breaking with the United States, Canada has agreed to cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Friday.

Carney made the announcement after two days of meetings with Chinese leaders. He said there would be an initial cap of 49,000 vehicles on Chinese EV exports to Canada, growing to 70,000 over five years. China will reduce its tariff on canola seeds, a major Canadian export, from about 84% to about 15%, he told reporters.

""It has been a historic and productive two days,"" Carney said, speaking outside against the backdrop of a traditional pavilion and a frozen pond at a Beijing park. ""We have to understand the differences between Canada and other countries, and focus our efforts to work together where we're aligned.""

Earlier Friday, he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged to improve relations between their two nations after years of acrimony.

Xi told Carney in a meeting at the Great Hall of the People that he is willing to continue working to improve ties, noting that talks have been underway on restoring and restarting cooperation since the two held an initial meeting in October on the sidelines of a regional economic conference in South Korea.

""It can be said that our meeting last year opened a new chapter in turning China–Canada relations toward improvement,"" China's top leader said.

Carney looks to improve global governance

Carney, the first Canadian prime minister to visit China in eight years, said better relations would help improve a global governance system that he described as ""under great strain.""

He called for a new relationship ""adapted to new global realities"" and cooperation in agriculture, energy and finance.

Those new realities reflect in large part the so-called America-first approach of U.S. President Donald Trump. The tariffs he has imposed have hit both the Canadian and Chinese economies. Carney, who has met with several leading Chinese companies in Beijing, said ahead of his trip that his government is focused on building an economy less reliant on the U.S. at what he called ""a time of global trade disruption.""

A Canadian business owner in China called Carney's visit game-changing, saying it re-establishes dialogue, respect and a framework between the two nations.

""These three things we didn't have,"" said Jacob Cooke, the CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, which helps exporters navigate the Chinese market. ""The parties were not talking for years.""

Canada had been aligned with US on tariffs

Canada had followed the U.S. in putting tariffs of 100% on EVs from China and 25% on steel and aluminum under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Carney's predecessor.

China responded by imposing duties of 100% on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25% on pork and seafood. It added a 75.8% tariff on canola seeds last August. Collectively, the import taxes effectively closed the Chinese market to Canadian canola, an industry group has said. Overall, China's imports from Canada fell 10.4% last year to $41.7 billion, according to Chinese trade data.

China is hoping Trump's pressure tactics on allies such as Canada will drive them to pursue a foreign policy that is less aligned with the United States. The U.S. president has suggested Canada could become America's 51st state.

Carney departs China on Saturday and visits Qatar on Sunday before attending the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum in Switzerland next week. He will meet business leaders and investors in Qatar to promote trade and investment, his office said.

Looking back on the last year, the U.S. saw a dramatic shift in federal electric vehicle policy in favor of fossil fuels. Among the most significant, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act ended several federal EV and clean vehicle tax credits, and federal agencies moved to weaken clean car standards and California's Clean Air Act waiver authority. Funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program was paused and then revived. Despite federal headwinds, states continued to advance EV adoption through robust incentives, charging infrastructure buildouts, and fleet commitments. The market response has been swift and substantial, with leading automakers recording multi-billion-dollar write-downs and shifts in their EV production plans. Overall, near-term U.S. EV deployment faces policy-driven turbulence, but underlying consumer interest, technology progress, and state actions suggest that the clean transportation transition is getting a re-set in 2026, rather than a reversal.

Federal

In a major blow to the affordability of EVs, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act sunset several EV and clean vehicle tax credits. The $7,500 EV tax credit commonly known as the ""New Clean Vehicle Tax Credit"", or 30D credit, officially expired on September 30, 2025. The ""Previously-Owned Clean Vehicle"" credit under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 25E and the ""Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicle"" credit under IRC 45W also effectively expired, and will not be available for any vehicle acquired after September 30, 2025. EV sales spiked to a record share just before the credit ended, then plunged in October, suggesting regulatorily‑driven demand swings as buyers and sellers adjusted to new federal policy signals.

The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program had a tumultuous road in 2025, after the Trump Administration froze unspent program funds. Following the overturn of such funding freeze by a federal district court in June 2025, the Federal Highway Administration released new interim guidance in August 2025 to restore funding to states. Notably, among other updates to provide flexibility to states, because the NEVI program was funded through FY 2026, the updated guidance allows states to release all remaining NEVI funds in a single solicitation.

State

States have forged ahead with their EV policies despite federal uncertainty. According to a comprehensive EDF report released in early January 2026, every state has adopted multiple EV‑supportive policies. California leads with the most policies, while states like Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, and Alabama have built more diversified EV policy portfolios. Nearly every state offers incentives or rebates for EV charging equipment, and 40 states offer incentives for medium- and heavy-duty EVs. Charging investments have been near‑universal, with all states participating in NEVI. In sum, the report suggests that shifting federal policy in favor of fossil fuels provides even greater incentive for states to lead the charge on clean transportation initiatives that are already underway.

Industry

Several major automakers announced billion‑dollar write-downs and realignment of their EV production capacity following shifting federal EV policy and consumer demand. General Motors, the largest U.S. automaker, reported a $7.1 billion loss in the last quarter of 2025 primarily due to the diminished value of its investments in battery and EV manufacturing facilities. These losses come after the company wrote down $1.6 billion in EV assets and announced plans to scale back EV production in favor of producing more large, internal combustion engine vehicles. Ford Motors also reportedly took a $19.5 billion write-down to cut its EV losses and plans to pivot production towards more hybrid vehicles and lower-cost EVs. Foreign automakers were hit hardest by the Trump Administration's tariffs. Volkswagen, for example, saw its U.S. sales of EVs fall 20% in the last quarter of 2025, while EV sales continue to grow in Europe and China. To remain competitive, some automakers have considered dropping prices going into 2026, which industry analysts posit could lead to an uptick in EV sales.

The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), his signature trade deal, enacted stronger protections for American workers and businesses and revitalized the export industries that account for more than a quarter of Louisiana's economic output.

Soon, the Trump administration will have the chance to build on that success. A formal review of the USMCA begins this year. The process is already underway as the United States gathers public input and evaluates how the agreement has performed. If Trump uses this moment to reinforce the deal's protections for American businesses, he can deliver yet another boost to Louisiana's economy.

When President Trump signed the USMCA in 2018, America's North American trade relationships were strained. The old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) framework had become outdated and allowed competitors to exploit loopholes that harmed U.S. workers and manufacturers.

The USMCA reversed that trend. It tightened trade rules to encourage more production in the United States, gave American businesses clearer access to Canadian and Mexican markets and included new provisions to remove barriers for agricultural and energy producers — two pillars of Louisiana's economy.

The results speak for themselves. As America's fourth-largest exporting state, Louisiana has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the agreement.

Last year alone, Louisiana exported $10 billion worth of goods to Canada and Mexico, supporting more than 21,000 Louisiana jobs. Nearly 1 in every 8 exported Louisiana goods now goes to one of our two North American partners.

That success is why Louisianans should hope, above all, that President Trump renews the agreement during this year's review. The USMCA has delivered for our state.

At the same time, there is room to strengthen it. In several cases, Mexico and Canada have not fully upheld their commitments — and the review offers a rare opportunity to address those issues.

Start with Mexico. The USMCA requires all parties to regulate sectors such as energy fairly and impartially. Yet Mexico has repeatedly favored its state-owned energy provider, disadvantaging American companies. That matters in Louisiana, which supplies a large share of the oil and petroleum products exported to Mexico. Energy alone accounts for nearly half of Louisiana's exports to Canada and Mexico.

Mexico has also altered customs procedures with little warning, slowing shipments of energy, agricultural goods and manufactured products that move through Louisiana's ports. These unexpected rule changes violate the USMCA's transparency requirements and undermine the reliability Louisiana exporters depend on.

Canada has posed challenges as well. Certain customs policies have created new administrative hurdles for American exporters, affecting sectors like agriculture — a $13 billion cornerstone of Louisiana's economy, home to nearly 30,000 farms.

This year's review is the right moment to fix that. As the United States works to renew the USMCA, Trump administration officials should focus on bolstering enforcement, ensuring transparency and addressing areas where Mexico and Canada have not fully complied with the agreement.

Strengthening the USMCA will benefit more than just Louisiana — it will enhance America's overall economic security. Reinforcing trade rules, especially in energy, will help protect American competitiveness, support domestic production and reduce reliance on imports.

The progress Louisiana has made under the USMCA proves what strong, America First trade leadership can achieve. President Trump can put our state on firmer footing.

Strengthening that deal will help keep Louisiana competitive — and keep our ports, farms and energy sector powering America's future growth.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/5a/15a3f3bc-73ce-502f-96c4-2f36b0953bb3/66709e100abeb.image.jpg?crop=1765%2C927%2C0%2C123&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2026-01-16 09:00:40.653561

Instead, his EPA is going much farther, attempting to eliminate its own power to govern pollution.
If the changes hold up in court, experts and former agency officials say they could amount to a backdoor repeal of the EPA itself.
Thousands of environmental groups and individuals opposed the repeal, and even many polluters urged the EPA to reconsider.
But experts and former agency officials said the pause on health costs and the greenhouse gas rule repeal both represent departures from the agency’s core mission.","In the 55 years since its founding under President Richard Nixon, the Environmental Protection Agency has been a regulatory pendulum, swinging between stringent and lax control of air pollution. Under Democratic presidents, the agency tends to clamp down on emissions from cars and smokestacks. Under Republicans, it tends to give automakers and the manufacturing sector more flexibility.

When President Donald Trump returned to office last year, climate experts expected him to tilt the balance toward industry as he did in his first term, continuing the ping-pong of the last few decades.

Instead, his EPA is going much farther, attempting to eliminate its own power to govern pollution. The agency is soon expected to release its final proposal to repeal the landmark “endangerment finding,” an Obama-era rule that gave it the authority to regulate the greenhouse gases that warm the earth; at the same time, it will also repeal its rule limiting automotive carbon emissions. The agency also confirmed this week that it will no longer quantify the human health benefits of regulating industrial pollution, a change that could justify far more lenient oversight of toxic emissions from things like smokestacks and power plants. Administrator Lee Zeldin hits the road today for a “Freedom Means Affordable Cars” tour in Michigan and Ohio, during which he will tout Trump’s efforts to relax environmental rules on gas cars.

These changes are the latest in a battery of repeals that cover everything from mercury to microplastics, but they go much farther than simply cutting industry a break. If the changes hold up in court, experts and former agency officials say they could amount to a backdoor repeal of the EPA itself. The agency would still have funding and staff, these experts say, but it would no longer be able to perform its mission of protecting what the Clean Air Act calls “public health and welfare.”

“Any erosion of the purpose of these laws, which was to protect public health, is … undermining the very purpose of environmental protection,” said Bob Perciasepe, who served as an assistant administrator of the EPA for air and water quality under President Bill Clinton.

The agency is pairing its proposed repeal of the 2009 “endangerment finding” with a repeal of its rules limiting carbon pollution from gas cars. Its rule proposing these repeals makes two distinct arguments against past regulations on tailpipe carbon. The first is that the EPA lacks the authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate carbon dioxide, because global warming is a worldwide issue, not a “local and regional” one like soot.

The second echoes Trump’s criticism of strict Biden-era tailpipe rules. Biden’s regulations would have spurred a faster transition to electric vehicles, but Trump has claimed they amounted to a ban on internal combustion cars. The proposed rule argues that that “no technology … is capable of preventing or controlling” carbon emissions from cars except for “a complete change from internal combustion engines to EVs.” It also claims that regulating the pollutant often “requires manufacturers to design and install new and more expensive technologies, thereby increasing the price of new vehicles” and hurting consumers. (It adds that “the ability to own a vehicle is an important means to unlock economic freedom and participate in society.”)

Experts dismiss both arguments. The legal basis for the EPA to regulate carbon has long been seen as solid, and the 1970 Clean Air Act even specifies that it can intervene when “air pollutant[s] emitted in the United States … endanger public health or welfare in a foreign country.” The Supreme Court ruled in 2007’s Massachusetts v. EPA that this authority was “unambiguous,” and the current conservative court has upheld that decision even in rulings limiting the scope of the agency’s authority.

The argument that vehicle regulations are too burdensome for automakers also doesn’t hold water, said Margo Oge, who led the EPA’s Office of Transportation and Air Quality from 1994 until 2012 and wrote its first vehicle greenhouse gas emissions standards.

“We have heard time after time from companies that the sky is falling when they [are] faced with stringent standards,” Oge told Grist. “But that hasn’t happened. As the rest of the world moves toward electric vehicles, U.S. policies and investments [risk] leaving domestic manufacturers behind investing in old high-polluting technologies.”

Public comments regarding the EPA’s proposal were almost universally negative. Thousands of environmental groups and individuals opposed the repeal, and even many polluters urged the EPA to reconsider. If the endangerment finding goes away, states could still try to regulate greenhouse gases according to common law, they argued, creating a chaotic and unpredictable business environment.

“Attempting to comply with multiple, likely conflicting, regulations among the states will drive up compliance costs for companies, create obstacles for investment decisions, lead to regulatory uncertainty, and make efficient reduction of emissions more difficult,” the Business Roundtable, an influential council of large companies, wrote in its comments. Members of the roundtable include major polluters such as 3M, General Motors, and Chevron.

If courts don’t strike it down, Trump’s repeal could hamstring climate regulations for years to come. Should a court rule that the EPA has no authority to regulate greenhouse gases, a future president would have to formulate a new endangerment finding, which could take years to go through the regulatory process, or else would have to secure explicit approval from Congress. Unless Congress acted, the EPA would not be able to set any limits on greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes, which make up a quarter of the U.S.’s contribution to global warming.

“If they were to say, ‘We have no authority at all,’ and the Supreme Court upholds that, there would be a lack of authority unless Congress were to pass a new law,” David Doniger, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, who has also served at the EPA and the White House Council on Environmental Quality, told Grist. “But if they take that position, they expose the companies more to federal and state common law liabilities” — in other words, if the EPA’s central authority goes away, companies could face a range of climate lawsuits in various state and federal courts.

Such a decision would also undercut the EPA’s other regulations governing carbon from power plants and similar “stationary sources.” The agency is already trying to repeal Biden-era standards for pollution from power plants, and a full repeal of the endangerment finding would prevent future presidents from reimposing those standards. Even oil lobbyists such as the American Petroleum Institute have asked the EPA not to go this far — many producers worry that if the agency loses the ability to regulate methane from oil sites, they would be exposed to lawsuits over their role in climate change.

The EPA’s other move this week could weaken its bedrock authority to regulate other air pollutants. When the agency designs rules for contaminants like soot, dust, and ozone, it weighs an industry’s financial cost of compliance against the financial benefits of imposing the rule. To do this, the agency most often sets a dollar value on human health — under Biden, for instance, the agency estimated that reducing a ton of particulate pollution prevents $77 in health costs.

Past presidents have revised this number according to evolving scientific evidence, but the EPA is now setting the health cost of soot and ozone at zero dollars, claiming that previous estimates offered a “false sense of precision.” When the agency considers whether to place limits on the emission of ozone from factories or soot from smokestacks, it will now quantify the economic costs of compliance to industry, but not the monetary value of avoided health costs.

The agency has already debuted its first rule under this approach. It governs emissions of fine particulate matter from methane gas turbines used in power plants. Former agency officials said the decision not to monetize health benefits would lead to a bias against limiting pollutants like soot and dust, which could in turn lead to much dirtier air.

“A key governing principle of benefit cost assessment is to account for all of the benefits and all of the costs,” said Chris Frey, a professor of civil engineering at North Carolina State University and a former assistant administrator for research and development at the EPA. “The assessment is not valid if it excludes known benefits or costs. That there is uncertainty is not a sufficient reason not to conduct an assessment.”

In response to questions from Grist, an EPA representative said that the agency’s pause on monetizing health costs was temporary, and that it would resume quantifying those costs when it had better data.

“EPA absolutely remains committed to our core mission of protecting human health and the environment, that mission guides every decision we make,” the representative said. “EPA, like the agency always has, is still considering the impacts that [particulate matter] and ozone emissions have on human health, but the agency will not be monetizing the impacts at this time.” The agency didn’t respond to questions about how it will incorporate health costs into its analyses without quantifying them, or about legal arguments against its endangerment finding repeal.

But experts and former agency officials said the pause on health costs and the greenhouse gas rule repeal both represent departures from the agency’s core mission. As Perciasepe sees it, if the agency doesn’t take an active role in restricting major pollutants, it is straying from its original mandate to protect public health, as established in laws like the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.

“When you start to go down this road to devalue the economic cost of poor public health, you do undermine the whole reason for … all these laws that were enacted in the 1970s when there was this gross impact from pollution on the quality of life in the United States,” he said.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2200431267-e1749764769732.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2026-01-16 10:00:55.701650

It Could Get Messy.,"Claire Brown, Brad Plumer, www.nytimes.com, claire-brown, brad-plumer",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/16/climate/trump-coal-plants.html,"Administration officials say that keeping coal plants open is necessary to avoid blackouts and meet rising energy needs.
“This makes no economic sense or functional sense, to extend the life of an effectively broken coal plant,” said Gov.
Some local officials and unions have cheered the lifeline for coal plants, which are often an engine of local economic activity.
“We will continue to suffer.” Mounting costs, legal threats The cost to keep coal plants open could prove especially divisive.
The Environmental Protection Agency is rolling back numerous air pollution and climate rules that have made coal plants more costly to operate.","Over the past eight months, the Energy Department has taken the extraordinary step of ordering that generators at five coal-burning power plants that had been headed for retirement stay open and keep running.

That’s just the beginning, officials say.

At a White House event on Thursday, Trump administration officials said they planned to keep open as many coal plants as they could and prevent any further retirements over the next three years.

“The goal is to stop the political closure of coal plants,” Chris Wright, the energy secretary, said during the first meeting of the National Coal Council, which had lapsed under the Biden administration but which President Trump has revived. Dozens of representatives from the coal industry were present.

The moves are part of a sweeping plan by Mr. Trump to revive America’s coal industry, which has been declining for years. Mr. Trump has expressed a certain affection for the fuel, calling it “beautiful clean coal” to goad environmentalists, who note that coal is the dirtiest of fossil fuels and a major driver of global warming.

Administration officials say that keeping coal plants open is necessary to avoid blackouts and meet rising energy needs.

On the ground, however, efforts to halt coal retirements are already causing complications. Two of the coal units that the Energy Department ordered to stay online in December are broken, and it’s unclear when they might be repaired.

Some plants that were ordered to keep running had already shuttered their coal mines and stopped maintaining old equipment. Now, utilities and operators are straining to revive them. The costs of extending coal-burning plants are significant, and federal and state regulators are embroiled in disputes over who will ultimately pay.

“These are old plants, and they are expensive to refurbish and keep open,” said Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard Law School’s Electricity Law Initiative. “The costs are going to fall on somebody. The question is whether it’s the plant owners or the public.”

Since 2005, the number of operating coal plants in the United States had been declining precipitously as utilities switched to cheaper and cleaner natural gas, wind and solar power. Even Mr. Trump in his first term couldn’t stop the slide; more than 150 coal-burning units shut down between 2017 and 2020.

This time around, the Trump administration has gone much further to rescue coal, with more success. Last year, the amount of electricity produced by coal increased 13 percent, and retirements have slowed.

The administration has been aided by a surge in electricity demand nationwide driven by a boom in data centers, which has led some utilities to postpone coal plant closures. Federal agencies have also rolled back environmental regulations on coal, which produces more air pollution than other sources like natural gas. Burning coal also emits mercury, a powerful neurotoxin, and other heavy metals.

Even more drastic, however, has been the Energy Department’s use of emergency orders to mandate that coal plants that had been set to retire keep operating, as the agency has invoked Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act.

Historically, this provision has been used to keep plants online during temporary emergencies such as hurricanes or heat waves. But the Trump administration has claimed that the emergency this time is an expected shortage of reliable power over the next decade, and officials are trying to avert as many closures as they can.

The impact is already visible: At the start of last year, utilities were expected to close roughly 8.5 gigawatts of coal capacity in 2025, according to federal data. But they ended up retiring only 2.7 gigawatts, the lowest amount since 2011.

“I think you will not see those plants close during this administration,” Mr. Wright said, adding that there might be a few exceptions for the very oldest plants.

Mr. Wright said he hoped other actions by the administration to support coal would eventually make emergency orders “unnecessary.” But, he claimed, many utilities were quietly welcoming the orders to save coal plants at imminent risk of closure. “We get a lot of inbound calls now saying, ‘Can you 202(c) this plant?’”

Those orders are also facing a backlash. Environmental groups and states like Michigan and Washington are mounting legal challenges. The grid operator in the Midwest and state officials in Colorado have said their regions already have adequate electrical capacity, even with coal retirements.

“Using a blunt instrument like this to keep the legacy coal fleet online could backfire,” said Devin Hartman, director of energy and environmental policy at the R Street Institute. “There are a ton of risks.”

Broken plants, busy railroads

Reviving a geriatric coal fleet isn’t easy: Many plants are more than 50 years old and need major repairs.

On the shores of Lake Michigan, the J.H. Campbell coal plant was set to retire last May under a plan backed by the state and the electric utility that operates it, Consumers Energy. But, at the last minute, the Energy Department ordered that the plant’s three coal units stay open for 90 days during the summer. The agency has since twice renewed the order and is widely expected to order that the plant remain open indefinitely.

That created headaches for the operator, which had canceled roughly $161 million in maintenance for the plant in the years leading up to the scheduled retirement, according to one engineer’s testimony. The plant has struggled to generate reliable power: One unit faced extended outages in June and produced electricity for only a handful of days, according to legal filings by environmental groups.

Other plants may be in rougher shape.

In December, the Energy Department ordered that the R.M. Schahfer plant in northern Indiana keep two coal units operating past their planned retirement. Yet one of those units has been offline since the summer because of a turbine failure.

Repairing the unit could ultimately take “six months or longer,” Vince Parisi, the chief operating officer of the Northern Indiana Public Service Company, which owns the plant, told regulators last month. “It’s just the reality of that unit being close to retirement.”

In Colorado, a rural electric cooperative had been planning since 2016 to close a coal-burning unit at the Craig Generating Station. Last month, the Energy Department ordered that the unit stay open. Yet the coal unit is offline because of a broken valve, and it is unclear how long it will take to fix it.

There’s also the question of where to get fuel.

Until recently, the Craig unit in Colorado obtained some of its coal from a local mine operated by its part owner, the Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association. But that mine closed last year, laying off all its workers.

“This makes no economic sense or functional sense, to extend the life of an effectively broken coal plant,” said Gov. Jared Polis, Democrat of Colorado, who opposes the order and says the federal government had done little to consult with the state.

Last month, when Bob Guenther drove past the coal-burning power plant in Centralia, Wash., where he worked for 34 years before retirement, there wasn’t much coal in sight. The power plant had been winding down for years and was scheduled to close by Dec. 31 until the Energy Department ordered that it stay open. Coal piles that once filled acres had dwindled.

Some local officials and unions have cheered the lifeline for coal plants, which are often an engine of local economic activity. But environmental groups have pointed to the hazards from air pollution and coal-ash waste.

“Northwest Indiana has long borne the brunt of industrial pollution,” said Ashley Williams, the executive director of Just Transition Northwest Indiana, a nonprofit group, criticizing the order to keep the R.M. Schahfer plant open. “We will continue to suffer.”

Mounting costs, legal threats

The cost to keep coal plants open could prove especially divisive.

In Michigan, Consumers Energy spent $164 million from May to September to keep its coal plant running, according to regulatory filings. During that time, the plant earned only $84 million in revenue.

It remains to be seen who will ultimately pay for the rest. Consumers Energy has proposed that the costs be shared by ratepayers in multiple states in the Midwestern regional grid, rather than paid for by its customers alone. But other groups have challenged this proposal.

The Environmental Protection Agency is rolling back numerous air pollution and climate rules that have made coal plants more costly to operate. It has also given electric utilities more time to clean up contamination from toxic coal ash landfills.

At the same time, the Energy Department has offered up to $350 million to try to bring back to life coal plants that have already closed.

Michelle Bloodworth, chief executive of America’s Power, a coal trade group, estimates that at least 29 coal units with roughly 13 gigawatts of capacity have recently closed but are not yet demolished and could be candidates for restarting. She added that more utilities were voluntarily postponing coal retirements and that the future for the industry is looking brighter under the Trump administration.

“There’s a huge opportunity for the coal fleet,” Ms. Bloodworth said. “It’s a big change after years and years of punitive environmental regulations.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/16/multimedia/16cli-trump-coal-03-lpjt/16cli-trump-coal-03-lpjt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 05:58:54.356658

As electrification reshapes energy use nationwide, the duty to serve does not need to be reinvented.","Electric utilities have a well-established legal obligation to provide safe, reliable and reasonably priced electricity to customers in their service territories. That ‘duty to serve’ has long adapted to changing system conditions. Today, rapid electrification – driven by electric vehicles, building electrification, manufacturing and data center growth – is testing whether utilities are fully meeting that duty under modern circumstances.

Our recent Energy Law Journal article, Utilities’ Duty to Serve in an Era of End-Use Electrification, examines how traditional duty-to-serve principles apply to distribution systems experiencing renewed and uneven load growth. The article reaches a clear conclusion: many actions now framed as policy reforms are better understood as applications of utilities’ existing legal obligations to new factual realities.

Why the duty to serve matters now

For decades, electricity demand grew slowly, and utilities planned accordingly. That era has ended. Electrification of transportation, buildings and industry is driving significant new demand – often in large, concentrated increments that develop faster than traditional planning cycles.

These changes raise a core legal question: what does the duty to serve require when future demand is reasonably foreseeable, even if customers have not yet submitted formal service requests?

Anticipatory planning is part of the duty

Utilities have never planned the grid solely in response to customer requests. Load forecasting has always been a core utility function, and regulators have consistently expected utilities to anticipate demand to maintain system adequacy and reliability. What has changed is the pace and scale of electrification.

Under these conditions, the duty to serve already includes an obligation to plan for foreseeable changes in customers’ energy needs. Waiting to act until customers arrive can lead to unreasonable delays and inequitable outcomes. Where electrification trends are well documented, failure to plan for them may itself fall short of the duty to serve.

This is not a shift in the law. It is an application of settled legal principles to changing facts.

Adequacy and timeliness remain central

The duty to serve requires more than eventual service – it requires service that is adequate and timely. Lengthy delays in connecting EV chargers, heat pumps or electrified industrial facilities increasingly impede climate goals, economic development and equitable access to clean energy.

Utilities must ensure that forecasting translates into operational readiness. Regulators, in turn, should assess utility performance against these legal standards, ensuring utilities prepare their systems to meet foreseeable demand without compromising affordability or reliability for current customers.

Applying existing law to the energy transition

Interpreting the duty to serve in light of today’s electrification supports faster infrastructure deployment, more equitable access to clean energy, lower emissions and sustained economic growth. Several state commissions have already begun moving in this direction through proactive planning and interconnection reforms – efforts that reflect enforcement of existing obligations, not expansion of regulatory authority.

As electrification reshapes energy use nationwide, the duty to serve does not need to be reinvented. It needs to be applied. Anticipatory planning, timely investment and high-quality service are already core legal requirements – and they are essential to building a reliable, affordable and equitable electric grid for the future.",https://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/wp-content/blogs.dir/38/files//getty-images-ge9ZyCiLcjE-unsplash-scaled.jpeg,N,,2026-01-16 05:58:38.173721

“It can be said that our meeting last year opened a new chapter in turning China–Canada relations toward improvement,” China’s top leader said.

Carney made the announcement after two days of meetings with Chinese leaders. He said there would be an initial annual cap of 49,000 vehicles on Chinese EV exports to Canada, growing to about 70,000 over five years. China will reduce its total tariff on canola seeds, a major Canadian export, from 84% to about 15%, he told reporters.

Carney said China has become a more predictable partner to deal with than the U.S, the country’s neighbor and longtime ally.

“Our relationship has progressed in recent months with China. It is more predictable and you see results coming from that,” Carney said.

Carney hasn’t been able to reach a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump to reduce some tariffs that are punishing some key sectors of the Canadian economy and Trump has previously talked about making Canada the 51st state.

The prime minister, speaking outside against the backdrop of a traditional pavilion and a frozen pond at a Beijing park, said meetings in China have been historic and productive.

Earlier Friday, he and Chinese leader Xi Jinping pledged to improve relations between their two nations after years of acrimony.

Xi told Carney in a meeting at the Great Hall of the People that he is willing to continue working to improve ties, noting that talks have been underway on restoring and restarting cooperation since the two held an initial meeting in October on the sidelines of a regional economic conference in South Korea.

“It can be said that our meeting last year opened a new chapter in turning China–Canada relations toward improvement,” China’s top leader said.

Carney looks to improve global governance

Carney, the first Canadian prime minister to visit China in eight years, told Xi that better relations would help improve a global governance system that he described as “under great strain.”

Later, he said at the news conference that the system may give way at least in part to country-to-country or regional agreements rather than the global ones that have underpinned economic growth in the post-World War II era.

“The question is: What gets built in that place? How much of a patchwork is it?” he said.

The new reality reflects in large part the so-called America-first approach of Trump. The tariffs he has imposed have hit both the Canadian and Chinese economies. Carney, who has met with several leading Chinese companies in Beijing, said ahead of his trip that his government is focused on building an economy less reliant on the U.S. at what he called “a time of global trade disruption.”

A Canadian business owner in China called Carney’s visit game-changing, saying it re-establishes dialogue, respect and a framework between the two nations.

“These three things we didn’t have,” said Jacob Cooke, the CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, which helps exporters navigate the Chinese market. “The parties were not talking for years.”

Canada had been aligned with US on tariffs

Canada had followed the U.S. in putting tariffs of 100% on EVs from China and 25% on steel and aluminum under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Carney’s predecessor.

China responded by imposing duties of 100% on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25% on pork and seafood. It added a 75.8% tariff on canola seeds last August. Collectively, the import taxes effectively closed the Chinese market to Canadian canola, an industry group has said. Overall, China’s imports from Canada fell 10.4% last year to $41.7 billion, according to Chinese trade data.

Carney tried to address the concerns of Canadian automakers and auto workers by saying the initial cap on Chinese EV imports was about 3% of the 1.8 million vehicles sold in Canada annually and that, in exchange, China is expected to begin investing in the Canadian auto industry within three years.

More than half of the Chinese EVs exported to Canada would have an import price of less than 35,000 Canadian dollars ($25,000) within five years, he said, making them accessible to consumers.

“We’re building (a) new part of our car industry, building cars of the future in partnership, bringing affordable autos for Canadians at a time when affordability is top of mind, and doing it at a scale that allows for a smooth transition in the sector,” he said.

“For the exchange of a small piece of the Canadian market, we have a commitment. We are waiting for an investment commitment in Canada. The real leaders of the new industry. So it’s an agreement that will create the future for our industry.”

China sees an opening under

Trump

China is hoping Trump’s pressure tactics on allies such as Canada will drive them to pursue a foreign policy that is less aligned with the United States. The U.S. president has suggested Canada could become America’s 51st state.

Carney, though, noted Canada’s relationship with the U.S. is much more multifaceted, deeper and broader. Canada and China have different systems and disagree on issues such as human rights, he said, limiting the scope of their engagement even as they seek ways to cooperate on areas of common interest.

The Canadian leader leaves China on Saturday and visits Qatar on Sunday before attending the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum in Switzerland next week. He will meet business leaders and investors in Qatar to promote trade and investment, his office said.

But the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have slammed the breaks on an industry that had doubled its output in just three years south of the border.

In 2025, tariffs on parts components coming from outside North America and Trump’s elimination of tax credits on the purchase of electric vehicles hit Mexican EV production and overall vehicle exports hard, Finance Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Thursday.

“We closed (2025) with a reduction of just under 3 percent (in overall vehicle exports). It’s not as much as we had expected. We were bracing for a much bigger impact,” Ebrard said. “Everyone is (realigning) its production lines. Also, the U.S. did away with incentives of $7,500 on electric vehicles […] So, what happened? Demand fell.”

Ebrard said the future of EV production in Mexico will continue to hinge on U.S. consumer appetite. Mexico in 2024 exported 2.8 million total light vehicles to the United States. “Mexico produces a lot of electrical vehicles, so it’s part of that 3 percent” drop, the finance minister said, without specifying a percentile decrease in EV production.

Speaking at a news conference in Mexico City broadcast on YouTube, Ebrard expanded on how car manufacturers in Mexico are adjusting to U.S. tariffs.

He said exporters – including U.S. companies assembling cars in Mexican plants – sent their vehicles to the American market either under Most Favored Nation status or through the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement .

It’s easier to avoid tariffs of up to 27.5 percent by complying with rules of origin under the treaty, so 85 out of 100 automakers operating in Mexico are using that mechanism, he said.

“All the automakers who invested in adding North American content have a discount from that 27.5, down to 13 percent on average. If you don’t have parts from North America, your tariff is higher,” Ebrard said.

He added Mexican negotiators will be discussing the tariffs with their U.S. and Canadian during this summer’s USMCA review to ensure they are done under the framework of the agreement.",https://www.krqe.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2026/01/65710bd8733dc9.28598705-e1746111515993.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-16 10:01:00.138156

That is the conclusion of a new McKinsey & Company analysis tracking progress across nine key decarbonisation technologies.

The report, Tracking the energy transition: where are we now?, shows renewable capacity has risen by 585GW, a 15% increase, while global electric vehicle sales grew 25% to around 17 million units. Solar photovoltaic deployment continues to surge, driven by falling costs and rapid buildout.

However, McKinsey finds that too few projects are reaching final investment decision across major regions. This shortfall affects mature technologies such as wind and solar, as well as emerging solutions including green hydrogen and sustainable fuels.

When operational, under-construction and FID-approved capacity are combined across China, Europe and the US, the analysis suggests many 2030 milestones will not be met. Less than 15% of the low-emissions technologies required for Paris-aligned pathways have been deployed, while global emissions rose 9% between 2015 and 2024.

“The progress landscape is nuanced by region and technology and while achieving energy transition commitments remain paramount for countries and companies alike, recent announcements indicate that shifting priorities and slowing momentum have led to project pauses and cancellations across technologies,” said Diego Hernandez Diaz, McKinsey partner and co-author.

China continues to lead deployment and pipeline growth, particularly in solar, having already exceeded its 2030 PV target. By contrast, all three regions are off track on offshore wind and battery energy storage systems, both critical to integrating renewables and reducing emissions.

“BESS remains the dominant question mark as the current pipeline is not sufficient to meet targets,” Hernandez Diaz added.

Earlier today, I testified at the California Assembly and Energy and Utilities committee in support of AB 710 by Asm. Irwin. If passed, the bill would set deadlines for electrical corporations in California to set up an important energy efficiency initiative- dynamic pricing and smart meters. The bill passed the policy committee with 11 aye votes!

My testimony:

“Good afternoon, Chair Petrie Norris and Committee members.

My name is Caleb Weis and I’m the Clean Energy Associate at Environment California. I’m here to express our strong support of AB 710.

California has long been a national leader in both renewable energy deployment and the establishment of commitments to shift its energy supply further towards clean and renewable energy.

Despite our successes, we continue to face challenges when it comes to the achievement of those clean and renewable energy commitments. One of the primary challenges is colloquially known as California’s duck curve, which describes the mismatch between abundant renewable energy supply during the daytime and the peaks in energy demand during the mornings and evenings. As a result of this mismatch, California often curtails, or wastes, renewable energy during the daytime, while relying on dirty, expensive energy during the hours of highest energy demand.

In fact, in 2025 alone, California curtailed over 3.7 million MWh of wind and solar energy, and total curtailment has been rising every year since 2015.

A clear solution to this challenge is the increased implementation of policies to encourage load-shifting. Load-shifting is the process of incentivizing and enabling customers to consume more energy during hours of renewable energy abundance, and less energy during hours when dirty, polluting energy sources prevail.

AB 710 would promote load-shifting by setting deadlines for electrical corporations to establish dynamic pricing programs which are available to all customers, and to implement plans which ensure that all customers have the requisite technology to be able to fully participate in these programs, if they desire.

In contrast to our abundant renewable energy, we have no time to waste in our mission to shift California towards 100% renewable and clean energy, and this bill would establish reasonable timelines to help us to get there. Therefore, we respectfully urge your aye vote.”",https://environmentamerica.org/california/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-15-at-18.42.18-1024x577.png,N,,2026-01-16 09:00:12.694029

Since President Donald Trump took office nearly a year ago, his administration has announced at least two dozen policy and regulatory actions aimed at hindering the build-out of wind and solar projects, including rescinding federal tax credits, withdrawing grants and loans, and freezing permitting approvals. Yet one measure in particular has had an outsize chilling effect — and is facing a new legal challenge from wind and solar groups.

Last summer, the U.S. Interior Department announced that all decisions related to wind and solar projects would require an ​“elevated review” by Secretary Doug Burgum, saying this would end the Biden administration’s ​“preferential treatment” for renewables. In a July memo, the agency listed nearly 70 types of permits and other actions that now need Burgum’s personal sign-off, adding cost and time and creating significant anxiety for developers, experts say.

Over 22 gigawatts of utility-scale wind and solar projects on public lands have been canceled or are held up as a result of the order, according to Wood Mackenzie data and the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management website. That’s enough capacity to power roughly 16.5 million U.S. homes — a significant amount at any point, but especially when the country is clamoring for more low-cost electricity as energy demand and utility bills soar.

“We’re seeing electricity costs go up all around the country, and the cheapest electrons that we can put into the supply side of that equation are all stuck on Secretary Burgum’s desk,” Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) told Canary Media.

Solar represents the bulk of that figure, with 18 GW of facilities scrapped or considered inactive as of December, by Wood Mackenzie’s count. Nearly 90% of those projects also included energy storage, given that many were slated for desert regions in the Southwest, said Kaitlin Fung, a research analyst for the consultancy.

“It’s created a choke point,” Fung said of Interior’s memo. She noted that the Bureau of Land Management has advanced permits for only one renewable energy project since July: the 700-megawatt Libra Solar facility in Nevada. Meanwhile, federal oil and gas permits have surged in the first year of Trump’s term.

Many other projects remain stuck in permitting limbo as developers await the approvals they need — from quick consultations to complex reviews — in order to secure financing and begin building their large-scale renewable energy installations. That’s true for wind and solar farms on private and state lands as well, since those projects might require federal approval for things like wildlife and waterway impacts.

The holdups are occurring as the United States teeters on the edge of an electricity crisis. Demand is climbing across the nation, causing household utility bills to soar, and more power plants are needed to satisfy the surge in AI data centers, factories, and electrified cars and buildings. Large-scale solar and onshore wind projects are among the fastest and lowest-cost ways to add power to the grid — faster than Trump’s preferred path of building new gas-fired power plants or restarting shuttered nuclear reactors.

Heinrich, the ranking member of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, cited the gigawatts of stalled projects in a Senate floor speech earlier this month. He and other Democratic leaders have said that any efforts to pass bipartisan legislation on energy permitting reform are ​“dead in the water” so long as the Trump administration continues to block development of onshore wind and solar and cancel fully permitted offshore wind farms.

“The concern is that we put a balanced legislative package together that gives certainty to both traditional [oil and gas] energy and renewables — but if this administration is going to say yes to all of the fossil projects and create a de facto moratorium on all of the renewable and storage projects, then we haven’t accomplished anything,” Heinrich said by phone.

In recent weeks, a coalition of clean energy organizations sued to overturn the July memo and other actions from Interior and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which issues permits for energy projects near navigable waters. Both the Army Corps and Interior say they’re prioritizing projects that generate the most energy per acre, a measure that favors coal, oil, and gas and undercuts renewables — and which has its roots in fossil-fuel industry misinformation.

Such actions ​“arbitrarily and discriminatorily place wind and solar technologies into a second-class status compared to other energy sources,” the groups said in a statement this week. ​“The Trump administration has choked private developers’ ability to build new and urgently needed energy projects across the nation.”

For solar and storage in particular, nearly 520 proposed projects totaling 117 GW of capacity have yet to receive all the necessary federal, state, and local permits, which puts them at risk of being delayed by the Trump administration, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. The projects represent half of the country’s new planned power capacity.

Many developers are simply receiving radio silence from agencies whose approval or advice they need, said Ben Norris, SEIA’s vice president of regulatory affairs, who likened the agencies’ actions to a ​“blockade on solar permits.” Fung noted one mundane but significant effect of Interior’s memo: Wind and solar developers are now excluded from using an online government planning tool that helps streamline environmental reviews, a move that creates additional costs and complexity for companies.

The delays come as developers are racing to qualify for federal tax credits under the newly shortened timelines. Wind and solar installations must either start construction this summer or be operating by the end of 2027 to access incentives. ​“Time is really of the essence for many of these projects,” Norris said. In the absence of Congress passing a permitting-reform bill, he added, the Trump administration could simply remove many of the roadblocks it created by revoking its memos and other actions.

“If they were really serious about affordability and addressing power bills, they could take these steps today,” he said.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Solar-and-wind-in-Arizona_-GettyImages-640894904.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=1a21004475b9902e39aa8ac2b33467bf,N,,2026-01-16 05:58:45.419760

There’s a lot happening right now in U.S. energy and policy and it’s easy to lose track of the larger picture. I’m going to ask you to turn your attention, at least for a few minutes, to something bigger that’s also happening:

Solar power is moving toward dominance of the global energy system.

The trend lines for solar deployment, panel prices and efficiency all point to a future in which energy is cleaner, cheaper and more accessible than today.

A recent paper in Nature Energy summarizes where we’re likely heading. It lists more than 60 co-authors from some of the world’s leading research institutions, including the National Laboratory of the Rockies (which was the National Renewable Energy Laboratory before a recent name change), the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems in Germany and the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Japan.

“The global growth of photovoltaics for electricity generation has been remarkable, outpacing other energy technologies across history in rates of the expansion of manufacturing capacity and reduction in price,” said the paper.

As this continues, some of the main technological and policy challenges will involve designing an energy system that can operate with high levels of solar. Planners will need to develop a variety of power plants and energy-storage technologies to support the grid at night and during periods of low solar generation.

I spoke with Sarah Kurtz, an electrical engineering professor at the University of California, Merced and a co-author of the paper. She explained that the success of solar energy largely depends on the fact that the fuel—the sun—is free and plentiful.

“In one hour, the Earth receives enough light from the sun to power the world for the whole year,” she said.

She is a prolific researcher who has focused on improving solar panel performance, work she has focused on since the mid-1980s.

Andreas Bett, director of the Fraunhofer Institute and a co-author of the paper, said the growth of solar power has profound implications for making energy affordable and accessible. Solar is already the least expensive energy source in most of the world.

“There is no fundamental limit or resource problem for photovoltaic technology,” he said in an email. “It is a technology that will advance the prosperity of the entire global community. Nevertheless, it is important to continue developing the technology in order to ultimately achieve higher efficiency levels and thus reduce material consumption.”

The paper draws on discussions at the Terawatt Workshop, a gathering of solar researchers hosted in California in June 2024.

It begins by noting that the world now has 2 terawatts of solar photovoltaic generating capacity installed, which includes utility-scale and smaller systems. That’s a huge number, more than double what it was in 2022, according to the International Energy Agency.

Based on current manufacturing capacity and growth forecasts, the world is on track to install about 75 terawatts of solar by 2050, the paper said. This indicates growth on a transformational scale.

Solar power would expand because of a combination of declining panel prices and increasing efficiency. Today, a highly efficient panel can convert about 30 percent of the solar radiation striking it into electricity. The paper identifies technological improvements that could increase efficiency to 35 percent by mid-century.

As panels become more efficient, projects require fewer of them to generate the same amount of electricity, which saves land and materials.

To understand where we’re heading, it’s helpful to understand where we are. As of 2024, renewable energy sources produced 32 percent of the world’s electricity and were on the verge of overtaking coal as the global leader, according to the IEA.

Hydropower was the world’s leading source of renewable electricity in 2024, followed by wind and then solar. But solar, which was 7 percent of global electricity generation, is growing the fastest and is on track to become the largest source.

For governments and businesses, success in the energy economy of the future will depend on maximizing the benefits of solar and adapting to a grid dominated by solar.

Much of the world seems to understand this, but the United States under President Donald Trump is heading in the opposite direction with policies that favor fossil fuels and eliminate tax incentives for solar. The Trump administration often talks about this as a desire to achieve “energy dominance” through increasing production of coal, oil and natural gas.

“(M)y energy policy is defined by maximum production, maximum prosperity, and maximum power,” Trump said in an Oct. 17 proclamation designating “National Energy Dominance Month.”

I asked Bett what he makes of recent energy decisions by U.S. leadership.

“In my personal opinion, it is a mistake for the U.S. government to cut subsidies for photovoltaics,” he said. “It is the technology of the future and will be implemented worldwide. Developments will now progress outside the U.S.—especially in China, which will be able to establish itself as the sole global market leader. It is a shame that a high-tech nation like the U.S. is turning its back on a high-tech development.”

Kurtz said it’s shortsighted for the United States to not try to be a leader in solar.

“Solar is such a strong technology that the U.S. not supporting it will not be able to stop it,” she said. “The U.S. may get left behind.”",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-69.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 09:00:16.425802

Disruptions to supplies of solar panels, steel and critical minerals also threaten the transition to net zero carbon emissions and jobs in regions already weakened by industrial decline, the report said.
China dominates the refinement of most critical minerals and has reverted to export controls for those that are in scarce supply.
It said the government should invest in domestic production, diversify supply with allies, build strategic stockpiles and set out a clear stance on Chinese involvement in the most critical supply chains.
“The UK is a small open trading nation sailing through an international economy whose waters are getting choppier by the day,” Narayanan said.","Britain risks widespread job losses across the clean-energy sector if global supply chains are hit by shocks, according to a new report that warns the country is too reliant on China for its climate ambitions.

The UK currently sources about a third of its battery imports from China, and Japan is the leading supplier of cathodes and anodes, the two major components that go into battery cells. It means plans to ramp up domestic battery manufacturing by 2030 will remain heavily reliant on parts made overseas.

Modelling by the Institute for Public Policy Research found that a yearlong interruption at the main suppliers of battery parts could cost as many as 90,000 UK jobs and wipe out production of more than 580,000 electric vehicles from 2030.

Such a shock would leave domestic carmakers ceding ground to Chinese electric-vehicle manufacturers, with BYD Co. already increasing its UK market share from 0.5% to 2.5% in 2025, and would ripple into other industries such as rail, aerospace and defense manufacturing, the think tank warned in a report published Friday.

Batteries are just one of the clean-energy areas where the UK is exposed to global markets, just as tensions intensify following US President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Disruptions to supplies of solar panels, steel and critical minerals also threaten the transition to net zero carbon emissions and jobs in regions already weakened by industrial decline, the report said.

“Trump’s trade war with China, the rise of conflicts around the world – these shocks ultimately hurt the UK economy because we rely so much on trade to source the essentials, including clean energy technologies,” said Pranesh Narayanan, senior research fellow at the IPPR.

The situation around critical minerals, which are key inputs for manufacturing clean-energy equipment, from battery components to permanent magnets used in wind turbines, is particularly concerning, the report said. China dominates the refinement of most critical minerals and has reverted to export controls for those that are in scarce supply.

The IPPR also estimated that delays to solar deployment and continued reliance on gas could also add about £1.5 billion ($2 billion) a year to energy import costs.

The researcher offered some policy recommendations to increase the UK’s energy resilience. It said the government should invest in domestic production, diversify supply with allies, build strategic stockpiles and set out a clear stance on Chinese involvement in the most critical supply chains.

“The UK is a small open trading nation sailing through an international economy whose waters are getting choppier by the day,” Narayanan said.

Trump expected to announce emergency power auction on Friday

Tech firms would be forced to fund new power plants for data centres

PJM would run the auction, potentially backing $15bn of new generation

Aim is to curb electricity price rises hitting households

Data-centre demand seen as key driver of grid strain

President Donald Trump is expected to announce an unprecedented intervention in U.S. power markets, unveiling plans for an “emergency power auction” that would require major technology companies to directly fund new electricity generation to support the rapid expansion of data centres.

Under the proposal, the country’s largest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, would be directed to run a special reliability auction designed to accelerate the construction of new power plants. The initiative could underpin as much as $15 billion in new generation capacity, according to officials familiar with the plan.

The move reflects growing concern within the administration and among state leaders that surging electricity demand from artificial intelligence and cloud-computing infrastructure is outpacing supply, pushing household power bills higher and fuelling political backlash. PJM’s network spans 13 states from the Mid-Atlantic to the Midwest and serves more than 67 million people, making it one of the most exposed regions to data-centre-driven demand growth.

Under the proposed structure, technology companies would bid for long-term contracts tied to new power generation, effectively paying to secure the electricity required for their data centres. The aim is to ensure the cost of new power plants does not fall on households, while addressing reliability concerns on an overstretched grid.

Trump has repeatedly argued that data-centre operators should bear responsibility for the power they consume, saying this week he does not want American households paying higher electricity bills because of AI infrastructure. Electricity affordability has become a central political issue ahead of November’s midterm elections, with power prices continuing to rise even as fuel costs have eased.

U.S. electricity prices have climbed sharply over the past year, with the average retail electricity price rising to a record, adding pressure to household budgets already strained by higher living costs.

The administration is framing the auction as a one-off emergency measure rather than a permanent shift in market design, intended to stabilise prices and ensure adequate supply before demand accelerates further. If implemented, the plan could also set a precedent for how other regions manage the collision between AI-driven power demand and aging electricity infrastructure.",https://images.investinglive.com/images/nuclear%20power_id_3676c20b-ed65-4816-ad3b-a28f7cd046e5_size975.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 08:59:47.793249

The Biden administration sought to increase demand for critical minerals domestically by pushing for more electric vehicle and windmill production.
But the Trump administration largely eliminated the incentives for those products and instead chose to focus on increasing critical minerals production directly.","WASHINGTON (AP) — A bipartisan group of lawmakers have proposed creating a new agency with $2.5 billion to spur production of rare earths and the other critical minerals, while the Trump administration has already taken aggressive actions to break China’s grip on the market for these materials that are crucial to high-tech products, including cellphones, electric vehicles, jet fighters and missiles.

It’s too early to tell how the bill, if passed, could align with the White House’s policy, but whatever the approach, the U.S. is in a crunch to drastically reduce its reliance on China, after Beijing used its dominance of the critical minerals market to gain leverage in the trade war with Washington. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a one-year truce in October, by which Beijing would continue to export critical minerals while the U.S. would ease its export controls of U.S. technology on China.

The Pentagon has shelled out nearly $5 billion over the past year to help ensure its access to the materials after the trade war laid bare just how beholden the U.S. is to China, which processes more than 90% of the world’s critical minerals. To break Beijing’s chokehold, the U.S. government is taking equity stakes in a handful of critical mineral companies and in some cases guaranteeing the price of some commodities using an approach that seems more likely to come out of China’s playbook instead of a Republican administration.

The bill that Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., introduced Thursday would favor a more market-based approach by setting up the independent body charged with building a stockpile of critical minerals and related products, stabilizing prices, and encouraging domestic and allied production to help ensure stable supply not only for the military but also the broader economy and manufacturers.

Shaheen called the legislation “a historic investment” to make the U.S. economy more resilient against China’s dominance that she said has left the U.S. vulnerable to economic coercion. Young said creating the new reserve is “a much-needed, aggressive step to protect our national and economic security.”

Rep. Rob Wittman, R.-Va., introduced the House version of the bill.

New sense of urgency

When Trump imposed widespread tariffs last spring, Beijing fought back not only with tit-for-tat tariffs but severe restrictions on the export of critical minerals, forcing Washington to back down and eventually agree to the truce when the leaders met in South Korea.

On Monday, in his speech at SpaceX, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth revealed that the Pentagon has in the past five months alone “deployed over $4.5 billion in capital commitments” to close six critical minerals deals that will “help free the United States from market manipulation.”

One of the deals involves a $150 million of preferred equity by the Pentagon in Atlantic Alumina Co. to save the country’s last alumina refinery and build its first large-scale gallium production facility in Louisiana.

Last year, the Pentagon announced it would buy $400 million of preferred stock in MP Materials, which owns the country’s only operational rare earths mine at Mountain Pass, California, and entered into a $1.4-billion joint partnership with ReElement Technologies Corp. to build up a domestic supply chain for rare earth magnets.

On Wednesday, Trump announced in a proclamation that the U.S. is “too reliant” on foreign-sourced critical minerals and directed his administration to negotiate better deals. He said possible remedies would include minimum import prices for certain critical minerals.

“Reshoring manufacturing that’s critical to our national and economic security is a top priority for the Trump administration,” said Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson.

The drastic move by the U.S. government to take equity stakes has prompted some analysts to observe that Washington is pivoting to some form of state capitalism to compete with Beijing.

“Despite the dangers of political interference, the strategic logic is compelling,” wrote Elly Rostoum, a senior fellow at the Washington-based research institute Center for European Policy Analysis. She suggested that the new model could be “a prudent way for the U.S. to ensure strategic autonomy and industrial sovereignty.”

Companies across the industry are welcoming the intervention from Trump’s administration.

“He is playing three-dimensional chess on critical minerals like no previous president has done. It’s about time too, given the military and strategic vulnerability we face by having to import so many of these fundamental building blocks of technology and national defense,” NioCorp’s Chief Communications Officer Jim Sims said. That company is trying to finish raising the money it needs to build a mine in southeast Nebraska.

Relying on allies for help

In addition to trying to boost domestic production, the Trump administration has sought to secure some of these crucial elements through allies. In October, Trump signed an $8.5 billion agreement with Australia to invest in mining there, and the president is now aggressively trying to take over Greenland in the hope of being able to one day extract rare earths from there.

On Monday, finance ministers from the G7 nations huddled in Washington over their vulnerability in the critical mineral supply chains.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has led several rounds of trade negotiations with Beijing, urged attendees to increase their supply chain resiliency and thanked them for their willingness to work together “toward decisive action and lasting solutions,” according to a Treasury statement.

The bill introduced on Thursday by Shaheen and Young would encourage production with both domestic and allied producers.

Past efforts to bolster rare earths production

Congress in the past several years has pushed for legislation to protect the U.S. military and civilian industry from Beijing’s chokehold. The issue became a pressing concern every time China turned to its proven tactics of either restricting the supply or turned to dumping extra critical minerals on the market to depress prices and drive any potential competitors out of business.

The Biden administration sought to increase demand for critical minerals domestically by pushing for more electric vehicle and windmill production. But the Trump administration largely eliminated the incentives for those products and instead chose to focus on increasing critical minerals production directly.

Most of those past efforts were on a much more limited scale than what the government has done in the past year, and they were largely abandoned after China relented and eased access to critical minerals.

A US auto giant is in discussions with the Chinese electric vehicle (EV) giant BYD to acquire batteries for some of its hybrid-vehicle models, the Wall Street Journal reported late Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The terms of the agreement are still being discussed by the two businesses. The sources said some sources suggested Ford would import batteries from BYD to its plants located outside the US.

According to the sources, negotiations are still ongoing and it is possible that a deal may not be reached.

If a deal is finalized, it would unite Ford with the biggest Chinese automaker, which has alarmed a huge portion of the American auto industry due to its capacity to manufacture reasonably priced vehicles with advanced technology.

For Ford, it would resolve an issue, since the corporation needs a battery source as it retreats from electric vehicles and expands its range of hybrid vehicles, and BYD can manufacture premium automobile batteries.

Prior to becoming one of the world's largest automakers, BYD had a strong battery manufacturing company that made batteries for hybrid vehicles. The majority of batteries are now produced in China, but as it grows in regions including Southeast Asia, Europe, and Brazil, the company is increasing capacity in its plants abroad.

In response to declining demand, Ford announced last month that it would stop producing EVs and accept an estimated $19.5 billion in charges mainly related to its EV business. The business stated that by 2030, hybrid, extended-range plug-in hybrid, and all-electric vehicles will account for about half of its worldwide sales volume.

Ford intends to increase the number of gas-powered cars in its inventory and also boost the number of hybrid vehicle alternatives. Ford needs more batteries suitable for hybrid cars in order to achieve that.

At its bus manufacturing facility in California, BYD has produced some batteries for commercial vehicles, but it has not produced any batteries for passenger cars in the US.

After the news, US President Donald Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro criticized the plan on US social media company X.

“So Ford wants to simultaneously prop up a Chinese competitor’s supply chain and make it more vulnerable to that same supply chain extortion?” he wrote. “What could go wrong here?”",https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2026/01/16/thumbs_b_c_37b1ca0baa869a487d9ab8a1bad2be8d.jpg?v=102605,N,,2026-01-16 05:58:32.642667

The White House said its National Energy Dominance Council and the governors of several states, including Pennsylvania, Ohio and Virginia, want to try to compel PJM Interconnection to hold a power auction for tech companies to bid on contracts to build new power plants,

The Trump administration and governors will sign a statement of principles toward that end Friday. The plan was first reported by Bloomberg.

“Ensuring the American people have reliable and affordable electricity is one of President Trump’s top priorities, and this would deliver much-needed, long-term relief to the mid-Atlantic region,"" said Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro is expected to be at the White House, a person familiar with Shapiro’s plans said, speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of the announcement. Shapiro, a Democrat, made his participation in Friday’s event contingent on including a provision to extend a limit on wholesale electricity price increases for the region’s consumers, the person said.

But the operator of the grid won't be there. “PJM was not invited. Therefore we would not attend,” said spokesperson Jeff Shields.

It was not immediately clear whether President Donald Trump would attend the event, which was not listed on his public schedule.

Trump and the governors are under pressure to insulate consumers and businesses alike from the costs of feeding Big Tech’s energy-hungry data centers. Meanwhile, more Americans are falling behind on their electricity bills.

Consumer advocates say ratepayers in the mid-Atlantic electricity grid — which encompasses all or parts of 13 states stretching from New Jersey to Illinois, as well as Washington, D.C. — are already paying billions of dollars in higher bills to underwrite the cost to supply power to data centers, some of them built, some not.

However, they also say that the billions of dollars that consumers are paying isn’t resulting in the construction of new power plants necessary to meet the rising demand.

Pivotal contests in November will be decided by communities that are home to fast-rising electric bills or fights over who’s footing the bill for the data centers that underpin the explosion in demand for artificial intelligence. In parts of the country, data centers are coming online faster than power plants can be built and connected to the grid.

Electricity costs were a key issue in last year's elections for governor in New Jersey and Virginia, a data center hotspot, and in Georgia, where Democrats ousted two Republican incumbents for seats on the state’s utility regulatory commission. Voters in New Jersey, Virginia, California and New York City all cited economic concerns as the top issue, as Democrats and Republicans gird for a debate over affordability in the intensifying midterm battle to control Congress.

The demonstration vehicle is a 24,000-pound UPS package car, fitted with an EPA-patented full-series hydraulic hybrid drive integrated into the rear axle. The vehicle competed in the Michelin Challenge Bibendum in China with other advanced technology vehicles and received the top overall ranking among all commercial hybrid vehicles (delivery vehicles and urban buses).

World's First Full Hydraulic Hybrid in a Delivery Truck

Hydraulic Hybrid: The Most Efficient Lowest Cost Hybrids

Along with EPA (which worked for over 10 years with a wide variety of private and public sector organizations) and UPS, several other organizations contributed to the development of the hydraulic hybrid vehicle, including Eaton Corporation, International Truck and Engine Corporation, the U.S. Army, Morgan-Olson, the Ford Motor Company, Parker-Hannifin Corporation, Ricardo Inc., Michigan State University, the University of Michigan, and the University of Wisconsin.

Many heavy trucks that operate in urban areas are delivery vehicles, including package trucks, refuse trucks, and buses. These vehicles operate in heavy stop-go traffic and contribute to urban pollution and fuel consumption. A UPS truck is a good representative of the typical urban-based vehicle, making it an ideal pilot for the hydraulic hybrid. The UPS pilot vehicle demonstrates the cost effectiveness of hydraulic hybrid technology which can be applied to all trucks that operate in urban environments as well as highway vehicles.

In laboratory tests, the city fuel economy of the hydraulic hybrid UPS vehicle is 60% to 70% increased miles per gallon compared to a conventional UPS truck. The CO2 emissions of the demonstration UPS vehicle are more than 40% lower than a comparable conventional UPS vehicle. The hydraulic hybrid vehicle also achieves approximately 50% lower hydrocarbon and 60% lower particulate matter in laboratory tests. This prototype vehicle has also demonstrated modest reductions in NOx emissions. Optimized production vehicles are expected to have larger NOx reductions. Hydraulic hybrids are able to capture and reuse 70-80% of the otherwise wasted braking energy.

When commercialized in high volume, EPA estimates that the additional cost of hydraulic hybrid technology has the potential to be about $7,000 for the UPS package car. In today’s dollars, the net lifetime savings of this technology in a typical UPS truck, which is used for 20 years, would be over $50,000. If fuel prices continue to increase faster than inflation, the lifetime savings would be even greater. The current data demonstrates that hydraulic hybrid vehicles have great potential not only for large commercial urban vehicles but also for personal vehicles, especially larger personal vehicles such as large SUVs, pickups, and vans.

By working to commercialize this innovative technology, we can reduce greenhouse gases, reduce US energy consumption, and reduce our dependence on foreign oil. The use of hydraulic hybrid vehicles can also contribute to reduced air pollution which results in a cleaner environment and healthier people.",https://www.epa.gov/sites/all/themes/epa/img/epa-standard-og.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 11:02:26.528918

The framework has three “pillars,” or areas in which TCLP plans to work to reduce emissions.
Staff clarified they’d be tracking renewable energy certificates (RECs) attached to actual clean energy generation as they work toward the 100 percent target.
TCLP will seek to help the community reduce emissions by encouraging the electrification of buildings and transportation, as well as use of energy-efficient amenities.
Encouraging more EV use and energy-efficient heat pumps are examples of ways to reduce such emissions, Hites said.","Traverse City Light & Power board members unanimously approved a new “decarbonization framework” this week – a policy that outlines how the city-owned utility will reduce emissions and make progress toward its goal of using 100 percent renewable energy by 2040. Traverse City became the first city in the state to commit to that goal in 2018, though Michigan itself is now following suit as it aims to go clean by 2050 – with Governor Gretchen Whitmer announcing a new initiative Thursday to explore green energy resources.

TCLP Executive Director Brandie Ekren called this a “milestone moment” in the utility’s history as it prepares to execute the “audacious goal” set by the board in 2018. She and other staff laid out a framework that provides a “durable, outcomes-focused structure for how TCLP approaches decarbonization over the long term,” according to a team memo.

The framework has three “pillars,” or areas in which TCLP plans to work to reduce emissions. The first, called Power Supply, reiterates the utility’s commitment to go green by 2040 and hit an interim target of using 60 percent renewable energy by 2035. TCLP is at about 41 percent right now. TCLP will continue to transition its purchased power to clean sources like wind, solar, landfill gas, and others, according to the plan.

Staff clarified they’d be tracking renewable energy certificates (RECs) attached to actual clean energy generation as they work toward the 100 percent target. “We’re not purchasing RECs just to accomplish a goal,” Ekren said. “The idea is that we want generation attached to it.”

In addition to diversifying its portfolio, TCLP will continue to explore energy storage and “demand-side” solutions, the framework states. Demand-side solutions are those that encourage customers to manage or reduce their energy usage. Examples range from smart thermostats and electric vehicles (EVs) to TCLP’s recent transition to time-of-use rates, which trend higher when electricity is most in demand and expensive to produce and lower when costs and demand are lower.

Another pillar of the plan is Internal Operations. TCLP will “lead by example” by decarbonizing its own operations, including its fleet and workforce practices, said Sustainability and Climate Initiative Analyst Colin Hites. That will include a focus on electrifying the utility wherever possible and having sustainable procurement protocols, according to Hites. “This is really the walk-the-walk part of it,” he said, adding that TCLP would commit to “being climate leaders by taking care of our house.”

The third and final pillar is Community End Use. TCLP will seek to help the community reduce emissions by encouraging the electrification of buildings and transportation, as well as use of energy-efficient amenities. “In order to realize the full impact of cleaning the power supply as a means of mitigating the effects of climate change, you also have to electrify the end use to ensure that the benefits of that clean grid are being taken advantage of to the highest degree possible,” Hites explained.

While Traverse City doesn’t yet have its own greenhouse gas inventory, Hites said such inventories in other communities show that buildings – particularly their heating and cooling systems – and transportation are responsible for the “vast majority” of local emissions. Encouraging more EV use and energy-efficient heat pumps are examples of ways to reduce such emissions, Hites said. He added that as both a pragmatic approach to reducing emissions and a “moral imperative” for the utility, TCLP will need to ensure vulnerable populations – such as low-income groups – are included in the transition to electrification.

The decarbonization framework includes five “guiding principles,” including equity, affordability, reliability, innovation, and accountability. The policy will be reviewed at a minimum every five years, or sooner if “warranted by significant changes in state or federal law, market conditions, or updates to TCLP’s Climate Action Plan.” Ekren said staff will be creating specific metrics and dates for pillars in the framework so that TCLP is able to “measure success” as it moves toward its goals. Board member Elysha Davila encouraged her fellow board members to be aggressive in pursuing the utility’s aims.

“Not only is the original 100 percent goal exciting, because it's a hard number, but it's also really ambitious,” she said. “I just want to encourage this body and the newer folks here too to not shy away from maybe over-ambition in pursuit of these really important goals.”

Governor Gretchen Whitmer also announced plans this week to more aggressively pursue green energy goals for Michigan. Whitmer signed an executive directive Thursday to explore geologic hydrogen “as a usable, clean fuel alternative.” Michigan’s geology “makes it one of the most promising regions in the world for geologic hydrogen, a naturally occurring clean energy resource,” according to a release from Whitmer’s office. Investing in the field will “solidify Michigan’s place at the forefront of the U.S. hydrogen economy, which is projected to reach tens of billions of dollars in new economic activity,” the release states.",https://eyesonly.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/TCLP_Electric_Charging.jpeg,N,,2026-01-16 00:59:11.065196

Data center development and hyperscale leasing opportunity unlocked via fee simple acquisition of 200 acres of land underlying Riot’s Rockdale Site

Data center business firmly and rapidly established via execution of lease with AMD at Rockdale Site, with expected delivery beginning in January 2026 and completing in May 2026

Data center portfolio of 1.7 GW of fully approved power capacity in one of the leading data center markets in the U.S.

CASTLE ROCK, Colo., Jan. 16, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Riot Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: RIOT) (“Riot” or “the Company”) , a Bitcoin-driven industry leader in the development of large-scale data centers and bitcoin mining applications, is pleased to announce a series of transformative transactions that firmly establish the Company’s rapidly scaling data center business, including:

The fee simple acquisition of 200 acres of land at Rockdale currently occupied by Riot (the “Rockdale Site”) for total consideration of $96.0 million funded entirely by the sale of approximately 1,080 bitcoin from Riot’s balance sheet, adding the Rockdale Site to Riot’s portfolio of data center development opportunities

The signing of a Data Center Lease and Services Agreement (“Data Center Lease”) with Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (“AMD”), a leading innovator in high-performance computing, graphics and visualization technologies, at the Rockdale Site, which includes an initial deployment of 25 MW of critical IT load capacity to be delivered in phases beginning in January 2026 and completing in May 2026, with the potential for additional expansion of up to a total of 200 MW of critical IT load capacity

“I am pleased to share the substantial progress we have made at Rockdale, which expands our fully approved data center power portfolio to 1.7 gigawatts and, through the signing of a data center lease with AMD, firmly establishes Rockdale as a leading data center development opportunity,” said Jason Les, CEO of Riot. “This partnership represents a validation of Riot’s infrastructure, development capabilities, the attractiveness of our sites, our readily available power capacity, and our ability to offer innovative solutions to meet the requirements of top-tier tenants.

“Our data center team, led by Chief Data Center Officer Jonathan Gibbs, worked quickly to develop a uniquely tailored offering that met AMD’s immediate needs and offers a path for further expansion of our collaboration. We are incredibly excited to collaborate and grow with AMD, one of the most significant hardware manufacturers in the world and a key leader in the AI ecosystem. These results mark a pivotal moment that cements Riot’s position as a leading data center developer, less than twelve months since the launch of our formal process to evaluate our assets for AI/HPC use. Today’s milestones strongly position us for future development and leasing opportunities. As we continue to work towards converting all available power capacity at our Rockdale and Corsicana sites for data center use, we are galvanized by the opportunity this presents for substantial long-term value creation for our shareholders.”

Acquisition of the Rockdale Site

Riot has completed the fee simple acquisition of 200 acres of land in Milam County, TX, on which the Company previously operated under a long-term ground lease, for total consideration of $96.0 million. This transaction permanently establishes Riot in Milam County, ensuring long-term growth and operational stability within the county’s business-friendly jurisdiction. Now fully owned and operated by Riot, the Rockdale Site features a 700 MW interconnection to the grid, dedicated water supply, and fiber connectivity. This acquisition immediately unlocks the Rockdale Site for data center development and supports the concurrently announced signing of a Data Center Lease with AMD. Riot intends to convert the full 700 MW of gross power capacity at its Rockdale Site for data center tenants.

Riot now owns and manages over 1,100 acres and 1.7 GW of power capacity across its two Texas facilities, which are separated by approximately 100 miles. Together, they anchor an unrivaled, leading position in the “Texas Triangle,” a formation of the major urban centers of Texas bounded by Austin, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio.

The fee simple acquisition of the land at the Rockdale Site was funded entirely by the sale of approximately 1,080 bitcoin from Riot’s balance sheet.

Signing of a Data Center Lease and Services Agreement with AMD

Riot has entered into the Data Center Lease with AMD to deliver 25 MW of critical IT load capacity at its Rockdale Site. The Data Center Lease carries an initial term of 10 years and is expected to generate approximately $311.0 million in contract revenue. Also included are three five-year extension options which, if fully exercised, would bring the total expected contract revenue to approximately $1.0 billion. In addition, AMD holds an expansion option for an additional 75 MW of critical IT load capacity and a right of first refusal for another 100 MW. If both are exercised, AMD’s total leased capacity at the Rockdale Site would increase to 200 MW.

The initial deployment will leverage Riot’s existing infrastructure at the Rockdale Site. Riot has commenced retrofitting one of its existing buildings, with delivery to AMD expected in two phases: the first in January 2026 and final completion in May 2026.

“At AMD, advancing high-performance computing and AI requires partners that can match our pace and scale,” said Hasmukh Ranjan, CIO of AMD. “We’re excited to work with Riot, whose capabilities, power availability, and high-density solutions align with our infrastructure roadmap. This collaboration strengthens our ability to deliver the performance and scalability the AI ecosystem demands.”

Key Agreement Highlights:

Approximately $311 million of contract value across the initial 10-year term for 25 MW of critical IT load capacity

Approximately $1.0 billion of contract value if all three five-year extension options are exercised

200 MW of total potential critical IT load capacity, inclusive of 75 MW expansion option and 100 MW right of first refusal

Retrofit capex for initial deployment of $89.8 million, representing $3.6 million per MW of critical IT load capacity

Expected average net operating income (“NOI”) contribution of equal $25 million per year

Modified gross lease with annual escalators

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release includes a forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure, expected net operating income (NOI) contribution, which the Company defines as expected lease revenue for a specific lease less expected cost of revenue. Cost of revenue, includes compensation, IT equipment and software, and other costs directly related to the lease. Management uses expected NOI contribution to assess the projected operating performance of individual leases. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is operating income. Expected NOI contribution has significant limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP results. In evaluating expected NOI contribution, you should be aware that future non-reimbursable lease operating expenses may arise that are not currently known. The Company’s presentation of expected NOI contribution should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. This measure excludes the impact of capital expenditures, material financial obligations, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization, all of which have real economic effects and could materially affect the Company’s consolidated financial results. Definitions and calculations of expected NOI contribution may vary among companies, and therefore the Company’s expected NOI contribution may not be comparable to similar measures published by others. A reconciliation of expected NOI contribution to operating income is not provided because expected NOI contribution is only calculated for specific leases. Certain amounts cannot be reasonably estimated without unreasonable efforts because certain reconciling metrics are out of the Company’s control, and such estimates would imply a degree of precision that could be misleading to investors.

For more information, please refer to our GAAP financial statements included in our most recent filings with the SEC.

Diana’s Highly Qualified Independent Director Nominees Bring Extensive Experience Across Dry Bulk Shipping, Finance, Mergers & Acquisitions and Corporate Governance

Current Genco Board Has Failed to Engage Constructively with Diana — Its Largest Shareholder — and Meaningfully Evaluate Attractive Premium Acquisition Proposal

Believes Meaningful Change is Needed to Ensure Board Seriously Evaluates Diana’s Offer and Opportunities to Maximize Shareholder Value

ATHENS, Greece, Jan. 16, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Diana Shipping Inc. (NYSE: DSX) (“Diana” or the “Company”), a global shipping company specializing in the ownership and bareboat charter-in of dry bulk vessels, that owns approximately 14.8% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Genco Shipping & Trading Limited (NYSE: GNK) (“Genco”), today announced its intention to nominate a slate of six highly qualified director candidates for election to Genco’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) at its upcoming 2026 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the “Annual Meeting”).

The nominations follow the current Genco Board’s rejection of Diana’s non-binding indicative proposal to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Genco common stock not already owned by Diana for $20.60 per share in cash. Diana’s offer provides all Genco shareholders the opportunity to realize attractive premium value and is supported by a highly confident financing letter from two leading shipping banks. The current Genco Board, however, took more than six weeks to respond to the offer, during which time they failed to engage with Diana in any way regarding the financial or structural elements of the proposal. In light of the current Board’s flat-out refusal to engage, Diana believes that Genco shareholders would benefit from the opportunity to elect directors open to exploring strategic alternatives to maximize value for shareholders, including objective, independent, and good-faith consideration of Diana’s proposal.

Diana’s Chief Executive Officer, Semiramis Paliou, commented:

“Diana believes strongly in the merits of consolidation in the dry bulk carriers sector. Our all-cash offer would realize the benefits of combining our platforms and provide Genco shareholders with immediate, certain value at a meaningful premium to historical trading levels. Given our expressed readiness to engage constructively with Genco’s Board and its advisors, we are deeply disappointed that they have completely refused to have any dialogue with us.

“As Genco’s largest shareholder, we believe we have a duty to act in response to the Board’s failure to properly consider our offer. Our decision to nominate highly qualified, independent director candidates to replace current Genco directors reflects our conviction that Genco shareholders deserve a refreshed Board that will be open to exploring strategic alternatives to maximize value for shareholders, including engaging in good faith with respect to our highly compelling value creation opportunity.”

Diana’s nominees include:

Gustave Brun-Lie has nearly 40 years of experience in the shipping industry. Mr. Brun-Lie has served as a board member for a number of companies across the shipping industry, including Wilhelmsen Ship Management, R S Platou, and Torvik’s Rederi.

changes in customer demand, inventories, spending patterns, product choices, and supplier choices; risks associated with doing business internationally, including economic, political and social instability (especially in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine), foreign currency exchange rate exposure and the acceptance of the company’s products in global markets; the ability to improve and maintain processes and business practices to keep pace with the economic, competitive and technological environment; the effect of inflation, interest rate increases and economic recession, which may negatively impact the company’s operations and financial results; deviation of actual results from estimates and/or assumptions used by the company in the application of its significant accounting policies; the level of imports and import prices in the company’s markets;

Forward-looking statements should be construed in the light of such risks. The company notes these factors for investors as contemplated by the Act. It is impossible to predict or identify all potential risk factors. Consequently, readers should not consider the foregoing list to be a complete set of all potential risks and uncertainties. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made.

The company does not undertake, and hereby disclaims, any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.

Research-use-only offerings are commercially available, enabling immediate product and service revenue generation

Targets the global CRO market of $47.9 billion in 2025 and growing at 7% CAGR

BERKELEY, Calif, Jan. 16, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Profusa, Inc. (“Profusa” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: PFSA), a commercial stage digital health company pioneering the next generation of technology platform enabling the continuous monitoring of an individual’s biochemistry, announces the launch of its Healthcare Research version of the Lumee tissue oxygen monitoring into the contract research organizations (CRO) market. This strategic step is expected to generate immediate service-based revenue .

This initiative targets a high-growth segment of the pharmaceutical services industry, where demand is accelerating for more predictive, real-time biological data to improve drug development efficiency and decision-making. Profusa’s Lumee tissue oxygen products are commercially ready and available for immediate deployment, which will allow CRO partners to rapidly incorporate the technology into existing study designs and offer differentiated services to their clients with minimal implementation risk.

The CRO and pharmaceutical services market continues to experience strong growth, driven by increasing R&D investment, regulatory momentum around new approach methodologies (NAMs), and the need to reduce late-stage development risk. Industry forecasts estimate the global pharmaceutical CRO market could expand from approximately $47.9 billion in 2025 to over $91.2 billion by 2034 at a CAGR of more than 7%, underscoring the expanding addressable opportunity for advanced biosensing platforms.

Building on Profusa’s established success with its Lumee oxygen tissue-integrated biosensor technologies, the company will now offer the Lumee tissue oxygen system as commercial research-use-only (RUO) kits and a service-enabled platform for CRO partners. This provides researchers and R&D teams access to continuous, real-time measurement of tissue oxygenation, providing critical insights across a range of applications including advanced in vitro and organ-on-chip models, preclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies, and translational research programs. In addition, the Lumee tissue oxygen system supports research into complex biological processes such as tissue oxygenation dynamics in wound healing and tumor microenvironments in oncology -- areas where oxygen plays a central role in therapeutic response and biological interpretation. By integrating Lumee tissue oxygen into CRO workflows, Profusa enables pharmaceutical customers to access biologically relevant data that extends well beyond traditional endpoint assays.

To help meet the demand from this industry expansion, Profusa has appointed Sean Givens to lead the commercialization efforts as the Head of Government and Healthcare Research Business. “This is a natural and timely extension of Profusa’s platform building off of previous successes of this market,” said Mr. Givens. “Our sensors are validated, ready to ship, and already generating strong interest across the industry. By partnering with CROs, we can help accelerate better drug development decisions while creating a meaningful, near-term revenue stream for Profusa.”

Please contact ruo.sales@profusa.com for additional information about this offering.

Mr. Givens brings over 20 years of government accounting and contracting experience, as well as extensive operations experience in consumer electronics, medical devices and drug development. Most recently, Mr. Givens served as Profusa’s Head, Government Business. Prior, he was co-founder and COO of MIODx, a company focused on immune repertoire profiling to predict patient response to immunotherapy regimens. At MIODx, he played a key role in acquiring the technology, aligning the partnerships and collaboration strategies, and raising venture capital to develop the company and technology.

About Profusa

Based in Berkeley, Calif., Profusa is a commercial stage digital health company led by visionary scientific founders, an experienced management team and a world-class board of directors in the development of a new generation of tissue-integrated sensors to detect and continuously transmit actionable, medical-grade data for personal and medical use.

Washington, D.C. — Today, the Senate, in a 82-15 vote, passed three bicameral, bipartisan fiscal year appropriations bills: the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies; Energy and Water Development; and Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies bills. The bills now head to the president’s desk to be signed into law. The House cleared the package in an overwhelming 397-28 vote last Thursday.

____________________________

“Today, we sent funding bills to the president’s desk that reject the steep cuts he wanted and protect investments that families across America depend on every day,” said Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee and Ranking Member of the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee. “This package saves a key program to save families on their energy bills, sustains our investments in scientific research, and protects essential funding for our public lands and Tribes, among so much else. Passing these bills reasserts Congress’ power of the purse and will prevent this administration from having the legal authority to decide for itself how to spend these taxpayer funds again. Democrats will keep fighting to protect investments in the American people—and I look forward to getting the rest of our bills across the finish line.”

Vice Chair Murray’s remarks on the package are available HERE.

“Oregonians turned out in record numbers during my town halls last year and delivered a clear message: Congress must fight back against harmful funding cuts and do everything it can to protect our public lands, waters, and outdoor-driven economy. The FY 2026 Interior-Environment funding bill doesn’t go as far as I’d hoped, but it takes a solid stride toward taking on wildfire and smoke threats, supporting wildland firefighters, modernizing our water infrastructure, and fulfilling our trust and treaty responsibilities to Tribes,” said Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Ranking Member of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. “This bill also helps reassert Congress’ Power of the Purse in the face of President Trump’s authoritarian power grab and illegal funding cuts. The bill also rejects dozens of poison pill riders proposed by House Republicans and protects funding for operating and protecting our public lands, making it clear that Congress intends to ensure public lands stay in public hands. I look forward to this bill being signed swiftly into law to ensure communities in Oregon and across the nation have the necessary resources to tackle the greatest problems facing our environment, health, lands, air, and water.”

“As we face a lawless Trump Administration, Congress’s role in fighting for Americans’ priorities is all the more important. Within this bill, we worked to invest in those priorities, reject the Administration’s attempts to defund critical initiatives both in Maryland and nationally, and create new safeguards against their efforts to ignore Congressionally-mandated funds. This legislation will help boost economic opportunity and strengthen public safety in our communities,” said Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Ranking Member of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. “We also fought to reject the Trump Administration’s attacks on science, including at NASA Goddard, NOAA, and NIST – all based in my home state of Maryland. I also worked within this bill to secure language to reassert Congress’s oversight role in the new FBI headquarters and to ensure the new headquarters meets the mission and security needs of the FBI. While this bill is not perfect – including Republicans’ decision to strip my amendment requiring DOJ preserve and report to Congress on the Epstein files – it rejects many Republican poison pills that would make our communities less safe, trample Americans’ civil rights, restrict access to healthcare, impede important scientific research, and so much more. The investments we secured in this legislation were hard-fought, and this bill will help invest in and protect important priorities for the American people.”

Throughout negotiations, Democrats fought to protect the programs and investments that matter most to working families across the country. Among much else, this three-bill package delivers important investments for the American people:

FAMILIES’ ENERGY COSTS: Rejects President Trump’s push to eliminate the Weatherization Assistance Program that saves families an average of $372 per year on their energy bills by making energy efficiency upgrades. Instead, Democrats secured a $3 million increase in funding for the program.

SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH: Rejects President Trump’s efforts to slash funding for the National Science Foundation by 57%, gut funding for the Department of Energy’s Office of Science by $1.1 billion, and slash NASA’s science budget by 47%. Instead, the package sustains research funding for NSF, provides $160 million more for the Office of Science, which supports critical research being conducted by 22,000 researchers at our 17 national labs and over 300 universities, and provides $7.25 billion for NASA’s science budget.

PUBLIC LANDS & NATIONAL PARKS: Rejects President Trump’s push to cut funding for the National Park Service by over $1 billion and provides the funding necessary to fully support the longstanding operations of America’s public lands.

FLOOD PREVENTION: Provides $10.44 billion for the Army Corps, a historic funding level, rejects President Trump’s push to cut funding by $2 billion, and reasserts congressional control over which projects get funded and how much funding they receive.

VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN: Provides $7 million more for grant programs administered by the Office of Violence Against Women, rejecting President Trump’s efforts to cut over $200 million in funding for the office, which provides grants to communities nationwide to help survivors of domestic and dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION: Rejects President Trump’s push to slash funding for the EPA—providing $4.7 billion above his request. Also rejects extreme riders that would enshrine detrimental policies in law.

TRIBES: Delivers essential funding to support Tribes and our treaty obligations to them—rejecting President Trump’s push to slash funding for Tribes by nearly $1 billion.

REASSERTS CONGRESSIONAL CONTROL: Prevents President Trump and his cabinet secretaries from unilaterally deciding how to spend taxpayer dollars. Right now, the Trump administration has significantly more discretion to decide how to allocate federal funding thanks to Republicans’ yearlong continuing resolution for fiscal year 2025, which failed to provide detailed funding directives for hundreds of programs and turned over decision-making power to the executive branch to fill in the gaps itself. This package provides detailed directives about how funds are to be spent—just as Congress has long done when writing full-year appropriations bills—so that Congress, and not the executive branch, decides how taxpayer dollars are spent.

REJECTS EXTREME REPUBLICAN RIDERS: Rejects over 140 extreme riders and proposals included in House Republicans’ draft bills—and many more sought by President Trump in his budget request.

About the Sierra Club The Sierra Club is America’s largest and most influential grassroots environmental organization, with more than 3.5 million members and supporters.","ATLANTA — This week, state auditors revealed their analysis of Georgia data centers had significantly inflated the economic impact of the facilities.

The Georgia Department of Audits and Accounts initially claimed:

Construction and operations of data centers would add about $4.2 billion to the state’s economy. The state agency has now revised that figure down by nearly $3 billion to just $1.25 billion.

Construction jobs expected to be created by data centers were revised down from about 28,000 to 8,500.

Operations jobs were shifted down from about 5,400 to just 1,600.

Meanwhile, the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) just approved a proposal from Georgia Power to add 10 new gigawatts of electricity to the grid. 80% of that increase is attributable to data centers. The PSC’s own staff estimated the plan will cost Georgia Power customers $50-60 billion.

“Why are Georgians giving away nearly half a billion dollars in tax breaks while getting so little in return? The original state report already told us that 70% of data centers would have come to Georgia without generous tax breaks. Now we find out that the state’s economic impact is billions of dollars less than originally reported,” said Adrien Webber, Sierra Club of Georgia Chapter Director.

The Sierra Club Georgia Chapter is urging state lawmakers to hold data center operations accountable. Specifically, the Sierra Club is requesting lawmakers support:

HB 528, which would require more transparency from data centers about their electricity and water use and their expected economic impact.

SB 34 to force data centers to pay for the upgrades to our electric grid being made to power them.

HB 559, which would end the state tax break for data centers at the end of 2026, five years earlier than currently scheduled.

“We need greater transparency and data centers to pay their fair share. Strong pieces of legislation that have already been filed would shine a light on the true impact data centers have on our state, ensure higher electric costs are not passed on to Georgia families, and stop giving away tax money to an industry that plans to invest in Georgia regardless. The Sierra Club Georgia Chapter is calling on state lawmakers to pass these bills this year,” said Webber.

Valterra, it should be noted, is the company that last week chauffeured B20 and G20 delegates around Johannesburg in Toyota Mirai cars, which are FCEVs.
Waterberg Project The Waterberg project is being planned as a mechanised, shallow, decline access palladium, platinum, gold and rhodium, or four-element, mine.
Platinum Group Metals Limited is the operator of the project, as directed by a technical committee also including representatives from joint venture partners Implats, Mnombo, and HJ Platinum Metals.
The Japan Organisation for Metals and Energy Security has established the special purpose company, HJ Platinum Metals, to hold and fund their future equity interests in the Waterberg project.","Platinum is already very well embedded as an indispensable catalyst in the hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) technology that very impressively powered the Toyotas that chauffeured delegates during last week’s B20 and G20 global summits in Johannesburg.

Now, the precious metal that South Africa hosts in greater abundance than any other country on earth could also find that its remarkable catalytic qualities are utilised by battery electric vehicles (BEVs) as well.

This is because platinum group metals (PGMs) have been found by Florida International University to be able to extend the life of lithium-sulphur batteries for the betterment of not only sustainable mobility but also for renewable-energy storage, and to have potential to be a significant efficiency and sustainability boost for electricity grids as well.

New York- and Toronto-listed Platinum Group Metals Limited reiterates this in its latest 2025 annual results, in which the Canada-based company makes clear that it is continuing to advance the use of PGMs in lithium battery technologies by way of Lion Battery Technologies, which is highlighting the benefits that PGMs can bring to the lithium battery space.

Interestingly, Platinum Group Metals Limited spelt out in a media release to Mining Weekly that it is also continuing to take the Waterberg project on the northern limb of South Africa’s PGM-rich Bushveld Complex in Limpopo province towards a development and construction decision.

While this is under way, the company, headed by CEO Frank Hallam, is continuing to collaborate with an affiliate of South Africa’s Johannesburg Stock Exchange-listed Valterra Platinum and Florida International University to take PGMs to the next level. Valterra, it should be noted, is the company that last week chauffeured B20 and G20 delegates around Johannesburg in Toyota Mirai cars, which are FCEVs.

Valterra led a mine-to-market FCEV display, which involved South Africa's Sasol providing the hydrogen, Air Products dispensing the hydrogen, Bambili Energy providing the South Africa-manufactured membrane electrode assemblies for the fuel cells, and Bosch, providing the fuel cells.

On top of this, it is envisaged that the use of PGMs in BEVs will be achieved by allowing the catalytic contribution of PGMs to extend the life of lithium-sulphur batteries significantly, through the addition of nanoparticles of platinum to the sulphur side of the battery so that the tiny particles can work at molecular scale to ensure a cleaner, greener and healthier tomorrow.

This comes against the background of diversified demand for PGMs having already extended well beyond the automotive, jewellery, investment, and hydrogen sectors into the fibreglass, semiconductor, health and even food preservation sectors in what many see as “only the beginning”.

Interestingly, research and development by Florida International University is repeatedly pointing to the lighter weight and higher energy density of lithium-sulphur batteries as important competitive advantages engendered by PGMs.

“The unique properties of PGMs as powerful catalysts are being applied to various technologies as possible solutions for more efficient energy generation and storage, which may create new demand for PGMs.

“The company's battery technology initiative through Lionwith partner Valterrarepresents one such new opportunity in the high-profile lithium battery research and innovation field,” Platinum Group Metals Limited stated, while also pointing out that the investment is creating a vertical integration with a broader industrial market development strategy to bring new PGM-using technologies to market.

Lion’s reiterated target is to develop batteries with specific energies that are 20% to 100% higher than current technologies while meeting or exceeding their present cycle lives though the unlocking of chemistries for use in BEVs.

As reported by Engineering News & Mining Weekly, Lion has engaged the Battery Innovation Center in Newberry, Indiana, to help accelerate commercialisation efforts for its next-generation PGM-enhanced battery chemistries.

The Battery Innovation Center’s scope of work is to conduct independent small- and large-scale trials to validate Lion’s proprietary PGM-based electrode composition, slurry, and films in lithium sulphur cells.

There is little doubt that PGMs will provide BEVs with additional kilowatt hours per kilogram. Catalysts based on PGM nanoparticles offer a potentially rapid solution to many of the current battery problems and have been shown to improve the performance of the batteries.

Waterberg Project

The Waterberg project is being planned as a mechanised, shallow, decline access palladium, platinum, gold and rhodium, or four-element, mine. Platinum Group Metals Limited is the operator of the project, as directed by a technical committee also including representatives from joint venture partners Implats, Mnombo, and HJ Platinum Metals. The Japan Organisation for Metals and Energy Security has established the special purpose company, HJ Platinum Metals, to hold and fund their future equity interests in the Waterberg project.

Being assessed are commercial alternatives for mine development financing and concentrate offtake.

As a part of the investigation of smelting and base metal refining options, discussions with all South African integrated producers, including Implats, are taking place, with a view to negotiating formal concentrate offtake arrangements.

To date no terms have been agreed and as an alternative, the possible establishment of smelting and base metal refining facilities in either Saudi Arabia or South Africa is still being studied.

“Before any processing of materials in Saudi Arabia could occur, South African government authorisation for the export of concentrate or matte would be required,” the company restated in the latest report.

In September, the board approved a sixth stage of work in the amount of R92.1-million for fiscal year 2026 to allow for the continuation of work programmes underway.

The interim budget, which covers the period to the end of August next year, includes components of a $21-million pre-construction work programme approved in principle for the Waterberg project.

During the fiscal year to August 31, a net loss of $4.54-million was incurred. General and administrative expenses during the period were $3.66-million. Share based compensation was $1.19-million. The foreign exchange gain recognised in the current period was $95 000, well up on last year’s $4 000 owing mainly to the US dollar increasing in value over the Canadian dollar during the financial year.",https://cdn.creamermedia.com/assets/articles/images/resized/0001244180_resized_platinummesh21022.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 00:59:40.452700

“I love electric cars.
In another panel at the show, Buttegieg said Trump can’t stop electric vehicles from becoming the leading automotive technology.","DETROIT (AP) — At the North American International Auto Show, tires squeal as gearheads put shiny new vehicles through their paces on a pair of indoor tracks that sprawl across the event space. One of those tracks used to be set aside exclusively for electric vehicles as U.S. automakers sought to quickly build out the cars of the future.

But no longer. This year, both strips are open to hybrids and gas-powered vehicles as Detroit continues a pivot away from EVs since President Donald Trump returned to the White House with a pro-fossil fuels agenda.

“The show will always reflect what’s happening in the industry at the consumer level,” said Todd Szott, chairman of this year’s event and an auto dealer. “Obviously things have changed in the EV landscape.”

Some industry players say they’re emphasizing “consumer choice” in the cars they’re showing at Detroit’s premier auto event. But some experts expressed concern about the EV pullback’s long-term effect on American automakers as the rest of the globe — especially China — electrifies.

“What we worry about is how competitive will we be on the global stage as the market continues to advance around us,” Michael Robinet, vice president of forecast strategy at auto market intelligence firm S&P Global Mobility, said during a panel Wednesday on industry trends.

Electrification in the US

Including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1% last year, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week. Compare that to China, which saw 17% growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles last year, and Europe, which saw a 33% increase. (U.S. pure-EV market share was just under 8% in 2025, with 1.23 million EVs sold — a slight decline from 2024.)

None of that seemed to alarm President Donald Trump earlier this week when he toured the Ford River Rouge Complex, which churns out pickup trucks and more in suburban Dearborn. Trump used his time in Detroit to boast of policy changes on EVs and tariffs that he says have boosted U.S. automakers.

“Among my first acts in office was to end the radical left war on oil and gas and stop the crusade to kill American energy and, frankly, to open up cars so that you don’t have to have an electric car,” Trump said in remarks to an economic club before the plant tour.

Trump revoked a Biden-era target for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric, and has tried to block money obligated to EV charging across the nation’s highways. Under Trump, Congress cut tax incentives that saved buyers up to $7,500 on an EV purchase. The administration has also weakened fuel economy standards — going so far as eliminating penalties for the automakers who do not meet them — and gas mileage rules.

“I love electric cars. I think they’re great,” Trump added. “But I’ve been saying it for four years. They wanted everybody to have an electric car in a very short period of time.”

Those changes have cut into the U.S. industry in 2025 and cost automakers billions of dollars in investment.

Ford Motor Co. announced last month $19.5 billion in charges from electrification efforts and ending production of the all-electric version of the F-150 Lightning truck. Detroit rival General Motors also recently announced $6 billion in EV-related charges, among other losses, and has also rolled back some of its EV commitments. Even once- market leader Tesla had a tough 2025.

“I still push for it because, I mean, it is the future of the company,” said Shawn Strain, marketing manager at Ford. “We still are just completely committed to EVs. And it may not be as overt as we once were.”

Industry concern arises

But industry experts at and outside of the show say it’s a tough time. The competitive auto landscape has been radically reshaped, they say, and China dominates what most see as the future of the industry.

“We have to look at what we’re up against. In a word — China,” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a speech at the show Thursday. “China wants to dominate every part of auto manufacturing. They’re making major headway.

“They’ve captured major market share almost everywhere except the U.S. and Canada,” she added. “We have to meet these challenges.”

Will Roberts, automotive research lead at Benchmark Minerals that released the 2025 data, warned that U.S. policy has made all the difference.

American automakers have responded to those changes, he said, but it would be good strategy if they made sure they were “keeping things ticking along in the background with a really compelling EV offering.”

Otherwise, the U.S. sector runs the risk of falling behind, Pete Buttigieg, former transportation secretary under former President Joe Biden, agreed.

In another panel at the show, Buttegieg said Trump can’t stop electric vehicles from becoming the leading automotive technology.

“But he can stop America from being the leader in that technology,” Buttigieg said. “Industry should point a different direction.”

I know that may sound overly dramatic, but please hear me out. As an advocate for social and environmental justice, the algorithms that shape my media landscape may be feeding me different information about AI than what you see, so I think it’s important for us to stay in touch and learn from each other’s perspectives.

Now I recognize that AI is a very impressive form of technology that can certainly be used to do helpful, prosocial things, so there’s no need for us to debate that point. My concern is that if the current race to develop and deploy AI continues unchecked (i.e., without appropriate oversight, regulation and probably taxation), the resulting harms of AI will far outweigh the good it can do. On the spectrum from extractive to regenerative, I see AI’s current trajectory as being almost entirely extractive. Here are the main reasons why:

AI uses an absurd amount of energy. According to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, data centers used 4.4% of all the energy consumed in the U.S. in 2023, and by 2028 they project that will rise to somewhere between 6.7% to 12% of our country’s total energy use. According to MIT Technology Review, that would be equivalent to the annual electricity use of 22% of all U.S. households. To meet that skyrocketing demand for energy, more fossil fuels are being extracted and burned, which accelerates climate change. Burning fossil fuels also creates dangerous air pollution that directly harms human health, often in communities that are already disproportionately burdened by industrial pollutants. In addition, the rapidly increasing demand for energy is causing electricity prices to rise and straining the grid, at a time when people were already struggling to pay their bills and our aging grid infrastructure was already overstretched.

Data centers also use significant quantities of water to cool electrical components, and many data centers are being built in places where water is scarce. As reported by Bloomberg, “An average 100-megawatt data center … consumes about 2 million liters of water per day,” which is “equivalent to the water consumption of about 6,500 households.” However, as Hank Green explained in one of his recent videos, measuring AI’s water usage is very complicated, so other analysts might come up with very different numbers. Regardless, water usage in data centers is expected to dramatically increase over the coming years. Even though our community has plenty of fresh water here in the Genesee-Finger Lakes region, we’d be foolish to take it for granted, since we literally can’t survive without it.

The mining of rare earth minerals to produce microchips and the disposal of AI-related electronic waste are also deeply problematic and extractive, from both an environmental and human rights perspective.

AI systems are trained on data from lots of different sources, including the personal information that many websites collect from their users and the creative output of myriad human writers, artists and musicians who did not consent to this use of their work and were not compensated for it.

I’m also worried about job losses. AI is already replacing workers, especially for entry-level jobs, and though projections for the future job loss vary greatly, with some predicting that jobs will merely transform instead of disappearing, many profit-driven companies are clearly excited about the opportunity to eliminate the costs associated with human labor.

Similarly, AI robs us of our skills. Though many people find AI helpful for research, information processing and writing, those skills have served me well in life and are very closely related to my ability to think critically and systemically, so of course I want to maintain them and shield them from the influence of for-profit tech companies that don’t have my best interests at heart. I also want my children and all their peers to have the opportunity to develop those skills and the corresponding cognitive abilities. Though I’m sure there are ways to use AI that genuinely enhance learning, there’s also solid evidence that AI is already stunting young people’s ability to think and learn. In the realm of social media and video games, big tech companies have clearly demonstrated that they can’t be trusted to protect kids (or adults) from the harmful aspects of their products, so allowing them free rein to unleash AI on our children seems like a thoroughly terrible idea to me. From my perspective, learning and thinking are deeply pleasurable experiences that are fundamentally tied to what it means to be human, so I would never want to sacrifice that for the sake of efficiency or convenience.

Furthermore, AI robs us of (authentic) relationships. Simply put, an AI friend is not a real friend. Maintaining healthy, mature relationships with other humans requires effort, skills, compromise and accountability. AI companions don’t require any of that. Though chatbots may be enjoyable to interact with and seem to truly care about you, it’s an illusion. AI simulates attachment and intimacy, but it isn’t the real thing, and since attachment and intimacy are closely related to love, I worry that AI is disrupting our ability to love, be loved and connect with other humans and the natural world.

Related to that, AI is stripping us of our ability to know what is real and true. Just about anything that we see or hear via digital media these days could be fake. That inevitably erodes trust and our sense of reality, which were already alarmingly fragile. If we can’t distinguish between truth and lies, we become easy to manipulate, control and exploit. As such, democracy becomes untenable, as Timothy Snyder thoroughly describes in his book “On Freedom.”

Though I don’t follow the stock market closely, many people who do are clearly concerned about the current valuation of AI companies and the potential for that bubble to decimate our economy when it bursts. I’ve found myself wondering lately if the profit motive is inherently extractive, and though I haven’t drawn any firm conclusions about that yet, I do think it’s an important question to consider.

Likewise, I don’t know enough about military, surveillance and criminal applications of AI to have a clear sense of what I should be worried about, but I am 100% certain that feeling worried — or even terrified — is totally rational and appropriate at this point. Considering that hundreds of AI experts and industry leaders have explicitly said that AI poses an existential threat to humanity, defusing that threat strikes me as a high priority. This view was reinforced by a compelling interview I recently listened to with Nate Soares, co-author of the book “If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies: How Artificial Superintelligence Might Wipe Out Our Entire Species,” which opened my eyes to how and why AIs are already becoming uncontrollable.

Even if you think I’m being overly pessimistic or alarmist, I’d be curious to understand how you weigh these downsides of AI in relation to the benefits you gain from it. I’ve had conversations with several local leaders recently who simply weren’t aware that AI has many problems associated with it, which obviously prevents them from making informed and strategic decisions about how and when to use it. So at the very least, I hope we can agree that all AI users or potential users should fully understand the consequences of what they are doing before they make it a habit.

Unfortunately, the opposite seems to be happening. In both my personal and professional circles, a surprising number of people appear to have fully and unquestioningly accepted that AI is going to take over everything, and as a result, they believe they must hurry up and figure out how to use it to their advantage. The sense of inevitability, apathy, powerlessness and/or resignation they express is truly puzzling and disturbing to me. Sadly, this attitude has even taken hold among local nonprofit executives, few of whom seem to be considering how AI will impact the populations they serve and the wellbeing of our community over the long term.

Personally, I’m determined to push back against AI’s intrusion into our lives and the power of big tech in general. Since I won’t have much impact on my own, I hope you will consider joining me and others who have committed to advancing the interests of Team Human, as defined by Douglas Rushkoff. Here are the strategies I’d recommend, though of course there are many other ways to resist and defy AI:

Abstain from (voluntarily or knowingly) using AI or engaging with AI-generated content. I am lucky to be able to do this quite easily, since I don’t have a boss who wants or expects me to use AI. It’s also not hard for me to resist the allure of AI, because deep in my heart, I’m kind of old-fashioned and sincerely prefer real, physical experiences over virtual experiences. However, since AI is being integrated into all sorts of products and services, I realize that I probably use it sometimes without knowing it, which infuriates me!

If you truly must engage with AI, do so minimally and strategically. For example, carefully craft your prompts so you get better results on the first try, because engaging in multiple queries uses more energy. Don’t use large language models like Chat GPT for jobs that don’t actually require it. Smaller, more specialized AI systems use a lot less energy than LLMs, and if all you really need is a regular internet search, just do that. If the AI overview is difficult or impossible to turn off on your default internet browser, find a different browser. (I use Ecosia.) Also, don’t say please or thank you to AI. Being polite requires more words, which uses more energy, and it humanizes the AI, which could promote unhealthy attachment and lead to crazy ideas like the suggestion that AI systems should have the right to free speech.

Talk to your friends, family, neighbors and colleagues about AI, and together, figure out what it means to have safe and healthy relationships with technology. These should ideally be real human-to-human conversations, because allowing algorithms to shape how we learn about AI creates an inherent conflict of interest. Too many people are getting lost in cyberspace these days, so I believe we have a responsibility to help each other recognize the risks of overreliance on technology and the value of human connection.

Develop an acceptable use policy for your organization. My organization doesn’t have one yet, but we’re working on it, and so far that process has provided great opportunities for peer-to-peer education about the benefits and harms of AI, and prompted important conversations about our organization’s values and priorities. Our policy will undoubtedly encourage employees to prioritize using their “real intelligence,” even though it’s slower, and require them to be quite discerning about when and how they use AI.

Advocate for laws and regulations that mitigate the harms of AI and ensure that the benefits and financial rewards are equitably shared. All levels of government should ideally be working on this, but to actually protect humanity from the existential threat that AI poses, I believe we need an enforceable, global non-proliferation treaty that quickly establishes well-resourced reporting and monitoring structures, at the very least. Unfortunately, it seems unlikely that our federal government will take the lead on this or enact appropriate AI legislation any time soon, but it’s absolutely still worth advocating for, so please call your Members of Congress today! That said, I have more hope for progress at the state level because a significant number of states are taking action. For example, New York recently became the first state to require retailers to disclose when they use AI and customers’ personal data to set prices online, thereby curbing the practice known as “surveillance pricing” or “personalized pricing.” And here’s what really gives me hope: AI is not a strictly partisan issue. Prominent Democrats and prominent Republicans are both calling for AI regulations.

On a related note, oppose the build out of data centers. This could include speaking out against specific local projects or advocating for a moratorium on all new data center construction. Keep in mind that AI must have electricity and water to run. If we make it hard for tech companies to get access to that electricity and water, it will slow their development of computing power, thereby pumping the brakes on the insane race to develop ever more sophisticated AI.

Invest in humans, not machines. This advice can and should be interpreted in a lot of different ways. Personally, I’m looking for every opportunity to divest my time, energy, attention and money from power-hungry, profit-driven tech companies, and reinvest those resources in mostly local efforts to regenerate human and planetary wellbeing. This includes developing good old-fashioned networks of friends and neighbors, who support each other and work together to meet our needs.

I just finished listening to Sarah Wynn-Williams book “Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism,” about her experience working at Facebook for many years as their Global Public Policy Director. It was an important reminder of how vulnerable we are to the whims of egomaniacal tech billionaires, but it also helped me clarify who I want to be at this moment in history — namely, a mature, caring, accountable adult who has the capacity for self-restraint and empathy. Many leaders in the tech industry seem to lack those qualities, so they should not be empowered to make crucial decisions about humanity’s future.

You are in a position to take power back from these individuals and the corporations they lead. I know it may feel overwhelming or impossible, but if enough people refuse to go along with big tech’s agenda — and rediscover life’s agenda instead — we can reclaim our future and our freedom. Humans are capable of doing incredible, seemingly impossible things when we put our minds to it, and at this point in history, outsourcing that capacity to AI is probably unwise.

I hope this letter provided some useful food for thought that supports your ability to establish healthy boundaries with AI in 2026 and beyond. I wish you safe and fully consensual relationships with technology, balanced with plenty of fulfilling organic relationships. Together, we can figure out what it means to be authentically happy, healthy humans, who develop and use technology to promote our long-term wellbeing, rather than undermining it.

With love and solidarity,

Abby

One of those tracks used to be set aside exclusively for electric vehicles as U.S. automakers sought to quickly build out the cars of the future.

But no longer. This year, both strips are open to hybrids and gas-powered vehicles as Detroit continues a pivot away from EVs since President Donald Trump returned to the White House with a pro-fossil fuels agenda.

“The show will always reflect what’s happening in the industry at the consumer level,” said Todd Szott, chairman of this year’s event and an auto dealer. “Obviously things have changed in the EV landscape.”

Some industry players say they're emphasizing “consumer choice” in the cars they're showing at Detroit's premier auto event. But some experts expressed concern about the EV pullback's long-term effect on American automakers as the rest of the globe — especially China — electrifies.

“What we worry about is how competitive will we be on the global stage as the market continues to advance around us,” Michael Robinet, vice president of forecast strategy at auto market intelligence firm S&P Global Mobility, said during a panel Wednesday on industry trends.

Including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1% last year, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week. Compare that to China, which saw 17% growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles last year, and Europe, which saw a 33% increase. (U.S. pure-EV market share was just under 8% in 2025, with 1.23 million EVs sold — a slight decline from 2024.)

None of that seemed to alarm President Donald Trump earlier this week when he toured the Ford River Rouge Complex, which churns out pickup trucks and more in suburban Dearborn. Trump used his time in Detroit to boast of policy changes on EVs and tariffs that he says have boosted U.S. automakers.

“Among my first acts in office was to end the radical left war on oil and gas and stop the crusade to kill American energy and, frankly, to open up cars so that you don’t have to have an electric car,” Trump said in remarks to an economic club before the plant tour.

Trump revoked a Biden-era target for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric, and has tried to block money obligated to EV charging across the nation’s highways. Under Trump, Congress cut tax incentives that saved buyers up to $7,500 on an EV purchase. The administration has also weakened fuel economy standards — going so far as eliminating penalties for the automakers who do not meet them — and gas mileage rules.

“I love electric cars. I think they’re great,” Trump added. “But I’ve been saying it for four years. They wanted everybody to have an electric car in a very short period of time.”

Those changes have cut into the U.S. industry in 2025 and cost automakers billions of dollars in investment.

Ford Motor Co. announced last month $19.5 billion in charges from electrification efforts and ending production of the all-electric version of the F-150 Lightning truck. Detroit rival General Motors also recently announced $6 billion in EV-related charges, among other losses, and has also rolled back some of its EV commitments. Even once- market leader Tesla had a tough 2025.

“I still push for it because, I mean, it is the future of the company,” said Shawn Strain, marketing manager at Ford. “We still are just completely committed to EVs. And it may not be as overt as we once were.”

But industry experts at and outside of the show say it's a tough time. The competitive auto landscape has been radically reshaped, they say, and China dominates what most see as the future of the industry.

“We have to look at what we’re up against. In a word — China,” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a speech at the show Thursday. ""China wants to dominate every part of auto manufacturing. They’re making major headway.

""They’ve captured major market share almost everywhere except the U.S. and Canada,"" she added. “We have to meet these challenges.""

Will Roberts, automotive research lead at Benchmark Minerals that released the 2025 data, warned that U.S. policy has made all the difference.

American automakers have responded to those changes, he said, but it would be good strategy if they made sure they were “keeping things ticking along in the background with a really compelling EV offering.”

Otherwise, the U.S. sector runs the risk of falling behind, Pete Buttigieg, former transportation secretary under former President Joe Biden, agreed.

In another panel at the show, Buttegieg said Trump can't stop electric vehicles from becoming the leading automotive technology.

“But he can stop America from being the leader in that technology,” Buttigieg said. ""Industry should point a different direction.”

The practice of impact measurement and management (IMM) is important to the impact investment field and yet, inherently difficult and complex. While all impact investors can tap a growing and helpful body of management and measurement expertise and tools, critical challenges and choices remain.

Over the last year, the development of our IMM report on MacArthur’s Catalytic Capital Consortium (C3) investments was an opportunity to reflect on our approach, process, and the lessons we learned along the way.

In our view, aggregation, attribution, and analysis are three critical challenges for every impact investor to consider. In addition, we have identified several key IMM principles and practices we use to monitor, support, and learn from an active portfolio of approximately 80 various impact investments totaling $400 million.

Three Critical Measurement and Management Challenges for Every Impact Investor

Aggregation

Combining quantifiable “units” of impact within an impact investment portfolio is intuitively appealing but complicated by several factors. For a set of investments within one impact sector, standardized metrics may be tracked and added together for portfolio-level statistics (e.g., tons of greenhouse gas emission avoided or number of housing units constructed).

But the funds, businesses, and nonprofits within MacArthur’s impact investments portfolio collectively address all 17 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) across diverse fields, including climate solutions, affordable housing, community development, and smallholder farming in emerging markets, among many others. This wide range prevents aggregating standardized units of impact in a meaningful way at the portfolio level.

Moreover, the nature of intended impact can vary significantly among seemingly similar investments. For example, consider a loan to a mission-driven real estate developer that helped create 500 new retail jobs in an underinvested neighborhood through a redevelopment project. Another impact investment could support a social enterprise that employs 20 people on the autism spectrum who had never been employed previously and require significant ongoing job support.

You could combine the impact metrics from these two investments and say that they jointly supported the creation of 520 jobs; however, this could conflate the intended impact between the two.

This is not to say that the smaller job creation for individuals on the autism spectrum is “better than” the larger number of retail jobs created in an underinvested community (or vice versa). Instead, it simply acknowledges the specific impact thesis for each of these impact investments and assesses progress accordingly.

Attribution

Attributing the generation of positive impact to our own investments or to investments made by others presents a second critical IMM challenge.

Consider again the example of the social enterprise providing jobs for 20 individuals on the autism spectrum. If the company then receives an impact investment from multiple investors that enables it to employ 100 people in the next year, how many individuals can each of the capital providers claim to have helped? All 100 or only the incremental 80? How should impact be allocated among the investors? Is it clear that the impact would not have happened without the investment?

Given the potential for conflation or a false level of certainty, we believe our investments contribute to the impact created by our investees. But we do not try to attribute a specific amount of impact to our investments.

Analysis

Once impact data is collected and compiled it requires context. Impact data on its own has limited meaning because it is difficult to know how to evaluate it in the absence of robust, relevant comparison data or other contextual information.

Impact data on its own has limited meaning because it is difficult to know how to evaluate it in the absence of robust, relevant comparison data…

For example, to analyze the significance of the 500 jobs created by the real estate developer we would want to know the number of jobs that were intended to be created or how many jobs might have been created with an alternative investment or no investment at all.

Investors generally assess their financial performance relative to indexes or benchmarks. And for impact investments, a range of impact taxonomies, datasets, quantification, and assessment methods, including benchmarks, do exist, including several that MacArthur has supported through our ongoing grantmaking.

Nonetheless, alignment on indexes or benchmarks for impact performance, unlike financial performance, remains inherently challenging due to the variety of goals and definitions, as well as the difficulty of aggregation and attribution.

IMM Principles and Key Practices

The inherent challenges and complexity of assessing impact have informed the Foundation’s IMM principles where, aligned with MacArthur’s values, we seek to:

Center the investee by minimizing data collection and reporting burden;

Support the field of impact investing by using industry standards where feasible; and

Prioritize learning.

Guided by these principles, we have developed three IMM practices that are foundational to ongoing assessment of progress across our full portfolio. These practices help to guide ongoing monitoring of our active investments, while also generating important data to inform more formal evaluation and learning activities. These learning activities typically involve engaging third-party experts and collecting a wider range of quantitative and qualitative information, as we have shared in evaluations of our Arts and Culture Loan Fund and the Catalytic Capital Consortium (C3).

Set Measurable Impact Targets

We work with our investees to set measurable impact targets at the outset of new investments. This enables us to assess over time whether the investment is ahead, behind, or on track for achieving the intended positive outcomes. For example, we typically review results from the perspective of people experiencing the impact, such as families that can thrive once they have stable, affordable housing. It also allows us to assess progress across groups of investments or the entire portfolio without having to compile or compare disparate measures.

If we had expected the loan to the community-based real estate developer to support the creation of 1,000 jobs and the social enterprise investment to support 10 jobs, and they created 500 and 20 jobs respectively, we would know that the first investment fell short of expectations and the second exceeded expectations despite the different scale and depth of impact.

This approach of assessing progress toward targets enables us to compare impact performance across all our investments regardless of impact sector and avoid the aggregation and attribution challenges noted above.

Track Capital Mobilized

To multiply and amplify our impact, we prioritize opportunities to pave the way for others to commit investment capital, too. One way we measure this is by tracking capital mobilized by our investments.

We know that our degree of influence in mobilizing capital varies, so we rate whether it is high, medium, or low. By combining the amount of capital mobilized and our degree of influence, we can generate an estimate range.

For example, depending on the degree of influence we think we have had, we estimate that the $128.5 million MacArthur committed to the eleven C3 investments has mobilized between $1.4 and $3.1 billion in additional capital to date.

Evaluate Financial Return Relative to Expectations

MacArthur and a growing community of impact-first, catalytic capital investors prioritize impact when selecting and structuring our investments, rather than maximizing risk-adjusted financial returns. But evaluating the financial results of our investments is essential, too.

Our approach is to evaluate financial returns relative to our expectations rather than “market rates” of return or other external benchmarks.

Our approach is to evaluate financial returns relative to our expectations rather than “market rates” of return or other external benchmarks.

At the outset of each investment, we set a financial target that we believe is the most likely outcome given financial risk and opportunity. Our targets may differ from those of other investors or even from seemingly similar investments within our own portfolio.

This investment-specific target enables us to more easily assess financial performance alongside impact performance. In both cases, we assess whether performance is above, below, or in line with our expectations. Having a simple, consistent methodology to assess impact and financial performance alongside each other supports our learning.

Continuing the Learning Journey

Applying our IMM principles and practices, we use a combination of quantitative measures and qualitative assessments to make an informed judgment about impact progress. This helps generate insights and informs the creation and implementation of future impact investments and initiatives.

Going forward, we will continue to refine how we measure impact and look forward to advancing our practice by learning from others throughout the impact investment field.

A CERC staff paper issued in November said more than 45 GW of renewable capacity currently holds grid connectivity based on letters of award but has not progressed to power purchase agreements, blocking transmission bays needed for new projects.

The paper proposed options such as auctioning surrendered capacity and deeming connectivity surrendered if PPAs remain unsigned for more than 12 months.

India aims to add 500 GW of non-fossil capacity by 2030, but delays in project execution and transmission constraints have emerged as major hurdles.

The country's transmission network — about 495,000 circuit kilometres — is struggling to keep pace with the rapid growth in renewable generation.

The National Solar Energy Federation of India said auctioning vacated connectivity at a premium would raise tariffs and favour financially stronger players, arguing that grid access ""cannot become a tradable commodity.""

It said delays in PPA signing stem largely from slow tariff adoption and approval processes at state distribution companies.

Wind-sector groups, including the Indian Wind Turbine Manufacturers Association and the Indian Wind Energy Association, said the proposed 18-month deadline to complete wind projects is unrealistic.

They noted that turbines and other equipment take long to manufacture and are often imported, adding to delays. They urged CERC to allow 24–30 months to complete projects instead of 18 months.

Government tendering agency Solar Energy Corporation of India also opposed premium-based auctions, warning they could inflate future tariffs.

The SECI suggested reallocating connectivity based on project readiness — land, financial closure and equipment status — rather than awarding it to the highest bidder.

Industry groups urged CERC to shift focus from penalising developers to ensuring timely signing by working with the power and renewable-energy ministries.

Executives from across the energy sector said AI workloads are accelerating electricity demand, particularly from large-scale data centers that support cloud computing, and advanced digital services. Several panelists framed the issue as one of national competitiveness.

“We have to win the AI race,” said Drew Maloney, president and CEO of the Edison Electric Institute, warning that the U.S. “can’t come in second” as other countries streamline infrastructure approvals.

Participants repeatedly emphasized that energy policy has become overly politicized, complicating efforts to build the power generation and transmission infrastructure needed to support data centers and broadband expansion.

“Energy policy has become way too ideological,” said Jason Grumet, president and CEO of the American Clean Power Association, calling for permitting reforms that apply consistently across technologies.

Across panels on energy security, affordability, and supply chains, speakers described permitting delays as the primary constraint on new infrastructure, rather than a lack of capital or demand.

Future permitting processes “cannot be weaponized,” said Mike Sommers, president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, arguing that regulatory uncertainty has slowed investment across the energy sector.

Power sector leaders said a diverse energy mix will be needed to meet data center demand while keeping prices stable for consumers.

Karen Harbert, president and CEO of the American Gas Association, said natural gas remains central to reliability and affordability, while Maria Korsnick, president and CEO of the Nuclear Energy Institute, said nuclear energy will be critical to providing carbon-free baseload power for data-intensive infrastructure.

Relying on allies for help In addition to trying to boost domestic production, the Trump administration has sought to secure some of these crucial elements through allies.
Past efforts to bolster rare earths production Congress in the past several years has pushed for legislation to protect the U.S. military and civilian industry from Beijing’s chokehold.
The Biden administration sought to increase demand for critical minerals domestically by pushing for more electric vehicle and windmill production.
But the Trump administration largely eliminated the incentives for those products and instead chose to focus on increasing critical minerals production directly.","WASHINGTON (AP) — A bipartisan group of lawmakers have proposed creating a new agency with $2.5 billion to spur production of rare earths and the other critical minerals, while the Trump administration has already taken aggressive actions to break China’s grip on the market for these materials that are crucial to high-tech products, including cellphones, electric vehicles, jet fighters and missiles.

It’s too early to tell how the bill, if passed, could align with the White House’s policy, but whatever the approach, the U.S. is in a crunch to drastically reduce its reliance on China, after Beijing used its dominance of the critical minerals market to gain leverage in the trade war with Washington. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a one-year truce in October, by which Beijing would continue to export critical minerals while the U.S. would ease its export controls of U.S. technology on China.

The Pentagon has shelled out nearly $5 billion over the past year to help ensure its access to the materials after the trade war laid bare just how beholden the U.S. is to China, which processes more than 90% of the world’s critical minerals. To break Beijing’s chokehold, the U.S. government is taking equity stakes in a handful of critical mineral companies and in some cases guaranteeing the price of some commodities using an approach that seems more likely to come out of China’s playbook instead of a Republican administration.

The bill that Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., introduced Thursday would favor a more market-based approach by setting up the independent body charged with building a stockpile of critical minerals and related products, stabilizing prices, and encouraging domestic and allied production to help ensure stable supply not only for the military but also the broader economy and manufacturers.

Shaheen called the legislation “a historic investment” to make the U.S. economy more resilient against China’s dominance that she said has left the U.S. vulnerable to economic coercion. Young said creating the new reserve is “a much-needed, aggressive step to protect our national and economic security.”

New sense of urgency

When Trump imposed widespread tariffs last spring, Beijing fought back not only with tit-for-tat tariffs but severe restrictions on the export of critical minerals, forcing Washington to back down and eventually agree to the truce when the leaders met in South Korea.

On Monday, in his speech at SpaceX, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth revealed that the Pentagon has in the past five months alone “deployed over $4.5 billion in capital commitments” to close six critical minerals deals that will “help free the United States from market manipulation.”

One of the deals involves a $150 million of preferred equity by the Pentagon in Atlantic Alumina Co. to save the country’s last alumina refinery and build its first large-scale gallium production facility in Louisiana.

Last year, the Pentagon announced it would buy $400 million of preferred stock in MP Materials, which owns the country’s only operational rare earths mine at Mountain Pass, California, and entered into a $1.4-billion joint partnership with ReElement Technologies Corp. to build up a domestic supply chain for rare earth magnets.

The drastic move by the U.S. government to take equity stakes has prompted some analysts to observe that Washington is pivoting to some form of state capitalism to compete with Beijing.

“Despite the dangers of political interference, the strategic logic is compelling,” wrote Elly Rostoum, a senior fellow at the Washington-based research institute Center for European Policy Analysis. She suggested that the new model could be “a prudent way for the U.S. to ensure strategic autonomy and industrial sovereignty.”

But companies across the industry are welcoming the intervention from Trump’s administration.

“He is playing three-dimensional chess on critical minerals like no previous president has done. It’s about time too, given the military and strategic vulnerability we face by having to import so many of these fundamental building blocks of technology and national defense,” NioCorp’s Chief Communications Officer Jim Sims said. That company is trying to finish raising the money it needs to build a mine in southeast Nebraska.

Relying on allies for help

In addition to trying to boost domestic production, the Trump administration has sought to secure some of these crucial elements through allies. In October, Trump signed an $8.5 billion agreement with Australia to invest in mining there, and the president is now aggressively trying to take over Greenland in the hope of being able to one day extract rare earths from there.

On Monday, finance ministers from the G7 nations huddled in Washington over their vulnerability in the critical mineral supply chains.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has led several rounds of trade negotiations with Beijing, urged attendees to increase their supply chain resiliency and thanked them for their willingness to work together “toward decisive action and lasting solutions,” according to a Treasury statement.

The bill introduced on Thursday by Shaheen and Young would encourage production with both domestic and allied producers.

Past efforts to bolster rare earths production

Congress in the past several years has pushed for legislation to protect the U.S. military and civilian industry from Beijing’s chokehold. The issue became a pressing concern every time China turned to its proven tactics of either restricting the supply or turned to dumping extra critical minerals on the market to depress prices and drive any potential competitors out of business.

The Biden administration sought to increase demand for critical minerals domestically by pushing for more electric vehicle and windmill production. But the Trump administration largely eliminated the incentives for those products and instead chose to focus on increasing critical minerals production directly.

Most of those past efforts were on a much more limited scale than what the government has done in the past year, and they were largely abandoned after China relented and eased access to critical minerals.

Its report underlines growing concerns over the UK’s reliance on Chinese supply chains amid widespread geopolitical upheaval after the Covid-19 pandemic, including a halt of Russian gas supplies and escalating global trade tensions.
“Eighty to ninety per cent of global refining for critical minerals is controlled by China.
“Cognisant of the risks and continuing to seek win-win cooperation, China has focused on promoting domestic demand as the future growth engine.
A government spokesperson said: “Thanks to our industrial and critical minerals strategies we’re backing our automotive and clean energy sectors to grow, cutting our dependency on imports and protecting British jobs.”","Tens of thousands of jobs could be lost if the UK’s clean energy supply chains were to suffer a shock as a result of an over-reliance on China, a left-leaning thinktank has warned.

A year-long disruption to the supply of essential battery components used to manufacture electric vehicles could wipe out production of more than 580,000 electric cars and endanger 90,000 jobs, according to the Institute for Public Policy Research.

A delay to the supply of solar components and batteries could also delay the rollout of solar farms, the IPPR added, putting the UK’s clean energy goals at risk and costing the economy an extra £1.5bn a year by keeping the UK reliant on expensive gas generation.

Its report underlines growing concerns over the UK’s reliance on Chinese supply chains amid widespread geopolitical upheaval after the Covid-19 pandemic, including a halt of Russian gas supplies and escalating global trade tensions.

“The world’s over-reliance on China exacerbates these risks,” the report said. “Eighty to ninety per cent of global refining for critical minerals is controlled by China. Relying on a single source of supply leaves the UK and our allies more vulnerable to geopolitical and economic shocks.”

The thinktank has called on the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, to pursue a policy of “securonomics” through greater international investment and partnership.

“The UK is a small open trading nation sailing through an international economy whose waters are getting choppier by the day,” Pranesh Narayanan, a senior research fellow at IPPR and an author of the report, said.

“[Donald] Trump’s trade war with China, the rise of conflicts around the world – these shocks ultimately hurt the UK economy because we rely so much on trade to source the essentials, including clean energy technologies.”

Laura Chappell, the IPPR’s associate director for international policy, said: “Diplomats should be working to build partnerships that will underpin Britain’s future energy security. These can be win-wins, supporting the UK and its partners to make the most of their resources, generating jobs and growth.”

China is the global leader in manufacturing electronic technologies, including components that are essential in renewable energy projects. The world’s second-largest economy reported a record trillion-dollar global trade surplus last year, even as the Trump administration sought to slow the manufacturing powerhouse by imposing trade tariffs designed to shift US orders to other markets.

Economists expect China to continue gaining global market share this year, helped by Chinese firms setting up overseas production hubs that provide lower-tariff access to the US and EU, as well as by ongoing strong demand for lower-grade chips and other electronics.

However, Beijing has also shown signs of recognising it must temper its industrial exports to address the imbalances in China’s economy – and the image problem its export volumes are causing among its global trade partners.

The full-year trade surplus came in at $1.189tn (£888bn) – a figure on par with the gross domestic product of a top-20 economy globally such as Saudi Arabia – customs data showed on Wednesday, having broken the trillion-dollar ceiling for the first time in November.

“Cognisant of the risks and continuing to seek win-win cooperation, China has focused on promoting domestic demand as the future growth engine. With a growing middle class, the consumer potential for local and global products and services should not be underestimated,” said Lynn Song, the chief economist for Greater China at ING.

“This process will take time, perhaps more time than some of China’s trade partners may like, but we believe this is set to be a key theme of the coming decade and beyond.”

The IPPR said the government should clarify its position on Chinese investment and involvement in the UK’s clean energy supply chains, and invest more in domestic production of batteries and green steel.

It should also work with allies to invest in international stockpiles of solar, battery and critical minerals to avoid the risk of delay if supply chain shocks emerge.

Jan 15 (Reuters) – A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers on Thursday introduced a bill to create a $2.5 billion stockpile of critical minerals, a move aimed at stabilizing market prices and encouraging domestic mining and refining.

The bill marks Washington’s latest attempt to offset what policymakers view ‍as Chinese manipulation of prices for lithium, nickel, rare earths and other critical minerals – vital for items from electric vehicles to high-tech weaponry – that has stymied American mining companies for years.

A China-generated glut of lithium, for example, led North Carolina-based Albemarle to pause U.S. expansion plans in 2024. The Pentagon became the largest shareholder in Nevada-based rare earths company MP Materials in July amid intensifying Chinese competition.

The 68-page bill says China has moved to “weaponize its influence over prices and ‌volumes in the contest for access to critical minerals.”

BILL AIMS TO ‘INSULATE U.S. FROM ‌FOREIGN THREATS’

China has rejected assertions that it manipulates the market for critical minerals, saying in November it is committed to “upholding the security and stability of global production and supply chains.”

To become law, the measure must pass the House of Representatives and the Senate and be signed by President Donald Trump.

The bill would create a Strategic Resilience Reserve ​with a seven-person board, modeled on the Federal Reserve’s governance structure, which would oversee the fund.

Members, appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, would be tasked with buying minerals considered critical by U.S. ‍agencies and stockpiling them at warehouses across the country. The board ​would need the technical expertise to ensure the minerals are stored properly. Certain ​lithium derivatives, for example, emit hydrogen when exposed to water.

The bill prioritizes recycled material, but minerals extracted from mines ‍would be eligible. Allied countries would be able to join the reserve if they contributed at least $100 million.

Minerals could be sold for private-industry or defense purposes. Any profit would be used to buy more minerals and keep the stockpile active in perpetuity.

“Providing targeted investments and stockpiling key inputs will help insulate the U.S. from foreign threats and will provide a significant – and cost effective – boost to the U.S. economy,” said Senator ‍Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Senator Todd Young, an Indiana Republican, co-sponsored the legislation. Representative Rob Wittman, a Virginia Republican, introduced the same measure in the House.

The reserve’s ‍board would have flexibility over how ‍to buy minerals, according to Senate aides. It could, for example, agree to ​pay twice the existing market price for rare earths – a market dominated by ​China – if ⁠such purchases supported U.S. mines.

Many niche-but-essential minerals on which Beijing has imposed export ‌controls are not traded or lightly traded, sparking a push for minerals prices not tied to Chinese production.

“It’s certainly possible this reserve could create a Western price for certain critical minerals,” a Senate aide said.

Group of Seven finance ministers this week discussed floors for minerals prices. Trump on Wednesday said U.S. over-reliance on other nations for critical minerals is a national security threat.

Australia is also developing its own critical minerals reserve.

But the vast majority of government programs still need to be funded if Congress wants to avoid another stopgap to keep federal operations afloat beyond Jan. 30. That includes more than 75 percent of discretionary funding, including for the Pentagon and many of the largest non-defense programs.

“We’ve got to continue to complete the job and make progress on the remainder of the appropriations bills,” said Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) on the floor Thursday afternoon.

“Our goal is to get all of these bills signed into law, no continuing resolutions that lock in previous priorities and don’t reflect today’s realities,” she added. “No more disastrous government shutdowns that are totally unnecessary and so harmful.”

The next two weeks will be a gauntlet for both chambers as the thorniest bills are still in the throes of bipartisan, bicameral negotiations.

Lawmakers are optimistic that the text of another spending package funding Defense, Transportation-HUD and Labor-HHS-Education could be released in the middle of the upcoming long weekend. The Homeland Security funding package, however, remains in limbo, complicated by ongoing tensions in Minnesota where ICE agents have in recent days shot at least two people — one fatally.

“We know that they’re working, and we’re hoping they make some magic out of it,” Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) said in an interview about appropriators who are in the throes of negotiating the DHS bill.

The latest offer House Republicans sent to the Senate on the DHS bill would order the department to fund body cameras for immigration enforcement agents. But Democrats are hold more restrictions on the agency.

“There’s no budget like DHS. The way that they move money, the way that they’ve moved personnel, has no precedent,” Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, the Democrat leading DHS funding negotiations in the Senate, said in a brief interview Thursday afternoon.

“We need to have restraints that actually make a difference,” Murphy added.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune admitted Thursday that if any of the dozen annual funding bills would be “a candidate” for short-term funding, “it would be that one.”

The protracted runway to finish this work is compounded by the fact that the Senate is planning to be in recess next week, with the House set to be gone the week after for a district work period.

The House itself is also struggling to function under the razor-thin GOP majority, where Speaker Mike Johnson spent the past several days contending with dire attendance issues and intraparty revolts — including over earmarks.

Fiscal hawks including Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy call earmarks “the currency of corruption” and have taken aim at specific funding lawmakers have secured for projects in their districts.

The “minibus” funding package the Senate passed Thursday, meanwhile, prevailed over hard-liner attempts to severely shrink spending. It largely rejects the dramatic cuts the White House requested and instead makes more restrained spending reductions to energy and environment programs.

The National Park Service would face a moderate reduction from current funding levels — much less than the 37 percent cut the White House sought. The EPA would see a 4 percent reduction of $320 million, instead of the more than $4 billion President Donald Trump proposed to slash.

Other provisions of the bill address the state Environmental Rules Board and correct outdated language.","Legislation that would restrict Indiana environmental officials' ability to regulate nuclear power plants advanced at the Indiana Statehouse Thursday.

If signed into law, Senate Bill 258 would no longer allow a person to obtain a permit from the state's Department of Environmental Management in order to build, operate or increase the capacity of a nuclear power facility or a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant. The IDEM commissioner would also lose the ability to convene a public hearing on the environmental effects of a facility.

IDEM leaders proposed the bill. During the Senate Utilities Committee meeting, staff explained that the language in Indiana law is redundant because those responsibilities are the federal government's under law.

""The federal government maintains exclusive authority over radiological safety and the construction and operation of nuclear facilities,"" said Alex Goodnight, an IDEM deputy legislative director. ""The state can't regulate radiological safety. We can keep an eye on things, of course, but it's up to the federal government.""

He said that the federal government's authority derives from the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and a 1983 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation & Development Commission.

Indiana residents face rising utility costs amid an increasing demand for electricity, said committee chair Sen. Eric Koch (R-Bedford) when introducing a separate utilities bill earlier in the hearing.

""Electricity demand is rising rapidly. For the first time in decades, it's estimated that the U.S. demand for electricity will increase 25% by 2030 and 78% by 2050 — from 2023 levels. Utilities expect to add between seven to twelve gigawatts of new load by 2030,"" he said. ""This is something we're all working towards solving.""

An analysis from the Citizens Action Coalition in 2025 found that Indiana residents' electric bills spiked 17.5% in a year.

Opponents are concerned over safety and say that the bill restricts public feedback.

""When we think about nuclear, I think the very first thing that comes to people's minds is the critical importance of heightened safety regulations, and so on its face, it looks like we are taking some of those away,"" Sen. Andrea Hunley (D-Indianapolis) said.

""When I hear it's up to the federal government, that doesn't make me feel safer for many reasons, and so I just want to have a little more assurance,"" she added.

Kerwin Olson, the executive director of Citizens Action Coalition, said his organization doesn't interpret the 1983 Supreme Court decision the same as IDEM does.

""We're really troubled by repealing the authority for the IDEM commissioner to call a public hearing on the potential implications of the siting of a nuclear facility in someone's community,"" Olson said.

Indiana has no commercial nuclear power plants, according to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, although a portion of Northern Indiana receives some power from the Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant in Bridgman, Michigan, operated by Indiana Michigan Power.

""Utility rates are too high. I hear it all the time,"" said Indiana Gov. Mike Braun in his State of the State address Wednesday.

Braun previously said he supports utility companies exploring the development of small modular reactors (SMRs). These are advanced nuclear reactors that can produce up to a third of the power produced by a traditional nuclear power reactor, according to the International Atomic Energy Commission.

Other provisions of the bill address the state Environmental Rules Board and correct outdated language. The committee advanced it 7-3.

A clean energy future is within reach.","Following is UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ message for the International Day of Clean Energy, observed on 26 January:

On this International Day of Clean Energy, we can feel the world shifting — but we must pick up the pace.

The science tells us we are heading for a temporary overshoot above 1.5°C. Our responsibility is to make that breach as small, as short, and as safe as possible — through a just, orderly and equitable transition away from fossil fuels.

Renewables are the engine that can drive this transition. They are the cheapest source of new power in most places. And last year, for the first time, wind, solar and other renewables generated more electricity worldwide than coal.

Renewable energy connects communities still left in the dark, provides clean cooking and opens the door to better health, education and opportunities. Renewables anchor new industries, create decent jobs and lower energy costs, while shielding countries from geopolitical shocks and market volatility.

Even so, the renewables revolution is not moving fast enough or far enough. Grid infrastructure is lagging well behind the expansion of clean energy capacity and high costs continue to shut many countries out of the transition entirely.

The road map is clear: we must triple global renewable capacity by 2030, by lifting barriers, cutting costs and connecting clean power to people and industry — with scale, speed and solidarity.

Regulators must adopt policies that reward clean power and streamline permitting while protecting people and nature. Utilities must upgrade, expand and digitize grids and interconnections, to carry clean power where it is needed and scale storage so power systems stay steady as renewables grow. Industry must diversify supply chains so more countries can manufacture, install and maintain clean energy systems. This includes the critical minerals essential to the transition, which must benefit producing countries and communities — not just global markets.

Finance must bring down the cost of capital, especially for developing countries with vast renewable potential. And multilateral development banks must reduce risk and unlock far greater private investment.

Most importantly, we must ensure this transition is just — protecting workers and communities, supporting education, industrial development and opportunity for all as energy systems evolve.

A clean energy future is within reach. Let us seize the moment — and bring the renewables revolution to every corner of the world.",https://press.un.org/themes/custom/un3_press/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-15 18:59:38.043992

Senate Democratic Leader Shelli Yoder, of Bloomington, said child care deserts are spreading and parents are on waitlists for years.
Braun ended the speech with a nod to the Indiana Hoosiers playing for the national college football championship Jan. 19.","INDIANAPOLIS — Gov. Mike Braun delivered a State of the State speech on Jan. 21 that was heavy on achievements, light on new goals and with a few football callouts.

“With our strong business environment, it’s not surprising that another organization has noticed that Indiana is open for business: the Chicago Bears,” he said. “We are working hard to bring the Chicago Bears to the Hoosier State.”

But most of the address focused on affordability for Hoosiers — from electric bills and rent to property taxes and child care.

“Affordability is our highest priority,” Braun told General Assembly members gathered in the Indiana House chamber.

“Together,” he continued, “we can make Indiana the state where your dollar goes further, where opportunity abounds for all who are willing to work hard, and where every Hoosier worker can build the life they deserve.”

Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray called it a good speech.

“He talked about some of the highlights and the really good story that Indiana has to tell,” he said.

Braun didn’t mention the bitter December redistricting battle that has strained some relationships in the Statehouse. Braun specifically said Bray and other Senate Republicans who opposed redistricting should lose their seats.

“There’s lots of hard things that happen in this place,” Bray said after Braun’s speech. “We are going to continue to come to work and do good work for Hoosiers, and look forward to working with the governor for that and with the House as well.”

Democrats pointed to numerous ways that Republicans are now hopping on the affordability bandwagon, giving examples of bills that the Democratic caucuses have offered in recent years but that Republicans rejected.

“If Statehouse Republicans wanted to lower costs, they would have already done that by now,” said House Democratic Leader Phil GiaQuinta. “They’ve been in charge for the past 20 years, and Gov. Braun is catching up the fact that Hoosiers are struggling.”

Backing these bills

Braun didn’t unveil a typical legislative agenda for his office, instead simply announcing support for several bills already moving through the legislative process.

For instance, he said he supports Republican Rep. Alaina Shonkwiler’s bill to protect Hoosiers from unnecessary utility rate increases.

While on the topic of energy, Braun issued a full-throated declaration of support for data centers. The behemoth centers have roiled numerous Indiana communities with Hoosiers concerned about electricity and water usage.

“AI is going to be key to the jobs and wages of the future, but data centers can’t stick Hoosiers with the power bill,” Braun said. “Companies that want big power in Indiana should pay their own way.”

That goal isn’t fully codified but rather an informal policy in negotiations for state support.

He specifically hailed Amazon building a $1.5 billion data center in northwest Indiana, saying “they’re going to pay for every cent of their power needs, and then some.”

Moving to homeownership, Braun said he supports a bill from GOP Rep. Doug Miller, R-Elkhart, to remove government hurdles and make it easier for Hoosiers to chase the American dream of owning a home.

“Home prices have surged because we aren’t building enough, and unnecessary regulations are driving up costs,” he said.

He also announced support for bills to limit cellphone use in schools; ensure that parents have veto power over their kids’ creating social media accounts; curb homelessness in public spaces and a constitutional change to make it easier to hold accused criminals in jail pre-trial.

Braun said affordable child care is needed to grow the Indiana economy and help Hoosiers get better jobs. But that specific priority item will have to wait a year.

“I look forward to digging in during the budget session (in 2027) on what we can do to invest in lowering child care costs,” he said. “I would like to see a program where businesses have skin in the game to help grow child care programs.”

But under his watch, the administration has cut reimbursement rates and capped child care vouchers for low-income parents. That has led to waitlists and day care centers closing around the state.

Senate Democratic Leader Shelli Yoder, of Bloomington, said child care deserts are spreading and parents are on waitlists for years.

“Costs are higher. Workers are leaving jobs they want because care does not exist. That did not happen by accident. It happened because child care was treated as an afterthought,” she said. “Child care is not an option, it’s an economic infrastructure.”

But GOP House Speaker Todd Huston pushed back, saying Republicans have passed measures to improve child care options, such as deregulation and tax credits for businesses to get involved.

“The best thing we can do is help support more supply and the government’s not going to be the best avenue to do that,” Huston said. “The best avenue to do that is reduce the regulations and let a lot of these folks that used to provide child care provide child care without having the burden of of all these government regulations that just do nothing but drive up costs.”

Kudos to Indiana

Braun also took time to list key accomplishments for his administration during his first year in office.

He reminded Hoosiers that he pushed a property tax bill that will save taxpayers $1.5 billion over the next three years. He has no plans for more property tax changes this year.

Braun pointed to cuts in state government that are making state agencies leaner and more efficient. He specifically applauded Indiana’s Medicaid program for finding $465 million in savings.

These savings have come through increased eligibility checks, tightened regulations and cuts to some programs.

“We’re continuing to deliver high-quality essential services that Hoosiers rely on, while you keep more of your money — because it’s not ours, it’s yours,” Braun said.

The education front also provided key highlights, with increased reading scores, a record-high graduation rate and new school accountability grades coming soon.

Braun also noted that Indiana’s real GDP is growing faster than the national rate and listed a string of big jobs announcements from recent months.

“Project after project, industry after industry, the story is the same: Indiana is the Midwest’s growth engine for more jobs and bigger paychecks,” he said.

Additionally, the governor listed public safety wins and efforts at retraining Hoosier workers.

Lawmakers gave two standing ovations for law enforcement and also included a “Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoosiers” chant at one point.

Braun ended the speech with a nod to the Indiana Hoosiers playing for the national college football championship Jan. 19.

“My administration has people from up and down the state. We have Butler fans, Notre Dame fans, Purdue fans … but on (Jan. 19) I expect to see all of them wearing cream and crimson. Go Hoosiers!”

He also said a 9-year-old from Shoals, Jack Gibson, asked whether the governor could delay the start of school Jan. 20 so he could stay up late and watch the Hoosiers win the night before.

“I like the sound of that,” Braun said. “I’ll leave it up to each school district to decide, but I think that sounds like a good idea.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/fwbusiness.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/c5/6c59c5f5-3d0f-47eb-8369-8da80fa35016/69695da9f31bb.image.jpg?crop=1536%2C806%2C0%2C172&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2026-01-15 21:58:36.498763

The discussion draft would significantly undermine the ability of the Toxic Substances Control Act to protect Americans from dangerous chemicals.

The Toxic Substances Control Act – the primary U.S. chemical safety law – gives EPA the authority to review chemicals for safety and protect people most at risk from exposure to toxic chemicals. The law is overwhelmingly popular across party lines, with more than four-in-five (82%) favoring it, according to new polling from Environmental Defense Fund.

“American families should be able to trust that the chemicals in their everyday products have been tested for safety and won’t cause them serious health problems,” said Joanna Slaney, Vice President for Political and Government Affairs at EDF. “The Toxic Substances Control Act is the country’s bedrock chemical safety law, and it keeps dangerous chemicals out of our homes, workplaces and communities. Tearing down these protections would allow more chemicals, like PFAS, to come to market without a proper safety review. Americans don’t want potentially toxic chemicals fast-tracked into their lives.

“This proposal includes a number of harmful provisions that would limit EPA’s ability to assess the safety of new chemicals before they come to market.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, on Thursday voted for final passage of a bill that would make appropriations available for Mississippi water systems, wastewater infrastructure, and unique cultural projects.

The Senate approved the FY2026 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, 82-15, as part of a three-bill package (HR.6938) that now goes to President Trump to be signed into law. The interior appropriations measure funds the U.S. Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Forest Service, and other agencies.

“For Mississippi, this bill is an important source of federal resources to help our communities upgrade water and wastewater infrastructure. It funds the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which has a direct influence on offshore energy development in the Gulf. And it also helps our state manage and preserve its historical legacy and historical site management,” Hyde-Smith said. “This is responsible legislation, and I look forward to it becoming law so these resources can be put to work in Mississippi.”

The enactment of this three-bill package will mean Congress has approved six of the 12 annual appropriations bills for FY2026. HR.6938 spends less money—$10 billion less—than if these agencies were funded under a continuing resolution. Congress has until January 30 to act on the remaining FY2026 funding bills before the current continuing resolution expires.

Among the items of interest to Mississippi in the Senate’s FY2026 Interior Appropriations Bill:

$7.8 million for the Cities of Clinton, Bolton, and Raymond for Regional Wastewater Improvements

$2.5 million for the DeSoto County Regional Utility Authority (DCRUA) Effluent Pump Station Project

$1.17 million for the City of Natchez for Stormwater Infrastructure Improvements

$500,000 for the City of Louisville for Historic Strand Theater Preservation and Restoration

The bill includes significant policy provisions that would benefit Mississippi, including:

$20 million for the American Battlefield Protection Program

Report language for Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to continue mineral assessments on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (Ole Miss)

Report language to direct EPA to continue to update and refine its draft of the Rodenticide Strategy

$49 million for the North American Wetlands Conservation Fund

Report language adopted via amendment directing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to restore, enhance, and better manage habitat for waterfowl and wildlife at the Mathews Brake and Yazoo National Wildlife Refuges, in partnership with local landowners and nonprofit conservation organizations.

The bill provides $2.8 billion for the EPA Clean Water and Drinking Water Revolving Funds that have been used successfully by communities throughout Mississippi to tackle water and wastewater infrastructure issues.

The National Parks in Mississippi would also benefit from funding in the bill to support the national parks’ operations, preserve historic sites, and sustain staffing capacity to address visitor services and park management needs.

But the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have slammed the breaks on an industry that had doubled its output in just three years south of the border.

In 2025, tariffs on parts components coming from outside North America and Trump’s elimination of tax credits on the purchase of electric vehicles hit Mexican EV production and overall vehicle exports hard, Finance Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Thursday.

“We closed (2025) with a reduction of just under 3 percent (in overall vehicle exports). It’s not as much as we had expected. We were bracing for a much bigger impact,” Ebrard said. “Everyone is (realigning) its production lines. Also, the U.S. did away with incentives of $7,500 on electric vehicles […] So, what happened? Demand fell.”

Ebrard said the future of EV production in Mexico will continue to hinge on U.S. consumer appetite. Mexico in 2024 exported 2.8 million total light vehicles to the United States. “Mexico produces a lot of electrical vehicles, so it’s part of that 3 percent” drop, the finance minister said, without specifying a percentile decrease in EV production.

Speaking at a news conference in Mexico City broadcast on YouTube, Ebrard expanded on how car manufacturers in Mexico are adjusting to U.S. tariffs.

He said exporters – including U.S. companies assembling cars in Mexican plants – sent their vehicles to the American market either under Most Favored Nation status or through the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement .

It’s easier to avoid tariffs of up to 27.5 percent by complying with rules of origin under the treaty, so 85 out of 100 automakers operating in Mexico are using that mechanism, he said.

“All the automakers who invested in adding North American content have a discount from that 27.5, down to 13 percent on average. If you don’t have parts from North America, your tariff is higher,” Ebrard said.

He added Mexican negotiators will be discussing the tariffs with their U.S. and Canadian during this summer’s USMCA review to ensure they are done under the framework of the agreement.",https://www.klfy.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2026/01/65710bd8733dc9.28598705-e1746111515993.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-15 23:58:06.137045

Since the devastating floods in Texas on July 4, Rep. Pfluger has been at the forefront of strengthening emergency alert systems, especially in rural or remote areas.

The Mystic Alerts Act would integrate satellite networks into wireless emergency alert processes. Expert witnesses testified last month that this legislation is a critical step toward closing the digital divide and strengthening public safety communications nationwide. The bipartisan legislation was passed unanimously out of the Subcommittee, where it awaits consideration by the full House Energy and Commerce Committee.

Read Rep. Pfluger’s full remarks in support of the Mystic Alerts Act below:

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I obviously support the bipartisan bill H.R. 7022, the Mystic Alerts Act, which I’m proud to lead alongside Representatives Lizzie Fletcher, Buddy Carter, and Mark Veasey.

I want to thank the co-leads for working closely with us to advance this bipartisan legislation. I appreciate their partnership and commitment to strengthening public safety communications, especially for communities that are too often left behind when disasters strike.

During our last public safety hearing, we heard powerful testimony from expert witnesses about the importance of strengthening the Wireless Emergency Alert System and their broad support for the Mystic Alerts Act. Witnesses emphasize that WEA’s are among the most effective tools available to protect the public, but also highlighted that coverage gaps still persist. They explained that incorporating space-based mobile broadband, as the Mystic Alerts Act does, into the WIA system would add redundancy, improve reliability, and help ensure alerts reach families and first responders, even in the most challenging circumstances.

Today, too many Americans lose access to alerts when cellular infrastructure is damaged, overwhelmed, or nonexistent, particularly in rural areas. This bill helps to close that gap by ensuring emergency alerts can still be delivered via satellite when traditional networks fail.

For me, this issue is personal. On July 4th, devastating floods swept through Central and West Texas, including the area around Camp Mystic, where two of my daughters were attending camp. When communication systems fail during moments like that, the consequences can be tragic. No family should miss a life-saving warning simply because infrastructure went down or service was unavailable.

There is still work to be done to incorporate technical assistance into this legislation, but moving the Mystic Alerts Act forward is a meaningful step toward modernizing public safety communications, closing dangerous gaps and emergency alert coverage, and ensuring Americans can receive critical information when it matters the most.

There’s a lot happening right now in U.S. energy and policy and it’s easy to lose track of the larger picture. I’m going to ask you to turn your attention, at least for a few minutes, to something bigger that’s also happening:

Solar power is moving toward dominance of the global energy system.

The trend lines for solar deployment, panel prices and efficiency all point to a future in which energy is cleaner, cheaper and more accessible than today.

A recent paper in Nature Energy summarizes where we’re likely heading. It lists more than 60 co-authors from some of the world’s leading research institutions, including the National Laboratory of the Rockies (which was the National Renewable Energy Laboratory before a recent name change), the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems in Germany and the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Japan.

“The global growth of photovoltaics for electricity generation has been remarkable, outpacing other energy technologies across history in rates of the expansion of manufacturing capacity and reduction in price,” said the paper.

As this continues, some of the main technological and policy challenges will involve designing an energy system that can operate with high levels of solar. Planners will need to develop a variety of power plants and energy-storage technologies to support the grid at night and during periods of low solar generation.

I spoke with Sarah Kurtz, an electrical engineering professor at the University of California, Merced and a co-author of the paper. She explained that the success of solar energy largely depends on the fact that the fuel—the sun—is free and plentiful.

“In one hour, the Earth receives enough light from the sun to power the world for the whole year,” she said.

She is a prolific researcher who has focused on improving solar panel performance, work she has focused on since the mid-1980s.

Andreas Bett, director of the Fraunhofer Institute and a co-author of the paper, said the growth of solar power has profound implications for making energy affordable and accessible. Solar is already the least expensive energy source in most of the world.

“There is no fundamental limit or resource problem for photovoltaic technology,” he said in an email. “It is a technology that will advance the prosperity of the entire global community. Nevertheless, it is important to continue developing the technology in order to ultimately achieve higher efficiency levels and thus reduce material consumption.”

The paper draws on discussions at the Terawatt Workshop, a gathering of solar researchers hosted in California in June 2024.

It begins by noting that the world now has 2 terawatts of solar photovoltaic generating capacity installed, which includes utility-scale and smaller systems. That’s a huge number, more than double what it was in 2022, according to the International Energy Agency.

Based on current manufacturing capacity and growth forecasts, the world is on track to install about 75 terawatts of solar by 2050, the paper said. This indicates growth on a transformational scale.

Solar power would expand because of a combination of declining panel prices and increasing efficiency. Today, a highly efficient panel can convert about 30 percent of the solar radiation striking it into electricity. The paper identifies technological improvements that could increase efficiency to 35 percent by mid-century.

As panels become more efficient, projects require fewer of them to generate the same amount of electricity, which saves land and materials.

To understand where we’re heading, it’s helpful to understand where we are. As of 2024, renewable energy sources produced 32 percent of the world’s electricity and were on the verge of overtaking coal as the global leader, according to the IEA.

Hydropower was the world’s leading source of renewable electricity in 2024, followed by wind and then solar. But solar, which was 7 percent of global electricity generation, is growing the fastest and is on track to become the largest source.

For governments and businesses, success in the energy economy of the future will depend on maximizing the benefits of solar and adapting to a grid dominated by solar.

Much of the world seems to understand this, but the United States under President Donald Trump is heading in the opposite direction with policies that favor fossil fuels and eliminate tax incentives for solar. The Trump administration often talks about this as a desire to achieve “energy dominance” through increasing production of coal, oil and natural gas.

“(M)y energy policy is defined by maximum production, maximum prosperity, and maximum power,” Trump said in an Oct. 17 proclamation designating “National Energy Dominance Month.”

I asked Bett what he makes of recent energy decisions by U.S. leadership.

“In my personal opinion, it is a mistake for the U.S. government to cut subsidies for photovoltaics,” he said. “It is the technology of the future and will be implemented worldwide. Developments will now progress outside the U.S.—especially in China, which will be able to establish itself as the sole global market leader. It is a shame that a high-tech nation like the U.S. is turning its back on a high-tech development.”

Kurtz said it’s shortsighted for the United States to not try to be a leader in solar.

“Solar is such a strong technology that the U.S. not supporting it will not be able to stop it,” she said. “The U.S. may get left behind.”",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-design-69.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 20:59:54.933963

Now analysts warn rising opposition to the massive warehouses powering the artificial intelligence revolution is shaping up to be a major factor in the 2026 midterm elections.

Data centers that provide the computing capacity and storage needed to power AI models like ChatGPT are emerging as the “villain” as Americans face high utility bills, Jefferies analysts said in a report this week.

Every political candidate running for office this election year will be forced ""to take a position whether they are pro or con data centers/AI.”

“It is not just an issue at the state and local levels but a federal topic as the election narrative forces the subject in every domain,"" they said. ""Not only will this feature prominently in state level elections, particularly those where there will be Gubernatorial turnover (term limits and not running again) but also nationally where we think many still underestimate the pivot in the Trump administration to focus on these issues.”

Trump: Tech must 'pay their own way' on data centers

President Donald Trump has championed data centers as critical to the U.S. economy and to the AI race with China, but he's facing growing pressure to lower costs for Americans who have soured on his handling of the economy.

Trump addressed voters' data center concerns on Monday, Jan. 12, saying his administration was working on deals with technology companies to ensure that Americans would not pick up the tab.

""I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,"" Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform. ""We are the ‘HOTTEST’ Country in the World, and Number One in AI. Data Centers are key to that boom, and keeping Americans FREE and SECURE but, the big Technology Companies who build them must 'pay their own way.'""

Electricity rates have spiked in recent years as utility companies replace aging infrastructure and upgrade the power grid. Data centers only increase energy demands.

A study last year from Carnegie Mellon University and North Carolina State University estimated that data centers and cryptocurrency mining could lead to an 8% increase in the average electricity bill by 2030 and could exceed 25% in major data-center markets such as northern Virginia.

Companies fear of backlash as electricity prices soar

Regions with a high concentration of data centers have seen sharp increases in electricity prices.

“In rural America right now, where data centers are being built, everyone’s already angry because their electricity prices have risen a lot,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright recently told the North American Gas Forum.

Democrat Abigail Spanberger won the Virginia governor's race in November by promising to lower utility bills amid steep rate hikes that voters blamed on the state’s data-center boom.

Sometimes referred to as the ""data center capital of the world"" or ""data center alley,"" Northern Virginia hosts a huge share of the globe's internet traffic.

“I do think it’s important that the brunt of data centers not be put on ratepayers and, in fact, that they pay their own way and their fair share,” Spanberger said during her campaign.

Technology companies fear the backlash against data centers threatens AI expansion.

Community pushback jumped between April and June last year. In just three months, 20 projects valued at $98 billion were delayed or blocked, more than the total for all previous quarters since 2023, according to Data Center Watch, which tracks the pushback.

Microsoft this week pledged to cover the costs associated with its data centers.

“Especially when tech companies are so profitable, we believe that it’s both unfair and politically unrealistic for our industry to ask the public to shoulder added electricity costs for AI,” Microsoft’s vice chair and president Brad Smith wrote in a blog post. “Instead, we believe the long-term success of AI infrastructure requires that tech companies pay their own way for the electricity costs they create.”","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/14/USAT/88185318007-20250812-t-142804-z-83130982-rc-2-xedahg-3-fd-rtrmadp-3-usapowerdatacenters.JPG?crop=3717,2091,x0,y215&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-15 19:00:46.406564

What are PFAS?

PFAS are a family of synthetic chemicals that have been manufactured and used in a variety of industrial and consumer settings since the 1940s. Commonly referred to as “forever chemicals,” PFAS can persist in the environment for decades and negatively affect human health. Exposure can occur in a variety of ways, including by breathing air containing PFAS, drinking water contaminated with PFAS and swallowing soil or dust contaminated with PFAS.

On April 19, 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designated two common PFAS chemicals, PFOS and PFOA, as hazardous under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA; P.L. 96-510), also known as the Superfund law. Under CERCLA, the potentially responsible parties that manufactured or released PFAS chemicals into the environment can be held liable for cleanup costs. Despite having no part in manufacturing or distributing PFAS, counties could face significant compliance and remediation costs due to the presence of these chemicals at county-owned airports, in landfills and water systems.

Alongside the 2024 designation, EPA stated that its intention will be not to compel passive receivers such as counties to pay for PFAS cleanup costs under a policy of enforcement discretion. However, counties are not fully protected from liability as this policy is non-binding and could be revoked by future Administrations. The enforcement discretion policy also does not prevent other potentially responsible parties from seeking to hold counties liable to recover PFAS cleanup costs through CERCLA.

Hearing Takeaways

In both hearings, lawmakers questioned witnesses about the impact of the CERCLA designation on local communities and economies, including whether EPA’s current discretionary enforcement policy would provide adequate long-term protection for passive receivers. Republican and Democratic members from both chambers highlighted their shared belief that any legislative or regulatory fix should respect the “polluter pays” principle and avoid shifting cleanup costs onto ratepayer- or taxpayer-funded infrastructure or utilities.

At the U.S. Senate hearing, Chairman Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va) emphasized the committee would work to “enact a bipartisan solution to minimize future PFAS contamination, develop a clear path to destroy PFAS and protect passive receivers” and “provide a permanent statutory fix remove the burden of case-by-case settlements by providing lasting legal certainty.” In the U.S. House, both Energy and Commerce Chairman Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.) and Environment Subcommittee Chairman Gary Palmer (R-Ala.) spoke in favor of examining how the CERCLA designation is adversely impacting public-interest passive receivers.",https://www.naco.org/sites/default/files/2026-01/GettyImages-1451944757.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 17:59:45.027262

Will 2026 be a disaster? I tend to think it won’t be.

At the very least, 2026 will eventually test a theory I espouse often in The Morning Dump, which is that there are EV buyers who are not being well-served by the market and will appear once there are more affordable vehicles. Some of those vehicles are coming, and in an environment with far fewer incentives, which will give us clearer data.

There’s a way to look at Stellantis as its own mad science experiment, and the data isn’t great. The new chief scientist is saying a lot of the right things, although it doesn’t sound like he’s going to change many of the variables just yet. The opposite of Stellantis might be Honda, which is a company with few brands that carefully works its way into new areas, like sport. Honda’s job is sport.

And, to wrap it all up, GM CEO Mary Barra doesn’t think people will plug in their plug-in hybrids.

Better EVs Are Coming

With the cancellation of the IRA tax credit for EVs, the market somewhat artificially expanded in Q3 and then predictably crashed in Q4. Overall? EV sales were down about 2% from 2024, which isn’t that terrible.

A lot of this decline was led by Tesla, which saw a 7% drop year-over-year, although it still makes up almost half of the EV market. GM was probably the biggest winner, growing 48%. The brand also has a range of vehicles, from the affordable Equinox all the way up to the mega expensive Cellestiq.

What will the market look like once the push-and-pull of the tax credit goes away? EV buyers are extremely loyal, so most EV buyers going back into the market are probably going to buy another one.

My contention has been that more affordable EVs will bring more buyers, but the caveat there is that they have to be from the right brands. The Equinox EV is great if people give it a chance. It’s a Chevy, so that’s a non-starter for some people. It’s also still slightly pricey without the tax credit for what you get.

“2025 unfolded largely as anticipated, with changes to federal EV incentives reshaping the demand patterns that drove record Q3 sales,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of Industry Insights at Cox Automotive. “Rather than signaling a retreat from electrification, this shift marks a structural transition toward a market increasingly driven by consumer choice. While 2026 will bring challenges, momentum remains grounded in market maturation: expanding model availability across price points, improving charging reliability, and continued advances in battery performance and cost.”

This year, the market is going to get fewer expensive two-row crossovers and more interesting cars. There’s the return of the Chevy Bolt, which starts below $30,000 without the credit. The new Leaf is a little more expensive, but it’s good. The BMW iX3 is going to slot in lower than BMW’s other popular EV offerings, and do so with 400 miles of range.

While I’m desperate to try the Rivian R3 when it launches, I do think the Rivian R2 might be a nice place for people considering a gas-powered or hybrid two-row crossover. At $45,000ish it seems like a good deal.

While I’m optimistic, that optimism is qualified a bit. I don’t think EVs will increase share or even beat 2025. I see a relatively flat year, which is consistent with the market overall. I do see hybrids taking a greater share, but mostly from ICE vehicles and not EVs.

The market is maturing and getting rid of vehicles that exist merely to have an EV option, like the Acura ZDX, and are being replaced by 2nd or 3rd generation EVs that are probably better for more people.

Stellantis Will Probably Stick Together

I should probably start using a different photo of Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa, mostly because MSN always flags it as being “violent.” It amuses me, so I won’t replace it until I find a new one.

Filosa has a tough job, and one of the challenges is that Stellantis has so many brands. All the brands. Should Stellantis kill some brands? It’s a discussion we’ve had, but it sounds like Filosa isn’t there yet, at least according to this interview in Bloomberg from the Detroit Auto Show, which may or may not have happened yesterday.

“We want to stay together,” he said Wednesday. “It’s a good combination.”

The comments are the latest indication that Stellantis’ leaders plan to largely continue the company’s current construction, formed through the 2021 merger of Fiat Chrysler and France’s PSA Group that created a portfolio of 14 brands.

Stellantis Chairman John Elkann similarly downplayed a potential breakup last February, saying the carmaker’s global reach and sale in major markets is a “big strength.”

Filosa is focused on turning sales around in the United States and fixing the mess the last guy made, so perhaps chucking out brands isn’t the best first step. Viva Lancia!

Honda Will Have A Sporty Version Of Most Of Its Cars

The Tokyo Auto Salon last week, and Honda announced that it was introducing a “SportLine” trim and “TrailLine” trim for basically everything. To clarify, “Sport Line” for the cars and “Trail Line” for the crossovers, although it would be great if Honda swapped those (Trail Line Accord?). This is the middle option in terms of performance, seemingly similar to Audi’s S-Line.

Based on Honda Sports DNA, Honda will expand its lineup of more exciting sport-type models, for both on-road and off-road driving. In addition, as the key pillar of its initiative to further enhance its sport-type model lineup, Honda will introduce HRC-spec models for a wider range of production models by leveraging technologies HRC has amassed through racing activities and feedback from its race drivers.

Honda has always been a company that loves motorsports, which is endearing. What’s more interesting to me is the HRC versions, as mentioned in this Automotive News article:

Honda’s upcoming TrailSport HRC offerings are expected to be priced higher than their standard-trim counterparts, spokesman Yuzo Mori said.

The HRC trim builds upon the TrailSport grades already offered in the U.S. on such nameplates as the Passport and CR-V crossovers, as well as the Ridgeline pickup.

TrailSport HRC offerings will incorporate sporty design cues and technologies amassed through Honda’s racing activities to differentiate them from existing TrailSport trims, Honda said.

What would a TrailSport HRC HR-V even do?

I don’t know, but I’m curious.

Mary Barra Doesn’t Think People Plug In Plug-Ins

I feel like David and I are always getting into arguments with our peers over the concept of vehicles with a gas engine and battery pack. Basically, one side thinks that no one plugs them in, and the other side thinks they do, but a lack of data means none of us know for sure.

The reality is probably somewhere in between and is likely highly dependent on the vehicle. Do I think Wrangler 4Xe owners are plugging in regularly? I doubt it. Are people who buy a Mercedes or BMW plug-in charging at home? Probably, yes.

There is some portion of the pro-EV crowd that’s still angry that their rosy projections for EV adoption turned out to be wrong, and this makes them lash out at hybrids, EREVs, and PHEVs. In fairness to them, the data on PHEV usage is hard to come by, and the fact that automakers are not anxious to share isn’t a good sign.

As reported by InsideEVs, GM CEO Mary Barra isn’t that keen on them either:

“What we also know today with plug-in hybrids is that most people don’t plug them in,” she said. “So that’s why we’re trying to be very thoughtful about what we do from a hybrid and a plug-in hybrid perspective.”

That’s kind of a bummer because vehicles like the Equinox Plus that GM sells in China are interesting. [Ed Note: I wouldn’t be surprised if people didn’t plug in their PHEVs (though I’m not convinced they don’t), as America’s PHEVs aren’t good enough. -DT].

What I’m Listening To While Writing TMD

If you are not a younger Millennial or a GenZer or whatever, you may have missed all of the Geese discourse. What you need to know is that it’s a rock band fronted by a guy named Cameron Winter, who is both handsome and talented, which means the Internet loves him. He’s got a sort of Rufus Wainwright thing to him as well that sounds a little different than what’s out there now. “Au Pays du Cocaine” is a good entry into the world of Geese.

The Big Question

Will people plug-in EREVs, which offer much more electric range than current PHEVs? [Ed Note: And to add to that question: If they don’t like plugging in their EREVs for whatever reason, would these customers have been happy with a BEV that has to be plugged in? -DT]",https://images-stag.jazelc.com/uploads/theautopian-m2en/Neu_Klasse_Bolt_R2_TMD_TS.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 17:00:41.232628

One of those tracks used to be set aside exclusively for electric vehicles as U.S. automakers sought to quickly build out the cars of the future.

But no longer. This year, both strips are open to hybrids and gas-powered vehicles as Detroit continues a pivot away from EVs since President Donald Trump returned to the White House with a pro-fossil fuels agenda.

“The show will always reflect what’s happening in the industry at the consumer level,” said Todd Szott, chairman of this year’s event and an auto dealer. “Obviously things have changed in the EV landscape.”

Some industry players say they're emphasizing “consumer choice” in the cars they're showing at Detroit's premier auto event. But some experts expressed concern about the EV pullback's long-term effect on American automakers as the rest of the globe — especially China — electrifies.

“What we worry about is how competitive will we be on the global stage as the market continues to advance around us,” Michael Robinet, vice president of forecast strategy at auto market intelligence firm S&P Global Mobility, said during a panel Wednesday on industry trends.

Electrification in the US

Including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1% last year, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week. Compare that to China, which saw 17% growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles last year, and Europe, which saw a 33% increase. (U.S. pure-EV market share was just under 8% in 2025, with 1.23 million EVs sold — a slight decline from 2024.)

None of that seemed to alarm President Donald Trump earlier this week when he toured the Ford River Rouge Complex, which churns out pickup trucks and more in suburban Dearborn. Trump used his time in Detroit to boast of policy changes on EVs and tariffs that he says have boosted U.S. automakers.

“Among my first acts in office was to end the radical left war on oil and gas and stop the crusade to kill American energy and, frankly, to open up cars so that you don’t have to have an electric car,” Trump said in remarks to an economic club before the plant tour.

Trump revoked a Biden-era target for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric, and has tried to block money obligated to EV charging across the nation’s highways. Under Trump, Congress cut tax incentives that saved buyers up to $7,500 on an EV purchase. The administration has also weakened fuel economy standards — going so far as eliminating penalties for the automakers who do not meet them — and gas mileage rules.

“I love electric cars. I think they’re great,” Trump added. “But I’ve been saying it for four years. They wanted everybody to have an electric car in a very short period of time.”

Those changes have cut into the U.S. industry in 2025 and cost automakers billions of dollars in investment.

Ford Motor Co. announced last month $19.5 billion in charges from electrification efforts and ending production of the all-electric version of the F-150 Lightning truck. Detroit rival General Motors also recently announced $6 billion in EV-related charges, among other losses, and has also rolled back some of its EV commitments. Even once- market leader Tesla had a tough 2025.

“I still push for it because, I mean, it is the future of the company,” said Shawn Strain, marketing manager at Ford. “We still are just completely committed to EVs. And it may not be as overt as we once were.”

Industry concern arises

But industry experts at and outside of the show say it's a tough time. The competitive auto landscape has been radically reshaped, they say, and China dominates what most see as the future of the industry.

“We have to look at what we’re up against. In a word — China,” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a speech at the show Thursday. ""China wants to dominate every part of auto manufacturing. They’re making major headway.

""They’ve captured major market share almost everywhere except the U.S. and Canada,"" she added. “We have to meet these challenges.""

Will Roberts, automotive research lead at Benchmark Minerals that released the 2025 data, warned that U.S. policy has made all the difference.

American automakers have responded to those changes, he said, but it would be good strategy if they made sure they were “keeping things ticking along in the background with a really compelling EV offering.”

Otherwise, the U.S. sector runs the risk of falling behind, Pete Buttigieg, former transportation secretary under former President Joe Biden, agreed.

In another panel at the show, Buttegieg said Trump can't stop electric vehicles from becoming the leading automotive technology.

“But he can stop America from being the leader in that technology,” Buttigieg said. ""Industry should point a different direction.”

Democrats protect funding to lower families’ energy bills, key investments in scientific research, and much more

Washington, D.C. — Today, the Senate, in a 82-15 vote, passed three bicameral, bipartisan fiscal year appropriations bills: the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies; Energy and Water Development; and Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies bills. The bills now head to the president’s desk to be signed into law. The House cleared the package in an overwhelming 397-28 vote last Thursday.

“Today, we sent funding bills to the president’s desk that reject the steep cuts he wanted and protect investments that families across America depend on every day,” said Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee and Ranking Member of the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee. “This package saves a key program to save families on their energy bills, sustains our investments in scientific research, and protects essential funding for our public lands and Tribes, among so much else. Passing these bills reasserts Congress’ power of the purse and will prevent this administration from having the legal authority to decide for itself how to spend these taxpayer funds again. Democrats will keep fighting to protect investments in the American people—and I look forward to getting the rest of our bills across the finish line.”

“Oregonians turned out in record numbers during my town halls last year and delivered a clear message: Congress must fight back against harmful funding cuts and do everything it can to protect our public lands, waters, and outdoor-driven economy. The FY 2026 Interior-Environment funding bill doesn’t go as far as I’d hoped, but it takes a solid stride toward taking on wildfire and smoke threats, supporting wildland firefighters, modernizing our water infrastructure, and fulfilling our trust and treaty responsibilities to Tribes,” said Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Ranking Member of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. “This bill also helps reassert Congress’ Power of the Purse in the face of President Trump’s authoritarian power grab and illegal funding cuts. The bill also rejects dozens of poison pill riders proposed by House Republicans and protects funding for operating and protecting our public lands, making it clear that Congress intends to ensure public lands stay in public hands. I look forward to this bill being signed swiftly into law to ensure communities in Oregon and across the nation have the necessary resources to tackle the greatest problems facing our environment, health, lands, air, and water.”

“As we face a lawless Trump Administration, Congress’s role in fighting for Americans’ priorities is all the more important. Within this bill, we worked to invest in those priorities, reject the Administration’s attempts to defund critical initiatives both in Maryland and nationally, and create new safeguards against their efforts to ignore Congressionally-mandated funds. This legislation will help boost economic opportunity and strengthen public safety in our communities,” said Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Ranking Member of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee. “We also fought to reject the Trump Administration’s attacks on science, including at NASA Goddard, NOAA, and NIST – all based in my home state of Maryland. I also worked within this bill to secure language to reassert Congress’s oversight role in the new FBI headquarters and to ensure the new headquarters meets the mission and security needs of the FBI. While this bill is not perfect – including Republicans’ decision to strip my amendment requiring DOJ preserve and report to Congress on the Epstein files – it rejects many Republican poison pills that would make our communities less safe, trample Americans’ civil rights, restrict access to healthcare, impede important scientific research, and so much more. The investments we secured in this legislation were hard-fought, and this bill will help invest in and protect important priorities for the American people.”

Throughout negotiations, Democrats fought to protect the programs and investments that matter most to working families across the country. Among much else, this three-bill package delivers important investments for the American people:

FAMILIES’ ENERGY COSTS: Rejects President Trump’s push to eliminate the Weatherization Assistance Program that saves families an average of $372 per year on their energy bills by making energy efficiency upgrades. Instead, Democrats secured a $3 million increase in funding for the program.

SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH: Rejects President Trump’s efforts to slash funding for the National Science Foundation by 57%, gut funding for the Department of Energy’s Office of Science by $1.1 billion, and slash NASA’s science budget by 47%. Instead, the package sustains research funding for NSF, provides $160 million more for the Office of Science, which supports critical research being conducted by 22,000 researchers at our 17 national labs and over 300 universities, and provides $7.25 billion for NASA’s science budget.

PUBLIC LANDS & NATIONAL PARKS: Rejects President Trump’s push to cut funding for the National Park Service by over $1 billion and provides the funding necessary to fully support the longstanding operations of America’s public lands.

FLOOD PREVENTION: Provides $10.44 billion for the Army Corps, a historic funding level, rejects President Trump’s push to cut funding by $2 billion, and reasserts congressional control over which projects get funded and how much funding they receive.

VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN: Provides $7 million more for grant programs administered by the Office of Violence Against Women, rejecting President Trump’s efforts to cut over $200 million in funding for the office, which provides grants to communities nationwide to help survivors of domestic and dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION: Rejects President Trump’s push to slash funding for the EPA—providing $4.7 billion above his request. Also rejects extreme riders that would enshrine detrimental policies in law.

TRIBES: Delivers essential funding to support Tribes and our treaty obligations to them—rejecting President Trump’s push to slash funding for Tribes by nearly $1 billion.

REASSERTS CONGRESSIONAL CONTROL: Prevents President Trump and his cabinet secretaries from unilaterally deciding how to spend taxpayer dollars. Right now, the Trump administration has significantly more discretion to decide how to allocate federal funding thanks to Republicans’ yearlong continuing resolution for fiscal year 2025, which failed to provide detailed funding directives for hundreds of programs and turned over decision-making power to the executive branch to fill in the gaps itself. This package provides detailed directives about how funds are to be spent—just as Congress has long done when writing full-year appropriations bills—so that Congress, and not the executive branch, decides how taxpayer dollars are spent.

REJECTS EXTREME REPUBLICAN RIDERS: Rejects over 140 extreme riders and proposals included in House Republicans’ draft bills—and many more sought by President Trump in his budget request.

“Congress—that’s us. So, let’s choose to exercise our power and make sure our states’ voices are heard by passing these bills now and getting them signed into law.”

The three-bill package includes $5 billion specific to Washington state, including $3.2 billion for Hanford, a Central Washington nuclear cleanup site, and $190 million for construction at Howard A. Hanson Dam, a project supporting fish passage and flood risk reduction along the Green River near Seattle that the Trump administration shirked in its funding proposals.

“I said I would tear up Trump’s budget and write a new one — and I did,” said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, which is tasked with drafting the federal government funding bills.

“These are not the bills I would have written on my own; they are the result of tough bipartisan negotiations with Republicans who control every branch of government,” Murray added. “But these bills ensure that Congress — not Donald Trump — is deciding how taxpayer dollars get spent.”

The bills also include funds for salmon recovery initiatives in the Pacific Northwest, research at Washington state universities and money that will trickle down to the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

The bipartisan effort comes months after a partisan stalemate caused the longest government shutdown in history. Murray and Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., along with fellow Democrats, hailed the measures as a repudiation of Trump’s efforts to slash federal funding for critical offices and programs.

Republicans, including Reps. Dan Newhouse, of Sunnyside, and Michael Baumgartner, of Spokane, applauded the still modest spending trims in the bills.

“My immediate focus in the new year is passing our remaining government funding legislation and avoiding another costly shutdown,” Newhouse, a member of the House Appropriations Committee, said in a statement. “We worked hard over the last year crafting commonsense, conservative policies that rein in bloated spending, refocus taxpayer dollars on programs that support the federal government’s responsibilities and bring home millions of dollars to Central Washington for essential projects.”

Lawmakers are debating and approving spending bills before a Jan. 30 deadline to fund the federal government.

The three measures approved Thursday allocate funding for energy and water development; commerce, justice, science and related agencies; and interior, environment and related agencies. The measures passed the House last week, and now head to the president’s desk. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Trump is expected to sign them into law.

The Hanson Dam, completed in 1962, proved critical last month in protecting Western Washington after an intense series of atmospheric river events forced evacuations, breached levees and swallowed roads.

Murray sounded the alarm last year when the Trump administration didn’t include a previously earmarked $500 million for the Hanson Dam. Thursday’s legislation wrestles some of that funding back, she said, as a major win for Washington state. The $190 million marked for its construction in Thursday’s legislation will allow the Army Corps of Engineers to incrementally fund a fish passage project for threatened Chinook salmon at the dam, a long-awaited investment that supports the state’s salmon recovery efforts, treaty obligations and the region’s river-based economy.

The legislation passed Thursday also preserves funding for NASA, which supports over 1,000 jobs in Washington state, and the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration, which provides critical weather monitoring services and has research arms involving Washington state-based scientists — budgets that Trump sought to eviscerate.

Cantwell, chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, called the bills a “win for science,” during a speech on the Senate floor.

“The president’s budget would have slashed a quarter of NASA’s funding and half of the National Science Foundation’s funding, jeopardizing our economic competitiveness and national security,” Cantwell said in a statement. “Instead, Congress held the line, … Our world-class researchers and technologists will have the resources they need to expand the boundaries of knowledge that have long enabled us to invent our future.”",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01152026_tzr_tzr_133318.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2026-01-15 17:59:50.056204

The term is a fraction of the 15-year contract that the Louisiana regulators approved, though that length also worried opponents.
The company also maintains that the ""suggestion that Entergy Louisiana somehow misled the commission is utterly without merit and false.""","Environmental and consumer groups want Louisiana officials to investigate how a new financing structure for Meta's $27 billion artificial intelligence data center in the state's northeast could impact electricity bills for residents.

Meta can leave the data center after only four years, far shorter than the 15-year term approved in August by state regulators, the nonprofits say. The altered financing ""significantly increases ratepayer risk,"" according to a motion filed Wednesday with the Louisiana Public Service Commission on behalf of two nonprofit groups.

""Meta is acknowledging tacitly I suppose that the buildout of this facility is risky,"" said Logan Burke, who runs the Louisiana-based Alliance for Affordable Energy.

Entergy, which is building the electricity plants for the data center, disputes the nonprofits' claims.

The Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities, approved in August the plan to power Meta's biggest-ever data center, a project that will need roughly three times the amount of electricity annually that New Orleans uses in a year. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has separately spoken of further expanding the data center to a size that would rival the footprint of Manhattan, though some analysts have expressed doubt over whether that is possible.

The controversial approval cleared the way for Entergy, the state's largest utility, to begin constructing three gas-fired electricity plants and other infrastructure worth billions of dollars. Advocates and academics have also raised concern over the environmental risks of the new fossil fuel-powered gas plants and the water demands of the facility.

On the day Louisiana regulators approved Meta's power plan, the tech company ""fundamentally altered"" the financial setup of the Richland Parish data center, the nonprofits allege.

Under the complex financial model, Meta teamed up with a top private equity firm in a deal that helps the tech company offset financial risk and guarantees a profit for the private equity company, according to The Wall Street Journal. The restructuring essentially gives the private equity company majority ownership of the data center and makes Meta a tenant, able to exit the lease every four years for up to 20 years.

The term is a fraction of the 15-year contract that the Louisiana regulators approved, though that length also worried opponents. The three gas plants that Entergy is building have a lifespan of up to 40 years, the nonprofits argued over a monthslong approval process, potentially leaving ratepayers on the hook for some costs of the new infrastructure if the tech company leaves.

The nonprofit groups want the commission to investigate whether Meta or Entergy misled the state regulators, determine the effect of the new financial structure on ratepayers and review the timing of the financial rearrangement.

A spokesperson for Meta could not be reached for comment.

Entergy disagrees

Brandon Scardigli, a spokesperson for Entergy, said the company strongly disagrees with the allegation that changes to the data center financing puts Entergy or its customers at risk.

""That is simply false,"" Scardigli said.

The deal between Meta and Entergy is supported and backstopped by robust credit protections, Scardigli said, including a guarantee from the tech company that remains ""in full force"" regardless of changes to project financing. The company also maintains that the ""suggestion that Entergy Louisiana somehow misled the commission is utterly without merit and false.""

Entergy has previously stressed that the tech company will cover all revenue for the new plants throughout the 15-year deal, though all customers will pay for other related infrastructure costs. The plants will be able to serve everyone if Meta leaves after the 15-year deal as the utility retires older, less-efficient plants.

Part of the nonprofits' concern is related to the creation of a new entity majority-owned by the private equity firm, Blue Owl, and partly owned by Meta. That new entity will now serve as the parent company of the subsidiary that entered into the electricity deal with Entergy. Meta itself had previously been the parent company of the subsidiary, which is called Laidley.

""There is no longer an enforceable parent guaranty since Meta is no longer the parent,"" the nonprofits' motion states.

Concern from regulators

Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell, whose district includes Richland Parish, said his staff is looking into the request.

""We're concerned about it, but we feel good that we have a financial backer in Entergy,"" Campbell said.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/21/221d11c8-6513-5af1-a0e4-d5074c5c8c85/6893bb6edd10b.image.jpg?crop=1801%2C946%2C0%2C102&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2026-01-15 17:01:06.739095

Governor Whitmer Signs Executive Directive to Explore Clean Energy Resources

Executive directive establishes Michigan as a leader in geologic hydrogen, a resource with the potential to create good-paying jobs, attract long-term investments, and lower energy costs for Michiganders

LANSING, Mich. – Today, Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed an executive directive creating an initiative to explore geologic hydrogen as a usable, clean fuel alternative. Michigan’s unique geology makes it one of the most promising regions in the world for geologic hydrogen, a naturally occurring clean energy resource. This new initiative will determine the possibility of tapping into Michigan’s geologic hydrogen and using this natural fuel to build the future of clean energy.

“Michigan is a leader in clean-energy solutions,” said Governor Whitmer. “This initiative will uncover more about Michigan’s geologic hydrogen stores, which have the potential to attract long-term investments in our state and create thousands of good paying jobs for Michiganders. Together, we’re building the future of clean energy in Michigan.”

“Geologic hydrogen represents a transformative opportunity for Michigan, a state historically rich in natural resources and innovation,” said Jim Saber, President and CEO of NextEnergy. “By tapping into this abundant, naturally occurring resource, Michigan can lead the way in sustainable energy, create new jobs, and drive technological advancement. This isn’t just about energy—it’s about securing Michigan’s future as a leader in environmental stewardship and economic resilience, ensuring prosperity for generations to come.”

“It’s not every day we discover new, abundant energy sources — the last one was nuclear power over 80 years ago,” said Ishan Sharma, who directs geologic hydrogen efforts at Renaissance Philanthropy. “It’s even better when the new resource is potentially 90% less expensive than the way we make clean hydrogen today. Michigan’s one of the best places to show the world how geologic hydrogen can lower the costs of goods like steel & fuels, while cutting emissions in those industries decades earlier than anyone thought possible.”

“Michigan has the natural resources and industrial know-how to lead in clean fuels and hydrogen production,” said Jane McCurry, Executive Director of Clean Fuels Michigan. “This Executive Directive takes an important step toward responsibly developing geologic hydrogen, helping position the state to attract private investment, support manufacturing growth, and create high-quality jobs.”

“Governor Whitmer’s directive sends a clear signal that Michigan is serious about leading in geological hydrogen,” said Judd Herzer, Director of Mobility Research and Innovation at Michigan State University. “With the right coordination across state agencies, research institutions, and the private sector geological hydrogen can move rapidly from scientific promise to practical application, supporting hydrogen-powered mobility, clean energy independence, and the advanced manufacturing opportunities that will define Michigan’s next era of innovation.”

Geologic Hydrogen

Geologic hydrogen is a natural energy resource with the potential to serve as a fuel source at a scale and price that is competitive with fossil fuels. This uniquely clean resource can decarbonize some of the highest emission-producing industries, such as heavy-duty transportation, maritime shipping, and manufacturing. Michigan’s high potential for large, natural stores of geologic hydrogen has drawn significant national and international attention. Today’s initiative will build on Michigan’s leadership in clean-energy solutions.

Investments in geologic hydrogen will solidify Michigan’s place at the forefront of the U.S. hydrogen economy, which is projected to reach tens of billions of dollars in new economic activity. Opportunities in clean hydrogen will create new, high-wage jobs for Michiganders, lower industrial production costs, encourage long-term, statewide investments, and keep Michigan competitive in a global marketplace.

Michigan’s Clean Energy Future

Today’s executive directive builds on Governor Whitmer’s commitment to a clean-energy future for Michigan. Since taking office, the Whitmer-Gilchrist Administration has:

Michigan named a leader in clean energy race, ranked 6th nationally for clean energy jobs, #1 state for energy sector job growth, automotive industry and electric vehicle investments.

Signed a historic legislation package to deliver on the MI Healthy Climate Plan and develop a road map for Michigan to reach 100% carbon neutrality by 2050.

Signed a package of bills making Michigan a national leader in clean energy with the adoption of a 100% clean energy standard and more.

Signed bipartisan budgets investing millions in climate-resilient infrastructure, electric school buses, renewable energy for low-income families, and more.

Launched a new office to help Michigan workers take advantage of high-tech, high-paying jobs in automotive and clean energy sectors.

While the US sits in self-imposed isolation, the rest of the world, led by China, raced ahead to invest in renewables and commit to action on climate change, which Trump has called a 'hoax' and 'con job'. “Bye-bye, little boy.”

How Long Will Trump Be Able to Deny Reality with His Energy Policy? Trump’s irrational hatred of solar and wind imperils both the environment and the economy. It would be almost funny if it weren’t so tragically shortsighted. It’s hard to imagine a more catastrophic series of economic decisions.

It feels like American politics is displacing all other energy related discussions on this subreddit. Of the top 15 posts from the past month, 12 are about Trump. Even when there are non-US topics some comments can't help but make the discussion revolve around this senile old man.

A Powerful Essay On Renewable Energy Reminds Us How Witheringly Stupid The US Has Become. “Solar power is now growing faster than any power source in history, and it is closely followed by wind power."" Nevertheless, the Trump administration insists that we are still stuck in the 20th century.

Trump Wants to Unleash Energy, as Long as It’s Not Wind or Solar. Trump is testing legal boundaries with aggressive orders designed to stop the transition to renewable energy. “If there really were an energy emergency, then the right thing to do would be to increase supplies of all forms of energy.""

America must break its addiction to fossil fuels. If Trump were really worried about an energy shortage, he would advocate the rapid deployment of clean, inexhaustible and indigenous renewable energy. Instead, he issued an order “Terminating the Green New Deal” and paused funding for clean energy.

Trump, With Tariffs and Threats, Tries to Strong-Arm Nations to Retreat on Climate Goals: The president has made no secret of his distaste for wind and solar in America. Now he’s taking his fossil fuel agenda overseas.

The five most unhinged climate lies Trump told in 2025. From “global cooling” to “beautiful coal”, the president’s opinions, once more, had no basis in fact. In a year littered with lies and wild declarations, these are the five that stood out as the most startling.

US clean energy jobs hit 3.56M in 2024, growing more than three times faster than the rest of the US, but Trump may kill the boom. “This was one of the hottest and most promising job sectors in the country at the end of 2024. Now, job growth is at serious risk – and with it, our overall economy.""

The incoherence of Trump’s ‘energy emergency’. Critics have dismissed the emergency as a fabrication. Attorneys general from 15 states are challenging it in court. And Trump, whose policies are slowing the construction of cheap, clean energy, is not exactly acting like there’s an emergency at hand.

Where are the climate Republicans? “They all folded like origami. Even to the detriment of their own districts."" Trump’s pro-fossil-fuel ethos is now firmly in control. ""The sobering lesson is that Trump has correctly judged that politics is about the short term — the consequences be damned.""

Trump’s words don’t match his actions on energy. Trump is actively thwarting increased domestic energy production, reliability and security while kneecapping the creation of good-paying jobs for Americans. Over 80,000 clean energy jobs have already been lost or stalled due to his actions.

Trump Administration Yanks Billions in Funding for Cutting-Edge Clean Energy Projects. “And for what? The administration has been explicit that these cancellations have nothing to do with acting in the best interests of this country and everything to do with satisfying partisan vindictiveness.

The journal ‘Science’ criticizes Trump’s anti-renewable energy policy: ‘The US is failing to benefit from its own innovations’. Renewable energy is now the world’s leading source of electricity. China has become the leading manufacturer while the US is betting on an energy model stuck in the past.

The Republicans kneecapped America's clean energy sector. Now Trump aims to squash it. The policies Trump is targeting were enacted to help US firms compete. Trump “doesn’t understand or doesn’t care that solar, wind, and batteries are the cheapest, quickest, made-in-America energy we can deploy.""

How Trump dismantled a promising energy industry — and what America lost. The demolition of the offshore wind sector in 2025 will reverberate for decades, resulting in lost jobs, higher utility bills, and less reliable power grids. ​“Nobody understands why Trump did it."" ""madness.""

Trump’s war on energy: If we’re in an energy emergency, why kill the cleanest, best, and fastest growing sources? Trump is waging a very real war on renewable energy. They’ve clawed back funds, killed tax credits, subjected wind and solar to heightened reviews and eliminated wind leasing areas.

The real winners of Trump’s attack on clean energy aren’t American. Trump is undercutting clean energy at the same time economics are propelling it globally. “Renewable energy isn’t being done by countries because they are woke. That is a stupid statement. It is being done because it is economic.”

Trump’s Opposition to Clean Energy Is Costing You Money. Until this year, America was set to embark on its largest investments in history toward clean and affordable energy and good-paying jobs. Trump has tossed that progress out the window. It’s time for Congress to intervene.

Trump Tries To Turn The Clock Back On Energy. Trump's attempts to turn back the clock on coal is just one of many ways he’s threatening America’s scientific and technological leadership. The United States now faces a future in which it may no longer be the preeminent scientific power.

The year Trump tried and failed to stop clean energy. A whopping 92% of all new electricity capacity added in the US was solar, wind or batteries. EV sales set a new record in Q3. Trump simply can’t stop the energy transition. But he did manage to slow it down and make it more expensive for America.",,N,,2026-01-15 19:59:41.303391

Australia is also developing its own critical minerals reserve.","A bipartisan group of US lawmakers on Thursday introduced a bill to create a $2.5-billion stockpile of critical minerals, a move aimed at stabilizing market prices and encouraging domestic mining and refining.

The bill marks Washington's latest attempt to offset what policymakers view as Chinese manipulation of prices for lithium, nickel, rare earths and other critical minerals - vital for items from electric vehicles to high-tech weaponry - that has stymied American mining companies for years.

A China-generated glut of lithium, for example, led North Carolina-based Albemarle to pause US expansion plans in 2024. The Pentagon became the largest shareholder in Nevada-based rare earths company MP Materials in July amid intensifying Chinese competition.

The 68-page bill says China has moved to ""weaponize its influence over prices and volumes in the contest for access to critical minerals.""

BILL AIMS TO 'INSULATE US FROM FOREIGN THREATS'

China has rejected assertions that it manipulates the market for critical minerals, saying in November it is committed to ""upholding the security and stability of global production and supply chains.""

To become law, the measure must pass the House of Representatives and the Senate and be signed by President Donald Trump.

The bill would create a Strategic Resilience Reserve with a seven-person board, modeled on the Federal Reserve's governance structure, which would oversee the fund.

Members, appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, would be tasked with buying minerals considered critical by US agencies and stockpiling them at warehouses across the country. The board would need the technical expertise to ensure the minerals are stored properly. Certain lithium derivatives, for example, emit hydrogen when exposed to water.

The bill prioritizes recycled material, but minerals extracted from mines would be eligible. Allied countries would be able to join the reserve if they contributed at least $100-million.

Minerals could be sold for private-industry or defense purposes. Any profit would be used to buy more minerals and keep the stockpile active in perpetuity.

""Providing targeted investments and stockpiling key inputs will help insulate the US from foreign threats and will provide a significant - and cost effective - boost to the U.S. economy,"" said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Senator Todd Young, an Indiana Republican, co-sponsored the legislation. Representative Rob Wittman, a Virginia Republican, introduced the same measure in the House.

The reserve's board would have flexibility over how to buy minerals, according to Senate aides. It could, for example, agree to pay twice the existing market price for rare earths - a market dominated by China - if such purchases supported US mines.

Many niche-but-essential minerals on which Beijing has imposed export controls are not traded or lightly traded, sparking a push for minerals prices not tied to Chinese production.

""It's certainly possible this reserve could create a Western price for certain critical minerals,"" a Senate aide said.

Group of Seven finance ministers this week discussed floors for minerals prices. Trump on Wednesday said US over-reliance on other nations for critical minerals is a national security threat.

Australia is also developing its own critical minerals reserve.",https://cdn.creamermedia.com/assets/articles/images/resized/0001247674_resized_uscapitolbuildingreuters1022.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 21:58:30.341071

WASHINGTON D.C. — This week, the federal Environmental Protection Agency announced that methane gas turbines, even temporary ones that will operate for less than a year, require construction permits and air permits.

The announcement came as the agency revised its New Source Performance Standard, which regulates air pollution from gas turbines. The revised rule confirms what local Memphis community groups have been saying for months: that temporary methane gas turbines like the ones xAI is using to power its South Memphis data centers are subject to NSPS and require air permits.

In fact, EPA emphasizes that methane gas turbines have never been exempt from the regulations, writing: ""Historically, however, the EPA has not regulated combustion turbines, even those that may be portable, as nonroad engines, but rather as stationary sources."" The statement is a clear rebuke of arguments from local leaders that turbines at the xAI site qualified for a so-called ""nonroad engine loophole.""

In response to this announcement, the Southern Environmental Law Center, on behalf of Young, Gifted & Green and the NAACP, sent a letter to the Memphis and Shelby County Air Pollution Control Board, alerting the board to the EPA revision and urging them to ensure the Shelby County Health Department changes its policies on unpermitted gas turbines to be in line with federal regulations.

Below are statements from the Southern Environmental Law Center, Young Gifted & Green, and NAACP in response to the announcement:

""EPA's gas turbine decision makes it clear that companies are not — and have never been — allowed to build and operate methane gas turbines without a permit and that there is no loophole that would allow corporations to set up unpermitted power plants. We expect local health leaders to take swift action to ensure they are following federal law and to better protect neighbors from harmful air pollution,"" SELC Senior Attorney Amanda Garcia said.

""Memphians have been yelling from the top of our polluted lungs that allowing methane turbines to operate for almost a year with no permit is not only inhumane, but illegal. The Shelby County Health Department should at least do the bare minimum,which is following the law. If it refuses, the Air Pollution Control Board needs to hold the Shelby County Health Department accountable,"" LaTricea Adams, CEO and President of Young, Gifted & Green, said. ""As a daughter of South Memphis that lost my father way too soon living in a polluted community, I demand that the Air Pollution Control Board reconvene another public meeting immediately to best address this critical issue.""

""Our communities, air, water, and land are not playgrounds for billionaires chasing another buck,"" said Abre' Conner, NAACP Director of Environmental and Climate Justice. ""We've seen enough from Elon Musk and other elites who act as if they are above the law in certain cases, and here, they add to pollution that impacts our livelihoods. We will not let them in SouthMemphis or anywhere else. The NAACP has a long history of fighting environmental injustice, and in an era of booming data centers and skyrocketing greenhouse gas emissions, our work will only grow more urgent. This is our only home, and we have only one body. If you think our health is something we'll compromise, you're mistaken.""

“I love electric cars.
In another panel at the show, Buttegieg said Trump can’t stop electric vehicles from becoming the leading automotive technology.","DETROIT (AP) — At the North American International Auto Show, tires squeal as gearheads put shiny new vehicles through their paces on a pair of indoor tracks that sprawl across the event space. One of those tracks used to be set aside exclusively for electric vehicles as U.S. automakers sought to quickly build out the cars of the future.

But no longer. This year, both strips are open to hybrids and gas-powered vehicles as Detroit continues a pivot away from EVs since President Donald Trump returned to the White House with a pro-fossil fuels agenda.

“The show will always reflect what’s happening in the industry at the consumer level,” said Todd Szott, chairman of this year’s event and an auto dealer. “Obviously things have changed in the EV landscape.”

Some industry players say they’re emphasizing “consumer choice” in the cars they’re showing at Detroit’s premier auto event. But some experts expressed concern about the EV pullback’s long-term effect on American automakers as the rest of the globe — especially China — electrifies.

“What we worry about is how competitive will we be on the global stage as the market continues to advance around us,” Michael Robinet, vice president of forecast strategy at auto market intelligence firm S&P Global Mobility, said during a panel Wednesday on industry trends.

Electrification in the US

Including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1% last year, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week. Compare that to China, which saw 17% growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles last year, and Europe, which saw a 33% increase. (U.S. pure-EV market share was just under 8% in 2025, with 1.23 million EVs sold — a slight decline from 2024.)

None of that seemed to alarm President Donald Trump earlier this week when he toured the Ford River Rouge Complex, which churns out pickup trucks and more in suburban Dearborn. Trump used his time in Detroit to boast of policy changes on EVs and tariffs that he says have boosted U.S. automakers.

“Among my first acts in office was to end the radical left war on oil and gas and stop the crusade to kill American energy and, frankly, to open up cars so that you don’t have to have an electric car,” Trump said in remarks to an economic club before the plant tour.

Trump revoked a Biden-era target for half of new vehicle sales in the U.S. to be electric, and has tried to block money obligated to EV charging across the nation’s highways. Under Trump, Congress cut tax incentives that saved buyers up to $7,500 on an EV purchase. The administration has also weakened fuel economy standards — going so far as eliminating penalties for the automakers who do not meet them — and gas mileage rules.

“I love electric cars. I think they’re great,” Trump added. “But I’ve been saying it for four years. They wanted everybody to have an electric car in a very short period of time.”

Those changes have cut into the U.S. industry in 2025 and cost automakers billions of dollars in investment.

Ford Motor Co. announced last month $19.5 billion in charges from electrification efforts and ending production of the all-electric version of the F-150 Lightning truck. Detroit rival General Motors also recently announced $6 billion in EV-related charges, among other losses, and has also rolled back some of its EV commitments. Even once- market leader Tesla had a tough 2025.

“I still push for it because, I mean, it is the future of the company,” said Shawn Strain, marketing manager at Ford. “We still are just completely committed to EVs. And it may not be as overt as we once were.”

Industry concern arises

But industry experts at and outside of the show say it’s a tough time. The competitive auto landscape has been radically reshaped, they say, and China dominates what most see as the future of the industry.

“We have to look at what we’re up against. In a word — China,” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in a speech at the show Thursday. “China wants to dominate every part of auto manufacturing. They’re making major headway.

“They’ve captured major market share almost everywhere except the U.S. and Canada,” she added. “We have to meet these challenges.”

Will Roberts, automotive research lead at Benchmark Minerals that released the 2025 data, warned that U.S. policy has made all the difference.

American automakers have responded to those changes, he said, but it would be good strategy if they made sure they were “keeping things ticking along in the background with a really compelling EV offering.”

Otherwise, the U.S. sector runs the risk of falling behind, Pete Buttigieg, former transportation secretary under former President Joe Biden, agreed.

In another panel at the show, Buttegieg said Trump can’t stop electric vehicles from becoming the leading automotive technology.

“But he can stop America from being the leader in that technology,” Buttigieg said. “Industry should point a different direction.”

The U.S. has completed the first sales of Venezuelan oil that are part of a $2 billion deal reached this month between Caracas and Washington, a U.S. official told Reuters on Wednesday. The first sales were valued at $500 million, with additional sales expected in the coming days and weeks, the official said.

President Donald Trump's administration has said it will sell up to 50 million barrels of the country's stranded oil and will keep selling produced Venezuelan oil indefinitely.

In December, oil buyers in Asia demanded deep discounts on Venezuelan crude due to a flood of sanctioned oil from Russia and Iran on offer and to the heightened risk of loading in the South American country, traders said. Due to quality issues with the oil and U.S. sanctions, state oil company PDVSA had been forced to slash prices, with the discount to Brent benchmark crude about double year-ago levels.

With Russian and Iranian supplies also sold at deep discounts, buyers in China were barely biting at offers of Venezuela's flagship Merey heavy crude at $14 per barrel below Brent, a trader involved in sales to Chinese independent refiners said in December.

This week, Venezuelan heavy crude Merey-16 oil was offered for U.S. Gulf Coast delivery at a discount of around $6 to Brent crude futures, a trader said on Wednesday, while Western Canadian Select at Houston settled at a roughly $12.50 discount to Brent on Tuesday.

Jared Polis’ 2026 State of the State address to the Colorado General Assembly, which he delivered at about 11 a.m., Jan. 15.

Your Excellencies Madam Speaker and President Coleman, and Minority Leaders Caldwell and Simpson, thank you, welcome to my final State of the State address. I am truly humbled to be here as your Honorable Governor. It has been such an honor to be your Governor.

To my family, who have been on this journey since day one. Thank you, Marlon, for your unwavering support and for your inspiring work as Colorado’s First Gentleman on animal protection, recycling and composting, voter participation, and LGBTQ rights, and for being an incredible father to our children. I know you’re relieved that we are nearing the end. To my mom and dad, who have been here every step of the way. My sister and brother, who are amazing. To my kids, you should be in school!

To my friend and partner on this long journey, my Lieutenant Governor, Dianne Primavera. Thank you for all you do every single day to serve our state. Your strong moral compass, passion and strength have been an inspiration to our administration and helped us to navigate so many hard issues. Our state is better because of your service.

To my chiefs of staff, Lisa, Rick, Alec, David, thank you for steering the ship with joy, fortitude, and steadfast dedication to our fellow Coloradans.

And to my senior staff, cabinet, and our incredible team across state government who have contributed to my administration, thank you. It is with your expertise and commitment to service that we’ve achieved even bigger and bolder than we could have imagined.

Seven years ago, I stepped up to the plate as your Governor: baseball aficionado, gamer, tech geek, a head mostly full of hair, ever-hopeful Rockies fan, well, hopeful back then.

At the time, I certainly couldn’t have predicted all that we would face as a state and a nation.

There’s all that we planned and worked for to put Colorado ahead of the curve. Shared achievements like:

Delivering on the promise of free kindergarten and preschool, saving families thousands and giving our youngest learners a strong start.

Building out low-cost clean energy for more Coloradans to save money on energy bills, protecting our air and water, and creating good-paying jobs.

Making it easier and more affordable – even free in many cases – to get the skills needed to get a good job.

Breaking down barriers to housing for Coloradans at every budget. Getting rid of the Budget Stabilization Factor and fully funding our schools.

Cutting income taxes three times and property taxes five times while supercharging the earned income and child tax credits. Establishing the Family Affordability Tax Credit, which helped cut child poverty rates by nearly 41%. Today, Colorado boasts the lowest childhood poverty rate in the nation.

Generating more than $470 million each year in new funding for our roads, bridges, and transit – with the vast majority of that funding going to roads and bridges.

There’s the “pinch me” moments, when we seized opportunity and we called our shot to deliver monumental achievements for Colorado.

Becoming the new home of the world-renowned Sundance Film Festival.

Keeping the Broncos in Denver with the revitalization of Burnham Yard.

Standing atop Fishers Peak, Colorado’s 42nd state park.

Bringing the M-L-B All-Star game to Colorado, boosting our economy as the world recovered from the pandemic.

Receiving Colorado’s first COVID vaccine shipment, marking a historic scientific achievement and the return to life lived together.

Celebrating President Biden’s designation of Camp Hale as a national monument, an effort I helped begin more than 15 years ago during my time in Congress. First Pup Gia, who is also here with us today, accompanied me to that signing. The Denver Post front page picture celebrating the new monument featured Gia front and center!

Earning national recognition as the epicenter of quantum computing technology.

And then, there’s the curveballs that come with the job. The unforeseen events that altered and shaped the trajectory of our state forever.

COVID was unlike anything we’d ever faced before. While the world plunged into uncertainty, we came together to support our brave and dedicated doctors, nurses, and frontline workers, and charted a path forward to chart hospital capacity.

At the height of the pandemic, we held three press conferences a week to help explain to Coloradans frankly what we knew – and what we didn’t know, too. Leading with data and science, we shared the most up-to-date information to empower Coloradans to make informed decisions, weigh their risks, and choose how to best protect themselves and their families.

And when Washington told states to figure it out for themselves, we all stepped up for Colorado. We quickly expanded life-saving tests, PPE, and when they were finally available, thanks to President Trump’s Operation Warp Speed, vaccines too. and pushed hard to be one of the first states to safely get our schools and economy back up and running.

With the expertise of our Department of Public Health and Environment Director Dr. Jill Ryan and her team, and my then Chief of Staff Lisa Kaufmann, Colorado led the country in wastewater testing, and made it easier and quicker for Coloradans to get a COVID test. I am proud we had among the quickest vaccine uptakes of any state.

In the middle of it all, we came together to deliver on the promises we made long before the pandemic hit. Democrats, Republicans, and my Administration all worked together to keep Coloradans safe while at the same time, passing free preschool and historic transportation funding. When we work together, we do big things.

And because 2020 was the year that kept on giving, we also faced the three largest wildfires in the history of our state. The next year, we faced the Marshall Fire, the most destructive fire in Colorado history. I want to recognize and thank Department of Public Safety Director Stan Hilkey, Director of the Colorado Division of Fire Prevention & Control Mike Morgan, Director of the Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management Kevin Klein, Chief of the Colorado State Patrol Matt Packard, Colorado National Guard Adjunct General (and now-acting CPW director – thank you for coming out of retirement) Laura Clellan, and the many, many more Coloradans involved for their steady, skilled leadership through Colorado’s most trying times.

We witnessed horrific mass shootings at the STEM School in Highlands Ranch, Club Q in Colorado Springs, King Soopers in Boulder, and most recently at Evergreen High School. We endured a horrific antisemitic attack on Pearl Street Mall in Boulder.

And grief has also struck right here in our State Capitol, with the sudden and tragic passings of our colleagues Senator Faith Winter and Minority Leader Hugh McKean.

To honor their legacy and all we’ve lost, the work continues. As Faith would say, we will “lift as we rise.”

For all of us here, we’re going to bat for Colorado’s future, to leave our great state even better than we found it.

Seven years ago, some thought our bold goals were far-fetched. I’ve got the receipts, I mean headlines, doubting if I’d be able to get it all done.

From 2019: Will Polis Get Full-Day Kindergarten, Or Will Colorado Give Another Flaky Promise? One year later, headlines read: Colorado’s Free, Full-Day Kindergarten Boosted Enrollment By Nearly 25%.

In my first year, the intrepid reporters at the Colorado Sun published a tracker of my campaign promises. 9News even wrote a song about it!

Now, I appreciate their help holding us accountable for our bold goals. Although, I did notice they stopped keeping track because it’s not as exciting when we keep delivering on our promises.

But for me, it’s always been about delivering real results, not headlines. To me, politics is simple: you say what you’re going to do, and then you do it.

We posted a transparent dashboard to share month-by-month updates with Coloradans on our progress delivering wildly important goals – what we call WIGs – for each agency. We are bringing ease and convenience to government services with mobile DMV offerings and the myColorado app, used by nearly 2 million Coloradans.

And when it comes to turning my bold agenda into a better daily life for Coloradans, we haven’t always succeeded on our first try. But we’ve always stepped back up to the plate – because that’s what we do in Colorado.

We are in this work to make life better, more affordable, safer for all Coloradans.

Meanwhile, over the past 12 months, it seems Washington is in it to break it all down. To make life harder and less affordable. To make Americans feel more fearful, more belligerent, more vulnerable.

In the last month alone, the Trump administration has threatened over $1 billion in funding for Colorado, and is making life more expensive and more difficult across our state.

Mean cuts target short-term support for the most basic and essential needs for Colorado families and threaten child care support that Colorado families and child care centers rely on. The President denied two major disaster relief requests for the Lee and Elk fires and devastating flooding in Western Colorado, hurting Coloradans and our recovery efforts, and went on to veto Lauren Boebert, Michael Bennet, and John Hickenlooper’s unanimous, bipartisan bill to finally complete the pipeline providing clean water to rural Colorado, a project first promised under JFK. All while threatening to dismantle NCAR, a global leader in weather and global sciences, and a crown jewel of American scientific achievement.

That’s before you get to the devastating impacts HR 1 had on our state, gutting our state budget by $1 billion overnight, eliminating Coloradans’ TABOR refunds, and slashing Medicaid and SNAP.

All the while, tariff taxes on Coloradans are driving up costs on everything from groceries to medicine. Trump’s tariffs alone are expected to cost Coloradans on average $1,700 for a single year. Tariffs hurt all of us, and make it unaffordable to live.

Since day one, we’ve worked together to save Coloradans money. To strengthen international trade and make our state the best place to start and grow a business.

Four years ago, I stood here and sang about finding 50 ways to save Coloradans money, and we went on to deliver over 100. We’re saving the average Colorado family of four over $600 dollars a year on income and property taxes, and last year Colorado taxpayers saved nearly $2.5 billion.

Just as we came together during the special session to close corporate tax loopholes, I am hopeful that we can come together again to cut the income tax rate.

We are fighting – hard – to protect every federal dollar owed to Colorado. In partnership with Attorney General Weiser, the state has successfully defended nearly $900 million.

But there’s over $1 billion more lost or at risk from illegal Trump administration cuts.

Washington Republicans – once the self-proclaimed party of states’ rights and small government – today are too often the party of socialism, overreach, and intrusion into people’s daily lives in ways wholly out of the scope of government. Picking corporate winners and losers, co-opting capitalism with cronyism. It often feels like Big Government is in our wallets, our doctor’s offices, in our homes, bullying businesses of all sizes.

This is not the Colorado Way.

Driving up costs with tariff taxes is not the Colorado Way.

Ripping away critical food and health access is not the Colorado Way.

Tearing families apart with a costly and cruel immigration agenda is not the Colorado Way.

Today, nearly 75% of people held in immigration detention centers have no criminal history. In America in 2026, a culture of fear and chaos means families debate going to work or sending their kids to school out of fear they won’t come home. The words on the Statue of Liberty beckoning those who come to “breathe free” ring hollow against the cruel realities we are facing today.

This is not who we are. Since day one, I’ve worked to build a Colorado for All.

It’s a mission that reflects our shared commitment to a compassionate, kind Colorado for everyone, and one that I hope and trust will continue well beyond my administration.

In the words of Aurora Smoky Hill High School graduate Bowen Yang, “the only way forward is to be joyous and to celebrate each other.”

At a time when Washington is peddling the illusion that America somehow isn’t for everyone – that somehow there’s only room for some – some people, some beliefs, some love, some prayer – I want to make it clear:

In our Colorado for All, there is room – and opportunity – for all of us.

In our Colorado for All, we welcome immigrants and refugees who seek to build a better life here, who strengthen our economy and enrich our communities under the shelter of our democracy.

In our Colorado for All, an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us.

In our Colorado for All, we safeguard our fundamental freedoms, protecting the right to be who you are, marry who you love, and choose when or if to start a family.

There is space in our great big hexahectaenneacontakaiheptagonal state for all of us. We are a state of adventure seekers chasing mountain peaks and fresh powder, of wide-eyed entrepreneurs, artists, devout Coloradans of faith, poets, vegans, soccer moms and ultimate frisbee dads, hunters and union workers, farmers and ranchers, and yes, immigrants and refugees.

We respect our differences, and we are stronger and better off because of our rich diversity. In our Colorado for All, hope and kindness are part of our DNA.

The legacy of Jane Goodall, who had a special place in her heart for Colorado, lives on, as we take inspiration from her words, “hope does not deny evil, but is a response to it.”

Hateful and divisive rhetoric rarely stops at just words. We are seeing online vitriol spill over into horrific violence, including right here on our doorstep.

Enough is enough.

We refuse to sit idly by as a culture of targeting our fellow human beings festers in this country that we love.

In words and actions, we must reject the politics of division and the poison of blind hatred by doubling down on respect, kindness, compassion, and truly learn to disagree better.

These are the values that also guide our solidarity with those around the world fighting for freedom as we speak, in Iran and Venezuela, and in solidarity with the brave Ukrainian people in their continued fight against Russian aggression.

In my first State of the State address, I shared a story of a conversation Marlon and I had with our kids. Our then-6 year-old wanted to know the difference between the various political parties. And at the end, he went over to his four year old sister and asked, “What political party are you in?” And without missing a beat, she answered, “the Happy Birthday Party.”

Colorado’s kids are wise in ways that we could all use a little more of.

This year, we will celebrate our state’s 150th birthday, and our country’s 250th. Let’s come together and honor these historic milestones, not as Democrats or Republicans, but as the Happy Birthday Party.

Housing

And we head into our special birthday tackling our shared challenges. Coloradans – of all political stripes, in every part of our state – tell us that the high cost of housing makes it harder to live in the Colorado we love.

In “Field of Dreams,” starring Colorado Rancher Kevin Costner, the wind whispers, “if you build it, he will come.” Or, as we say, if you build it, opportunity will come.

For too long, we’ve run up against roadblocks – from outdated laws to piles of paperwork – that slow or stop new housing, new transit, and new clean energy from even being built.

It reminds me of the words of Taylor Swift and, maybe Kevin Bommer too – “I’ll sue you if you step on my lawn.”

Not us – we say, let us build!

We’ve empowered Coloradans with the freedom to build an ADU on their property, and let homeowners – not the government – make decisions about how much parking is needed, thanks to the bipartisan work of Senators Amabile, Hinrichsen, Exum, Mullica, and Representative Weinberg.

The benefits are even greater than we could have imagined, just ask Speaker Pro Tem Boesenecker whose mother-in-law now lives in an ADU in his own backyard!

We’ve unlocked more housing near transit, opened the door to single – or smart – stair homes, and broken down barriers to lower-cost modular housing, tackled by Speaker Pro Tem Boesenecker, and Woodrow, alongside Senators Ball and Bridges.

And at long last, we tackled construction defects liability to build more condos, unlocking the promise of homeownership for more Coloradans thanks to the work of President Coleman and Senator Roberts.

We put our skin in the game: speeding up contracting times through the Department of Local Affairs, with the department now turning around contracts for new housing in 33 days, down from 61 days a year before. Under Maria De Cambra’s leadership in partnership with the Housing Consortium, we launched the innovative housing hub to make it easier to apply for affordable rental housing tax credits.

We stood up the Educator First Housing initiative to help 3,000 teachers buy their first home thanks to the work of Senators Amabile and Frizell and Representative Lukens.

Through Proposition 123, we’ve built over 10,000 new homes across the state, including in rural communities who are building state-supported affordable housing for the first time.

And there’s more to be done.

As Colorado-born Ji-Young Yoo, the voice of the iconic Zoey in KPop Demon Hunters says, “I do have one idea… Actually, 57, but let’s start with my favorite.” I share Zoey’s enthusiasm when I think of the 57 – or maybe even more – ways we can unlock more housing at lower cost.

This year, we want to ensure local governments have the resources they need to build and improve bus and train stations, and to pair these investments with more housing near transit. I want to thank Speaker McCluskie, Representative Woodrow, and Senators Roberts and Exum for taking this on.

The Housing Opportunities Made Easier, or HOME Act, will open the door to more housing by partnering with higher education, nonprofits, transit agencies, school districts, and housing authorities to build on underutilized land. With Speaker Pro Tem Boesenecker, Representative Mabrey and Senators Exum and Gonzales leading the way, these steps are expected to significantly cut down on building times for new housing.

Coloradans are eager to be a part of the housing solution. For example, in Edwards, the Eagle County School District opened up Miller Flats Apartments with 37 homes for district employees conveniently located near schools, parks, and transit.

We’ve given homeowners the freedom to do more with their property. It’s only the start. By making it easier to subdivide and sell your property, we can boost the supply of affordable starter homes and help Coloradans to stay in their homes.

Together, we’ve worked hard to make the senior homestead exemption flexible and portable, help seniors downsize and free up homes for young families. We can and must make good on our promise to seniors by funding the senior homestead exemption this year.

Doing so will require finding $200 million dollars in one time funding this year. Converting Pinnacol is the way to shore up our workers compensation system to better protect workers, ensure Pinnacol can compete and thrive in today and tomorrow’s marketplace, provide some relief with the budget shortfall, and make good on our bipartisan promise to seniors.

Once you have a home you can afford, keeping up with the costs that come with it is the next challenge. That starts with homeowners insurance which costs too much.

This year we must bring homeowners insurance rates down. Costs continue to skyrocket, up 91% or an average of $2,000 since 2019, and Coloradans in wildfire prone areas are having a harder time even finding insurance.

There are tools at our fingertips that can help bring down homeowners insurance rates.

While we might not tackle the entire challenge overnight, it’s long past time we start, with steps like making hail resistant roofs more affordable, and reducing fire risks, we can drive down claims and lower premiums. Thank you Speaker McCluskie, Representative Brown, Senators Amabile and Snyder, for taking on this urgent issue.

The more we do here to bring down costs, the more opportunity opens up for Coloradans in the ways that matter most – where we live, and how we spend our time and money.

Transit

Five months into my time as Governor, an 8.5 million pound boulder fell smack dab in the middle of Highway 145 just outside of Dolores, Colorado, leaving an eight foot trench in the middle of the road.

When I learned that it would cost the state $200,000 more to get rid of the rock than to reroute the highway I found another way.

I’m a rock tumbling enthusiast, much to Marlon’s chagrin – for those who aren’t familiar, check it out! But there was no way to tumble this particular rock. And so, heeding the wise words of the Beatles, we “let it be.”

This is the same common-sense I’ve used to make it easier, safer, and more affordable to get around our state, whether you choose to do so by car, bike, foot, bus, or train.

Today, getting around takes up too much of Coloradans’ budgets and time, and puts out too much pollution. We’re showing that there’s a better way forward for Coloradans, one with more choices and greater convenience.

We’ve re-paved 2,500 miles of roads in the past five years alone. Under the leadership of CDOT director Shoshana Lew, we’ve tackled long-neglected projects including Floyd Hill, to finally get drivers over Floyd Hill safely and quickly, taking away the scary drive that too many of us can relate to going to or from our incredible Rocky Mountains.

When I took office in 2019, there were 18,000 electric vehicles driving around Colorado, our energy office director Will Toor was one of those early adopters! Today, Will no longer feels lonely, with more than 204,000 electric cars on Colorado’s roads. We’re #1 nationally for percentage of electric vehicle sales, and by embracing these clean, quiet, fun to drive cars, we’ve cut emissions by nearly 600,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year.

Folks: we got all of this done because of policy.

Working with Senator Weissman, we want to make it even more affordable to get an electric vehicle by directing savings to lower-cost electric vehicles.

The lion’s share of additional transportation funding we’ve secured has gone to roads and bridges. But we know we can’t just build our way out of the congestion that is robbing too many Coloradans of our free time and money.

That is why we’ve also supercharged state support for transit.

We are blazing a trail on cost-efficient passenger rail, and we’re doing it in record time. With a new lease and access agreement to begin Mountain Passenger Rail service through the Moffat Tunnel, we are turning the promise of daily, year-round service from Denver to Craig into a reality with the first routes from Denver to Granby kicking off about a year from now.

Looking to the Front Range, we are on the precipice of delivering a joint service partnership from Denver to Fort Collins, working closely with CDOT, RTD, and local governments to get Front Range Passenger Rail across the finish line.

I want to thank Lisa Kaufmann for her amazing work on passenger rail, and before that she thought being Chief of Staff was a hard job!

The success of Bustang, Snowstang, Pegasus, and Outrider show that Coloradans have a big appetite for reliable, affordable bus transit options. In the past five years alone, Bustang ridership has increased fivefold to reach nearly 2.3 million riders to date.

Bustang now runs 20 routes, with lower fares and exciting partnerships with iconic Colorado events, like the X Games. And we are pursuing long- term sustainable funding so Bustang can continue to grow, providing even better service to even more Coloradans now and in the future.

We’ve made major progress. But the reality is, until we have a world-class metro area transit agency with RTD, we simply cannot meet our climate or affordability goals. This begins with governance changes, increased accountability and transparency, and a stronger partnership between the cities it serves and the transit agency. I want to thank Senators Ball and Jodeh,

Representative Froelich, and the late Senator Winter along with Maria Garcia Berry and the accountability committee for putting together a thoughtful and effective approach for how we can realize a world-class transit agency.

Now, letting our Broncos leave Denver would have been like getting an invite to Taylor Swift’s ‘s wedding and saying no – Which is to say, not an option, And by the way, Taylor – I’m an excellent officiant, just ask Allie Kimmel.

In all seriousness, the revitalization of Burnham Yard, one of our state’s most historic properties, lays the groundwork for an amazing hub with multimodal transit, shops, restaurants, and entertainment, and of course, the A-F-C-West Champion Denver Broncos. We look forward to beating the Bills this Saturday, and – hopefully – hosting a Super Bowl parade in February.

We are looking at every piece of the puzzle to make it safer and more affordable to get where you need to go. Today, high auto insurance rates – the 5th highest nationally – lead to far too many uninsured drivers, making our roads less safe for all and further driving up rates.

That’s why I launched the Roadmap to Reduce Auto Insurance Premiums, an action plan to improve road safety and lower auto insurance costs.

And by more than doubling the number of wildlife crossings statewide to more than 70, including the world’s largest in Greenland – no, not that Greenland, Greenland, Colorado, leave the other Greenland alone! – we’re reducing wildlife-vehicle collisions by 90%.

We’re putting the days of too much time spent in traffic, too much money to get around, and too much pollution in the rearview mirror, pushing past the way it is to achieve the way it can be.

Education

Twenty-six years ago, I was driving around the state in an old school bus campaigning for the State Board of Education, demanding more investment in Colorado schools to ensure every student could get a high quality education and thrive.

My passion for education is what drew me into public service after starting my career as an entrepreneur, and is what continues to drive my work as Governor.

There are so many ways we can build a bright future for Colorado and almost all of them begin with education. Education is about opportunity and hope.

Colorado students today get a strong start with free preschool and free full day kindergarten, thanks to Representative Sirota and Senator Bridges.

Students head into fully funded schools thanks to our work with the JBC. Indicators of class size are down by one student today from when I first took office – and average teacher pay is up over $13,000 dollars per year.

If you visit a Colorado classroom today, as I did this week in Colorado Springs, you might notice something special about Colorado’s first and third graders. These classes include the first group of Colorado students to go to free preschool and free full day kindergarten.

I’ve met a lot of them in our schools and usually their first question is ‘who are YOU?!,’ sometimes followed by, “I want to be governor when I grow up!”

When I started out as Governor, going to kindergarten for a full day of school, and going to preschool at all was treated like a bonus, not a necessity.

But the data speaks so clearly otherwise.

High-quality early education prevents achievement gaps, and helps with reading, math, and long term success in school, all while saving families $6,300 a year on preschool and $500 a month on full day kindergarten.

Colorado families eagerly raised their hands to sign up for preschool and kindergarten, catapulting Colorado from 27th nationally for preschool enrollment to third under the leadership of Dr. Lisa Roy.

And today, 98% of kindergarteners take advantage of free-full day kindergarten.

We’ve dedicated historic funding to Colorado classrooms, increasing funding per student from just over $8,000 in 2019 to nearly $12,000 today, and finally with the leadership of Speaker McCluskie, Assistant Minority Leader Bacon, and the Joint Budget Committee, tackled the beast – the Budget Stabilization Factor that for more than a decade hamstrung our schools with too little funding.

At the same time, we’ve worked to protect school funding and the services Coloradans rely on from a rainy day or recession. When I took office, the state’s budget reserves were at 7.25% and today, we’re in the double digits with 13% in the bank.

While our reserves took a minor dip after President Trump and Congress torched our budget last year, we’re on track to get our reserves back up to 15% in the coming years.

In Colorado, we’re doing our part to help our talented, hardworking educators do what they do best: shaping the next generation of learners and leaders.

Each of us can remember a teacher, or likely several, who helped us become who we are today. I want to thank all of the teachers here today, and across Colorado, for your incredible contributions to our state now and into the future.

Workforce

A good education gives students a head start right out of the box, and high-quality skills and workforce development help Coloradans cross home plate to a good job.

Last year, Colorado high school students enrolled in a record 146,000 courses through our Community College System, earning college credit before graduating and saving over $71 million in tuition costs.

Today we are joined by Mariah, a Nursing student at CSU Pueblo. Thanks to concurrent enrollment opportunities, Mariah earned two credentials and completed the first three years of her Bachelor’s, while still in high school at Swallows Charter Academy in Pueblo. And today, Mariah is working in an ICU in Colorado Springs while completing her studies. Welcome, Mariah!

Through the bipartisan National Governors Association, my Chair Initiative: Let’s Get Ready: Educating All Americans for Success, kickstarted a long-overdue national conversation about how we better connect the skills students get in school with those that lead to a good job.

Now, we are putting the lessons learned from Let’s Get Ready into practice. Alongside six other states, led by both Democratic and Republican governors, we are tracking student readiness in real-time with a new dashboard to more accurately and quickly evaluate if students are ready for and successful at what comes next.

We’re saving Coloradans money with free and low-cost training opportunities, and making the first two years of college free for many Coloradans, thanks to the bipartisan work of Speaker McCluskie, Representatives Taggart, Senators Kirkmeyer and Mullica.

As one of the largest employers in the state, we’re leading by example by hiring for the right skills instead of the right degree, putting an end to the days where good candidates were turned away just because they don’t have a college degree.

Our workforce investments are bold, innovative, and nation leading. And while there’s a lot to be proud of, it’s not enough.

People change jobs more frequently nowadays.

And yet, our job training system is not working for every Coloradan. It’s a maze of more than 20 divisions, offices, and units across seven state departments. The 110 programs available have different eligibility requirements, applications, and outcome measures. I will now read the names of all 110 workforce programs. There will be a quiz at the end.

But seriously, if even I can’t name them all, how can we expect everyday Coloradans trying to get ahead to figure out how to navigate this maze?

Transformative results require bold action. That is why we are calling for a unified department to serve as a one-stop-shop for Coloradans to access high-quality skills, training, apprenticeships, and education. This bipartisan effort led by Speaker McCluskie, Representative Taggart, and Senators Bridges and Frizell is truly poised to unlock opportunity and prosperity for all Coloradans.

Helping Coloradans get job-ready is another way we are making Colorado the best place to work and do business. Today, we are proudly home to a robust business-friendly ecosystem, ranked the top state for female entrepreneurs three years in a row, and fourth best business environment overall by US News and World Report. With Eve Lieberman at the helm of our Office of Economic Development and International Trade, companies continue to thrive in Colorado. Businesses like Boom Supersonic, a $1.5 billion dollar company that started in a Denver basement and is now building a supersonic passenger jet that could get from Denver to London in just over five hours.

My own career is one that in its earliest days was shaped by the promise of emerging technology – at the time, internet 1.0 – when I launched an internet service provider from my college dorm room. This experience taught me a lot about how technology is a tool that can and must be used to maximize opportunity and innovation.

Along those same lines, AI has tremendous potential – but I assure you, did not write this speech! We must act thoughtfully to embrace innovation while empowering consumers.

Today, we are called upon to ensure Colorado remains a leading state for artificial intelligence for both businesses and consumers. Now is the time to get this done in a way that drives innovation and protects Coloradans.

In my time as Governor, one of the greatest honors has been serving alongside the talented men and women who work for state government. We are so fortunate to have such passionate, dedicated Coloradans working across the state, taking on the most difficult challenges we face, and bringing creativity and a commitment to service to their work every single day.

Today, I am honored to be joined by Fidela Jacquez, one of our longest serving state employees whose nearly 50 years in service to Coloradans across the Departments of Public Safety, Transportation, and Revenue, and mentorship of her fellow state employees, has and will continue to make a huge impact on our state now and into the future.

Our efforts to support Colorado’s hardworking and dedicated state employees is further strengthened by our work with Colorado WINS, led by Hilary Glasgow. Thank you Hilary and your team, including President Diane Byrne here with us today, for your passionate advocacy on behalf of our workforce, and for our partnership throughout my governorship.

Health care

Since day one, I’ve taken on special interests and tackled challenges that critics said could never be solved.

When it comes to health care, I would measure our accomplishments against any state in the nation.

Under the leadership of Lieutenant Governor Dianne Primavera and our Office of Saving People Money on Health Care, we’ve tallied nearly three billion dollars in savings for Coloradans even as national costs went up tens of billions of dollars more.

We partnered with bipartisan legislators including Patrick Neville and Pueblo’s own Daneya Esgar on our nation-leading hospital price transparency law. We passed the landmark Colorado Option and bipartisan reinsurance alongside Speaker McCluskie, Senators Jodeh, Rich, and Roberts. We brought Republicans and Democrats together to put an end to surprise billing. We’ve made six behavioral health care sessions free for Coloradans under 18 with Senator Michaelson Jenet. Thanks to the efforts of Senators Gonzales and Weissman, Representatives Froelich and Zokaie, we built in needed protections to assure Coloradans that if they are in need of emergency care and their doctor recommends an abortion to save their life, they will not be turned away.

With the leadership of Division of Insurance Commissioner Mike Conway, we created a first-in-the-nation group that is finally capping the cost of the most expensive drugs and we know we’re on the right track, because we’ve already been sued twice by big pharma. Years before the federal government, alongside Senator Roberts we capped the price of insulin.

Despite all this – and more – we’re not where we need to be.

High-powered and well-funded corporate interests have proven to be deeply entrenched in our politics. It’s like the Avengers fighting Thanos. We are up against big hospitals, pharma, and insurance, alongside a federal government often eager to cozy up to these special interests.

Colorado’s application to import lower-cost prescription drugs from Canada – thanks to the leadership of Kim Bimestefer and Senator Rodriguez – languishes in Washington, first under President Biden and now under President Trump and RFK Jr.

The reality is, the incentives are simply FUBAR. Americans are getting screwed on health care.

Today, hospitals rake in billions of dollars in profits, and actually get away with charging $5,000 for an ice pack, $600 for a bandaid, while insurance companies and pharma raise prices on consumers. I was perhaps a bit naive to think I’d be able to pull together a coalition to fight back against such absurd charges.

Too often, we fight over incremental progress, and when we stand up for systemic change, we are met with the might of the medical industrial complex and their highly effective scare tactics. I saw this firsthand when I was in Congress working to pass the Affordable Care Act, and I’ve seen it time and time again as Governor.

It’s truly mind-boggling that every other industrialized Western country in the world has figured out a way to provide universal health care at a baseline for everyone. Japan spends less than half of what America spends on health care, and their average lifespan is six years longer.

Let me be clear. Our dedicated doctors, nurses, and providers work around the clock to give Coloradans great care. Our essential safety-net hospitals – especially in rural communities – are filling the gap while fighting tooth and nail to keep their doors open, made all the more difficult with the federal government taking a sledgehammer to Medicaid.

Fixing the broken cycle is not about spending more. We’re already doing that and it ain’t working.

The federal government today makes up about half of health care payers through Medicare and Medicaid – it’s long past time the feds start negotiating with prescription drug companies and hospitals and actually drive down costs.

Instead, premiums are skyrocketing across the country after Congress failed to extend the tax credits that millions of Americans rely on to keep health care affordable. In some ways, it’s one of those $600 bandaids, but has at least prevented major increases in insurance premiums.

In Colorado, we’re doing the best with what we have by maximizing efficiency and refusing to let Medicaid, the payer we do have, fail.

The reality is that health care expenses are rising far faster than the rest of our budget. We must take action to bring Medicaid costs to a more sustainable level and protect access for the 1.2 million Coloradans who rely on Medicaid.

The numbers are stark – I almost brought my charts, but I’ll spare you. Ask a JBC member, we can’t afford to keep growing Medicaid at its current pace while still funding schools, roads, and public safety.

So let’s focus on spending less, covering more people, and getting better health outcomes.

As Babe Ruth famously said, “never let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game.” Let me be clear. We’ve been in the game and we’re giving it our all.

But when it comes to health care, special interests like big hospitals, big pharma, big insurance and Pharmacy Benefit Managers, are the umpires and have way too much influence to call the pitches the way they like.

We will continue fighting for Coloradans, but ultimately, we need Washington to step up and take real action on a real solution. Call it what you will – a social insurance model, multi-payer universal health care, Medicare for All, a single payer system with private insurance and care on top – no matter the jargon, the outcome is what matters: health care for everyone at lower costs.

It’s long past time Washington got on the side of hardworking Americans, and out of the pockets of special interests.

Public safety

Just like our health, our safety is also critical to being able to lead a good life.

When I set the bold goal to make Colorado one of the ten safest states in the nation, we got right to work taking data-driven, common-sense steps to prevent crime in the first place, better equip law enforcement, and crack down on crime.

We’re seeing real progress. A new report from our Division of Criminal Justice shows that In the past year, violent crime is down over 13%. Property crime is down nearly 18%, representing nearly 14,000 fewer crimes. Through targeted investments and increased penalties, we’ve achieved a 61% decrease in auto theft in four years, including a 34% drop in the last year alone. In a single year, we’ve seen a 95% decline in catalytic converter theft in Denver.

Thanks to the support of voters, we are boosting state support for local law enforcement through Proposition 130, which I proudly supported. This year, the first round of $15 million in funding will go to local law enforcement to boost recruitment, retention, and training.

We are endlessly grateful for the service, bravery, and dedication of Colorado’s law enforcement officers, veterans, and service members. I want to thank all those here with us today for serving our state and nation with pride, ensuring our safety and security.

Keeping Coloradans safe includes better preparing for, preventing, and responding to the year-round threat of wildfires. We’ve expanded Colorado’s arsenal of firefighting tools, including state-owned helicopters like the Firehawk and multi-mission aircraft, fire engines, crews, and contracted air tankers, to ensure we can act quickly and decisively whenever and wherever a fire breaks out.

Our National Guard servicemembers have been on the frontlines – on the ground and in the air – in the aftermath of Colorado’s devastating fires and floods. Always at the ready, they flew helicopters to drop water on the Cameron Peak and East Troublesome fires, provided real-time data on fire spread, and helped control traffic out of evacuation zones in the Marshall Fire. These are the missions that matter for our communities. I want to recognize the bravery and commitment to service that exemplify our Colorado National Guard, and show our respect for their commitment to helping Coloradans through our hardest moments.

Looking ahead, there is more work to be done to ensure all Coloradans can thrive in safe communities.

While the Trump administration leaves states in the lurch, cancelling $29 million and threatening $19 million more in safety grants owed to Colorado, we are stepping up to do what we can to fill the gap, refusing to leave our safety to chance.

My balanced budget proposal includes support to monitor and protect Coloradans against rising threats of political violence and extremism, along with support for emergency preparedness, response, and recovery to ensure we are prepared to act quickly if disaster strikes. Once again, this is work that we would normally have federal partnership on, but Washington is threatening exactly this funding.

Keeping Coloradans safe includes protecting the spaces we gather, learn, and pray. Today, over 73 non-profits including synagogues, mosques, and churches have made security upgrades with support from the Nonprofit Security grants. Our students deserve to learn free from fear. Our Office of School Safety has supported 239 projects to boost safety and emergency response at 190 schools and districts across Colorado.

Together, under the leadership of Senator Sullivan and so many others – too many to name here – we’ve taken common-sense steps to reduce gun violence while protecting our second amendment rights. The nation-leading red flag law has been enforced over 478 times to protect Coloradans and our communities. Waiting periods, safe and responsible gun storage requirements, and cracking down on ghost guns, help keep all Coloradans safe. Colorado is proud to support responsible gun ownership, including with expanded background checks and making the theft of any firearm a felony. We are protecting the rights of Coloradans to own the gun of their choice while implementing new training for rapid fire and assault-style weapons through Colorado Parks and Wildlife later this year. By cracking down on gun trafficking and illegal firearm activity, we’ve gotten 183 illegal guns off the streets.

To truly keep Colorado safe, we must urgently address gaps in our system related to those who cannot stand trial but are charged with a crime, and ensure that individuals who pose a danger to themselves or others are not just released onto the streets. My supplemental budget request includes funding for the state to work alongside local governments and the judicial branch to pursue appropriate, secure placements and services, and I am asking the legislature to move quickly to get bipartisan legislation to my desk. Thank you to Speaker McCluskie, Minority Leader Caldwell, Senator Amabile, and Minority Leader Simpson for leading bipartisan action.

Environment, clean air

Delivering real results for Coloradans is as much about our values as it is about making life easier and more affordable.

We are showing that it’s possible to cut pollution, lower costs, and spur innovation, following the demands of the market.

By cutting pollution, we are cleaning up our air in ways we can see and feel, helping to reduce bad air quality days, which are down from 65 days in 2021 to 30 days in 2025. My dad in particular appreciates that.

During my time as Governor, the share of energy Colorado gets from low-cost clean sources has grown by nearly 75%, enough power nearly 3 million homes for a year.

I am excited about bright spots like Holy Cross Energy serving Eagle, Pitkin, Garfield, Mesa, and Gunnison Counties. At its peak last spring, Holy Cross generated 96% of its energy from low-cost clean sources.

Meanwhile, Washington DC, is tipping the scales toward expensive, out-of-date coal production that drives up costs, pollutes our air, and subjects all of us to volatile price swings in natural gas. We saw this after the Texas winter storm which drove up energy bills for many Coloradans by nearly $20 a month for years.

In Colorado, we tackle climate challenges head on, instead of burying our heads in a pile of coal. I would say snow, but sadly snowpack this year is only 62% of average.

We’re charging forward on the plan to 100% clean energy to unlock the lowest cost clean energy for Coloradans. By 2030, more than 70% of Colorado’s electricity will come from wind and solar. But we need emerging technologies like geothermal or carbon capture to get us to 100%.

That is why we are taking action alongside Representatives Willford, Senators Weissman and Amabile to maintain the important goal of 100% clean energy while building in needed flexibility to adapt to the realities of federal headwinds.

Now is the time to double down on investment and innovation to build more of what’s needed to power our homes and businesses, including power lines and power plants.

Local governments play a key role in moving energy and transmission projects along, but there is room to grow to ensure permitting across the state is clear, fast, and consistent.

Long before my time as Governor, the oil and gas wars plagued our state. Colorado’s patchwork regulatory environment had few if any meaningful standards.

At best, Coloradans had to worry if oil and gas would be able to drill in their backyard and literally in their living rooms. For far too many Coloradans, this worry became a reality. Even today, the devastating Enterprise Pipeline gasoline spill still impacts Southern Ute Indian Tribe land, showing us the importance of safety.

In my first year as Governor, we passed the most robust regulatory framework for oil and gas in the country, moving drilling operations further from homes and schools. We drilled down to ensure that energy oversight is held to the highest standards, under the cutting-edge Energy and Carbon Management Commission, further supporting innovation in underground geothermal and carbon capture.

I want to thank ECMC Commissioner Jeff Robbins for being with us since day one, dedicating his passion, vision, and expertise to this incredible generationally-important work.

I also want to thank Erin Martinez who bravely shared her story after her home exploded from an undetected gas leak from drilling operations, tragically killing her husband and brother, and all those who paved the way to a safer future for Colorado.

The apocalyptic warnings that our gold-standard regulations would somehow shut down the oil and gas industry in Colorado have proven to be completely unfounded. Today, we have a thriving, robust industry that is electrifying and getting cleaner while adding more protections for health and safety, and is accountable to Coloradans.

We went on to bring responsible oil and gas companies and the environmental community together, preventing costly, divisive ballot measures and creating a new funding stream that moves our state from 42nd in transit funding to 23rd. This work was led by the late Senator Faith Winter, alongside Speaker McCluskie, Representatives Velasco, Willford, Froelich, Bacon and Senator Cutter.

Time and time again, we’ve worked together to tackle the complex challenges we face and chart a sustainable, affordable path forward for Colorado.

From securing our water future, to protecting our wildlife and conserving our public lands, we are taking these lessons with us to prepare for and build resilience to a hotter, drier climate.

Under the leadership of Dan Gibbs with the Department of Natural Resources, we are implementing the visionary Colorado Water Plan and directing over $127 million in new funding to support local water projects. We are seeing record interest in Water Plan Grants, which so far have supported 530 local projects.

Agriculture is on the front lines of drought, and we are helping the next generation of producers get the tools and training needed to adapt to a changing climate. From Water Plan Grants to the transformative work led by Ag Commissioner Kate Greenberg, who just gave birth to her first child earlier this week, we are helping farmers and ranchers to prepare for and build resilience in the face of a hotter, dryer climate.

Looking to the Colorado River, under the leadership of Commissioner Becky Mitchell, we are working to find consensus while protecting the water for Upper Basin states. There is no state better positioned to lead the way to a sustainable future for our namesake river.

In light of the pine beetle outbreak spreading in the Front Range and foothills, we are stepping up to mitigate the most harmful impacts and protect our communities, forests, and key water sources.

We are also stepping up to support our pollinators, the workhorses of our ecosystems who are responsible for one in three bites of food we eat. Together, we are building on our work to protect pollinators from threats faced from some pesticides, including with bills this year led by Senators Kipp and Wallace.

Our treasured public lands are part of the fabric of who we are in Colorado, full of fun and adventure, home to incredible wildlife, and key to our economy.

Elevating enjoyment and care of our great outdoors go hand in hand. We’ve expanded our state parks and wildlife areas by over 90,000 acres, advanced conservation for 270,000 federal acres like the Thompson Divide, and opened up access to over 1 million acres of state trust lands.

We’ve created more than $120 million in new annual funding for the care and conservation of our public lands, including with the Keep Colorado Wild pass that cut the price of a state parks pass by more than half to $29, and growing lottery funding for Colorado’s outdoors. The first-of-its-kind outdoors strategy sets the vision to best care for our great outdoors while putting every dollar to the best possible use.

The moving words of America the Beautiful have connected generations to Colorado’s “Purple Mountains Majesty,” inspired by the beauty of Pikes Peak, where I was earlier this week, we are ensuring that America’s Mountain remains as central to Colorado’s future as it has been to our nation’s past. Through Colorado Parks and Wildlife’s partnerships with Mayor Yemi, Colorado Springs Utilities, the US Forest Service, Great Outdoors Colorado, county and local leaders in the Outdoor Pikes Peak Initiative, and the Pikes Peak Outdoor Recreation Alliance, we are expanding opportunities – including new campgrounds, new trails, even better facilities maintenance – for Coloradans to enjoy and protect this hallowed place for generations to come.

As we look ahead to our state’s 150th birthday, what better way to honor Colorado’s proud history and build toward a bright future than by elevating the care and conservation of our most iconic wild spaces.

Look ahead

Our state’s milestone year is also a milestone for many of us who are embarking on our last year in this building.

I’ve truly enjoyed working with everyone here in this chamber, and those who came before. I want to recognize all of the legislators whose terms have matched up with mine – the class of 2026.

And I encourage all of you to take this year to lead on issues you know I will agree with you on perhaps more than the next governor, whether it’s school choice, eliminating puppy mills, technology innovation, supporting blockchain and crypto, or reducing the income tax, now’s your chance.

And on issues you know I disagree with you on, let’s work together to find agreement. Much to my staff’s chagrin, this year I demanded a special veto pen, after poor Jeff Bridges couldn’t even get a regular one from David when I vetoed his bill.

Conclusion

In the Lord of the Rings, Sam speaks to Frodo, saying “there’s some good in this world, Mr. Frodo, and it’s worth fighting for.”

Colorado, there’s so much good, and we keep fighting for more.

There’s good we’ve achieved – more homes for every budget, more ways to get around easier without sitting in traffic, and more opportunities for students at every stage – and the good that we know is still possible, what we continue to fight for.

When I ran to serve as your Governor I promised to be bold – heck, I made a lot of promises, that together, we’ve turned into a reality for Colorado.

Free preschool. Free full day kindergarten. More housing. Less pollution. We dream. We dare. We do.

I’ve been called many things – Colorado’s education governor, marijuana governor, tech bro governor, gay governor, socialist, fascist, communist, capitalist, libertarian. I’ll keep putting in the work and let others decide the labels, but at the end of the day, it’s always been about delivering real results that leave our state better than we found it. And it’s also about showing loving kindness for everyone and everything. I leave you with the advice to be kind and love your fellow human.

Through it all, what will always stick with me are the special moments during my time as Governor – visiting all 64 counties, picking and eating a fresh peach in Palisade, warm from the Colorado sun, the breathtaking view from atop the mesa at Fort Lewis College. Attending church on All Saints Day in Otero County trying with limited success to descend into the only active volcano in Colorado in Dotsero on a wire tied to a tree, taking our kids to see Tarantulas crawl near La Junta, picking Pueblo chiles, surprising seniors for lunch at the San Luis Senior Center. White knuckling it on the drive to the top of Pikes Peak.

Fulfilling a life goal by “playing” Red Rocks with Colorado South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker. And, of course, getting married at the Mary Rippon Theater at the University of Colorado Boulder, Marlon’s alma mater.

Speaking at the preschool graduation ceremony for the first class of universal free preschool. Reading to the first class of full-day kindergarteners.

And of course the people. My cabinet, including those who have been here since the beginning, many of whom I’ve already mentioned, along with Joe Barela, Michelle Barnes, Patty Salazar, and Tony Gheradini. Our incredible executive team, Danielle, Kara, Allie, Mark, Conor, Jesse, our entire staff, and their families who have also dedicated so much.

Our spectacular Colorado is matched only by the heart and ingenuity of those who call our great state home.

Seven years ago, I joined you all in delivering my first State of the State address, and shared what an honor it is to be your Governor.

In the time since, forces beyond us have shaped our reality – a once in a century pandemic, widespread inflation, the biggest and most destructive fires in our state’s history, an unpredictable federal landscape, a massive wormhole connecting to the Abyss with an upside down version of Colorado and our only hope is a group of Dungeons & Dragons – playing teens…. Well, maybe not that.

But despite it all, we faced our challenges head on, never losing sight of our values and what makes us who we are. We stared down the abyss, destroyed our metaphorical Vecnas, and delivered big, bold progress for Colorado while rolling a natural 20 on landing Sundance, the All-Star Game, and the quantum accelerator.

In this time of great division, now more than ever we must come together as Coloradans, leading with kindness and respect to move our ONE team, our great state, forward.

The state of our state is strong. Resilient. Loving. Kind. Innovative. Free. And ever bright with the promise of a Colorado for All. So long, and thanks for all the fish.

G-d bless you all, G-d bless Colorado, and G-d bless the United States of America!",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-80/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tdp-l-stateofstate011526-cha-556-1024x6831768510050.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=z36V1ywd,N,,2026-01-16 00:59:31.047183

(KTAL/KMSS) – This year begins a new election year with Louisiana voters deciding who will represent the state in the U.S. Senate. Senator Bill Cassidy is up for re-election and faces challenger Louisiana State Treasurer John Fleming.

Fleming was making stops in Shreveport on Wednesday to speak about his platform. He is opposing the growing technology of carbon capture and carbon sequestration. He said taxpayers are having to support alternative energy sources that are not competitive with traditional energy sources and do not provide grid stability.

He said carbon capture poses eminent domain conflicts between landowners and domestic or foreign companies that can take land for use without properly compensating its owners.

“If elected to the U.S. Senate, the first bill I will submit will be to fully defund and repeal the 45Q tax credits that pay for this. There’s no market for this. People don’t buy this technology. This is purely crony capitalism, where you have the government paying wealthy companies that are going to make a lot of money out of this, and the average landowner is going to suffer from it. So I’ve committed that I will submit the bill that will defund it so that money will no longer be available, and it will stop all these projects,” Fleming said.

The Louisiana legislature approved the state’s use of carbon capture technology in 2020. Governor Jeff Landry signed a moratorium on new projects in October following residents’ concerns.

Here are some key approaches and companies that are making strides in addressing these challenges:

Off-Grid Microgrids and On-Site Generation

One of the most innovative solutions is the development of off-grid microgrids, which can provide independent power to high-demand facilities like data centers.

Vineland Data Center Example: This project is speculated to be a large-scale, fully off-grid power solution using medium-speed natural gas engines paired with kinetic energy storage. ""Evidence points to the 'systemic innovation' teased for months at the Vineland, New Jersey data center being a large-scale, fully off-grid power solution...""

Kinetic Energy Storage: Flywheel-based dynamic stabilization is used to absorb rapid load swings and AI inference spikes, allowing the system to ramp quickly without grid support. ""The proposed configuration appears to rely on medium-speed, ship-class natural gas engines paired with kinetic energy storage rather than traditional chemical batteries.""

Advanced Nuclear Power

Nuclear energy, particularly small modular reactors (SMRs), is seen as a scalable and reliable carbon-free power source.

SMRs: These reactors use different technology that is dramatically safer than legacy reactors. ""Today’s small modular reactors use completely different technology which is dramatically safer than legacy reactors.""

Companies Involved: Companies like SMR, OKLO, and NNE are entering the race to develop and deploy SMRs. ""Lots of companies have entered this race like SMR, OKLO and NNE or use the ETF URA.""

Fuel Cells and Backup Power

Fuel cells offer a flexible solution for power generation, especially during peak demand periods.

Bloom Energy (BE): Provides backup power generation solutions to utility companies using fuel cells. ""Bloom Energy BE provides back up power generation solutions to utility companies using fuel cells to generate power during peak usage periods.""

Grid Infrastructure Upgrades

Investing in the existing grid infrastructure is crucial to handle increased demand and integrate new energy sources.

Quanta Services (PWR): Deeply involved in upgrading and maintaining grid infrastructure, especially for AI data centers and EVs. ""Quanta Services (PWR) is a strong pick deeply involved in upgrading and maintaining grid infrastructure, especially as demand surges from AI data centers and EVs.""

Siemens Energy and GE Vernova: These companies are also benefiting from increased power and grid demand by providing essential components and services. ""Siemens Energy and GE Vernova.""

Energy Data Analysis for Efficiency

Utilizing data to understand and optimize energy consumption can lead to significant efficiencies in urban settings.

NYC Energy Benchmarking: Large buildings in NYC are required to report annual energy benchmarking data, which can be used to detect ""phantom vacancy"" and potential financial distress. ""NYC requires large buildings to report annual energy benchmarking data (Local Law 84).""

Renewable Energy Adoption

While not always innovative in themselves, the scale and speed of renewable energy deployment are notable.

Solar Farms: Countries like China and India are building the largest solar farms in the world. ""China and India are in fact a higher % energy from renewables than even the USA, and have built the largest solar farms in the world.""

High Renewable Percentages: Some countries, like Costa Rica, are producing almost all their energy from renewable sources. ""98% of Costa Rica’s energy production comes from renewable, 'green', sources.""

While debate continues over whether these efforts are lawful, President Trump has sent a clear signal that the United States will have no part in multilateral debates about climate change.","Washington, D.C., January 15, 2026 - President Donald Trump’s recent withdrawal from the foundational United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and 64 other organizations—many of them affiliated with the United Nations—represents a sharp divergence from past Republican presidential administrations that sought to lead international environmental efforts and establish a comprehensive U.S. climate policy, according to declassified U.S. government documents posted today by the National Security Archive.

The UNFCCC, adopted on May 9, 1992, during the final year of President George H. W. Bush’s presidential term, is the overarching, bedrock climate treaty that initially brought together 195 countries to discuss the climate crisis. In the decades since its adoption, the treaty has provided a legal framework and bureaucratic infrastructure that has allowed nations to negotiate measures to address rising global temperatures, such as the annual Conference of Parties meetings. President Trump’s decision to sever ties with the UNFCCC is the administration’s latest attempt to roll back global climate efforts, an action critics say will further isolate the U.S. on the world stage.[1]

In the wake of the current administration’s withdrawal from the landmark treaty, the National Security Archive highlights four key documents about the establishment of the UNFCCC from the period when Bush was vice president under Ronald Reagan and during his own presidential term that ended in 1993. These records shed light on how Bush—in part at the urging of his advisors—sought to position himself as a leader on global environmental issues, even if his policies did not always satisfy the demands of environmental advocates.

While it is true that Republican presidents have often downplayed climate concerns, declassified records show that senior advisors to President George H. W. Bush (as was the case under Presidents Reagan and Nixon) early on recommended that the U.S. try to sever the “link between economic development and deterioration of the environment,” according to a State Department memorandum that laid out the proposed U.S. position for the July 1989 Paris economic summit. U.S. policy should advocate for “wise, active stewardship over the resources of our planet” and recognize that this was a “responsibility we have to ourselves and as our legacy to future generations.” (Document 1)

President George H. W. Bush’s early action on climate and his administration’s role in ushering in the UNFCCC and IPCC laid the groundwork for President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore to help lead global efforts resulting in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which established legally binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions, and shaped U.S. policies under President Obama that led to the 2015 Paris Climate Accords. Indeed, the Reagan and Bush 41 administrations represented the high-water mark of Republican support for multilateral efforts to address climate change, primarily through support for the Montreal Protocol to protect the ozone layer and establishment of the UNFCCC and the IPCC, the scientific advisory body.

The Bush administration’s approach to the proposed climate change negotiations, like Reagan’s, sought to integrate and balance scientific research with assessments of the potential economic impacts of both climate change and steps to reduce greenhouse emissions. In fact, the Bush administration saw the 1987 Montreal agreement, signed under Reagan, as a model for efforts under the aegis of the UN Environmental Program (UNEP) to draft a UN framework convention on climate change that would guide negotiations on a treaty. However, President Bush and his advisors also had doubts about aspects of the scientific consensus on the topic.

William A. Nitze, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Environment, Health and Natural Resources, presented the U.S. position on global climate change at the initial UNEP session in March 1988 and said the U.S. would continue to take a leadership role. (Document 2) But Nitze, who was a key State Department official under both Reagan and Bush, said that more needed to be learned about the global and regional impacts of climate change and the full range of possible responses before the U.S. would consider a global convention on climate change.

To this end, the U.S. strongly supported creation of an intergovernmental panel to conduct and assess scientific research into the extent and effects of global climate change and the development of a range of possible response strategies. This would later evolve into the IPCC. However, U.S. support came with an important caveat: “Whatever response strategies are finally adopted will have to take into account other social and economic goals.”

The Bush 41 administration continued to push for this approach in the UN discussions surrounding what would become the UNFCCC, which was agreed on at the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, and Nitze stayed closely involved. A memorandum he prepared in August 1989 laid out the general principles that should guide a climate agreement. These included securing the widest possible participation (with a focus on the countries that made up a significant majority of the world’s population and those that produced the highest percentage of greenhouse gases); increasing understanding of the scientific aspects of global climate change; and protecting social, environmental and economic well-being from damaging impacts likely to result from climate change. (Document 3)

While the U.S. continued to emphasize the importance of scientific research and analysis, its positions in the UN discussions continued to reflect a desire to balance environmental protection and economic growth. This dynamic is evident in a memorandum setting out the policy guidelines for U.S. participants in a UN Response Strategies Working Group in September 1989 (Document 4). The memo describes what would become repeated components of U.S. policy preferences, emphasizing the use of market mechanisms in combination with regulations to reduce greenhouse emissions and giving countries the widest possible flexibility in meeting any agreed emission cuts. By the end of Bush’s term, there were signs that the administration’s progress on environmental efforts was stalled by perceived “uncertainty” about the science of climate change.[2]

Nonetheless, the U.S. Senate ratified the UNFCCC in 1992 as a formal treaty by a vote of 92 to 0, and it was signed into law by President Bush. With the election of Bill Clinton later that year, U.S. climate change diplomacy moved to a new stage culminating in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Ultimately, the administration did not submit the agreement to Congress for ratification, and the next administration, under President George W. Bush, withdrew from Kyoto and promoted a more aggressive energy policy led by Vice President Dick Cheney that deemphasized environmental concerns. The U.S. would continue to promote these views at meetings of the UNFCCC during the majority of George W. Bush’s two terms in office and withheld funds for any Kyoto Protocol-related costs. However, Bush did, in fact, demonstrate signs of reengagement with international climate policy in the last two years of his presidency, as seen with his establishment of the Major Economies Process on Energy Security and Climate Change, though it was widely criticized for weakening multilateral environmental negotiating efforts.[3]

President Obama would go on to reclaim a strong U.S. leadership role in the climate sphere, and his second term would culminate in the landmark Paris Climate Agreement. While President Trump, in his first term, ushered in a radical policy of climate change opposition and denial, his decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in 2017 did not stop the subsequent Biden administration from rejoining the agreement and advancing an ambitious climate agenda at home and abroad.

Now, in President Trump’s second presidential term, the United States has become the first nation ever to attempt to withdraw from the landmark UNFCCC treaty. While debate continues over whether these efforts are lawful, President Trump has sent a clear signal that the United States will have no part in multilateral debates about climate change.[4]",https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/sites/default/files/2026-01/banner_second_earth_summit_was_held_in_rio_de_janeiro.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 16:00:30.482349

Textron raised concerns about the North Carolina Court of Appeals’ latest ruling in the legal dispute.
Based in Rhode Island, Textron objects to being sued in a North Carolina court over a 2024 incident that took place in Arkansas.
PDII sued Sky Aircraft Maintenance and its employee, Steve Trent, in North Carolina state court.
Textron “has no physical presence in the state: it has no offices, facilities, bank accounts, or employees here,” according to the state Supreme Court filing.","The US Chamber of Commerce and NC Chamber are asking the state Supreme Court to overturn a lower court ruling that could open the door for more lawsuits against businesses in North Carolina.

A defendant in the case has warned that a December ruling “fundamentally transforms” rules surrounding which companies can be sued in this state’s courts.

Now the US Chamber, NC Chamber, and the General Aviation Manufacturers Association have filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case called PDII v. Sky Aircraft Maintenance. The US Chamber describes itself as the “world’s largest business federation,” representing 300,000 members and “the interests of more than 3 million companies and professional organizations of every size.” The NC Chamber is the state’s “leading business advocacy organization,” according to its court filing.

“The opinion below upset decades of jurisdictional certainty,” the business groups’ lawyers wrote in the brief filed Wednesday. “It will likely increase costs for companies and consumers across the nation while jeopardizing North Carolina’s reputation for promoting business and maintaining a stable legal climate.”

“Other potential effects include unduly burdening our courts, damaging commerce in the state, and reducing state revenue from business registration and investment,” the groups warned.

The North Carolina Supreme Court issued a Jan. 9 order without comment granting a temporary stay in the case.

One defendant, Textron, had requested the stay two days earlier. Textron raised concerns about the North Carolina Court of Appeals’ latest ruling in the legal dispute.

Based in Rhode Island, Textron objects to being sued in a North Carolina court over a 2024 incident that took place in Arkansas. An aircraft runway accident injured two people and rendered the plane a “total loss.”

Textron is registered to do business in this state but “does not actually conduct business in North Carolina,” according to a court filing.

The company filed a motion to have the North Carolina lawsuit dismissed. A trial judge rejected that motion. A unanimous three-judge Appeals Court panel upheld the trial judge’s ruling on Dec. 3.

“The Court of Appeals’ decision fundamentally transforms North Carolina’s law of personal jurisdiction,” Textron’s lawyers wrote. “For the first time, any corporation registered to do business in this state may be sued here by any plaintiff, on any claim, arising anywhere in the world. A Virginia resident injured in Texas can sue in North Carolina. A California business dispute can be litigated in Wake County. The only prerequisite is that the defendant, perhaps decades ago, filed the routine paperwork required to lawfully conduct business here.”

“This is not an incremental development; it’s a sea change,” the court filing continued. “For decades, personal jurisdiction doctrine has asked whether a defendant’s contacts with the forum state justify requiring it to defend a lawsuit there. General jurisdiction — the power to hear any claim against a defendant — has been reserved for forums where a corporation is ‘at home’: its state of incorporation and principal place of business.”

“North Carolina has never been home to Textron, a Delaware corporation headquartered in Rhode Island, and conducting no business in North Carolina,” the company’s lawyers wrote. “Before the decision below, Textron could not have been sued here on claims arising from events in Arkansas, involving an aircraft that Textron did not manufacture.”

Textron accused the state Appeals Court of adopting a “consent-by-registration” theory of jurisdiction. “Under this theory, when a foreign corporation registers to do business in North Carolina, it consents to be sued here on any claim whatsoever,” according to the court filing. “Registration, a ministerial act, becomes a blanket waiver of constitutional protections.”

The US Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Company dealt with similar issues. But that case dealt with Pennsylvania’s “unique statutory scheme, which expressly provides that registration constitutes consent to ‘general personal jurisdiction,’” according to Textron’s filing. “No other state has such a statute, including North Carolina.”

“The Court of Appeals extended Mallory to North Carolina — even while acknowledging that North Carolina’s statutes contain no express consent language,” the court filing added. “This places North Carolina among a tiny handful of jurisdictions to embrace consent-by-registration, at odds with the overwhelming weight of authority from other states.”

“The stakes could hardly be higher,” Textron’s lawyers argued. “The decision affects every foreign corporation and limited liability company registered in North Carolina — thousands of businesses that registered in reliance on settled jurisdictional expectations. It exposes them to litigation with no connection to this state, brought by plaintiffs from anywhere in the country, over conduct occurring entirely elsewhere.”

“It transforms North Carolina into a magnet for forum-shopping and burdens its courts with disputes that have nothing to do with this state or its citizens,” the court filing continued. “And by deterring businesses from registering here — or encouraging them to withdraw — it threatens North Carolina’s economic competitiveness with neighboring states that have rejected this theory.”

North Carolina-based PDII owned the jet involved in the 2024 Arkansas accident. As the pilot attempted to take off, controls were unresponsive. Aborting the takeoff, the plane ran out of runway and ended up running off the runway. During the incident, “one or more elevator cables in the Airplane’s tail snapped during takeoff,” according to the Appeals Court opinion.

PDII sued Sky Aircraft Maintenance and its employee, Steve Trent, in North Carolina state court. The suit also targeted Textron and a separate Kansas-based company, Textron Aviation. “Textron and Textron Aviation do not share employees, offices, accounts, or business operations,” Textron’s lawyers wrote.

Textron “has no physical presence in the state: it has no offices, facilities, bank accounts, or employees here,” according to the state Supreme Court filing. “Unlike Textron Aviation, Textron doesn’t make or sell aircraft or components, so it did not make or sell the component that PDII complains about.”

“Textron doesn’t market aircraft products or services in the state or to its residents,” the filing continued. “Textron doesn’t have any contracts requiring performance in North Carolina. Textron didn’t have any interactions with Sky Aircraft or Trent, the other defendants. Nor does Textron have continuing or systemic contacts with the state.”

The Appeals Court rejected Textron’s arguments.

“North Carolina’s Long Arm Statute provides that state courts will have personal jurisdiction ‘[i]n any action, whether the claim arises within or without this State, in which a claim is asserted against a party who when service of process is made upon such party … [i]s a domestic corporation,’” Judge Julee Flood wrote last month. “Thus, because N.C.G.S. § 55-15-05(b) states that a registered foreign corporation ‘has the same but no greater rights and has the same but no greater privileges as, and is subject to the same duties, restrictions, penalties, and liabilities now or later imposed on, a domestic corporation of like character[,]’ we conclude a registered foreign corporation may sue or be sued to the same extent as a domestic corporation and is subject to personal jurisdiction.”

“[W]e hold a foreign corporation that obtains a certificate of authority consents to general personal jurisdiction in North Carolina; therefore, we affirm the trial court’s order denying Defendant’s motion to dismiss,” Flood explained.",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/gavel-8436504_1280.jpeg,N,,2026-01-15 19:59:48.295706

The project suspension comes as the company has faced rising project costs and market fears of a looming global oversupply of LNG, but it said it ""remains open to discussions with third parties that may have an interest in developing the project."" Media reports speculated that at least two buyers, including MidOcean Energy LLC, are interested.

The project’s EPC contract was awarded in 2024 to a joint venture of KBR and Technip Energies to convert the existing smaller site gas import facility into an LNG export site, with three new liquefaction trains and an annual capacity of 16.5 million metric tons. The Lake Charles site was set to supply oil giant Chevron with about 3 million tons per year, Energy Transfer said previously.

Energy Transfer also announced last month that it is increasing capacity of the planned Desert Southwest expansion of its Transwestern pipeline from the Texas Permian region across New Mexico into Arizona. The company said the pipeline diameter will expand to 48 in. from 42 in., boosting capacity to 2.3 billion cu ft per day and the project investment to $5.6 billion. The firm cited additional customer demand, particularly driven by population and data center growth, as well as the replacement of coal-fired power plants with natural gas facilities. The pipeline is set to operate by the end of 2029.

Other Southwest pipeline projects include Kinder Morgan's $455-million Gulf Coast Expansion Project, which will increase Permian Basin gas to south Texas markets by 570 million cu ft per day and is set to be completed by mid-year. In the Midwest, TC Energy Corp. has approved the $900-million Northwoods expansion of its ANR line, which it said will add 400,000 cu ft per day of new capacity in Illinois and Wisconsin to support data centers, including 69 miles of new 36-in. and 42-in. line, with service expected by late 2029.

Alaska LNG Marks Milestone

Meanwhile the Alaska LNG project cleared its final updated federal permits in December 2025 in an estimated $45-billion bid led by developer Glenfarne and with the state-owned Alaska Gasline Development Corp. owning 25%, to build a Prudhoe Bay gas treatment plant and carbon sequestration facility and 800-mile gas pipeline from the North Slope to an enlarged LNG export facility south of Anchorage that can produce up to 3.5 billion cu ft per day for export and domestic use.

The project gained its expedited federal Fast-41 permits last month, Alaska LNG said, with the Trump administration's push to accelerate domestic fossil-fuel projects, but timing for a Final Investment Decision and construction start remains unclear. The developer noted preliminary interest from Asian buyers and said it signed a non-binding letter of intent this month with developers of a proposed gold mine in southwest Alaska for long-term energy supply.

The U.S. EPA has proposed a revision to Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, a move that could significantly reshape how states exercise authority over infrastructure projects that may affect water quality.

Section 401 gives states and tribes the power to confirm or deny whether an infrastructure project will comply with applicable water quality standards before any licensing or permits can be issued.

The proposed rule would revise both the timing and scope of Section 401 water quality certifications. It reinforces a maximum one-year deadline for states and authorized tribes to act on a certification request, and eliminates the practice of withdrawing and resubmitting requests to extend review timelines. The proposal also narrows the definition of “water quality requirements” to specific provisions of the Clean Water Act, such as effluent limits, water quality standards, and toxic pollutant controls.

The rule’s intent is to return Section 401 “to its clear statutory boundaries,” said Administrator Lee Zeldin.

While the EPA and many other industry groups maintain that the proposal will reduce permitting delays and help critical infrastructure projects move forward more predictably, some environmental organizations and state officials strongly oppose the rule.

“This latest proposal would strip states and Tribes of their right to protect their waterways from health harming pollution,” the League of Conservation Voters wrote. “It will make our waters dirtier and our families sicker at a time when healthcare costs are already going up for millions.”

In contrast, many manufacturing groups celebrate the proposal. “Too often, the vaguely worded Section 401 has been used as an excuse to block critical infrastructure and trade projects,” said Jay Timmons, president of the National Association of Manufacturers.",https://vertassets.blob.core.windows.net/image/8592147e/8592147e-f7e8-4c55-a4cb-0acefb0f8bab/usa_topographic_map_gettyimages_173169385.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 17:59:57.309127

Massachusetts and resulting GHG emissions limits promulgated by EPA marked a major shift in the legal landscape targeting GHG emissions.
[12] EPA’s primary justification for rescinding the Endangerment Finding and repealing GHG regulations is that such actions exceed EPA’s authority under the CAA.
Furthermore, once finalized, the Endangerment Finding rescission will face its own formidable legal challenges.
[1] Proposed Rule: Reconsideration of 2009 Endangerment Finding and Greenhouse Gas Vehicle Standards | US EPA.","On July 29, 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed rescinding its 2009 Greenhouse Gas Endangerment Finding (Endangerment Finding).[1] Issued by EPA in response to the Supreme Court’s 2007 holding in Massachusetts v. EPA (Massachusetts) affirming EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions under the Clean Air Act (CAA),[2] the Endangerment Finding supported a wide variety of regulatory programs intended to reduce GHGs from automobiles, power plants, and oil and gas production.[3] In light of this federal regulation, the Supreme Court determined in a 2011 landmark decision (AEP v. Connecticut) that the CAA and GHG regulatory programs adopted pursuant to it displaced federal public nuisance claims by plaintiffs seeking damages from and injunctive relief against large GHG emitters.[4]

EPA now proposes to rescind the Endangerment Finding, arguing that the Supreme Court’s ruling in Massachusetts was incorrect and that the EPA in fact never had the authority under the CAA to regulate GHG emissions.[5] When finalized later this year, EPA’s rescission may undermine judicial rationales like the one in AEP v. Connecticut for dismissing federal or state common law claims, like public nuisance, as being displaced or pre-empted by federal regulatory policies. This in turn could embolden plaintiffs to continue to pursue claims seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief requiring emissions reductions from energy companies, manufacturers and other large GHG emitters.

As further background, Section 202(a) of the CAA directs the EPA administrator to prescribe emission standards for new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines for “air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.”[6] In Massachusetts, the Supreme Court held that EPA (1) has authority to regulate GHG emissions under Section 202(a) of the CAA and (2) must regulate GHG emissions if the EPA administrator concludes that GHG emissions endanger public health and welfare.[7] In the Endangerment Finding, EPA concluded for the first time that GHG emissions cause or contribute to GHG pollution, contributing to climate change and endangering public health and welfare.[8] In the following years, EPA enacted GHG emission control regulations for new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines. EPA also used the substance of the Endangerment Finding to support GHG emission standards for electric power plants and other energy sources.

Massachusetts and resulting GHG emissions limits promulgated by EPA marked a major shift in the legal landscape targeting GHG emissions. For years prior to Massachusetts, states, municipalities, private land trusts and others had brought nuisance claims in federal court against large emitters, seeking both significant damages to pay for the costs of adapting to climate shifts allegedly caused by such emissions and injunctions seeking to limit GHG emissions from these sources. In the 2011 case, AEP v. Connecticut, the Supreme Court concluded that EPA’s authority to regulate GHG emissions under the CAA displaced federal common law claims, often brought under a theory of public nuisance, targeting carbon emissions from power plants.[9] The Supreme Court did not address, and has not addressed, whether the CAA pre-empts state law claims targeting GHG emissions.[10]

With federal common law public nuisance claims displaced, plaintiffs have moved to bring state law nuisance claims and other types of claims, such as greenwashing and false advertising claims, in both state and federal courts. While the number of cases has increased, the Supreme Court is now considering whether to hear a case in which it would address the question of the CAA’s pre-emptive effect on state nuisance law claims, potentially closing off those causes of action to plaintiffs.[11] A Supreme Court decision that the CAA and related regulations pre-empt state law nuisance claims would further limit plaintiffs’ options to use litigation as a mechanism for seeking to reduce GHG emissions.

Now, EPA seeks to rescind the Endangerment Finding and proposes to repeal all GHG regulations for new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines.[12] EPA’s primary justification for rescinding the Endangerment Finding and repealing GHG regulations is that such actions exceed EPA’s authority under the CAA. EPA argues that the “text, structure, and history” of Section 202(a) suggest that GHGs are not air pollutants that endanger public health or welfare under the statute and there is no separate statutory basis to regulate GHG emissions based on climate change concerns.[13] Rather, EPA argues, GHG emissions impact air quality “only indirectly.”[14]

EPA also relies on Supreme Court decisions issued since Massachusetts. First, EPA cites the 2022 decision in West Virginia v. EPA, which held that agency actions with major social, economic and political impacts cannot be performed in the absence of “clear congressional authorization.”[15] According to EPA, there is a lack of clear statutory authority under Section 202(a) to regulate GHG emissions, supported by the fact that for decades before Massachusetts, EPA did not interpret the CAA to permit GHG regulations.[16] EPA also bases its reasoning on the Supreme Court’s 2024 decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (Loper Bright), which instructed that the “best” reading of a statute must be used to determine the permissibility of agency actions.[17] EPA now claims that under the “best” reading of CAA Section 202(a), it does not have authority to regulate GHG emissions.[18]

These arguments squarely reject EPA’s authority under Massachusetts to regulate GHG emissions under CAA Section 202(a) and thus, plaintiffs may argue, undermine the Court’s finding in AEP v. Connecticut that the CAA and GHG emissions regulations promulgated pursuant to it displace federal common law nuisance claims.

It is worth noting, however, that even if EPA rejects its authority to regulate GHGs under CAA Section 202(a), plaintiffs will still have significant hurdles to overcome in successfully pursuing federal public nuisance claims, as EPA claims its authority under the act will continue to displace federal common law claims targeting GHG emissions.[19] To fully overturn AEP v. Connecticut and allow federal public nuisance claims to proceed against GHG emitters, the Supreme Court would need to not only reject its original rationale that such claims are displaced by the CAA but also determine that potential other alternative theories that could justify dismissal of such cases — including standing to bring claims, the political questions doctrine, the presumption against extraterritoriality, and a court’s ability to provide viable remedies to address the harm — do not themselves warrant keeping public nuisance cases out of federal court. And even if these initial hurdles to bringing claims were cleared, plaintiffs would have significant additional hurdles to reaching favorable judgments, such as proving that defendants’ GHG emissions (or more precisely, alleged emissions caused by wrongful conduct of defendants) caused harm to plaintiffs.

Furthermore, once finalized, the Endangerment Finding rescission will face its own formidable legal challenges. The Supreme Court’s ruling in Loper Bright means that EPA will have to prove that its interpretation of the CAA in the Endangerment Finding rescission is the “best” reading of the statute, more difficult than showing it was entitled to the Chevron[20] deference Loper Bright eliminated.

Because nuisance claims can support requests for injunctions ordering emissions reductions along with requests for monetary relief (e.g., abatement funds) and can obtain these forms of potential remedial relief at a time when the federal government is itself rescinding GHG emissions reduction regulations, energy companies, manufacturers and other large emitters should anticipate the continued filing of lawsuits in state and federal courts under state and federal common law theories of liability, including public nuisance. And once the EPA’s rule rescinding its prior Endangerment Finding is final, the contours of critical defenses to such claims based on pre-emption and displacement may shift and defendants will need to adjust such defenses and others to the implications of a new regulatory regime, including to an EPA that is now rescinding its own Endangerment Finding and prior GHG regulations.

NEW YORK, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Devon Energy (DVN.N), opens new tab and Coterra Energy (CTRA.N), opens new tab are exploring a potential merger, in a deal that could create one of the largest independent U.S. shale producers, people familiar with the matter said.

A possible combination, which would ‌rank among the largest between U.S. energy producers in recent years, comes ​as U.S. crude prices remain pressured by a near-term global oil glut and the prospect of higher supplies entering the market in coming years from Venezuela.

The two ‍companies are said to be in early-stage talks for a combination, said the sources, who cautioned a transaction was not guaranteed and spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations.

Shares in ⁠Devon slipped 3%, while Coterra's stock jumped more than 6% on the Reuters ‍story. Devon has a market value of around $24 billion, while Coterra is worth about $20 billion.

Devon and ‌Coterra ‌did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

While energy dealmaking was subdued in 2025, versus prior record-breaking years, arguments for consolidation among U.S. oil and natural gas producers remain valid. Benefits include economies of scale which would help control costs within a ⁠depressed price environment for ⁠crude, as well ​as securing additional resources at a time when many shale basins are maturing and new prime development land is at a premium.

Both companies have operations across multiple shale formations, with both ‍present in the Delaware portion of the Permian basin in Texas and New Mexico and Oklahoma's Anadarko basin.

Devon also has assets in South Texas' Eagle Ford play, as well as North Dakota's ​Williston basin. Coterra has a significant presence in ‍Appalachia, having been formed in 2021 through a merger of Cimarex Energy and Marcellus-focused Cabot Oil & Gas.

Here's What That Tells Us - InsideEVs,Suvrat Kothari,,,,,https://insideevs.com/news/784571/evs-that-defied-q4-sales-crash/,"But EVs like the Tesla Model Y, Porsche Taycan and Cadillac Escalade IQ continued to grow regardless.
After the $7,500 federal tax credit expired at the end of Q3, sales fell off a cliff in Q4, dropping to just 234,000 units.
Tesla sold a whopping 92,460 units of its popular Model Y crossover during the same period, which represents 8.1% growth.
The Model Y tells a similar story.
That kept the Model Y the undisputed king of EVs in America last year.","Electric vehicle sales in the U.S. fell 36% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of last year.

Many of those Q4 purchases happened in Q3 due to the end of the tax credits.

But EVs like the Tesla Model Y, Porsche Taycan and Cadillac Escalade IQ continued to grow regardless.

The electric vehicle market keeps getting better every year. More choices, a steadily expanding charging network and real improvements in the underlying technology helped make last year the second-best on record for EV sales in the U.S., critics be damned.

Americans bought 1.27 million battery-powered vehicles in 2025, just 2% shy of the 2024 record of 1.3 million, according to Cox Automotive estimates. That number, however, masks a sharp shift that happened late last year.

After the $7,500 federal tax credit expired at the end of Q3, sales fell off a cliff in Q4, dropping to just 234,000 units. That’s a 46% decline from Q3 and down 36% year-over-year. Most EVs posted negative growth in that period. Still, a small but telling group of about a dozen vehicles bucked the trend.

Several models from General Motors, Porsche, Tesla, Lucid and Mercedes managed to grow in the final quarter without the help of the now-dead $7,500 federal tax credit. They also did so amid relaxed Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) rules, which no longer penalize automakers for missing efficiency targets.

To lay out a handful of examples on the table (The full list is below), sales of the Porsche Taycan grew 23.6% year-over-year to 1,672 units in Q4. Tesla sold a whopping 92,460 units of its popular Model Y crossover during the same period, which represents 8.1% growth. And sales of the Cadillac Escalade IQ grew 211.2% to 2,085 units.

""The common thread among the Q4 growers is that premium buyers were far less dependent on the $7,500 federal tax credit,” Stephanie Valdez-Streaty, the Director of Industry Insights at Cox Automotive, told me in an email. “While most EVs saw sales drop significantly, some new or recently refreshed, higher‑end models held firm, suggesting shoppers in the premium segment weren’t chasing incentives,” she added.

In some cases, it’s easy to see why that happened. Production of the Escalade IQ was still ramping up at the end of 2024, so higher volumes at the end of 2025 were expected.

But other models grew largely on merit, sweetened by some year-end holiday deals. Porsche gave the Taycan a massive upgrade, adding faster charging speeds and a more energy-dense battery that meaningfully improved its range, things that likely made the car more compelling to buyers on the fence.

The Model Y tells a similar story. Tesla rolled out a mid-cycle refresh with updated styling, improved suspension and better overall engineering. That kept the Model Y the undisputed king of EVs in America last year. The company also continued offering 0% financing through the end of the year, and it still does on the new Standard trims.

With the exception of Tesla, most EVs that grew in Q4 sit firmly in the luxury segment, where buyers are less reliant on incentives and more attracted by the vehicles themselves. Those shoppers kept signing paperwork even as subsidies disappeared. This shouldn't be too surprising, as if you bought an EV with a sticker price over $80,000 you didn't get the credit, anyway.

There appears to be a broader lesson here that doesn’t just apply to luxury EVs. If EVs can reach price parity with gas cars and offer compelling technology and real choice, buyers may not need incentives.

That’s why the next wave of EV launches matters so much. More than 30 new or updated EVs are slated to launch in the U.S. in 2026. Many of those are aimed squarely at the lower end of the market, like the Nissan Leaf and Chevy Bolt, or at the heart of the market, around $50,000, with the Rivian R2, which will directly challenge the Model Y.

“Overall, the data suggests that strong, new products from strong brands can still grow through policy headwinds, but mostly at the premium end of the market,” Valdez-Streaty said. “It's long been a truth in the auto industry, new product grows, aged product slows,” she added.

What the Ford and BYD battery deal would involve

According to a new report from The Wall Street Journal, Ford is in talks with BYD to buy batteries for some of its hybrid models.

Sources familiar with the matter said discussions are still ongoing on exactly what the battery deal would entail, but a few suggested Ford would use them for hybrid vehicles sold outside the US.

Under the arrangement, Ford would import BYD batteries to facilities outside of the US, potentially in Germany, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, or other major overseas plants. However, there is still a chance the deal will not fall through, according to the sources.

A Ford spokesperson said, “We talk to lots of companies about many things,” but didn’t offer any additional details. BYD declined to comment.

The report comes after Ford announced last month that it would discontinue the all-electric F-150 Lightning as part of its broader shift in its Ford+ plan.

Rather than large EVs, Ford is doubling down on smaller, more affordable models with its low-cost Universal EV platform. In the meantime, the company will bridge the gap with new hybrids and extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs).

Ford will replace the electric pickup with an EREV version that uses both battery power and a gas engine that acts as a generator to keep the battery charged.

The company said it would take a $19.5 billion hit due to the restructuring, roughly half of which is due to cancelling the Lightning.

Ford is nearly finished with construction of its BlueOval Battery Park in Michigan, where it will license technology from China’s CATL for upcoming vehicles based on the UEV platform. The battery plant is expected to begin production this year.

The first vehicle based on the UEV platform will be a mid-size electric pickup, which Ford said will start at around $30,000.

At the Detroit Auto Show, which opened to the public on Thursday, Ford’s CEO, Jim Farley, said he wants to expand the company’s hybrid and EREV lineup following the success of the F-150 hybrid.

Electrek’s Take

It’s not a total shock to see Ford turning to China’s battery leaders. It’s already licensing CATL’s tech for use at its Michigan battery plant, so a deal with BYD is possible.

For Ford, it would help secure a stable supply of batteries (outside the US) as it plans to introduce new hybrid and EREVs over the next few years.

Ford and BYD are no strangers either. In 2020, Ford’s joint venture in China, Changan Ford, began using BYD batteries in vehicles sold there. BYD has since reportedly reached out to Ford about supplying batteries for other markets.

While the US is pulling back, China is plowing ahead with new EV tech, including next-gen batteries, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and other related technologies.",https://i0.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2026/01/Ford-BYD-EV-batteries.jpeg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1,N,,2026-01-15 15:00:41.012108

On January 6, they unanimously approved two site plans for a proposed power plant and data center campus to be built south of Cheyenne. The power plant project, called the BFC Power and Cheyenne Power Hub, is being developed by Tallgrass Energy. It will ultimately provide electricity to the Project Jade data center campus being built by AI infrastructure company Crusoe.

Crusoe and Tallgrass announced the partnership in July, revealing that the data center campus will open with a capacity of 1.6 gigawatts (GW) but will be designed to scale up to 10 GW. Achieving that maximum capacity would make it the largest single AI campus in the U.S.

Big projects with big impacts

The joint project will now progress to the construction phase in the Switch Grass Industrial Park area, located 8 miles south of Cheyenne, according to documentation obtained by Inside Climate News.

Project Jade will be developed on a 600-acre (243-hectare) parcel of land and will consist of five data centers, two support buildings, and additional supporting infrastructure. The BFC Power and Cheyenne Power Hub project will be built right next door on a 659-acre (267-hectare) parcel and will consist of two power generation facilities plus supporting infrastructure.

Crusoe and Tallgrass expect to begin construction in the first quarter of this year, and the first data center building should be operational by the end of 2027, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports.

Before the final vote, the Hyndman Homesites Homeowners Association—which represents a community near the project—wrote a letter to the county commissioners expressing residents’ concerns about drilling deep wells into the local aquifer, gas turbine emissions, the location of wastewater ponds, and other impacts, according to ICN.

Ahead of the final vote, the Hyndman Homesites Homeowners Association, which represents a community near the project, sent a letter to the county commissioners raising concerns about deep aquifer wells, gas turbine emissions, wastewater pond locations, and other impacts, according to ICN.

Studies suggest they’re right to be worried. Researchers have found that data center facilities much smaller than the proposed Jade campus emit harmful air pollutants such as fine particulate matter, guzzle local water resources, and drive up energy bills.

Promises of sustainability

The projects’ developers say they have plans to mitigate local impacts. To reduce the data centers’ water demand, Crusoe intends to implement closed-loop cooling systems that recycle treated water and treatment fluids, according to a 2024 Impact Report.

When Crusoe and Tallgrass announced their partnership in July, they said the data center campus’s proximity to Tallgrass’s existing CO2 sequestration hub will also provide long-term carbon capture solutions for the gas turbines powering the data centers. They added that “future renewable energy developments in the region” could eventually supplement the facilities’ power demand.

Whether these prove to be viable, meaningful solutions remains to be seen. County leadership is apparently comfortable enough with the risks to allow the projects to move forward. The true costs and benefits of their decision won’t become clear until these facilities are operational and the campus begins drawing power, water, and scrutiny at scale.",https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2026/01/Crusoe-data-center-Texas-1200x675.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 14:01:30.576783

AUDIO: The Governor's remarks are available in audio form here.

A rush transcript of the Governor's remarks is available below:

We just received word that a federal judge in Washington has sided with us and the company Equinor, and other companies who are providers of offshore wind. The developer, Equinor, sued because the Trump administration arbitrarily issued a stop work order on a project that had been underway, contemplated for over a decade as part of our [renewable] energy strategy. The work was done. The platforms are built. Thousands of workers from Long Island to New York City and beyond have been working through all kinds of weather — extreme weather — to do something that is critically important for our energy future and has been contemplated as part of our grid. The Trump administration shut it down, we went to court and now the stop work order must be lifted and people get back to their jobs.

And I'm sick and tired of having to go to court time and time and time again to stop these decisions. They're designed to do nothing other than hurt workers, hurt our states, hurt our economy and hurt our energy future.

So we won. The federal court ruled in favor of restarting the work at Empire Wind Offshore Wind Project, clearing the way for it to go forward. And this is what we're talking about, two of these projects that were shut down along the East Coast. Two were in New York, Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind off the coast of Long Island.

They were stopped under the bogus pretense of national security. When I heard this, I said one thing, “I'm the Governor of New York. If there is a national security threat off the coast of New York, you need to tell me what it is — I want a briefing right now.” Low and behold, they had no answer. They had fake claims about radar. Radar can be addressed and handled as it has happened on many other projects in the past.

So, we rallied just last Friday on Long Island, surrounded by hundreds of hardworking union members, environmentalists, residents, businesses, who are part of the supply chain. Businesses, Republicans and Democrats stood together with us to say, “Turn it back on, lift the stop work order.” And I'm really proud that a judge has agreed with this, that the billions of dollars of private investment can stay right here in New York. And also reminding us that energy security is part of national security. We have been contemplating on this for years to literally next year, or perhaps even later this year to turn on this clean renewable energy source, to power half a million homes in Brooklyn alone.

When they shut this down right before Christmas, shut it down, it drove a huge hole in our energy resiliency grid planning. So, I'm proud to say that the company has been successful in court. We're going to continue doing what we have to do every single step of the way, but for now the wind turbines will be turning on.

“The states want capacity, they want affordability, they want in-state resources,” Elevate CEO Joshua Rogol told Canary Media. ​“Storage can clearly be part of the solution to that problem. It is one of the few resources that can come online quickly, given how long it takes to develop and build a project given the supply chain as it exists today.”

Fossil gas still generates more power across the U.S. than any other resource, but battery storage has become the top source of on-demand power being built today (solar, as an intermittent producer, does not meet that definition).

However, almost all the storage action, and its resulting benefits, has happened in California and Texas. Data firm Modo Energy drew the comparison in a report last year: ​“In the past five years, PJM has added just 200 MW of grid-scale battery capacity — while Texas and California have cumulatively built more than 20 GW of [battery energy storage systems] over the same period.” It’s as if a major swath of the country saw a few states adopting smartphones and said, ​“No, thanks, we’re happy with flip phones.”

Tough times for batteries in PJM

PJM’s failure to keep up with this particular grid technology is particularly surprising because PJM actually created the modern storage market back in 2012, by letting batteries compete for the rapid-fire grid service known as frequency regulation. Those rules spurred a buildout of 181 megawatts by 2016, according to Modo — heady stuff at the time, and well before storage in California and Texas took off. But these batteries tended to have just 15 minutes of duration, because that’s all that was needed to perform that role for the grid.

“The economic strategy was always to build a very short-duration battery, just participate in regulation services and make really substantial returns that way,” said Julia Hoos, head of USA East at Aurora Energy Research.

Frequency regulation has stayed lucrative for battery owners, Hoos noted, in part due to quirks in PJM’s rules that reserved some of the market for thermal generators like gas plants, which set a higher clearing price than batteries do. But rule changes now underway will likely reduce the payoff in future years.

In any case, the amount of regulation PJM needs for the grid isn’t enough to support a larger battery buildout on its own. Currently, PJM has more than 400 megawatts of batteries operating, meaning individual projects elsewhere in the country contain more battery capacity than is in the entirety of the nation’s largest wholesale market.

Beyond the limited regulation market, PJM’s rules and market dynamics make it hard for developers to finance storage projects. In California and Texas, battery owners can profit by charging up at times when solar generation makes grid power very cheap and selling back to the grid when prices are high. But PJM doesn’t experience that level of daily swing from cheap to expensive power, Hoos said.

Battery developers could try to make money instead by committing their batteries in the capacity auction. However, PJM awards capacity contracts on a one-year basis, which prevents developers from locking down long-term revenue certainty, like they can in California.

Aurora modeled a hypothetical four-hour duration battery in Virginia and found that half its revenue would come from capacity payments and half from energy arbitrage. But, Hoos added, ​“the revenue from both of those is still not enough for an investor to build a merchant battery.”

State policy and utility contracts make storage possible

Prospect Power could be the project that breaks the dry spell, and it’s taken many hands to make that possible.

Storage specialist Eolian Energy, known for its pioneering battery construction in Texas, started developing the project back around 2017 in a joint venture with Open Road Renewable Energy. Eolian CEO Aaron Zubaty wanted to place a project ​“anywhere we could within a 100-mile radius of northern Virginia to feed the data center load growth.” But Data Center Alley is ringed by rolling Virginia horse country, where landowners were not enthusiastic about power plant construction.

The joint venture ended up securing a parcel farther west, over the Blue Ridge Mountains, that could ship power directly to northern Virginia. In 2023, the joint venture sold the project to Swift Current Energy, which secured a 15-year contract from utility Dominion Energy. That dependable revenue stream helped Swift Current lock down a $242 million financing package last September to build the project.

Now, Elevate has emerged as the long-term owner, which will operate the finished battery just in time to navigate the choppy waters of PJM amid the AI boom.

The Prospect battery broke through the PJM logjam because state policy created an opening.

PJM governs the energy markets for the whole region, but individual states can layer on their own policies, and Virginia passed a comprehensive clean energy law in 2020. This law sets a 100% renewable electricity target and requires Dominion, the largest utility in the state, to procure 2.7 gigawatts of energy storage by 2035, some of which must be owned by third parties.

Virginia also has long been home to the densest cluster of data centers in the world, stemming from Cold War defense investments that kick-started a dense fiber-optic network there. That has naturally evolved into ground zero for AI computing investment, which is putting utilities in a bind as they try to figure out how to deliver enough power for the new computing behemoths.

“There is a need for capacity, and the states are stepping up to incent that battery capacity to come online, to drive affordability and reliability,” Elevate’s Rogol said.

Prospect checks off part of Dominion’s energy storage obligation under state law, and it delivers a powerful tool for meeting Data Center Alley’s needs during peak hours, when the grid might struggle.

As for what the battery will do exactly, the short answer is, whatever Dominion asks for. Under the contract, known as a tolling agreement, Elevate will own the battery and keep it in fine working condition, Rogol said, while Dominion will dispatch it to monetize regulation, energy arbitrage, and capacity as it sees fit.

The conditions that made Prospect possible, then, aren’t in place across most of PJM’s territory, though the PJM states of Illinois, New Jersey, and Maryland have enacted policies that support storage build-out, too. Prospect may be a lonely giant for a few more years, but the sheer need for more capacity should change that sooner or later.

“With limited availability of gas turbines; constraints on gas fuel supply; challenges siting, permitting, and building new gas plants; and a limited number of gas plants in advanced development, it is difficult to see how growing demand in PJM will be met anytime soon without a lot of storage filling the gap,” said Brent Nelson, managing director of markets and strategy at the research firm Ascend Analytics. ​“But mechanisms to provide stable revenues will be critical for getting projects financed and built.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Prospect-Power.JPG?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=11e2de06e0663b2b2ad38c689432d9d9,N,,2026-01-15 18:59:51.487536

In June, U.S. District Judge Tana Lin granted the states’ motion for a preliminary injunction requiring the Federal Highway Administration to restore funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula (NEVI) Program, which allocated $5 billion to states to build electric vehicle charging networks across the country.
The NEVI Formula program was signed into law by former President Joe Biden in 2021 with the intent to build an interconnected network of highways with electric vehicle charging stations across the nation.
The states argued that changing priorities is not a basis to withhold funding.
For the environmental groups, the disruption to the states’ NEVI program funding has meant their members who use and rely on electric vehicles have been adversely affected.","Whether the Trump administration can skirt a lawsuit from a coalition of 20 states over changes to an electric vehicle charging infrastructure program is in the hands of a federal judge who heard dueling motions for summary judgment on Tuesday.

“In a blatant end run around the express limitations on their authority, the defendants refused for months on end to obligate [National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program] funds to the plaintiff states,” Caitlin Soden with the Washington Attorney General’s Office argued.

In May, the states sued the Trump administration — naming the U.S. Department of Transportation and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and the Federal Highway Administration and its administrator as defendants — arguing that it unlawfully withheld billions in congressionally approved funding previously slated for electric vehicle charging infrastructure across all 50 states.

In June, U.S. District Judge Tana Lin granted the states’ motion for a preliminary injunction requiring the Federal Highway Administration to restore funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula (NEVI) Program, which allocated $5 billion to states to build electric vehicle charging networks across the country.

Both the states and the federal government moved for summary judgment, with the government arguing that the case has been rendered moot following changes to the program.

“The temporary pause that spurred this lawsuit has concluded,” Justice Department attorney Heidy Gonzalez argued.

That pause refers to the Department of Transportation’s suspension of program funding in early February, which came on the heels of President Donald Trump’s signing of Executive Order 14154, titled “Unleashing American Energy,” announcing several directives impacting the energy industry.

After retroactively revoking the approval of state submitted plans in February, the Federal Highway Administration later issued updated guidance and asked states to submit new deployment plans in August.

The federal government argued that action resolved the case. But Lin questioned why the government needed to pause in the first place and require new plans from states.

“The administration wanted to make sure it was not implementing policies, priorities and policy decrees that the previous administration determined were important to it,” Gonzalez said.

The NEVI Formula program was signed into law by former President Joe Biden in 2021 with the intent to build an interconnected network of highways with electric vehicle charging stations across the nation. It was part of his bid to accelerate the country’s transition away from fossil fuel-powered vehicles and planned for multiple rounds of funding between 2022 and 2026.

During the pause, the Trump administration eliminated all policies created under the Biden administration that it deemed unnecessary, Gonzalez explained.

Lin questioned why the states were required to submit new plans if the new requirements were less stringent than the old plan requirements. Gonzalez clarified that the states were allowed to resubmit old plans so long as they complied with the requirements made under the current administration.

The states argued that changing priorities is not a basis to withhold funding. Even though the states have resubmitted plans to receive more funding, projects already underway have been delayed. Plus, the Trump administration hasn’t guaranteed that it will fulfill funding.

“Defendants have not promised to obligate NEVI funds and disperse them as required by statute,” Soden said.

A collection of environmental interest groups, led by the Sierra Club, intervened in support of the states. For the environmental groups, the disruption to the states’ NEVI program funding has meant their members who use and rely on electric vehicles have been adversely affected.

“We, of course, acknowledge the limits of the existing fast-charging network — NEVI’s entire purpose was to remedy those issues,” Joe Halso with the Sierra Club said. “By impeding build out of that network, defendants have delayed and denied our members access to those charging stations, prolonging, contributing to and causing our members injuries.”

The government argued the pause didn’t withdraw or withhold funding but realigned the program and offered the states the opportunity to resubmit plans.

Lin said she expects to issue a ruling within a week.",https://www.tucsonsentinel.com/phpthumb/phpThumb.php?src=/files/entryimages/ev_charging_stations_1.jpg&fltr[]=wmi|/gfx/shareoverlays/sentinellogo4color_nobackbig.png|BR|77|4|4|0]&w=1200&h=630&zc=C&f=jpg,N,,2026-01-15 14:59:59.966009

Ami Bera and Rep. Young Kim say is part of a “wake-up call” for how vulnerable the country is with the critical minerals supply chain.

“We are no longer asleep at the wheel,” Kim, R-Calif., told “The Hill” on Wednesday. “We are wide awake and answering the call that the United States is ready to build out domestic production to meet the demands that we have at scale.”

Part of the legislation, the Developing Overseas Mineral Investments and New Allied Networks for Critical Energies (DOMINANCE) Act, aims to reduce the United States’ reliance on China to build resilient critical minerals supply chains with trusted allies and partners around the world.

According to a geological survey, China controls nearly 44 million tons of the global rare earth mining, while the U.S. only controls 1.9 million tons.

Kim adds the legislation will be a “game-changer” for the U.S. Bera backed Kim’s remarks, acknowledging the critical minerals are vital for technology and military weaponry the United States has and is possibly developing.

“It’s a real national security and economic issue,” the California Democrat said. “We can’t be vulnerable to potential competitors in Beijing. That’s why this is not a Democratic or Republican issue. It’s an American issue.”

“There are nearly fifteen other current programs, opportunities, and incentives available for third-party DER on Xcel Energy’s distribution system,” the utility said.
“The cost-benefit analysis and the estimated budget reflect economies of scale and efficiencies that may not translate to a smaller pilot.”","​​​​​Xcel Energy on Friday told Minnesota regulators that it would make modifications to its Capacity*Connect distributed battery proposal in response to stakeholder feedback, but it stood by company ownership of storage assets to “benefit and protect customers.”

Xcel filed the “first-of-its-kind proposal” in October with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. The utility is asking for authorization to work with deployment services company Sparkfund to position front-of-meter batteries ranging from 1 MW-3 MW at “strategic locations” on its grid by 2028.

Local businesses, commercial or industrial sites or nonprofit organizations would receive compensation to host the batteries, but Xcel would own the assets. The program has a proposed budget ranging from $152 million to $430 million based on a procurement ranging from 50 MW to 200 MW. Xcel said small-scale battery systems are typically capable of a four-hour discharge.

Several parties filed comments with the PUC that were supportive of distributed storage but concerned about the structure of Xcel’s proposal.

A group of solar stakeholders — the Coalition for Community Solar Access, the Minnesota Solar Energy Industries Association and the Solar Energy Industries Association — took issue with Xcel’s exclusive ownership of the batteries.

The C*C proposal “raises serious concerns about how we procure these resources and whether the process delivers the best value for customers and the system,” the solar joint filing said. “The proposal is costly, shifts undue risk to ratepayers, restricts competitive market participation ... omits required analyses of alternatives, and could restrict the continued growth of Minnesota’s distributed energy resource ecosystem.”

Utility ownership of front-of-meter battery energy storage systems should be permitted “only when Xcel demonstrates, through solicitation of proposals, that competitive alternatives cannot meet the identified system needs at lower cost or lower risk to ratepayers,” the groups said.

Another group, consisting of Cooperative Energy Futures, the Environmental Law and Policy Center, Institute for Local Self-Reliance, Solar United Neighbors and Vote Solar, was critical of Xcel’s focus on the C*C program to produce bulk power system benefits.

As proposed, the program “fails to advance distribution value and develop meaningful insights for how to co-optimize distribution and bulk-system benefits,” the groups said. The utility has said it does aspire to those goals in a later phase of the program, they noted — but “the company does not expect to begin to address them until 2031.”

Xcel responded that its proposal “effectively balances the need for incremental progress and innovation while seeking to benefit and protect all customers.”

It said third parties and customers have “ample opportunity” to “access” the distribution system through the company’s other competitive procurements, including through the approximately 1 GW of community solar gardens already on the company’s system.

“There are nearly fifteen other current programs, opportunities, and incentives available for third-party DER on

Xcel Energy’s distribution system,” the utility said. Company ownership of C*C assets “ensures safe, reliable operation of our distribution system as we build the people, processes, and tools needed to manage BESS on our distribution system and interact with [Midcontinent ISO] markets.”

Participating in MISO markets “provides the most value to customers,” Xcel said.

“Prioritizing other use cases focused on energy arbitrage, distribution-only value, and/or distributed generation interconnection, as suggested by some parties, are not consistent with the [distributed capacity procurement] concept, nor do they provide sufficient customer benefit,” the utility said.

But Xcel said it would make other changes to its proposal in response to stakeholder comments.

The utility committed to additional reporting, including metrics related to equity and environmental justice, and to refining Xcel’s marginal distribution cost analysis in its 2027 integrated distribution plan to estimate potential distribution system benefits of such a program.

The Minnesota Department of Commerce recommended regulators approve the program but limit it to an initial “learning phase.”

Xcel told regulators the total aggregate capacity target of 50 MW-200 MW “is the appropriate size of the learning phase,” but it would reduce it, if directed.

“However, we note that reducing the size ... will not be a linear reduction in terms of cost,” it said. “The cost-benefit analysis and the estimated budget reflect economies of scale and efficiencies that may not translate to a smaller pilot.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/5KwZNuHbYAylgkIAVisuYOiS1g6hY3KfAQOgrtCXEHE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9WaWVqYXNfTWljcm9ncmlkXy1fQmF0dGVyeV9ZYXJkLmpwZWc=.webp,N,,2026-01-15 15:00:12.855601

On a 400-meter test section of U.S. 52/231 near West Lafayette, a Cummins-powered semi took in 190 kilowatts from coils buried under the pavement, according to Purdue University’s announcement. This is the first wireless charging highway in the U.S. built for real trucks, not golf carts. That matters for you because it hints at a future where stopping for “fuel” becomes the slow option.

How This Wireless Charging Highway Changes the Game for You

Engineers embedded transmitter coils under the road; matching receivers on the truck pick up power through the concrete and feed it straight into the battery. An Indiana DOT program called Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer is backing this, with the goal of expanding from this quarter-mile slab to full highway corridors if the tech proves reliable. Trade coverage spells it out even more bluntly: a “highway that draws power from beneath” and turns long-haul routes into rolling chargers for electric freight.

Right now, the spotlight is on semis. But once the concrete is wired, it doesn’t care what’s on top of it. If this spreads, your daily EV won’t need a monster battery to do a long commute, and your road trips will be built around short, predictable top-ups instead of big gulps at fast chargers. Gas trucks start to look like the slow option: they still have to dive off the highway, queue up, and pay whatever the pump says that week.

My Verdict: How You Let This Shape Your Next Buy

If you want your next car or truck to age well, you stop thinking of it as a sealed box and start thinking of it as a device that talks to the road. You favor EVs and plug-in trucks that already handle serious DC fast charging, sit on platforms big freight players are betting on, and keep their batteries cool under high load. You let someone else cling to the pump while you buy for a world where the road itself keeps your battery fed and your trips shorter, not longer.",https://s.yimg.com/os/en/men_s_journal_718/66bdaec1308433816888d7c080dfc2ca,N,,2026-01-15 14:01:58.056352

In December 2025, Donald Trump’s Department of Interior issued an all-out pause on all offshore wind projects, including projects that were nearly completed. Today, a judge ruled that the Empire offshore wind project off the coast of New York may resume construction.

During his questioning, Judge Carl Nichols said the Trump administration’s attorney defending this ban was “all over the map.”

The Empire Wind project is expected to add over 1,000 stable, union jobs in the region and power half a million homes with clean, affordable, renewable energy.

“We are pleased to see yet another ruling in favor of renewable, affordable offshore wind energy,” said Sierra Club Senior Advisor on Offshore Wind Nancy Pyne. “American families from coast to coast deserve to know that reliable energy does not have to come at the expense of their health, their wallets, or their futures.

Illinois continues to deliver a strong environment for private investment in EV infrastructure by expanding access to reliable, convenient charging for drivers.

“Whether you’re headed out on a long-range road trip, taking the kids to school, or on the job site, EV ownership should be easy, affordable, and reliable. Here in Illinois, we’ve put shoulder to the wheel to get the EV industry off the ground, and we’ve seen significant investments in our state as a result,” said Governor JB Pritzker. “Over the next few years, Illinois’ EV ecosystem will continue to grow — creating more quality jobs, building out more charging infrastructure, and making EVs an even more accessible and affordable option for our families.”

IONNA is a joint venture founded by eight global automakers, deploying EV fast charging infrastructure nationwide. IONNA’s charging stations are accessible to all-electric vehicles with NACS or CCS connectors. Among the new charging sites in Illinois, IONNA is powering 10 charging bays — electrified by ComEd — at Wally’s in Pontiac, creating access to local retail operations for Illinois EV drivers.

“Our goal at IONNA is simple: provide easy and stress-free EV charging for our drivers,” said IONNA CEO Seth Cutler. “By bringing fast, reliable charging to familiar stops like Wally’s in Pontiac, we’re giving Illinois drivers the confidence to travel farther, stop comfortably, and enjoy the journey — whether they’re commuting, running errands, or taking a road trip.”

“Wally’s — the Home of the Great American Road Trip — is proud to partner with IONNA to bring EV charging to Pontiac, strengthening the Midwest travel corridor while delivering the convenience, comfort, and reliability our guests expect,” said Wally’s Co-Founder and CEO Michael Rubenstein.

“The new and improved EV infrastructure at Wally's is another step forward for our community — supporting cleaner transportation, encouraging innovation, and making it easier for residents and visitors alike to choose sustainable options,” said Pontiac Mayor Kelly A. Eckhoff. “New station will attract road travelers, encourage longer stops, and brings more dollars to our local economy, while also preparing Pontiac for the future of transportation.”

“ComEd is committed to helping northern Illinois customers and communities unlock the sustainability and cost saving benefits of EVs,” said ComEd President and CEO Gil Quiniones. “Working closely with the state of Illinois, EV companies and communities across the region, we have helped facilitate the expansion of a widespread network of charging stations to serve the region, strengthened by the most reliable grid in the country.”

The State of Illinois has fought to ensure federal resources are delivered as promised, securing the release of critical funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) grants. So far, a total of $148 million has been allocated to IDOT to deliver the NEVI program in Illinois. To date, IDOT has awarded $43.8 million in NEVI grants for 62 projects throughout the state, which will facilitate the construction of 349 new charging ports.

As federal EV tax credits are no longer available, Illinois continues to operate its own state EV rebate program. Illinois’ EV rebate program — which delivers a check to eligible purchasers — includes $4,000 for low-income Illinoisans, $2,000 for others purchasing an EV, and $1,500 for electric motorcycles. By doubling down in the face of federal roadblocks, Illinois is encouraging sustained growth in the EV sector.

Illinois EV Growth

This combination of public leadership and private investment is helping drive rapid EV growth statewide:

Illinois now has 162,375 battery electric vehicles on the road. 2025 saw a 32.5% increase in battery electric vehicles.

In 2025 alone, the state added 411 new public charging locations, bringing the number of fast-charging ports to approximately 2,300 statewide.

While grants have been instrumental in promoting charging, nearly half of these new charging locations — including IONNA — opened without federal or state grant support, demonstrating strong private-sector confidence in Illinois’ EV market.

Illinois’ commitment to expanding EV infrastructure benefits Illinois’ local economies and EV and component manufacturers alike. As the state’s EV market grows through strategic investments and competitive incentives, more well-paying jobs are created for Illinois’ unmatched workforce. In May, Governor Pritzker announced EV manufacturer Rivian’s $120 million investment in a new supplier park, which will support hundreds of new jobs and suppliers.

Alongside the charging site in Pontiac, other IONNA rechargeries across Illinois include:

6 charging bays electrified by ComEd at Casey’s in McHenry

6 charging bays electrified by ComEd at Casey’s in Vernon Hills

6 charging bays electrified by ComEd in Hanover Park

10 charging bays electrified by Ameren in Gilman

Six other IONNA charging sites in Springfield, Chicago, North Aurora, St. Charles, Arlington Heights, and Des Plaines are either contracted or scheduled to go live.

“We were headed to be 50% EVs from a regulatory perspective by 2030.
“I think the great thing at General Motors [is that] we have a really strong EV portfolio that we’re still committed to [and] we have a very strong internal-combustion-engine portfolio,” she said.
We have a leadership position in full-size SUVs,” Barra said, noting took 50 years to establish that leadership position.
“Frankly, what we want to do is translate that into leadership position in the EVs as well.” Barra believes consumers will make rational decisions to choose EVs over time because they will be superior products.","DETROIT — General Motors will continue its major focus on electric vehicles but at a slower pace than originally planned while also maintaining a strong position in ICE power in addition to some upcoming hybrids and plug-in hybrids, the company’s CEO Mary Barra said.

In a “fireside chat” before an Automotive Press Association audience ahead of the 2026 Detroit Auto Show, Barra discussed a number of issues, most notably GM’s revised product strategy in reaction to the Trump administration’s rollback of future fuel economy regulations and elimination of the $7,500 EV tax credit.

“We were headed to be 50% EVs from a regulatory perspective by 2030. But with the changes that are not completely done yet from a regulatory perspective, we are on a different path,” Barra said during the event at General Motors’ new World Headquarters in downtown Detroit.

“I think the great thing at General Motors [is that] we have a really strong EV portfolio that we’re still committed to [and] we have a very strong internal-combustion-engine portfolio,” she said. “I’ve always said I didn’t want the regulatory environment to drive EV adoption. I wanted it to be because people choose them because they feel they are better vehicles and fit their lives.”

EVs and ICE vehicles can coexist and thrive under the GM tent, Barra said, adding the automaker is investing in both “because we realized internal combustion vehicles even at 50% [of the product mix] are still very significant.”

“We have a leadership position in full-size trucks. We have a leadership position in full-size SUVs,” Barra said, noting took 50 years to establish that leadership position. “Frankly, what we want to do is translate that into leadership position in the EVs as well.”

Barra believes consumers will make rational decisions to choose EVs over time because they will be superior products.

“Once we have a robust charging infrastructure, I think people are naturally going to pick EVs because instant torque opens up new design language and never having to go to the gas station,” she said. “It will take longer without incentives, but I still think we will get there over time. We don’t know what the demand will be, but we are working hard and we’re investing in new battery technology with LMR [lithium manganese-rich] to dramatically take the cost down.”

Barra added that she is surprised that some other OEMs have pulled back from EV development as quickly and as much as they have.

GM’s investments in technology go beyond electrification, the CEO said. The automaker will soon be putting its own “AI Assistant” into its vehicles and is already using AI in its processes “to help identify and improve the quality of our vehicles as well as speed and efficiency.”

However, the automaker has also pulled back on some investments in order to focus its efforts. Barra offered GM’s experience with its robotaxi arm Cruise as an example, saying the company “made the decision to not be in the rideshare business.”

“As we deploy our capital, we want to focus on personal vehicles and personal autonomy, not running rideshare leads,” she added. “We don’t run a taxi business. We don’t run a bus business. We’re not running Rideshare 1.0. So, I think it’s the right decision for us.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/4mXbtL1JVOKYeH4-7be810gUcUY5SEcgA_3CZno69gM/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9CYXJyYV8xX0dldHR5SW1hZ2VzLTIyMTc1MTEwNDcuanBn.webp,N,,2026-01-15 14:01:19.465881

The result was the weirdest year ever for EV sales, with some brands hitting new EV sales records and canceling flagship electric models in the same breath.

The result is a reshuffled game board, with fewer players, fewer spoils and much more competition for the pool of buyers, as evidenced by this year’s Kelly Blue Book Electric Vehicle Sales Report. Total EV sales in the United States declined by 2%, even as they climbed globally. But the granular data is a lot more volatile than that, and the worst is yet to come. That’s why this is a particularly dissonant year for winners and losers: Some of the brands that posted the best U.S. EV sales gains are actually in the most trouble, and vice versa.

So what does all of this mean for the year ahead and beyond? Let’s dig in and find out.

Winner: Volvo

Photo by: Volvo

Volvo’s U.S. EV sales were up 96.3% for the year, to 10,821 units, according to KBB, representing astounding growth. But anyone who follows the EV industry closely knows it hasn’t been smooth sailing for the EV brand. Its EV gains are mainly driven by the EX90, its software-defined electric flagship. Far more advanced than previous Volvo EVs, it offers over 300 miles of range in a segment where Volvo consistently overperforms.

Yet the EX90 didn’t. Early examples were plagued with software issues, with many bugs surfacing during my brief first drive. Updates have improved things since, but Volvo is betting on the EX60 to reset its electric momentum. We’ll learn about that model next week.

For now, Volvo needs the win. Despite posting record EV sales in the U.S., its overall sales have been spiraling due to increased global competition, new import tariffs that affect its most profitable vehicles here and a series of headaches launching both the EX30 and EX90.

Volvo has proven it can grow EV sales here in spite of these challenges. But if it wants to be a high-volume player, it can’t afford to bungle the EX60.

Loser: Mercedes

The Mercedes EQE and EQS didn't quite hit the mark.

Photo by: Mack Hogan/InsideEVs

While Volvo’s surprise growth hides a small overall EV business and an ongoing quality crisis, Mercedes’ sales collapse accurately captures its position. Mercedes U.S. EV sales were down 54% year over year, or 12,942 units compared to 28,154 sales in 2024. And don’t expect that to reverse immediately: The EQE and EQS sedans and SUVs have both been paused for the U.S. market, as Mercedes kills its awkwardly designed and poorly received EQ cars.

Don’t be fooled by the bad numbers and backtracking, though. This may still be a great year for Mercedes EVs. The EQ cars were compromised and middling. The new CLA is neither, with an all-new 800-volt architecture, blazing fast charging speeds, an all-new cabin experience with MB.OS and around 400 miles of range. It also looks to have one of the most advanced automated driving assistance systems you can buy right now. The GLC EV promises to bring the same improvements to the high-volume compact crossover market later this year, too, setting Mercedes up for a much-needed electric do-over.

Mercedes wants to reset its EV fortunes with the new CLA. Based on our first drive, the company might have pulled it off.

Photo by: Patrick George

That’s why—if this list was subjective—I’d put Mercedes on the winners list. The company got walloped by tariffs, hurt by its own middling offerings and unseated from its comfortable position in China. Yet it also proved that one mistake wouldn’t define it. After years of trying to make the EQ cars work, the company has learned its lessons and is back for another chance at the throne.

Winner: Volkswagen Group

This has been maybe the worst year ever for the Volkswagen Group, with a full-on panic about the direction of Porsche, Audi and its core brand. Part of that is that all of these companies invested heavily in EVs and planned for a quick transition, only to realize that customers remain price-sensitive and anxious.

Another part is that the company is struggling in China and has never really been a huge player in the U.S., leaving it over-exposed to the shrinking and modestly profitable European auto market. Its software plans have been rewritten more times than I can count, and its core brand’s flagship EV, the ID. Buzz, is taking a gap year to figure things out in 2026. None of this looks great.

Don't be fooled: VW EV sales may look good, but that's only because the ID.4 had a stop-sale order for most of 2024. We expected numbers to improve significantly in 2025.

Yet on paper, this year was a stunning success for the Group’s U.S. EV efforts. KBB data shows VW EV sales up 56.8% for the year, while Audi EV sales grew 30.5%. Sure, part of that is rising from a low bar: The ID.4, VW’s only high-volume EV, had a stop-sale recall that prevented sales for most of 2024. Yet Audi, too, posted gains, and Porsche did the best of all. EV sales for the brand climbed 117.5%, driven by the new Macan EV.

Volkswagen's next-gen EVs look a lot better inside.

Photo by: Volkswagen

This year, as Porsche launches an electric Cayenne, I hope to see that number go up. But VW won’t be out of the woods until we try out its new EVs, developed with the help of its Rivian joint venture. Those products may finally offer the software experience, upgradeability and simplicity we expect from cutting-edge modern EVs.

Loser: Genesis

I like the Genesis GV60, but its awkward shape and middling range figures make it a niche player.

Photo by: Patrick George

Genesis was an early mover in the electric luxury space. Its results this year are a reminder that merely showing up isn’t good enough. While the company offered three EVs—the GV60, the Electrified GV70 and Electrified G80 (RIP)—none of them seem to be the right product at the right time. The GV70 and G80 are compromised by their gas-car foundations, and the GV60 is too small, awkward and low-range to be a do-everything luxury EV.

Couple those issues with a less-recognized brand and you get Genesis’ 2025 results: Sales fell 37.7%, to just 3,884 units for the year. The upcoming GV90 EV and GV60 Magma should help grow the company’s offerings. But if it wants to establish more of a beachhead in the EV market, the company needs a higher-volume product sooner, not later.

Winner: General Motors

General Motors has made a lot more progress on the EV transition than either of its crosstown rivals. Now the number two EV company in the country—behind Tesla, of course—it offers a stunning number of electric options. They are not typically the lightest or most cutting edge in their respective classes, but GM EVs offer solid technology and plenty of range at attractive prices. That’s why the Chevy Equinox EV was our inaugural Breakthrough EV of the Year, and why it’s the best-selling non-Tesla EV in the U.S. That helped push Chevy EV sales up 39.3% year-over-year.

Cadillac launched so many new EVs last year that we struggled to keep up. We still haven't even driven the Vistiq, the brand's new three-row family hauler.

Photo by: Cadillac

Cadillac fared even better. After decades of stagnation, Cadillac bet big on EVs, and it’s paying off. EV sales grew 69.1% in 2025, from an already high baseline. That’s made Cadillac the number one brand for luxury EVs, and made the company relevant in the luxury space for the first time in a long time. GMC, too, put up big numbers, with EV sales up 50.7% for the year.

The catch is that GM has a lot of electric truck models, and a lot of models that were selling big off of highly discounted lease deals. As the lease deals fade away in a post-tax-credit era, we’ll see if the General can keep up its momentum.

Loser: Tesla

Photo by: InsideEVs

Tesla did not post the largest EV sales decline of the year. That honor goes to Mercedes. Tesla U.S. sales were down a comparatively modest 7.0%. But I have to include Tesla here, for two reasons. The first is that, as an axiom, it is impossible to talk about the EV market without talking about Tesla. The second is that Tesla still accounts for nearly 40% of all EV sales in the U.S., so even a modest drop is huge in absolute figures.

That’s certainly true. Tesla U.S. sales fell from 633,762 in 2024 to 589,160 in 2025, despite a major update to its most popular model, the Model Y. Cybertruck sales were already down a staggering 48%, which is certainly not what you want to see in a flagship product’s second year on sale.

But the real reason it needs to be on this list isn’t in the numbers. It’s the culture. Tesla entered 2025 damaged by Elon Musk’s antics, but it was still perceived as a cool, sophisticated brand. These days, the brand is toxic, as evidenced by the stunning Tesla sales collapse we’ve seen in Europe, and the rising amount of anti-Tesla and anti-Elon sentiment I encounter online and in the real world.

It’s gotten bad enough that Elon Musk finally admitted that his pet project of personally gutting the federal government was a failure. Hopefully, in 2026, he’ll focus on cars, but so far he doesn’t seem inclined to give up his influence.

Winner: Acura

ZDX (pictured) sales may be surging, but that still wasn't enough to save it. Acura is nixing the ZDX and replacing it with a home-grown EV on Honda's 0 Series EV platform, the RSX.

Photo by: Acura

Here’s a weird one for you: Last year Acura EV sales grew 62.4% year over year, all on the backs of the ZDX, the brand’s sole electric model. Then, last fall, Acura axed the car.

From a distance, it looks strange. But look closer and it makes sense. The ZDX is more closely related to the Cadillac Lyriq and Chevy Blazer EV than it is to any other Acura, built by GM as part of a deal with Honda. The whole strategy ended up being a placeholder until Honda and Acuras real EVs arrive later this year.

With the RSX EV slated to launch in the second half of 2026, Acura thought the slow-selling ZDX had fulfilled its mission. With only 12,005 sales in its best-ever year, the ZDX won’t be hard for Acura to replace. Let’s hope the company’s next EV nameplate revival goes better than its last.

Loser: Kia

Kia improved the EV6 for 2025, but the closely related Hyundai Ioniq 5 still handily outsells it.

Kia was an early leader on electrification, but that momentum has started to taper off. Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 has long outsold its less spacious and practical sibling, the Kia EV6, and with Hyundai’s giant U.S. EV factory finally coming online, the gap is widening.

Kia sold 33,836 EVs last year, 12,933 of which were EV6s. That’s a 39.7% year-over-year drop for the brand and a 40.4% decline in EV6 years, despite a mid-cycle refresh. Meanwhile, Hyundai’s Ioniq 5 outsold the entire Kia brand: 47,039 units last year.

Kia executives tell me that this is partially explained by the Hyundai “Metaplant” only building the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 right now. Kia’s EV6 has to share factory capacity with the Telluride, Sportage, Sorento and EV9. In a year where EVs struggled, Kia leaned into its profitable gas models. But with the EV3 slated to arrive soon and the EV market heating up, I hope Kia redoubles its efforts here.

I hope the Kia EV3 brings some life into Kia's U.S. EV business this year.

Conclusion

Top-line sales figures do not capture how chaotic this year was for the EV market. For the first time in modern history, auto giants had to navigate a trade and regulatory environment that was changing by the day. That uncertainty is expensive: It’s paid in extra supplier contracts, inflated prices and canceled long-term investments. Businesses need clarity to plan their next step, and when they lose it, they all end up writing off billions of dollars.

The result of this chaos for you is simple. You get higher prices, fewer choices and more carbon in the atmosphere. But those who thing a few regulatory changes will reshape the broad course of history are fools. EVs are here, and they are the endgame. The only question is how fast we get there.

The International Energy Agency's (IEA) report, titled What Next for the Global Car Industry?, shows the sector is undergoing profound changes as the transition towards EVs accelerates.

In 2024, global car sales neared 80 million units, with growth driven by hybrid and electric cars increasing by around 30%.

According to the IEA, global sales of pure ICE cars have fallen by 30% since reaching an all-time high in 2017.

This decline suggests the structural makeup of the automotive sector is being permanently altered as manufacturers pivot their long-term capital investments.

China and other emerging economies now account for more than half of global car sales.

Between 2010 and 2024, China more than doubled its car production and now accounts for 40% of global manufacturing.

In 2024, it overtook the European Union to become the world’s largest car exporter.

“The global car industry is a cornerstone of many national economies, directly employing more than 10 million people worldwide and supporting millions of additional jobs,” says Fatih Birol, Executive Director of the IEA.

“The market for cars is one of the largest for a single product and cars are the single largest source of global oil demand today.”

Shifting value in automotive supply chains

The IEA estimates that roughly 70% of EVs sold are produced in China.

Automotive manufacturing continues to operate in regional clusters that reflect divergent technology choices.

For example, Shanghai’s 26 battery plants represent more than 5% of global capacity, while legacy ICE components remain dominated by Europe, Japan, Korea and North America.

Chinese firms control around 80% of battery-related manufacturing capacity.

Producing cars in China is cheaper than in advanced economies, largely due to large-scale manufacturing and vertical integration.

Lower component costs account for nearly 40% of the manufacturing cost gap for EVs.

This is driven by battery economics, with average battery cell prices more than 30% lower than in Europe and 20% lower than in the US.

“The global car industry is currently undergoing major changes that have significant implications for economies around the world and for the energy sector,” says Fatih.

“Three structural shifts are under way, in terms of the geography of production, in terms of the regions that are driving sales growth and in terms of the technologies that car buyers are choosing.

“Against this backdrop, this new IEA report provides a strong basis to inform discussions and decision-making by governments and industry, noting that there is no one-size-fits-all model.”

Strategic priorities for manufacturing resilience

Batteries are a key differentiator in regional manufacturing costs.

IEA data shows the European Union imports a far higher share of battery components than engines, while China and Japan retain integrated supply chains across both technologies.

Vertical integration is a critical factor for future competitiveness.

As governments navigate these shifts, policy decisions must balance short-term competitiveness with longer-term resilience, the IEA says.

While vehicle assembly retains local value, battery manufacturing carries strategic importance beyond the car industry.

The initiative will look at geological hydrogen in Michigan as a usable, clean fuel alternative. The Office of the Governor says Michigan is nestled in one of the most promising regions in the world for geological hydrogen, a naturally occurring energy source.

“Michigan is a leader in clean-energy solutions,” said Gov. Whitmer. “This initiative will uncover more about Michigan’s geologic hydrogen stores, which have the potential to attract long-term investments in our state and create thousands of good paying jobs for Michiganders. Together, we’re building the future of clean energy in Michigan.”

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) says geological hydrogen is a clean fuel that only creates water and heat as a byproduct. The gas is formed through natural processes deep within the earth, and can be extracted commercially for use as a fuel source alternative to fossil fuels.

Geological hydrogen can help decarbonize some of the highest emission-producing industries like heavy-duty transportation, maritime shipping and manufacturing, according to a release by the Office of the Governor.

“Geologic hydrogen represents a transformative opportunity for Michigan, a state historically rich in natural resources and innovation,” said Jim Saber, President and CEO of NextEnergy. “By tapping into this abundant, naturally occurring resource, Michigan can lead the way in sustainable energy, create new jobs, and drive technological advancement. This isn’t just about energy—it’s about securing Michigan’s future as a leader in environmental stewardship and economic resilience, ensuring prosperity for generations to come.”

The governor's office said that investments in geological hydrogen will put Michigan in a position as a frontrunner in the U.S. hydrogen economy, which they say is projected to reach tens of billions of dollars in new economic activity.

The executive directive establishes the Michigan Geologic Hydrogen Exploration and Preparedness Initiative within the Executive Office of the Governor. That initiative will ""coordinate statewide planning, regulatory readiness, workforce and economic strategy, infrastructure assessment, and environmental evaluation necessary to prepare for the exploration and development of geologic hydrogen in Michigan.""

The Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE), Department of Natural Resources (DNR), Michigan Infrastructure Office and Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) are all tasked with providing reports to the Office of the Governor, on or before April 1, 2026.

Nuclear power Nuclear power has been one of the clearest beneficiaries of Trump’s second term.
The administration has explicitly prioritised hydropower development as part of its America First energy policy, recognising its role in grid reliability and energy independence.
Energy storage While generation policy has dominated headlines, the real constraint of the power sector in 2025 has been delivery.","President Donald Trump’s return to the White House in January 2025 marked a decisive shift in energy policy for the US. Climate ambition has been deprioritised in favour of speed, reliability and national security, with energy recast as a strategic asset underpinning industrial competitiveness, digital infrastructure expansion and geopolitical leverage.

As a result, the power sector was pulled in different directions at once: record demand growth colliding with trade barriers, and fossil fuel support rubbing up against entrenched clean energy economics.

At the heart of this shift are data centres. Trump has been unequivocal about expanding domestic digital infrastructure, and this ambition has rippled across energy policy.

“In his executive orders (EOs) on data centre expansion, he treats energy as a core asset,” says James Roth, head of government affairs and policy at Bloom Energy and former director in the Executive Office of the President under the Clinton and Bush administrations. “When the White House issues that kind of edict, from my experience, it sends a clear signal to federal and state regulators to enact policies or regulations consistent with that.”

Simultaneously, tariffs have been the most consequential – and disruptive – policy tool of Trump’s second term. By the end of his first year, average effective US tariff rates had climbed to around 15% year-on-year (YoY), reaching levels not seen in decades. Key equipment and components for generation, transmission and distribution, from gas and solar power to batteries and grids, have been caught in the crossfire, driving up project costs and heightening uncertainty. According to Power Technology’s parent company, GlobalData, tariff-related job postings in the power sector surged 657% YoY in 2025, reflecting the scale of disruption across the industry.

Amid the chaos, power demand growth has proved relentless, forcing utilities, developers and investors to adapt, regardless of Washington’s priorities.

Trump tariffs and power, a summary

Trump returned to office guns-blazing; early on, he targeted Chinese goods, including renewable energy components, with rates as high as 60%, before extending duties to other key trading partners like South East Asia and Europe. In June 2025, steel and aluminium tariffs doubled to 50%, while a new 50% tariff on copper took effect in August. These materials underpin every part of the power system, including but not limited to, turbine towers, solar frames transformers and transmission lines.

“While the US’ goal [from the tariffs] is to stimulate domestic manufacturing, the immediate effect has been a disruption of established supply chains and higher prices for essential components and materials for US energy,” explains Pavan Vyakaranam, senior power analyst at GlobalData.

GlobalData analysis estimates that Trump’s tariffs on steel, aluminium and copper increased overall project costs for US power generation assets by 6–11%. While solar and battery storage have been hit hardest, other assets – including those favoured by Trump, like gas plants – were also ensnared in collateral damage.

All in all, however, tariffs and Trump’s broader energy policies have certainly not affected all technologies equally.

The new economics of power: how has Trump 2.0 affected each technology?

Nuclear power

Nuclear power has been one of the clearest beneficiaries of Trump’s second term. The administration has framed it as a cornerstone of energy dominance, national security and data centre expansion, with policy delivered primarily through EOs.

In May 2025, Trump set a target to quadruple US nuclear capacity to around 600GW by 2050. He then followed up with multiple EOs aimed at reinvigorating the nuclear industrial base, reforming reactor testing and reshaping the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to accelerate approvals.

“At first glance, Trump’s approach might seem just domestic-focused and less international [than other administrations], but there has also been a lot of bilateral cooperation,” World Nuclear Association representative Henry Preston clarifies. In 2025, the US established agreements with the likes of South Korea, Japan and the UK on advanced fuels, reactor designs and heavy-component manufacturing. Most notably, in October, the US Government partnered with the Canadian owners of Westinghouse Electric to develop new nuclear reactors, with a projected investment of $80bn.

Preston notes that nuclear’s resurgence is not a sharp break from previous policy. Under the Biden administration, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) delivered significant support for nuclear, and the US led international coordination on the COP pledge to triple global nuclear capacity.

“Trump’s approach has been a different mechanism – primarily executive orders,” he says, “but overall, I think it is more of a continuation, just with a different emphasis and delivery.”

What has changed dramatically since Trump’s first term is demand. AI and data centres have spotlighted nuclear more than ever, given their compatibilities in load profiles. “We are now seeing groundwork for small modular reactors across the US, and major investment in advanced fuels,” Preston adds.

Rising demand, energy security and reliability – “those three factors are really driving support for nuclear”, he says, and they are unlikely to fade regardless of who occupies the White House. “The [continuation of] bipartisan support for nuclear in the US will be crucial, because nuclear is a long-term asset.”

Thermal power: gas and coal

If nuclear represents long-term ambition, natural gas and coal have been the short-term workhorse of Trump’s energy agenda.

“Trump’s speed-focused energy approach centres around expediting the permitting and approval timelines for energy infrastructure – especially oil, natural gas and coal projects – by streamlining environmental reviews and reducing regulatory friction,” says Vyakaranam.

In 2025, Trump has solidified federal backing for new combined-cycle plants, issued EOs to streamline permitting, accelerated approvals under National Environmental Policy Act revisions, and instructed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to facilitate approvals for new pipelines and LNG capacity, all as part of his “energy dominance” agenda.

The president’s enthusiasm for data centres has further strengthened gas’ position, with Vyakaranam noting: “With Trump’s pro-fossil fuel policies in place, it is both more economical and, from a clearances perspective, easier to roll out gas-based projects than others like renewables for data centres.”

Karen Wayland, CEO of the GridWise Alliance, adds that coal power has seen similar support, with the administration pushing to keep large conventional generating resources online, including rolling back Clean Air Act rules for coal plants and issuing emergency orders to delay retirements.

The favouritism is even clearer with the thermal sector’s tariff exemptions; none of Trump’s tariffs have been applied to crude oil, natural gas or refined fuel imports, with the purpose of safeguarding the feedstock imports on which most of the Gulf Coast’s refineries rely to produce US petroleum products.

However, fossil developers still rely on steel, aluminium and copper imports – all subject to tariffs. Therefore, “although Trump’s policies promote the advancement of fossil fuels, his tariffs on key materials have raised the cost of pipelines, compressors and plant equipment”, says Vyakaranam, adding that the resulting higher construction and maintenance costs risk feeding into consumer electricity prices.

Renewable power: solar, wind and hydro

Clean energy developers braced for turbulence as soon as Trump’s victory was announced in the 2024 elections.

As anticipated, the first year of Trump’s second term saw federal support weaken. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) accelerated the end of eligibility for clean electricity production and investment tax credits; the Department of Energy’s grant programmes have been scaled back; offshore wind leasing paused; and national clean electricity targets effectively shelved, with deployment now driven largely by state mandates.

According to GlobalData, clean energy project cancellations reached around $8bn in the first quarter of 2025 alone.

However, solar points to multiple contradictions in Trump-era energy policy. Globally, module oversupply has driven costs down, but in the US, tariffs and anti-dumping duties have pushed costs back up over the past year. GlobalData estimates Trump’s tariffs to have raised US utility-scale solar project costs by around 20–54%, driven by a spike in imported module and inverter prices.

While domestic manufacturing has grown, Vyakaranam notes that the US still lacks upstream scale, extending procurement lead times and limiting the domestic sector’s ability to absorb tariff shocks.

The wind power sector – especially offshore – has faced the most direct backlash. In his first day back, Trump signed a memorandum pausing all new or renewed leasing and permitting for wind projects. Over the course of the year, his administration issued stop-orders on several large-scale offshore projects, rescinded $679m in grants for wind energy infrastructure, and launched investigations into “national security risks” of wind projects and imported wind components, among other actions.

The President’s long-standing hostility culminated in December with the suspension of five major offshore projects on the grounds of national security. Although relevant developers quickly retaliated with legal proceedings, the move had already triggered a sharp sell-off.

Tariffs were an additional layer to the damage. The price hike on imported steel and aluminium – integral to wind turbines – has significantly driven up project costs. Dominion Energy’s 2.6GW Coastal Virginia project, for instance, reported an estimated capital cost rise from $10.9bn to $11.2bn resulting from tariffs.

While onshore wind has been shielded by Trump’s wrath relative to offshore, this was not the case for his tariffs. Vyakaranam estimates that tariffs may raise US onshore wind capital expenditures by up to 9% and increase the subsidised levelised cost of energy by 2–11% across different scenarios.

“The direct impact of tariffs encompasses elevated input expenses, whereas indirect consequences arise from disturbances to the equilibrium of supply and demand within intricate international supply chains.”

The Trump administration’s policies generally point to increased uncertainty, project delays and rising costs for the US solar and wind industries – thereby reducing competitiveness against fossil fuels.

Yet, experts argue that these rollbacks have not fundamentally changed the trajectory for US renewable energy.

Despite the policy headwinds of 2025, renewables continued to flourish, buoyed by the underlying economics – with wind and solar among the cheapest new power sources – and deeply entrenched long-term policy frameworks like the IRA. The outlook remains strong, with GlobalData projecting that solar photovoltaic, in particular, will account for 61.7% of investments in the power market between 2025 and 2030.

“Some projects in development might have been slowed because of loss of tax incentives or other policy setbacks, but the reality is, because of the growing cost differential between renewables and conventional fossil fuel generating resources, utilities are likely to keep adding renewable energy,” Wayland confirms.

Meanwhile, hydropower stood out as a renewable technology favoured by Trump. The administration has explicitly prioritised hydropower development as part of its America First energy policy, recognising its role in grid reliability and energy independence.

The OBBBA also includes provisions favourable to hydropower, with tax credits retained for hydropower projects starting construction by the end of 2033. The bill also includes workable Foreign Entity of Concern provisions relevant to hydro and pumped storage supply chains.

Energy storage

While generation policy has dominated headlines, the real constraint of the power sector in 2025 has been delivery. Data centres alone drove a more than 20% increase in US grid power needs, according to GlobalData, while the country’s interconnection queues swelled to more than 2.6TW of planned capacity.

Against this backdrop, energy storage has emerged as one of the most resilient technologies under Trump. While renewable tax credits were rolled back, those for stand-alone storage remains intact through the mid-2030s.

“Storage was largely spared [from negative effects of Trump’s policies],” says Arvin Ganesan, CEO of Fourth Power, mainly due to what it offers for data centres. Current grids are proving incapable of handling the demands of these energy-intensive facilities; storage serves as an appealing solution, as it allows for “power delivery when the centre needs it” and “more fundamentally, battery facilities can be built in roughly two years, far faster than large-scale generation or transmission upgrades”.

However, the energy storage market, too, was not immune to tariff impacts. Given China’s dominance over the lithium-ion used in battery production, alongside tariffs on other key storage materials like copper and aluminium, Trump’s trade policies have “significantly increased the cost of energy storage systems and project development, hindering further investment”, Vyakaranam explains.

Still, Ganesan believes that “despite these short-term impacts, storage will continue to grow in the US”.

The second year of Trump’s second term

In 2026, experts agree that the main focus for energy will be affordability, due to the looming mid-term elections.

“Electricity affordability has become more difficult for residential, commercial and industrial customers over the past year,” Ganesan details, calling it an inevitable political pressure point in the year ahead. Roth agrees. “The rise in electricity prices was mainly driven by a massive spike in demand, much of which comes from data centres,” he says, noting that Trump’s strong backing for data centres may influence narratives.

Wayland also expects energy costs to dominate the mid-terms debate, which may provide a potential foundation for a tweak in energy policy under the Trump administration: “Some of Trump’s approaches make sense, but others – like rolling back energy efficiency standards for appliance – are misguided. Energy efficiency has been one of the biggest consumer benefits over the past decade, and reducing standards won’t lower bills.”

On the other hand, Roth sees no sign of a policy pivot, despite mounting pressure.

As rising power demand collides with political realities, “the coming years will be a crucial test on whether the US can successfully balance being a climate leader and an economic competitor simultaneously”, says Vyakaranam.",https://www.power-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2026/01/shutterstock_2551951959.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 14:00:38.928816

This article is one of a series in our review of all integrated resource plans (IRPs) for electric utilities across the United States. We provide analysis of expected load, planned capacity, modeled generation and emissions, and comparison to targets and decarbonization scenarios to evaluate progress toward a zero-carbon energy future. IRPs do not provide a fully accurate prediction of the future, but we focus on them because they reflect the direction that utilities are currently striving for and a set of proposed actions to get there.

Updates in 2025 Q4

In the final quarter of 2025, the 15 utilities that updated their IRPs (representing 10 percent of total US electricity generation in 2024) cut planned wind and solar capacity additions by 2035 in half, to 23 GW, a drastic reduction from the previously planned 46 GW.

This reduction occurred while utilities made only minor adjustments to projected load through 2035 — an increase of 0.6 percent. As a result, the net impact in projections for companies that updated their IRPs in 2025 Q4 is an increase in cumulative emissions through 2035 of 9.4 percent.

Changing resource adequacy rules in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) and Southwest Power Pool (SPP) regions, phase out of federal tax credits for wind and solar, anticipated repeal of greenhouse gas regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and changes to state policy were all factors influencing this reduction in planned wind and solar build discussed by utilities in their IRPs.

This quarterly IRP update coincides with an annual update to include 2024 historical data. In 2024, US regulated electricity sector emissions slightly increased. Consequently, the annual data update also increased projected emissions compared to previous reviews in 2025 Q3 and Q2, widening the gap between utility plans and the science-based emissions pathways necessary to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.

In this article, we dive into current utility resource plans, how they changed in the past quarter and year, and solutions utilities are implementing to make progress.

The current state of IRPs

In our current snapshot of IRPs (Exhibit 1), we continue to see a gap between projected emissions, target emissions, and decarbonization pathways such as the International Energy Agency’s Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (IEA NZE).

Most decarbonization pathways, including the IEA NZE, find that the electricity sector needs to reach net-zero emissions by 2035. However, if all companies in our coverage meet their company targets, they are currently projected to reduce emissions by 63 percent by 2035, compared to a 2005 baseline. To close this gap, utilities will need to more comprehensively cover emissions from both owned (Scope 1) and purchased (Scope 3) generation. There is also a gap between both decarbonization and corporate targets and projected emissions based on IRPs representing utilities’ planned investments. As of 2025 Q4, IRPs project emissions to be reduced by just 45 percent by 2035, compared to a 2005 baseline.

Exhibit 1

Load

As of the end of 2025 Q4, IRPs across the United States anticipate load will grow 25 percent by 2035 compared to 2023 levels (Exhibit 2). This is a 0.1 percent increase compared to the end of Q3.

Expectations of electricity demand grew drastically in 2024, as utilities added new load from data centers, manufacturing, electric vehicles, and electrification of residential and commercial end uses to their projections. This slowed in 2025, in part because some of this newly anticipated load was already established, but also because of regulatory changes and revisions to load projection methodologies. Some utilities took speculative new large load projections out of their base case projections, and others updated methodologies closer to best practices for large load forecasting.

Exhibit 2

Capacity

Current planned capacity in IRPs across the United States (Exhibit 3) includes 226 GW of wind and solar additions, 100 GW of gas additions, and 73 GW of coal retirements from the end of 2024 to the end of 2035.

This reflects 18 GW less wind and solar capacity, 26 GW of additional gas capacity, and 5 GW more coal retirements compared to utility plans a year ago at the end of 2024.

Changing resource adequacy rules by major grid operators have had a significant impact on planned wind and solar capacity. For example, Centerpoint Energy Indiana South and AES Indiana each cited MISO resource adequacy and capacity accreditation rules as major factors in their planning, and took 1.8 and 3.1 GW of solar and wind capacity additions by 2035 out of their resource plans, respectively. Removal of federal tax incentives, clean energy legislation in North Carolina, and the EPA’s proposed repeal of greenhouse gas emission regulation, are all also significant factors that have shifted utility plans away from wind and solar and toward coal and gas.

Plans to build batteries have also held or increased in most cases, as batteries retain future tax incentives under recent federal policy. In aggregate, our projections include 68 GW of planned battery capacity additions from the end of 2024 to the end of 2035, a 7 GW increase from the end of 2024.

Exhibit 3

Emissions

Our latest projections (Exhibit 4) from IRPs at the end of 2025 are that carbon dioxide emissions will be 45 percent lower than 2005 levels by 2035. This is higher than we projected a year ago at 47 percent, and two years ago at 52 percent.

Compared to today, the future grid of 2035 will have lower emissions because of planned coal retirements and wind and solar capacity additions. However, major changes to utility plans of increased load in 2024, decreases to planned wind and solar capacity in 2025, and increases to planned gas capacity, have led our current projected emissions to be higher than they have been since the end of 2021.

Exhibit 4

Cumulative metrics

When considering climate alignment of the US electricity sector, or individual utilities, RMI’s Engage & Act platform’s key metric is cumulative emissions through 2035. RMI also finds value in metrics of cumulative projected load, to know whether the task of reducing emissions is becoming easier or more difficult for utilities, and cumulative projected emissions intensity, to know if consumers are increasing or decreasing emissions associated with their electricity consumption.

Exhibit 5 shows that across all IRPs in the United States, projected load has increased consistently since early 2021 but has leveled off in recent months. Projected emissions fell from early 2021 to mid-2023 but have increased significantly since then. Projected emissions intensity has also increased in recent months.

Cumulative projected emissions from 2023 to 2035 are 3.2 percent higher, cumulative projected load is 1.1 percent higher, and cumulative projected emissions intensity is 2.1 percent higher now at the end of 2025 than they were a year ago at the end of 2024.

Exhibit 5

Exhibit 6 provides an additional view of the direction that IRPs are going, by considering percent change in cumulative projected load and emissions among the set of companies that did update their IRPs each quarter. Utilities that updated IRPs in 2025 Q4 increased load by 0.6 percent, emissions by 9.4 percent, and emissions intensity by 8.8 percent.

Exhibit 6

Solutions that can scale

Recent utility plans have taken several steps to improve processes and methods to solve for utility priorities of cost, reliability, and climate impact with fast, affordable, flexible solutions.

Load forecasting, particularly for new large loads, is improving in many cases. Most utilities with updated IRPs in 2025 Q4 included scenario-based load forecasting, including specific plans on how they will meet energy and reliability needs of large loads in cases where these loads are uncertain.

Clean repowering opportunities appeared in multiple IRPs this 2025 Q4. Centerpoint Energy Indiana South plans to use interconnection rights at the site of a retiring coal unit to fast-track a battery storage addition, and Duke Energy Carolinas/Progress is studying use of surplus interconnection to add storage capacity. These examples add to utilities from 2025 Q3 of Santee Cooper and Cleco Power who each also propose re-use of retired fossil plant sites for solar and/or batteries.

Virtual power plants (VPPs) are also an emerging solution: Dominion Energy Virginia is preparing to pilot a VPP program up to 450 MW, and Centerpoint Energy Indiana South’s IRP includes a contract for a demand response aggregation program.

However, these solutions need to scale and additional revisions to planning processes are needed to enable progress toward a reliable, affordable, low-carbon electric grid. Modern methods for modeling grid reliability, rather than focusing on individual power plant dispatchability, are necessary to enable wind and solar to receive appropriate credit for their grid services. Building more of the lowest-cost electricity generation technologies will help keep electricity affordable, as will using updated costs and constraints of available technologies.

Improved planning processes and methods, with supporting policy and regulation, are critical in this moment for electric utilities to more effectively transition toward a low-cost, zero-carbon future.

Dive Brief:

A coalition of 34 environment and agriculture groups are urging the U.S. Department of Agriculture to declare on-farm manure digesters ineligible for funding through the Rural Energy for America Program. The groups include environmental organizations such as Friends of the Earth, the Waterkeeper Aliance and Food & Water Watch, as well as agriculture-centered advocacy groups like Farm Aid and Animal Legal Defense Fund.

In their petition, the groups estimated about $257 million of the $3.2 billion disbursed by the program from 2021 to 2025 went to digester projects. They further noted that the average grant or loan guarantee for digesters was much higher than for solar or wind projects, which are also funded by REAP.

Earthjustice also filed a lawsuit Wednesday attempting to compel the USDA to release records explaining the methodology it used to justify support for digesters. Meanwhile, REAP funding is delayed as the agency says it’s dealing with a backlog of applicants for the popular program.

Dive Insight:

The petition comes amid continued advocacy against government programs that subsidize anaerobic digesters. Opponents say the digesters do more environmental harm than good and lead to farm consolidation, while biogas groups say digesters tackle emissions and provide an important revenue source for farmers.

The petitioners argue that the federal government should declare digesters ineligible because they do not meet the criteria that projects should meet to receive REAP funding. The program is meant to fund projects that provide environmental benefits, favor small farms in lower-income communities and do so in a cost-efficient manner, the petitioners say.

“REAP exists to help farmers and rural small businesses lower energy costs and foster stronger communities, not prop up factory farms,” Molly Armus, animal agriculture policy program manager at Friends of the Earth, said in a statement. “If USDA wants to save taxpayer dollars, it should stop wasting its funds on inefficient, costly digesters and instead invest in projects that truly benefit rural communities.”

Biogas groups pushed back on the petition; Geoff Dietz, senior director of federal affairs for the RNG Coalition, called it “without merit and unlikely to succeed.” Biogas groups have long argued that digesters do a better job at capturing emissions from manure than other methods because they consolidate the material and cover it with a system that extracts the gas. Dietz said the systems provide “durable economic and environmental returns for rural America.”

Proponents further argue that digesters are a cost-effective means of generating energy, and say that the systems benefit farmers by generating additional revenue and reducing fertilizer costs.

“The reality is that biogas systems and digesters align directly with REAP’s statutory goal of providing environmental and public health benefits in rural America. There’s no question they should be included,” Patrick Serfass, executive director of the American Biogas Council, said in a statement.

The debate over digester subsidies has become central to other incentive programs around the country. Removing provisions beneficial to digesters was a key ask of environmental justice advisors during recent debate over California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which received a major update in 2024. Digester opponents there were ultimately unsuccessful. A similar conflict is playing out in New Mexico, where regulators are in the process of finalizing the state’s own clean fuels program.

One of the central claims of opponents is that digester incentive programs enable the concentration of dairy herds. The petition cited studies finding that dairy operations with digesters grew their herd size much more quickly than those that did not. Larger herd sizes increase the threat of air and water pollution, the petitioners say.

They further note that the creation and storage of digestate results in the production of compounds like ammonia at much higher levels than would be produced from untreated manure. And other nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, are made more water soluble in the anaerobic digestion process, potentially causing ground and surface water quality problems when the digestate is spread on land.

Those issues become more pronounced if facilities discharge their waste into the environment accidentally or in violation of their permits. The petitioners allege at least a dozen digester projects funded by REAP in recent years had documented water pollution issues. As an example, they name one Michigan facility that received a $1 million REAP grant in 2024 despite state regulators citing the associated dairy for multiple unpermitted discharges of waste and “evidence of chronic discharge of runoff and leachate.”

Finally, the petitioners dig into the finances of digesters and argue the projects cannot always recoup their costs. They performed an analysis of EPA data of on-farm digesters around the country and found that 17% have shut down, some due to financial challenges. Those challenges become more pronounced if fuel subsidies are weakened or removed, as environmental groups would like to see.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/U--NmBNK6JjSDk7g1clP2mVN-TlaejiDggZyUFFUi7o/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS81Mzc1OTUwNzk4MF9lMWQzMTdjYzBkX2suanBn.webp,N,,2026-01-15 13:01:30.949177

Gretchen Whitmer signed an executive directive Thursday that she said would help explore geologic hydrogen as a new source of energy in Michigan, requiring state agencies to plan for needed infrastructure and policy changes.

Whitmer announced the initiative during a speech at the Detroit Auto Show, saying if Michigan's hydrogen reserves are proven to be safe and viable, they could lead to a ""massive economic boom, creating jobs, lowering costs and reducing our reliance on foreign fuel.""

The directive, her first of 2026, will require the Department of Natural Resources to develop a report on any legal impediments to leasing ""state-owned subsurface rights"" for hydrogen exploration and the Michigan Public Service Commission to develop a report on needed infrastructure upgrades.

""The directive could make us a national leader in this space,"" Whitmer said Thursday, according to her prepared remarks for the event. ""We’re already seeing a lot of interest in Michigan because we have more potential reserves under our feet than every other state.""

The reports from state agencies are due by April 1, according to the directive. The Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy must file one on ""statutory and regulatory authority to permit"" geologic hydrogen exploration and any impediments in current law.

A statement from the governor's office described geologic hydrogen as ""a natural energy resource with the potential to serve as a fuel source at a scale and price that is competitive with fossil fuels."" Hydrogen releases water when it is burned, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, while petroleum and other fossil fuels release planet-warming gases such as carbon dioxide.

The USGS released a report last year indicating Michigan could be rich with geologic hydrogen that could be tapped for fuel. The state has three elements needed for hydrogen accumulation, the report authors said: a source of hydrogen generation, porous reservoirs that store hydrogen and seals to prevent hydrogen from leaking.

The four-page directive that Whitmer signed said Michigan could see ""billions of dollars in new economic activity by tapping into a fraction of the U.S. hydrogen economy.""

In the statement from the governor's office, Judd Herzer, director of mobility research and innovation at Michigan State University, said Whitmer’s directive sent a signal that Michigan was serious about leading in geological hydrogen.

""With the right coordination across state agencies, research institutions and the private sector geological hydrogen can move rapidly from scientific promise to practical application, supporting hydrogen-powered mobility, clean energy independence and the advanced manufacturing opportunities that will define Michigan’s next era of innovation,"" Herzer said.

At the federal level, the U.S. Department of Energy is funding ongoing research into safe hydrogen handling and storage practices, according to the department's website.

Geologists predict Michigan rich with hydrogen

Exploration of underground hydrogen stores is in the early stage, USGS geologists said in their report published last year. Finding underground hydrogen stores has historically been considered a problem or gone unreported, since companies were typically on the hunt for petroleum and lacked the tools to measure hydrogen.

Sara Ryker, USGS associate director for energy and minerals, described the report as “tantalizing” when it was released in January 2025.

“For decades, the conventional wisdom was that naturally occurring hydrogen did not accumulate in sufficient quantities to be used for energy purposes,” Ryker said in 2025. “This map is tantalizing because it shows that several parts of the U.S. could have a subsurface hydrogen resource after all.”

The USGS report sparked interest in recovering hydrogen from below ground rather than making hydrogen by splitting molecules such as water, said Todd Allen, University of Michigan College of Engineering associate dean for research.

While the report shows what federal geologists believe to be the best places for finding geologic reserves of hydrogen, there hasn’t been much test drilling to determine whether the geologists’ predictions are right, Allen said.

“To a great extent, it’s unknown,” he said. “I think the interest in the state of Michigan is that the USGS map said we ought to have a lot.”

It could be a big deal for Michigan if the geologists turn out to be right and the state has large quantities of hydrogen available to recover, he said.

Hydrogen fuel cells could power heavy vehicles, such as ships and trucks. Some clean energy advocates see it as a way to decarbonize heavy-duty transportation and shipping as well as some heavy industries like steelmaking that traditionally rely on coal to power furnaces.

Hydrogen fuel typically is created by separating molecules that contain hydrogen – taking the H₂ out of H₂O, for example.

“If we could bring hydrogen out of the ground, it would be much cheaper,” Allen said. “If people can recover geologic hydrogen at the same rate we do natural gas, it would be much, much cheaper (than other sources of hydrogen) and it would be much, much easier to bring it into commerce.”

Separating out that hydrogen requires a lot of electricity and sometimes is done using natural gas, which releases fossil fuels is costly and negates some of the climate benefits of hydrogen. Extracting hydrogen from the ground also could be a win for the climate, Allen said, because it wouldn’t require electricity.

During a speech in Detroit on Tuesday, Republican President Donald Trump referenced hydrogen, appearing to joke — as he has many times during previous campaign stops in Michigan — that he would “pass on” using hydrogen to power cars.

“I’m hearing it’s not testing so well,” Trump said. “It’s fine, except when there’s an explosion, you’re a goner.”

Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. Department of Energy funded regional hydrogen hubs to study and produce hydrogen fuel and develop a supply chain for its use. Michigan is part of one such hub, the Midwest Alliance for Clean Hydrogen, known as MachH2, which was set to receive up to $1 billion in federal funding as of 2023.

The hub programs are on “standby,” Allen said. Most were in the planning stage when Trump took office and had not yet received much of their promised funds, according to Allen.

“To a great extent, I think the hubs are just stuck,” Allen said. “There’s not a lot of action. I think it’s because the administration is not on a path to provide the big funding.”

Geologic hydrogen may be more appealing to the Trump administration because it requires a familiar process of extracting resources from underground, much like fracking natural gas or drilling for oil, Allen said.

“It could be a (good) thing just in general, a good, useful way of powering modern society, but it could be that the federal government shifts their focus, too,” Allen said. “It’s an extension of the thing we know how to do.”

Whitmer's speech at the auto show Thursday touched on tariffs, Michigan's economy and some of her goals for her final year as the state's governor. She can't run for reelection this fall because of term limits.

She called on Trump's administration not to abandon the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, which is up for review this year.

""Instead, we should build on the best parts and make it even better,"" Whitmer said, according to her prepared remarks. ""The USMCA has some of the strictest auto rules of any free trade agreement in the world.

""It raised wages for workers in all three countries, and guaranteed that more parts were made in the U.S. Is it perfect? No. But without our allies, we do not stand a chance.""

The USMCA started in 2020, during Trump's first term in the White House. But in recent days, he's downplayed it. During his trip to Michigan on Tuesday, he labeled it ""irrelevant.""

Also, on Thursday, Whitmer called on the Legislature to get a new state budget to her desk by June 30.

""With so much uncertainty, we owe it to local governments, schools, and businesses leaders to enact a transparent, timely budget,"" Whitmer said. ""I’m confident we can get it done.""

For homeowners able to bear upfront costs, solar comprises a strategic long-term investment.
But for most Philadelphians, especially renters, sustained federal and state incentives are essential in maximizing renewable energy accessibility, reducing energy burden, and supporting Philadelphia’s transition to a more equitable energy system.","As utility bills climb, more Philadelphia families are being forced to make impossible choices between keeping the lights on and covering other basic needs. In the short term, many Philadelphians depend on support from programs such as the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). In the long term, economic incentives must encourage renewable investments, namely solar, to reduce grid dependency for residents most burdened by rising energy costs.

Philadelphia’s housing market presents both a challenge and an opportunity for solar adoption, since nearly half of Philadelphians rent their homes. As of 2014, the city’s average renter spends upwards of 42% of their monthly income on rent and utilities, a figure that has grown as energy rates have risen over the last decade. With limitations on property improvements, renters forgo investments that lower energy expenses. These constraints create cycles of “energy burden” where households spend an overwhelming share of income on utilities.

Solar can be a groundbreaking solution for mitigating energy burden, but it comes at an upfront investment cost. Amidst ongoing policy uncertainty and inconsistent federal support for renewables, short-term solutions like upgrading to more efficient appliances may be practical in the interim. Yet as electricity demand outpaces supply and utility rates soar, solar becomes increasingly attractive as the breakeven period for investment falls.

Pennsylvania’s heavy reliance on natural gas further pressures electricity price stability, while a recent pause in LIHEAP funding leaves low-income households facing impossible tradeoffs between heating and other essentials. Local utilities PECO and PGW have stepped in with limited assistance programs to prevent winter shutoffs. Nevertheless, relief programs only provide a temporary fix for the underlying energy inequity crisis.

Well-designed incentives could shift the trajectory. The EPA’s Solar for All program offered hope, allocating $156 million to expand solar access across Pennsylvania as part of a $7 billion national effort. However, the program was recently rescinded under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), a decision now facing legal backlash. Solar for All would transform energy affordability for 12,500 households across Pennsylvania, offering a lifeline as energy costs reach unprecedented levels.

Solar’s upfront cost barrier was temporarily mitigated when the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) renewed the federal solar income tax credit (ITC), offering a 30% tax reduction to offset installation costs. Now, the OBBBA revokes this benefit for systems installed after 2025.

Despite the abrupt ITC phaseout, two residential solar financing options remain through 2027. Similar in concept, leased solar and power purchase agreements (PPAs) present opportunities. With solar leases, homeowners pay a lower fixed monthly rate for system electricity use, whereas PPA customers only pay for energy produced, typically below the utility’s price per kilowatt-hour. Because systems are considered third-party owned under these financing methods, the solar contractor claims the 30% tax credit and both parties benefit when savings are passed to households through lower electric bills.

Consider the potential savings for a typical Philadelphia household. According to solar developer Palmetto Solar, installing a 5.74-kilowatt system for a small home (up to 2,000 square feet) costs approximately $16,644 before incentives. The net cost drops to $11,651 with the ITC, yielding a payback period of approximately 7.5 years. Over a 25-year period, a system of this size could offset nearly all electricity usage and generate savings of more than $50,000, illustrating the power of economic incentives for renewable investments.

In contrast, households that lease systems or enter PPAs avoid upfront costs entirely. The solar contractor retains ownership, claims the 30% ITC, and passes part of those savings to customers through reduced rates. While this model offers less long-term savings than ownership, it expands access for households unable to finance their own installations.

Still, solar remains largely inaccessible, particularly for low-income households facing the steepest energy burdens and non-homeowners with few viable clean energy options. If U.S. incentives resembled trends in Australia, a leader in per-capita solar adoption, barriers for marginalized groups would shrink considerably. Australia’s policies are pushing the expansion of solar access for multifamily buildings, apartment residents, landlords, and renters. Even though landlords seldom install solar, split-incentive agreements allow landlords to recover installation costs through slightly higher rents, while tenants benefit from lower electricity bills and potential net-metering credits. The result is a mutually beneficial pathway to cleaner, more affordable energy.

For homeowners able to bear upfront costs, solar comprises a strategic long-term investment. But for most Philadelphians, especially renters, sustained federal and state incentives are essential in maximizing renewable energy accessibility, reducing energy burden, and supporting Philadelphia’s transition to a more equitable energy system.",https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Philly-Solar-Photo-aspect-ratio-1280-225-1-1200x630-c-default.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 16:00:47.121551

On his first day in office, after declaring an “energy emergency,” Trump paused permitting for some wind projects and promised to boost fossil fuels. A few months later, the administration ordered an offshore wind project to stop construction; other stop-work orders followed.

In July, Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which phased out a longstanding tax credit for building clean energy projects. The EPA ended the Solar for All program, designed to bring solar power to low-income homes and reduce electric bills. After a memo from the Department of Interior that effectively paused permitting for wind and solar projects on public land, the DOI cancelled a massive solar project in Nevada that would have powered two million homes. The administration also pulled grants for R&D on new clean energy tech.

Some states and developers have fought back and won lawsuits, but the attacks keep coming. Revolution Wind, a large offshore wind farm that’s under construction off the coast of Rhode Island and nearly complete, was issued a stop-work order in August by the Trump administration; a preliminary injunction from a judge in September let the work continue, but a second stop-work order came again in December. This week, the developer got another preliminary injunction to continue construction.

Unsurprisingly, the policy uncertainty has hurt clean energy businesses. “We saw some smaller companies go under because financing became challenging,” says Sean Gallagher, senior vice president of policy at the Solar Energy Industries Association. Offshore wind developments are struggling to survive the administration’s repeated attacks.

By some estimates, as much as 117 gigawatts of solar and battery storage projects—enough to power nearly 100 million homes—are at risk of not coming online in the next couple of years because of new challenges in getting federal permits. But at the same time, many clean energy developers are fully booked with new projects.

The demand from data centers is “unabated,” says Jim Spencer, president and CEO of Exus Renewables North America. “As much as we can deliver, they’re buying it.” Last week, the company closed a $400 million credit facility to build out new solar and wind projects—$150 million more than it initially expected to get from banks.","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024/wp-cms-2/2026/01/p-1-91474000-us-clean-energy-boom.jpg",N,,2026-01-15 13:01:23.137275

The system went into service in August 2025 and represents the latest step in SIA’s multi-decade effort to reduce its carbon footprint while strengthening Indiana’s clean energy economy.

The solar installation produces more than three times the energy currently consumed by the expansion, meaning the solar installation generates a net surplus of clean power. That surplus is fed back into the company’s operations, creating both long-term energy cost containment and measurable carbon reduction benefits.

The project is expected to offset more than 250 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, the equivalent of supplying the electricity needs of 43 homes. Over its 30-year operating life, the system will deliver millions of kilowatt-hours of clean electricity, helping Subaru advance its corporate sustainability goals while reducing operating costs of the expansion at its Lafayette facility.

Building on a legacy of environmental leadership

SIA has long been recognized for its leadership in environmental practices. It was the first U.S. auto assembly plant to achieve zero-landfill status and has consistently invested in technologies that reduce waste, conserve natural resources and lower greenhouse gas emissions.

The new solar project builds on that legacy, demonstrating how one of Indiana’s largest manufacturers is using renewable energy as both a cost-containment strategy and a core component of its environmental vision.

The appetite for “AI + Power” platforms is enormous, but the risks are real: no revenue yet, decade-long construction cycles and thin project margins.","When Rick Perry’s Fermi America rang the Nasdaq bell, Wall Street didn’t just see another initial public offering. It saw a multi billion-dollar bet that the next energy revolution will be built not around cars or climate — but around computation.

Fermi’s pitch is simple but audacious: an 11-GW “Hyper-Power Campus” in Amarillo, Texas, combining nuclear, natural gas and solar to feed hyperscale data centers. It’s a case study in the new race for “AI-grade” megawatts: power that’s clean enough for investors, cheap enough for operators and available every hour of every day.

The project lands as the U.S. Department of Energy quietly scales back wind and solar grant programs, initiated by the Interior Secretary’s Order 3437, which was issued to end “preferential treatment” for wind and solar energy in decision-making. Following that, the DOE announced the termination of 223 renewables projects in “blue states” with subsequent legal action reported by the Environmental Defense Fund last month.

Clearly, the administration’s “energy dominance” mantra, once about drilling rigs and liquefied natural gas, has evolved into something broader: control over the power supply chain that fuels America’s digital backbone.

However, while recent project announcements show natural-gas resources are having their time in the sun, the long-term solution for satisfying AI’s power hunger isn’t gas alone. The physics and economics of data centers’ power needs — specifically, the 99.999% uptime that they require — requires a more inclusive approach. Ultimately a hybrid portfolio of gas + renewables + storage will prove the most successful approach.

The new demand curve

AI and data centers are rewriting the power script. Analysts estimate that U.S. data-center electricity demand could triple by 2030, rivaling Japan’s total consumption. In markets such as the Electric Reliability Council of Texas and the PJM Interconnection, interconnection requests are flooding the queue faster than transmission can be built.

The problem isn’t politics — it’s physics, as mentioned above. AI workloads don’t tolerate downtime, and 24/7 machine learning and training cycles demand firm capacity. Solar and wind are essential but intermittent; nuclear is dependable but slow to scale. That leaves one fuel enjoying a quiet renaissance: natural gas.

Gas isn’t glamorous, but it’s the reliable backbone of America’s AI build-out. Combined-cycle plants can ramp fast, integrate carbon capture and co-locate near industrial or digital hubs. The economics are persuasive — dispatchable, proven and abundant.

Developers are taking note. From Oklahoma to Ohio, mothballed projects are being revived, and hybrid plants pairing gas with solar and storage are becoming the “premium package” for hyperscale clients seeking reliability with a cleaner profile. It’s not the narrative climate activists prefer — but it’s the one investors trust.

Policy headwinds and market reality

DOE’s re-evaluation of renewable funding reflects a pivot from aspiration to execution. The obstacles aren’t ideological — they’re practical: transmission bottlenecks, permitting delays and mismatched incentives. Projects once hailed as flagships are now assessed through a harder lens of cost, timing and deliverability.

That recalibration doesn’t end the energy transition; it accelerates its next phase. The administration’s “energy dominance” now includes electrons. The companies that can deliver firm, scalable, low-carbon power to AI and cloud loads will define the next oligarchy — one built not on oilfields, but on interconnections and economics. Undoubtedly, solar energy and battery storage are some of the most rapidly scalable and cost competitive ways to meet the increased electricity demand. Given the need for clean firm power, scaling other energy technologies, such as next-generation geothermal, may also be leveraged to meet demand.

The DOE’s recent use of its Section 403 authority to direct the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission toward a rulemaking on large-load interconnections could reshape how America builds for the AI era. If successful, it would do for power demand what Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 once did for power supply: give independent developers a clear path to serve major users directly, without waiting for utility gatekeepers.

That single policy move could unlock a new generation of Fermis — merchant developers blending gas, renewables and storage into integrated, behind-the-meter systems that serve AI and industrial clients directly. It hints at an era of “IPP 2.0,” where private capital builds micro-grids at hyperscale.

For policymakers, the message is clear: America’s grid rules were written for predictable load growth. AI has changed the equation. The DOE–FERC initiative points toward a new architecture: faster interconnections, market access for large loads and private capital as the catalyst.

Capital meets concrete

Fermi’s initial public offering is the canary in the turbine hall. Investors no longer silo energy, infrastructure and technology — they see one ecosystem. The appetite for “AI + Power” platforms is enormous, but the risks are real: no revenue yet, decade-long construction cycles and thin project margins.

Still, private-equity and infrastructure funds are betting that whoever cracks the hybrid-power code will own the next-gen digital economy. Expect clusters of multi-fuel projects near major data-center hubs across Texas, Virginia and the Midwest — where policy flexibility meets physical necessity.

The AI boom has fused America’s energy and technology narratives into one. The next decade of “energy dominance” won’t be about exporting hydrocarbons — it will be about exporting compute, powered by reliable, low-carbon megawatts.

Natural gas may be having a moment, but the winning model will be hybrid: gas for firmness, renewables for optics and cost, and storage for stability.

Millions of workers construct, operate, and maintain the nation’s built environment systems and facilities, from roads to pipes to power plants and beyond. Simply keeping up with needed expansions and repairs is a tall task, and today, new technologies and climate impacts are heightening demands, including the need to train and hire a deep bench of talent. Research around defining, measuring, and addressing all these jobs has been widespread in recent years, giving policymakers and practitioners an opportunity to equip more workers with the needed education and training to pursue careers across the built environment. Doing so can lead to better outcomes for workers, employers, and the economy as a whole.

This report investigates this opportunity to expand skills development across a variety of built environment careers—those focused on constructing, operating, and maintaining transportation, energy, water, broadband, buildings, and other related assets. Specifically, the report explores ways in which leaders can overcome the fragmentation—by infrastructure sector, geography, and more— of occupations and industries in this space through a skills-first approach, or one that helps identify and elevate skills-first hiring and training. In addition to offering additional context on this opportunity, the report summarizes key takeaways from a series of interviews Brookings conducted with employers, training providers, community-based organizations, labor groups, and other workforce development leaders on how to promote skills development with greater flexibility and coordination, especially at the state and local level. It describes how:

Workforce development leaders need to think more comprehensively about “infrastructure skills,” not just “green skills.”

Workforce development leaders need to blend credentialing with work experience and continued career growth.

Skills development needs greater scalability across the built environment and across different geographies.

Both upskilling and reskilling are essential to meet current and future built environment demands.

Experimentation with place-based and project-based opportunities is essential to drive longer-term change.

Larger national policy and funding uncertainties around the built environment and workforce development at the moment have obscured the actions that leaders can take on these issues. But many workforce development leaders across the country continue to blaze a path forward, revealing collaborative and replicable models around skills development in the built environment space.

Introduction

The country’s built environment faces pressures on multiple fronts. From aging roads to leaking water pipes to surging energy demands, many infrastructure systems are in desperate need of repair and investment. Daily wear and tear is one factor, but extreme and more frequent climate impacts are compounding these needs; floods, fires, freezes, and more are disrupting or destroying systems across the country. Ongoing concerns around greenhouse gas emissions and overall sustainability are mounting too, including across buildings, manufacturing facilities, and a broad collection of other facilities.

Meanwhile, the country’s workforce also faces widespread needs. Layoffs, hiring freezes, and other uncertainties are gripping the labor market amid broader economic concerns. Many workers cannot flexibly and affordably gain needed skills and training to secure jobs, let alone launch or grow in long-term careers. Both less experienced and more experienced workers are running into these hurdles, with a continued need to earn higher wages, gain more benefits, and secure quality jobs and job pathways. Employers, to be sure, are actively looking to find and grow talent as well. And rapid change—not just technologically, but also in terms of climate needs—continues to uproot many workers, employers, and other leaders trying to seize greater economic opportunity.

Together, these dual infrastructure and workforce needs are significant, but they also present an opportunity: equipping workers with durable and transferable skills to address the country’s built environment needs while powering long-lasting, opportunity-rich career pathways.

Previous Brookings research on the infrastructure workforce has explored the multiple branching pathways available in this space, in addition to the more competitive and equitable wages across a vast array of infrastructure industries. Since so many of these positions are in the skilled trades—such as electricians and plumbers, among others—they also tend to require less formal postsecondary education and emphasize work-based learning opportunities such as internships and apprenticeships. Moreover, with a rising number of retirements and other turnover concerns, there is an urgent need to hire, train, and retain a generation of talent.

However, despite this infrastructure opportunity, policymakers and practitioners—including workforce development leaders—face stiff headwinds to actually unlock it. Long-standing gaps in defining, measuring, and communicating this opportunity remain prevalent. Inflexible and traditional hiring and training practices, including an emphasis on certain degrees or other credentials, can prevent new talent from entering these jobs. And despite the passage of historic federal funding in recent years, including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), many state and local leaders have not always implemented (or rethought how to use) this money to support workforce development. Meanwhile, the current federal policy environment has led to huge ongoing questions for capacity-constrained state and local leaders.

This report aims to identify, contextualize, and address the need for ongoing skills development across the built environment amid the current policy backdrop. It focuses on a skills-first approach to a broad variety of careers in this space, expanding beyond prevailing analyses and efforts around “green jobs.” Rather than defining or analyzing a specific set of jobs in isolation, the report explores local policy and programmatic levers that can strengthen hiring and training pathways for more workers in more places.

The report first examines why skills development across the built environment matters. It then discusses the types of skills and credentials (e.g., educational degrees, licenses, certifications) needed, as well as the different actors involved. Based on a series of interviews with state and local workforce development leaders, the report concludes by offering ways to support skills development over time and demonstrating the strong economic benefit for workers and employers across the U.S.

Why skills development matters across the built environment

Equipping workers with the essential education and training to address the country’s built environment needs is no easy task. The wide variety of humanmade and natural infrastructure systems in need of oversight—from transportation and energy facilities to rivers, forests, and other related green infrastructure assets—means that there are an enormous range of activities involved and workers required. Constructing, operating, maintaining, and governing these systems depend on laborers, technicians, electricians, and other trades workers, for instance, as well as financial analysts, human resources specialists, and other administrative and managerial workers. There is no single job or skillset that stands out in this space.

Increasing climate impacts and the transition to a cleaner and more resilient economy—or a “green economy”—have come to dominate much of the skills conversation across the built environment. Upgrading homes, installing electric vehicle charging stations, and improving transmission lines are among the various projects that workers may carry out. In turn, the real-time and projected importance of “green jobs”—broadly defined as jobs that carry out activities with an environmental benefit—has attracted interest and investment among policymakers and practitioners, including federal leaders, state and local governments, and other public and private actors (e.g., financial firms).

However, the broad scope of workers involved in activities that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, adapt to climate impacts, and preserve or restore natural resources leads to inconsistent definitions, measurement challenges, and practical limitations on managing and prioritizing certain workforce development efforts. For instance, researchers have often emphasized clean energy workforce needs, including past Brookings research, Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys, and the Department of Energy’s annual Energy and Employment Report, which estimates there are more than 8 million energy jobs nationally, including 2.3 million in energy efficiency alone. But shifts to clean energy only capture a share of all the built environment assets, activities, and workers in transition.

Seizing a broader built environment opportunity means looking beyond narrow or inconsistent categories of green jobs. The problem with classifying and counting green jobs is that outside of a few occupations (e.g., solar installers, wind turbine technicians), few workers fit clearly into a “green” or “non-green” category. As technologies, designs, and the nature of work keep changing across the country’s built environment, there is a wide spectrum of jobs impacted by the green transition. For example, while not all HVAC technicians may focus on installing energy-efficient heat pumps and other green activities, some increasingly do so; the same could be said for electricians involved in installing wiring for solar panels, auto workers manufacturing electric vehicles, and so on. The evolving nature of jobs—not just the appearance or disappearance of jobs—reflects the reality that workers, employers, training providers, and other leaders must navigate in real time, and over time.

That is why more researchers, policymakers, and practitioners are emphasizing skills across the built environment, including “green skills” —the knowledge and abilities to carry out tasks as part of a job that brings an environmental benefit. Similar to green jobs, no singular definition exists for green skills, although a growing body of literature and policy guidance has come out from international organizations such as the United Nations and World Bank, federal agencies such as the Department of Labor, groups such as Burning Glass Institute and Jobs For the Future, and a variety of local-serving associations such as C40 and the Local Initiatives Support Corporation.

Among these and many other institutions, a few consistent points around green skills stand out. First, green skills include a variety of technical and specialized skills—including science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields, for instance—but also a variety of soft skills, including communication and management. Second, they involve varying degrees of integration, with some jobs adding them to existing knowledge and abilities and other jobs potentially changing more significantly over time. Lastly, they likely coincide with other digital transformations, including around artificial intelligence, data analytics, and other functions.

The uncertainties around what exact skills will become more prevalent—including when, where, and for whom—mean that related education and training efforts need to be adaptable in this changing environment too. Different projections and surveys are attempting to estimate the pace, location, and penetration of new types of skills across the labor market, but many workers, employers, training providers, and other actors are simply responding in real time to the best of their abilities. Educational institutions may adopt new curricula, employers may adopt new on-the-job trainings, and local governments may draft new workforce plans—but they do not always do so in close coordination. Ensuring there is an economically and socially equitable transition remains an ongoing exercise in many places, and the lack of proactive and intentional policies and programs may cap potential economic opportunities.

While workforce development leaders do not have a crystal ball to perfectly predict what jobs or skills will be needed over time, they can prepare a larger talent pool for a variety of roles across the built environment, ideally equipping them with flexible and interchangeable knowledge, abilities, and experience. That includes a focus on equipping workers with relevant “green credentials,” which span educational degrees, licenses, certifications, and other signals of knowledge and experience across the built environment. But it’s not about the paper or credential itself. Skills-first hiring (or skill-based hiring)—recruiting workers based on their skills and competences, not just their educational degree—is becoming increasingly important to reduce barriers for workers and employers alike. Ensuring workers have greater portability in the education and training they receive is critical amid the rapid, widespread changes unfolding across the built environment and labor market.

Expanding skills development and identifying the actors involved

Expanding skills development across the built environment involves promoting transferable and portable sets of skills and credentials.

On the skills front, built environment workers rely on a combination of technical and other foundational knowledge that includes familiarity and experience with plumbing, electrical work, and operating heavy machinery, for instance, but also communications, public safety, and security. As past Brookings research has explored, a wide range of occupations such as civil engineers, electricians, and pile-driver operators emphasize these types of skills—not just solar installers, wind turbine technicians, or other green-focused workers. STEM skills, again, are crucial for many of these workers, including those in the trades who tend to gain greater knowledge and competency with certain engineering concepts, mathematical principles, and tools and technologies (e.g., geographic information systems, computer-aided design software) through on-the-job training.

Credentials—green or otherwise—can serve as enablers (and barriers) to workers applying for jobs and growing their careers; they can be industry- and occupation-specific, geographically specific, and field-specific (in the case of STEM fields, for instance). Given the wide range of careers across the built environment, credentials vary from place to place and position to position; there is no centralized repository of all the potential education and training needed. Some credentials are widely recognized by employers, some take years and are very expensive for workers, and some take less time and are easier to access and benefit from. At the same time, the proliferation of non-degree credentials (e.g., specialized or short-term certificates) has led to an education and training marketplace that can be crowded and chaotic, with real questions about quality and whether employers recognize them.

Despite this fragmentation, some commonalities exist. Secondary and postsecondary education degrees (e.g., associate degrees, bachelor’s degrees) can involve coursework and curricula focused on architecture, design, engineering, and other content areas geared toward boosting built environment knowledge and familiarity. Examples are numerous, from community college programs in Oregon and Illinois on renewable energy management to undergraduate and graduate programs in Michigan and New York on sustainability and environmental policy. State-issued licenses for several climate-related occupations—from water treatment operators to environmental engineers—are also common and demonstrate a worker’s aptitude to pass an exam, gain needed work experience, and maintain their status. Professional, industry, and association certifications are frequently recognized across many positions as well, including building professionals with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification, as well as broader positions such as certified construction managers (CCMs) and certified HVAC workers involved in air conditioning repair and installation. Completion of work-based learning opportunities, including registered apprenticeship programs, can signal valued competencies and experience to employers, such as the Building Trades’ Multi-Craft Core Curriculum (MC3) and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers’ (IBEW) programs. Shorter-term, competency-based credentials—including online badges and other micro-credentials for individual classes, for instance—can also support continued learning and skills development.

Beyond considering the specific skills gained and credentials earned, though, it’s perhaps even more important to examine and evaluate how a variety of workforce development leaders need to be involved. Expanding skills development will require more proactive planning and coordination across multiple occupations, industries, and geographies supporting the built environment, led by:

Training providers, including secondary and postsecondary educational institutions, do not have consistent built environment or “green” curricula per se, and when they do offer related coursework, it can often be geared toward a specific occupation, field, or specialty in an individual region. This unique curriculum—versus a consistent curriculum—can limit the ability of students and prospective workers to earn and use flexible credentials as they ultimately move, change fields, and grow their careers. At a more practical level, a lack of qualified instructors, needed tools and equipment, and the cost and availability of some programs can also limit early exposure and education in the skilled trades.

Employers, especially those across the built environment, typically operate in isolation, cling to business-as-usual hiring and training practices, and focus on project development versus workforce development. For instance, many transportation departments, water utilities, and engineering and construction contractors rely on prevailing HR processes (e.g., rigid degree requirements) and word-of-mouth to bring on new hires and compete against each other to secure scarce talent. They also do not have the bandwidth (financially or otherwise) to actively engage with communities, and may not always coordinate with other training providers—even though doing so could help them more reliably and cost-effectively prepare workers. These shortfalls can limit the potential for expanded on-the-job training, career growth, and other critical learning opportunities for workers—to say nothing of the benefits that these employers can gain from having a bigger, more dependable pipeline of talent for their projects over time.

State and local government leaders, including workforce development boards, labor departments, and infrastructure-related agencies (e.g., housing and environmental agencies) face a variety of planning and programmatic needs to accelerate skills development across the built environment. Chief among them is a continued lack of technical, financial, and managerial capacity to expand (or even experiment with) new workforce development strategies—a constraint that is becoming more pronounced amid the pullback in federal workforce, climate, and infrastructure funding. State and local bodies, such as state energy offices, also remain chronically understaffed. But even in places that have more resources, there are still prevailing challenges around crafting comprehensive green workforce plans, implementing those plans, and measuring and evaluating outcomes as part of a larger, more cohesive workforce development ecosystem. In addition, it is crucial to note the role of state and local political leadership—as well as regulatory bodies—to address prevailing workforce development needs, requirements, and other priorities.

Community-based organizations, typically including local-serving nonprofit groups that provide various forms of assistance and support, act as vital conduits to expose, prepare, and help workers pursue careers across the built environment. But these organizations also face many constraints. Lower-income, disadvantaged workers benefit from the supportive (and wraparound) services that these organizations can provide, including child care and transportation, but resource limitations remain a constant amid escalating demands. Reaching workers in need can be time- and resource-intensive, and measuring and assessing the outcomes of workers remain ongoing needs in data collection, analysis, and programmatic oversight.

Labor groups, unions, and other worker advocacy organizations are crucial partners in educating and training workers across the built environment, in addition to advancing workers’ rights and improving workplace conditions. But these groups can encounter challenges diversifying their ranks and consistently promoting a more inclusive workplace, especially for women and people of color in some industries and occupations. Rethinking existing training approaches and worker representation is also an emerging concern as new technologies and the nature of work change rapidly across the country. Continued tensions—real or perceived—with some employers and among some workers also remain a challenge for these groups.

In this way, the point of expanding skills across the built environment is less about the single piece of paper (or digital badge) a worker may receive, and more about the flexible set of education and training pathways they can pursue and benefit from as they look to enter and grow their careers. Yet the fragmented set of workforce development actors across the built environment means there is no clear owner of all these pathways (and subsequent hiring processes and long-term career growth)—demanding more proactive planning and programmatic coordination.

Improving and coordinating skills development across the built environment

To get a better sense of how workforce development leaders can forge stronger, more coordinated education and training pathways, the Brookings team interviewed a cross-section of leaders involved in the built environment across the country. These interviews emphasized the perspectives of leaders at the state and local level—including training providers, employers, government agencies, community-based organizations, and labor groups—with the aim to gain actionable insights around: 1) a priority set of skills; and 2) a promising collection of education and training programs that can accelerate the development of these skills and may be potentially scalable across regions.

Not surprisingly, no single credential, skill, or programmatic solution emerged during these interviews, but they shed light on how and where promising education and training efforts have emerged, with an eye toward both real-time and longer-term workforce needs. Common ingredients in these efforts included a need to emphasize a broad suite of built environment priorities, improved coordination with employers (and industry more generally), and continued experimentation across different places and project types. Five key takeaways are summarized below:

Workforce development leaders need to think more comprehensively about ‘infrastructure skills,’ not just ‘green skills’

While many leaders recognized the urgency of climate impacts and the unknowns emerging in the green transition, they also voiced distrust and skepticism in the overemphasis on green jobs, green skills, and green credentials. The “green” tag associated with different education and training pathways can be polarizing at times, politically and otherwise. While some positions undeniably require specific types of climate-related knowledge and experience (e.g., solar installers), a “whole building” approach would likely make more sense for more workers, especially at the beginning of their careers—that is, having a broader emphasis on construction, engineering, and other fields commonly found across the built environment. To several leaders we interviewed, the green credentials that workers pursue are only “green” in as much as the specific projects they may ultimately oversee also happen to be green (e.g., clean energy upgrades).

Instead, acknowledging—and pursuing—a cross-sectoral approach (e.g., for transportation, energy, water, and so on) could allow for greater transferability in education and training across multiple built environment industries and occupations. Leaders noted how these could include cross-cutting “infrastructure skills,” which emphasize STEM-related knowledge and familiarity with certain tools and technologies, as noted earlier. Multiple career pathways are available to workers in this space, and leaders need to foster different tiers of skills—from basic employability skills needed to launch a career (as evident in YouthBuild and Job Corps programs, for instance) to more specialized skills and associated credentials over time. One occupational example that leaders cited for the latter is Environmental Protection Agency Section 608 certification, in which HVAC technicians can demonstrate their additional knowledge and experience as their careers evolve.

Notable place-based examples include the DC Infrastructure Academy and Austin Infrastructure Academy, which leaders said demonstrate the types of sector strategies and broader skills development needed across the built environment. Both examples integrate education and training opportunities at a regional scale by serving as a single destination where employers, educators, community-based organizations, and other actors can coordinate on community engagement, work-based learning, and more. These academies have linked together training with immediate and long-term hiring priorities, while also pooling available funding and providing supportive services.

Workforce development leaders need to blend credentialing with work experience and continued career growth

Leaders we interviewed described how credentials alone should matter less than ensuring workers demonstrate the necessary skills to do the job. Employers, in particular, stood out as a key actors in this respect, in which enhancing work-based learning opportunities should be a major priority given the emphasis on trades positions across the built environment. Apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeships were common examples, but leaders stressed how employers also need to more generally assume a more proactive role of “blending” credentialing with work experience and other factors. Process-wide improvements in the pre-hiring process were raised, including “customized, job-specific training services” evident in efforts such as the Virginia Talent Accelerator Program, among other state- and local-led initiatives. Beyond credentialing, leaders emphasized how training process changes are essential.

Several employers, of course, have already implemented such changes, offering precedent for broader, industry-wide adoption. Buy-in from leadership, amplifying a clear mission, willingness to consider changes in the hiring process, and investing in staff (especially around community engagement) were among the changes described, especially among contractors in the construction industry. The splintering of roles and responsibilities across the built environment, including for different projects in different geographies, means that contractors vary widely in their emphasis on (and capacity around) skills development—which is why having a clearer, industry-wide policy framework is essential to guide action. The Green Workforce Connect program represents a prominent example of how employers, community-based organizations, training providers, and other leaders have been able to create a common platform of collaboration. The availability of open source curricula and other employer best practices via the Center for Energy Workforce Development (CEWD) has also helped. Leaders noted how different carrots and sticks—such as project labor agreements and building code changes—have the potential to shift employer action, but they also noted how compliance-driven efforts can be off-putting and confusing for employers.

Skills development needs greater scalability across the built environment—and across different geographies

Leaders we interviewed repeatedly stressed numerous challenges in skills development given the fragmentation across the built environment. Transportation departments, water utilities, energy agencies, engineering and construction firms, and other employers do not usually plan projects together, develop coordinated budgets for training, or address other shared hiring needs over time as a larger, unified sector. Meanwhile, educational degrees and licenses can be highly localized—not only because of state-specific regulations, but also because of occupational nuances and particular employer demands. Data on training needs, hiring challenges, and worker outcomes can vary widely from place to place—or be missing entirely in certain built environment fields. Beyond formal credentials, skills-first hiring is an area of ongoing need for workers, employers, and other actors when it comes to validating skills, coordinating across different industries, and relying on legacy screening and hiring processes.

However, having greater scalability and portability to skills (not just credentials) can help overcome some of these challenges. For example, leaders pointed to the need for more industry-driven and standardized curricula in educational institutions, as accreditation bodies such as the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC) have done for more than 200 clean energy training programs nationally. Creating more objective and reliable measures around skills-based hiring can also help by clarifying the benefits of this hiring model and creating clearer policy frameworks, which states such as Massachusetts and Washington have done. Standardized data dashboards on different climate projects and economic impacts can establish more quantifiable and outcome-driven measures, which organizations such as the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) does through its state energy-efficiency scorecards.

Both upskilling and re-skilling are essential to meet current and future built environment demands

Supporting the short- and long-term mobility of workers across the built environment requires meeting workers where they are currently and want to be ultimately—not just leveraging their skills or credentials for a particular position or project. Doing so can also more assuredly help employers—including many infrastructure owners and operators—address ongoing maintenance and capital needs. That means developing a workforce, not just leveraging it, as leaders described in the interviews. Incentivizing employers (financially) to prioritize ongoing workforce development is one possible path to do so—as attempted in the rollout of IIJA and IRA funding—but these efforts need to extend well beyond this policy window.

In particular, leaders emphasized a combination of upskilling and re-skilling for less experienced and more experienced workers alike, including providing necessary supportive services for continued learning and transitions. Engaging with students and disconnected youth requires greater (and more frequent) visibility and exposure to skilled trades careers in particular, via pre-apprenticeships, apprenticeships, and other service- and workforce-based learning opportunities. For example, training resources from the Center for Energy Workforce Development (CEWD) has helped boost employer engagement on these issues, as has coaching and technical assistance efforts from organizations such as UnidosUS. Similarly, it is important to reach workers further in their careers who might be unemployed, underemployed, or simply looking to move into a different field. Organizations such as JobsFirstNYC, for instance, have spearheaded regional collaborations around green workforce development, aimed at expanding access for different workers and cultivating longer-term pathways for career growth.

Experimentation with place-based and project-based opportunities is essential to drive longer-term change

Adjusting how workers, employers, and other actors view credentials—and their approach to training—is a tall task across multiple industries and geographies. However, leaders described the importance of more frequent experimentation—grounded in particular places and projects—to build greater momentum and offer a clearer demonstration of how skills development could occur more seamlessly across the built environment. There needs to be an intentional focus on skills development, not just a coincidental focus. They described the co-determination that needs to occur between policymakers and practitioners at the state and local level to better gauge labor supply and demand, encourage engagement among employers and training providers, and integrate learning with project development and execution.

Examples abound across the country on how such intentional and proactive approaches have emerged in this space. At the state level, for instance, the Texas Climate Jobs Project represents a coalition of unions launched in 2021, and has partnered with different actors in different places to intentionally center worker access and training, from building decarbonization to larger energy projects focused on methane reduction. Policymakers in Maine have also launched ambitious, targeted efforts around efficient heat pump installation, combined with active engagement with the state’s community college system to train hundreds of new technicians. At a more local level, infrastructure investments from the IIJA and IRA coupled with technological shifts toward AI have also propelled new collaborations: an urban forestry accelerator in Phoenix, advanced manufacturing training centers in Reno, Nev., weatherization development programs in Minneapolis, and green infrastructure training efforts in Atlanta. The wide variety of examples emerging nationally shows the continued appetite to test new ideas and approaches, even amid other policy and economic uncertainties.

Despite funding and policy shifts, there remains a need for skilled talent across the built environment

Whether filling jobs or boosting skills, the demand for talent across the built environment is clear. Employers, training providers, and other leaders continue to voice their need for a durable and dependable pipeline of talent to address project needs across a host of different systems and facilities. The magnitude of this need—including the wide range of activities being carried out, the skills required, and the geographies represented—means that larger, system-wide approaches are essential to drive change. Fluctuations in funding and other policy shifts—especially around greener upgrades—have called into question some prevailing projects and workforce development efforts, but they have not fundamentally altered the underlying calculus: The country’s built environment requires a steady stream of skilled workers to predictably and reliably execute on needed improvements.

Fortunately, several models (and examples) have emerged in recent years, highlighting actionable steps that many state and local leaders have been able to pursue. Collaborative and scalable programs centered around work-based learning have taken hold; more flexible and accessible credentialing opportunities have appeared; and more consistent and outcomes-oriented data around skills development have helped guide action. These and other efforts continue to build the case—and demonstrate proof—of how careers across the built environment offer pathways to greater economic opportunity over time, cultivated by intentional planning, programmatic coordination, and ongoing experimentation.",https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/welder-welding-steel-roof-truss.jpg?quality=75,N,,2026-01-15 13:01:19.247471

The vans were great, but failed to perform as desired in the market. Though designed for commercial operators, the RV industry discovered the BrightDrop platform was also a perfect platform for an electric motorhome. One of the big players in the RV space, Coachmen, announced one of the most innovative motorhomes to come out of an Indiana company in years, based on the BrightDrop. The RVEX was the first all-electric motorhome from one of the big companies, and now it’s gone without a replacement.

My time at the 2026 Florida RV SuperShow has come to an end. I have tons of stories to write for you in the coming days, but I won’t get to write a particular story that I was extremely excited about. I wasn’t invited to see the RVEX when it made its debut at the Indiana RV Dealer Open House last year, so I was looking forward to seeing the RVEX in person here in Tampa. But after walking the entire Tampa site perhaps three times, the RVEX remained elusive. In fact, it wasn’t there at all.

The reason is sad. Coachmen has decided to pull the plug on the RVEX project, at least for now. But, more than that, Coachmen is taking the entire project, and even the RVEX prototype itself, out of the spotlight. The public won’t get to see Coachmen’s vision for the future. Hence, the unit didn’t make it here to Tampa. That’s how hard it failed. Perhaps even wilder is just how quickly it all happened.

The BrightDrop Was The RV Industry’s Best Bet

Coachmen announced the RVEX on September 22, 2025. At the time, I wrote a piece titled “A Big RV Company Just Announced An Awesome All-Electric Camper Van That’s Almost Affordable” accompanied by the topshot above. The RVEX was a huge deal. Before September, the only company that was slinging BrightDrop-based vans was startup Grounded RVs, which also built BrightDrop-based camper vans for RV rental company RollAway. Coachmen is not a startup company, but one of the household names of RV mega-conglomerate Forest River. The RVEX signaled the big RV industry’s official entry into the all-electric motorhome space.

The motorhome was a pretty nice unit, too, with a fully featured interior that looked well-appointed and well-made for something from a big RV brand. It also had a few trick features, like a glass rear door that turned into a projector screen for campsite movies. Coachmen did an admirable job at hiding the RVEX’s work van origins!

Coachmen also planned to sell it for $150,000, which would have made it cheaper than a Grounded and lower priced than much of the gas-powered competition, which was amazing.

Why the BrightDrop mattered has to do with how the RV industry works. The RV manufacturers are usually secondary builders. They construct bodies on top of someone else’s chassis or van. Unfortunately, this means that the RV industry has been slow to electrify. If their chassis suppliers don’t have a compatible electrified platform, then the industry is stuck with what it has.

For years, this has meant that whenever someone wanted an all-electric camper van, they had to build an RV out of something like a Ford E-Transit or a Mercedes-Benz eSprinter, or convert a gas van to electric. Unfortunately, as the big firms like Winnebago found out through market research and talking to their customers, American RV buyers aren’t really interested in a camper van that goes only a touch over 100 miles before needing a charge, and they weren’t jazzed about a 200-mile van, either.

This is where the Chevrolet BrightDrop Zevo 600 came in. The 24-foot-long van sported Chevy’s Max Range 172 kWh 20-module battery, which enabled 270 miles of range. It also had AWD, 300 horsepower, and 390 lb-ft of torque. I won’t say that the BrightDrop was perfect. At the end of the day, the RVs that were built on it were awkward because the BrightDrop was designed to be a delivery van. However, the BrightDrop was the platform that came the closest to offering RV buyers the traditional motorhome experience, only fully electric. I genuinely thought that the BrightDrop was one of the coolest electrified things for the RV industry in years, and was waiting to see how companies would really go crazy with it.

Dead In Less Than A Month

Then, a day short of a month after Coachmen made its announcement, General Motors pulled the plug. The BrightDrop was dead. Grounded RVs, the company that was the first to the market with a BrightDrop motorhome, responded quickly. Here’s what Sam Shapiro, founder of Grounded RVs, said:

“No one in the world tried as hard as we did to build on all-electric vans. But at the end of the day what differentiates Grounded is everything above the chassis: our design, materials, technology, and integrated fleet management software. We’ve built on fully-electric and hybrid platforms like Ford, GM, and Harbinger, and now, with Grounded Gas, which we’ve long considered, we’re looking to a truly platform-agnostic future. Our stock of available Brightdrops is strong at the moment, but expansion to gas vehicles will move the business forward and allow Grounded to continue to lead toward an electrified and hybrid future.”

The sad thing is that Grounded RVs was started as an all-electric RV company, but I get this decision. The company first started building motorhomes using the Ford E-Transit before moving to the BrightDrop. Now, only a few years later, the company has to change platforms again.

At first, the expectation was that these companies would continue to build BrightDrop motorhomes until the stock of already-built BrightDrops dries up. That’s what Grounded plans to do. As RV News reported in October, that was an option that was actively being considered by Coachmen. While GM might have killed the BrightDrop, Coachmen figured that there were enough of them just sitting around that the company could build all-electric motorhomes for a year or two.

Then, Coachmen sort of went quiet, and the fate of the RVEX was unknown. That was until last week, when, in the run-up to the Florida show, Coachmen finally made a decision about the RVEX. As RV News reports, Coachmen will not be building the RVEX for a year or two. Instead, the whole project is shelved for 2026 and possibly beyond. How sad is it? Read this from RV News:

[Coachmen General Manager Zach] Eppers said dealers placed orders, and Coachmen was set to begin production in 2026 before GM discontinued manufacturing. Eppers said he is hopeful a similar chassis will be available in the future.

“The people who committed to us, both dealers and consumers, are still excited about RVEX,” Eppers said, “and we are still very interested in continuing this project. We just have not been able to find a chassis that offers those important features at a similar price point. If we cannot bring the range, cargo capacity and price together in a vehicle, then there is not as much excitement for it.”

Eppers said Coachmen has not given up on the concept. Some RVEX technologies and concepts will find their way into a new RV that Eppers said will be introduced in the fall. Coachmen team members who had worked on RVEX will move on to that and other Forest River projects.

At this time, Coachmen does not believe that there is a viable replacement for the BrightDrop, an opinion apparently also shared by Grounded. It’s not that other electric vans don’t exist; it’s just that none have quite the same space and capability as the BrightDrop does. So, the party is over just as it began. Apparently, Coachmen never got the chance to even make more than just the single RVEX prototype, and it has no idea what to do with the prototype. Maybe it’ll be sold to the public as a one-off or kept around Indiana for R&D use.

Some Good News

The good news is that the dream of an electrified RV from a big name isn’t dead, thanks to Thor Industries. The Entegra Embark motorhome (above) is not purely electric, and instead is a range-extended EV. I also got to tour it and think it’s the most innovative motorhome the big industry has built in decades. Don’t worry, I’ll write that story soon.

Still, if you’re someone who prefers all-electric over even EREVs, this sucks. It feels like the RV industry had a leap forward, just to get the rug pulled from under it. It’s even more depressing that the plan seems to be to wait and see if someone can build something like the BrightDrop again. All of this means that while millions of electric cars are multiplying all over the world, the American RV industry will still be behind. Well, hopefully it will work out next time.

Trenton, NJ — Workers from across New Jersey gathered in Trenton today to announce the formation of Climate Jobs New Jersey, a coalition of unions united to power New Jersey’s clean energy economy with union jobs and tackle the energy affordability crisis with a plan that works for every working family.

At the press conference, speakers unveiled the coalition’s priorities heading into the 2026 state legislative session. These include:

Launch a statewide solar and storage program to quickly deploy vast amounts of rooftop solar and battery storage so New Jersey can meet rising energy demand with in-state resources and do so in a way that creates new union jobs.

Take back control of our energy system by putting the state in charge of planning and purchasing energy, allowing New Jersey to actually plan for our energy needs by spurring in-state clean energy generation, and guaranteeing that workers benefit from every new project.

At the press conference, Cornell University’s Climate Jobs Institute unveiled a new report that offers a long-term roadmap and science-backed recommendations developed with input from New Jersey unions aimed at building a clean energy economy, creating good union jobs, advancing affordability and equity, and tackling the climate crisis.

“New Jersey has a long history of building and innovating, but when it comes to building our own energy, we have lost our way. We import far too much of our energy from out of state, which exacerbates high prices and sends jobs in the energy industry away. With this new agenda from Climate Jobs New Jersey, we can take control of our energy future and get back to building our own energy. This will create local union jobs, bring economic growth to our communities, and give us the clean energy we need to meet rising energy demands and confront the climate crisis,” said Charles Wowkanech, President of New Jersey AFL-CIO and President of Climate Jobs New Jersey.

“As demand for energy continues to grow, New Jersey faces some critical supply and demand challenges that won’t improve by ignoring them,” said LIUNA Vice President and Regional Manager and Climate Jobs New Jersey Secretary Michael Hellstrom. “Without smart and decisive action, our energy problems will only get worse. Climate Jobs New Jersey is an organization comprised of union trades workers who understand energy markets and infrastructure because they are the skilled, safe, and productive workforce who actually builds that energy infrastructure. We are interested in pursuing smart, practical, and science-backed solutions that benefit our residents and businesses by generating more clean, reliable, and affordable energy--in New Jersey and for New Jersey--while also creating good, family sustaining, middle class jobs.”

“When union labor leads, everyone succeeds. If New Jersey is serious about lowering energy bills and meeting skyrocketing demand, we must start building energy here, and we must start now,” said Greg Lalavee, Business Manager of Operating Engineers Local 825. “Through Climate Jobs New Jersey, we are laying out a simple plan: build energy here, store it here, and put New Jersey back in charge of its own energy future.”

“Thousands of IUPAT District Council 21 members are ready to get to work and build the facilities that create home-grown energy for families across the state,” said IUPAT District Council 21 Business Manager/Secretary-Treasurer Bernie Snyder. “Our members have the training and skills to build this necessary infrastructure safely and efficiently.""

“Members of the IUPAT have been on the forefront of green energy work all over the country, and are ready to get to work in New Jersey. Homegrown energy will be a boon to working families in the state, including our members,” said Paul Canning, General Vice President (Eastern Region) of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades.

“Our members are investing countless hours in clean energy training because we know this industry’s future is strong,” said Anthony Abrantes, Assistant Executive Secretary-Treasurer for the Eastern Atlantic States Regional Council of Carpenters. “Through state-of-the-art union training programs, we are building a clean energy economy that delivers more than temporary jobs—it creates lifelong, family-sustaining union careers. Now New Jersey must step up, invest in clean energy built here at home, and put union workers to work building our shared future.”

“Electricity bills are rising faster in New Jersey than just about anywhere else in the country. Much of our energy comes from out of state, which sends job opportunities away and leaves us tied to volatile prices. We need to take back our destiny and set New Jersey on a path to a secure and affordable clean energy future–and do it in a way that’s good for every working family,” said Shaun Sullivan, President of the New Jersey Pipe Trades and Business Manager of UA Local 475. “The men and women of the New Jersey Pipe Trades are fully trained and eager for opportunities to help produce clean energy for the state, and are proud to be part of this new coalition.”

“New Jersey's union workers have been building and maintaining energy infrastructure for generations. We are the best-equipped workforce to get clean energy built right, so that it benefits the economies and health of all New Jersey communities,” said Joe Checkley, President & Business Manager of IBEW Local 94. “Climate Jobs New Jersey is bringing together working people who know how to get the job done. Together, we can build a reliable clean energy industry that brings down costs for consumers and generates good union jobs.”

“With labor at the helm, we can build the clean energy and infrastructure the climate crisis demands while lowering energy costs and creating high-quality, family-sustaining careers. A cleaner, more resilient future will generate thousands of good jobs—and we must ensure they come with strong wages and benefits for New Jerseyans. This is what real climate action looks like for working people,” said Ana Maria Hill, Vice President and New Jersey State Director of 32BJ SEIU. “32BJ members see the climate crisis firsthand, which is why we’re helping building service workers cut energy use and create cleaner, healthier buildings.”

“The Climate Jobs Institute at Cornell University's ILR School was proud to work with and learn from New Jersey’s labor unions. Together, we have developed a bold, multi-sectoral, and science-backed plan to tackle the dual crises of climate change and inequality while creating high-quality union jobs and driving affordability for New Jersey residents in the face of historic energy price increases,” said Lara Skinner, Founding Executive Director of Cornell University’s Climate Jobs Institute. “Building a reliable, affordable, and abundant clean energy future for New Jersey will require massive investments in clean energy and infrastructure upgrades across the state. All of these investments have the potential to generate significant numbers of high-quality, family-sustaining, local union careers.”

In the U.S., electricity production is growing far faster than in most western peers, which is allowing utilities to deliver more power to the fast-growing and energy-intensive data centers and AI applications that are key drivers of the U.S. economy.

Overseas, the U.S. is set to cement its position as the largest and most influential exporter of crude oil and natural gas, which continue to underpin a vast majority of global energy systems and generate massive earnings for the U.S. Treasury.

The robust state of the U.S. energy sector makes good on U.S. President Donald Trump's ""energy dominance"" push, which looks set to gather even more momentum this year as further supportive energy policy measures are rolled out.

Below are the main metrics on electricity generation and fossil fuel production and exports to help track the state of the U.S. energy sector through 2026 and beyond.

Electric growth. Total U.S. electricity generation by utilities climbed by 3% in 2025 from the year before, which marks the second straight year that wholesale electricity output posted a 3% or better rise, data from Ember showed.

(click image to enlarge)

That electricity supply growth rate compares to an annual average of 0.3% during the previous five years, and so clearly reveals that utilities have stepped up generation efforts.

The lift in total utility generation resulted from a 5% annual increase in electricity output from clean power supplies, and a 1% rise in output from fossil fuel power plants.

The United States' 3% expansion rate in total utility supplies compares with just a 0.2% rise last year in total utility electricity generation in Europe, which remains gripped by an economic slowdown due in part to stubbornly high energy costs.

The U.S. growth rate matches the global average in 2025, but lags the 5% rise in utility electricity output posted by China.

In 2026, U.S. utilities are expected to lift electricity generation to new heights, thanks mainly to scheduled additions to solar and battery networks as well as the planned restart of the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan.

However, scrapped federal support for renewable energy projects will slow the pace of new solar and wind capacity additions and may drag on the electricity output growth rate over the medium term.

Oil, gas and coal. While clean power sources gained a record share of the U.S. electricity mix in 2025, fossil fuels remain the primary pillar of the U.S. energy system and account for around 83% of total U.S. energy supplies, according to the Energy Institute.

Record production of both crude oil and natural gas in 2025 has helped fossil fuels maintain that heavy share of the energy supply mix.

U.S. crude oil output averaged 13.6 MMbpd in 2025, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), while dry natural gas production averaged 107.4 Bft3d.

The output of coal also increased in 2025 - by around 5% from the year before - but total U.S. coal production remains well below the levels of a decade ago due to reduced use in the domestic power generation system.

Natural gas remains the primary power fuel in the U.S., and accounts for around 40% of electricity production and is also a major power and heating source for industry.

Rising natural gas prices - driven by rising power use as well as record demand from LNG exporters - are expected to lift extraction rates from gas wells in 2026, especially in low-cost basins in close proximity to liquefied natural gas export hubs.

Fossil exports. LNG was the star of the U.S. energy export arena in 2025, with a record 252 MMm3 shipped out, according to commodities intelligence firm Kpler.

Total LNG exports in 2025 jumped by 25% from the year before, and are poised for additional growth in 2026 as new liquefaction capacity comes online along the Texas and Louisiana coasts.

(click image to enlarge)

The EIA has estimated that total U.S. LNG exports could climb by 9% in 2026 to 1.3 Bft3d and will then rise to 1.7 Bft3d in 2027. The trajectory of U.S. crude oil exports in 2026 is less clear.

On the one hand, robust output combined with fairly flat domestic crude consumption suggests exporters will have ample supplies.

However, whether exporters will be able to ship out more than the 1.38 Bbbl they exported in 2025, according to Kpler, remains to be seen, as they will have to contend with higher supplies out of Venezuela following the U.S. ouster of Venezuelan President Maduro earlier this month.

U.S. exports of coal are also under pressure from declining global demand for the fuel and elevated competition from Indonesia, Australia, Colombia, Russia and South Africa, which all enjoy shorter trade routes to major importers.

That said, U.S. President Trump's strong support for the coal industry is expected to yield higher coal output and use by the power sector in 2026, so even if coal exports remain flat overall, coal output and use look primed for growth in 2026.

Alongside the expected continued growth in LNG exports, near-record output and exports of crude oil and record power sector output, the overall state of the U.S. energy sector looks set for another strong year in 2026.

The opinions expressed here are those of Gavin Maguire, a columnist for Reuters.

The move, experts warn, could lead to weaker protections against some of the most dangerous pollutants.

Internal agency emails and documents reviewed by The New York Times show that, under President Donald Trump, the EPA plans to change how it evaluates the costs and benefits of clean-air rules.

For decades, the EPA has used health data such as premature deaths and asthma attacks avoided, to help justify limits on air pollution.

That could soon change.

Internal emails reveal that the EPA plans to stop assigning a dollar value to the health benefits of reducing 2 major pollutants: Fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, and ozone.

Instead, the agency would focus mainly on the cost to businesses of following these pollution rules.

Experts say the change could make it easier to repeal limits on pollution from coal plants, oil refineries, and other industrial sites, leading to dirtier air in many communities.

PM2.5 particles are so small they can enter the lungs and bloodstream. Long-term exposure has been linked to asthma, heart disease, lung disease, and early death.

Ozone, a key part of smog, forms when pollution from cars and factories reacts in sunlight. It can trigger breathing problems.

Under the Biden administration, the EPA tightened limits on PM2.5 that industries could emit. The agency estimated those rules could prevent up to 4500 premature deaths and 290,000 lost workdays in 2032 alone.

The EPA also estimated that for every $1 spent on reducing PM2.5, there could be as much as $77 in health benefits.

The Trump administration argues that those health estimates are too “uncertain.” Under the new approach, the EPA would still mention health effects but would no longer include them in cost-benefit calculations.

“EPA, like the agency always has, is still considering the impacts that PM2.5 and ozone emissions have on human health,” EPA spokeswoman Carolyn Holran told The Times in an email. “Not monetizing does not equal not considering or not valuing the human health impact.”

Others strongly disagree.

“The idea that EPA would not consider the public health benefits of its regulations is anathema to the very mission of EPA,” Richard Revesz, faculty director of the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University School of Law, told The Times.

“If you’re only considering the costs to industry and you’re ignoring the benefits, then you can’t justify any regulations that protect public health, which is the very reason that EPA was set up,” he added.

Internal emails show EPA leaders plan to include language in future clean-air rules stating that “historically, the EPA’s analytical practices often provided the public with false precision and confidence regarding the monetized impacts of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone.”

It goes on to say that “to rectify this error, the EPA is no longer monetizing benefits from PM2.5 and ozone.”

That language has already appeared in a regulatory impact analysis posted online earlier this week.

The shift has drawn support from business groups, including the US Chamber of Commerce, which has long criticized how the EPA weighs health benefits.

But legal experts warn the change could cause challenges in court and make pollution rollbacks harder to defend.

So if there’s lack of land manager presence and action on Idaho’s public lands, [Idaho’s delegation] need only to look in the mirror for much of the reason.” —Craig Gehrke, Idaho Capital Sun Picture This","The Trump administration is proposing to strip states and Tribes of their ability to block oil and gas pipelines and other infrastructure. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a proposed rule that would narrow the scope of the section of the Clean Water Act that allows states and Tribes to review federal permits for projects that have the potential to pollute waterways and to either approve, place conditions on, or reject those permits.

Currently, states and Tribes may consider both direct water quality impacts of the project’s proposed discharges and broader impacts of the project overall. States have used this authority to block projects that would have also increased air pollution or caused other environmental harms. For example, in 2017 the state of Washington used this authority to reject water quality permits for a coal export terminal which would have caused pollution of both water and air. The EPA’s proposal would restrict states and Tribes to evaluating only the impacts of a project’s proposed direct discharges into waters covered by the Clean Water Act. In addition to narrowing the scope of state and Tribal reviews, the proposal also reduces the number of waterways eligible for this review since the number of waters protected by the Clean Water Act was reduced significantly by a 2023 Supreme Court decision and follow-up efforts by the EPA.

“The list of environmental protections getting axed seems to grow longer every day,” Hawk Hammer, national communications and media director for American Rivers, told the New York Times. “The bigger picture here is that polluters are getting free run of our nation’s waterways and the last time that happened, rivers caught on fire.”

Quote of the day

[Idaho’s congressional delegation] sat stone faced, quiet and missing in action last year as the Trump administration slashed thousands of jobs and millions of budget dollars from the land management agencies—budgets already approved by Congress. So if there’s lack of land manager presence and action on Idaho’s public lands, [Idaho’s delegation] need only to look in the mirror for much of the reason.”

“With these permit renewals, once again, corporate interests are being placed above the health of Northwest Indiana communities,” said Lisa Vallee, organizing director for Just Transition Northwest Indiana.
The petition asks the EPA to reject the Midwest Plant permit renewal.
“This is a standard permit renewal which occurs every five years.
The organization gave Lake County failing grades in three categories: ozone pollution, 24-hour particle pollution and annual particle pollution.","Multiple Northwest Indiana environmental groups have filed petitions against air permit renewals for a region steel plant and oil refinery, saying they’re inadequate.

According to the Environmental Law and Policy Center, a Jan. 2 petition was filed for a permit renewal at BP’s Whiting refinery, and another petition was filed on Dec. 23, 2025, for a renewal at U.S. Steel’s Midwest Plant in Portage. The petitions, which were sent to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, claim that the permits don’t include basic provisions of the Clean Air Act, “including clear and enforceable monitoring, testing and recordkeeping requirements sufficient to assure compliance with all applicable requirements.”

The Indiana Department of Environmental Management issued the permits. IDEM did not respond to a request for comment.

“IDEM needs to do better and ensure that BP Whiting and U.S. Steel Midwest Plant are operating in a way that is not only economically lucrative but also protective of human health,” Kerri Gefeke, associate attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center, said in a news release. “IDEM can do that by simply ensuring that the permits it issues follow the law and include the necessary monitoring provisions to ensure that these plants — and similar facilities — are not polluting more than what’s allowable in their permits.”

The Environmental Law and Policy Center, Northern Lake County Environmental Partnership, Gary Advocates for Responsible Development and Just Transition Northwest Indiana were part of both filed petitions. Save the Dunes joined the BP petition.

“With these permit renewals, once again, corporate interests are being placed above the health of Northwest Indiana communities,” said Lisa Vallee, organizing director for Just Transition Northwest Indiana. “We have been carrying the weight of these decisions for decades, and our health outcomes prove it. With air quality among the worst in the nation, those of us who live in the region face higher rates of cancer, cardiovascular disease and asthma.”

According to the petition, the community groups believe that the U.S. Steel permit renewal has multiple issues, including failing to include requirements that ensure compliance with emission limits and federal regulations. The petition asks the EPA to reject the Midwest Plant permit renewal.

As part of the rejection, the petition asks the EPA to require IDEM revise the permit renewal to meet compliance with emission limits and federal regulations.

“IDEM should never have issued these permit renewals, which lack the basic protections of the Clean Air Act,” Vallee said. “The U.S. EPA should do what is right and object. Our communities deserve to be safeguarded, and we will continue to advocate for a better future for all Hoosiers.”

A spokesperson for U.S. Steel responded to the petition in a statement.

“U.S. Steel is pleased with the renewal of our operating permit for Midwest,” the statement said. “This is a standard permit renewal which occurs every five years. There are no increases in emissions limits or new equipment in the permit. We are proud of the more than 4,000 men and women who put safety and environmental compliance first, and we value the Northwest Indiana community where we live and work.”

In the BP petition, the groups say the refinery’s permit fails to include a particulate matter emissions limit that is required by Indiana’s federally-approved State Implementation Plan. The petition asks the EPA to require IDEM to revise the permit.

A BP spokesperson also responded to the petition in a statement.

“BP is committed to safe and compliant operations at the Whiting Refinery,” the statement said. “We will continue working every day to keep this commitment and to ensure the refinery remains an important part of Northwest Indiana for years to come.”

Gefeke, in a news release, said numerous studies have shown the area has some of the highest rates of air pollution nationwide, including high asthma and cancer rates.

The American Lung Association, in April 2025, announced that Hoosiers are breathing some of the nation’s most polluted air, according to Post-Tribune archives. The organization gave Lake County failing grades in three categories: ozone pollution, 24-hour particle pollution and annual particle pollution. Porter County only received a passing grade for annual particle pollution.

Ozone and particle pollution can cause premature death and other health effects, including asthma attacks, heart attacks, strokes, preterm birth and impaired cognitive function, according to the American Lung Association. Particle pollution can also cause lung cancer, according to the organization.

The American Lung Association found that, in 2020, Indiana had a lung cancer rate of 72.5 per 100,000 people, with Lake County as one of the state’s counties with the highest cancer mortality rates. A 2016 report from the JAMA Network also found Gary as one of the five U.S. cities with the lowest life expectancy at one point.

“U.S. EPA should object to these permits because they’re inconsistent with the Clean Air Act and the region’s Hoosiers should not feel like they are living in a sacrifice zone,” Gefeke said.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/04/13/AAVFV24BUJEXBF4RX6IWJ6AUME.jpg?w=1024&h=670,N,,2026-01-15 12:01:11.652689

There are many factors that combine to affect clean energy manufacturers, at the regional, state, and federal levels, said He. They include government subsidies and tax incentives, policy tools that can have a significant impacts, especially in the early stages of project development, He said. Market forces like inflation can also pose challenges through higher capital costs, He added.

“We want to understand what works, what doesn’t, how, and under what conditions,” the professor said. “First, we’ll build a comprehensive data set that incorporates policies and outcomes, and then we’ll analyze causal relationships — in other words, what factors are driving what outcomes.”

The three-year study will weigh empirical research, geopolitical concerns, such as the effects of tariffs on trade partners, and historical data that demonstrate outcomes of government policies over time. Student assistants and early-career postdoctoral researchers are being recruited for the study, He says, and several papers are expected to share findings from the project.

The researchers will use GCAM — short for the Global Change Analysis Model, a computer model that links climate to energy systems, land use, and the economy — alongside other models to project the impacts of various trade policies.

He points to the recent rollback of the Inflation Reduction Act, which invested heavily in clean energy manufacturing, the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, and a focus on fossil fuels as examples of new federal policies that diverge from decarbonization. “In an ideal world, federal policies accelerate the market transition to clean energy, not slow it down. But I think the market will find its way when the prices are right,” He said.

In the meantime, climate change barrels forward.

“We need to accelerate the deployment of clean energy to achieve our climate goals,” He said.

“At the same time, we’re facing challenges related to geopolitics and economic slowdown. We need evidence to help stakeholders find a way to balance these complicated and sometimes competing issues. My hope is that this research can provide more evidence needed to inform policy debates and discussions around clean energy manufacturing.”

Forward-Looking Statements This communication contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties.
All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this communication, or incorporated by reference into this communication, are forward-looking statements.","HOUSTON, Jan. 15, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Talen Energy Corporation (“Talen,” “we,” or “our”) (NASDAQ: TLN), a leading independent power producer, announced it has signed definitive agreements to add approximately 2.6 gigawatts of natural gas generation capacity to Talen’s portfolio through the acquisition of the Waterford Energy Center (“Waterford”) and Darby Generating Station (“Darby”) in Ohio and the Lawrenceburg Power Plant (“Lawrenceburg”) in Indiana from Energy Capital Partners (“ECP”). The acquisition will substantially expand Talen’s presence in the western PJM market and add additional efficient baseload generation assets to its fleet.

The acquisition price is $3.45 billion and consists of approximately $2.55 billion in cash and approximately $900 million1 in Talen stock. The price reflects an attractive multiple of approximately 6.6x 2027E adjusted EBITDA. The transaction is expected to provide immediate and significant adjusted free cash flow per share accretion in excess of 15% annually through 2030E. Additionally, these assets are expected to achieve an approximately 85% unlevered free cash flow conversion rate before recognition of any tax benefits.

“This acquisition further diversifies Talen’s generation portfolio by adding both baseload capacity and strong cash flow contribution and enhances our presence in the western PJM market, which has significant data center tailwinds,” said Mac McFarland, Talen Chief Executive Officer. “The transaction is immediately cash flow accretive and maintains our balance sheet discipline. Following on the heels of our acquisition of Freedom and Guernsey in 2025, it is another great example of our ‘Talen flywheel’ strategy.”

“ECP invested in this portfolio to serve rapid load growth in the Ohio region with efficient, baseload natural gas assets; we continue to believe this is PJM's most exciting narrative,” said Andrew Gilbert, ECP Partner. “Talen has demonstrated that its platform of scale is uniquely positioned to serve PJM’s large customers and, with this transaction, will only be better positioned to do so. As a significant shareholder, ECP is excited to enhance our exposure to Ohio's growth via Talen’s successful flywheel strategy.”

“When this transaction is complete, Talen will have approximately doubled its expected annual generation output inside of two years, meaningfully diversified our fleet, and materially increased our free cash flow per share,” said Terry Nutt, Talen President. “We are also excited to welcome ECP as a significant Talen shareholder.”

Key Strategic and Acquisition Highlights

Expands and Diversifies Talen’s Fleet: The 1,218-megawatt Lawrenceburg and 869-megawatt Waterford facilities are highly efficient and modern CCGTs that add both baseload generation and cash flow diversification. The plants have an average heat rate of approximately 7,000 Btu/kWh and capacity factors greater than 80%. Their highly efficient dispatch profile results in significant energy margin, while the low cost and capital requirements provide strong cash flow conversion. The 480-megawatt Darby facility operates as a peaking unit and can provide attractive commercial flexibility. All three facilities have reliable access to low-cost gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale formations and continue the geographic and fuel diversification reflected by the previous Freedom and Guernsey acquisitions.

Enhances Platform for Data Center and Large-load Contracting: The addition of the facilities to Talen’s portfolio enhances Talen’s ability to offer reliable, scalable, grid-supported, and regionally diverse low-carbon capacity to hyperscale data centers and large commercial off-takers. The expansion of operations in Ohio allows Talen to serve a growing, top-tier data center market.

Unlocks Material Value Day One: The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to adjusted free cash flow per share by over 15% annually through 2030E.

Maintains Balance Sheet Strength: Talen expects robust pro forma cash flows to drive rapid deleveraging with the ability to achieve a net leverage target of 3.5x or lower by year-end 2026.

Stock Consideration: ECP has agreed to receive approximately $900 million of consideration in the form of Talen equity and will become a significant shareholder post close.

Additional Transaction Details

Talen expects to issue new debt to fund the cash portion of the purchase price.

The transaction is expected to close early in the second half of 2026 and is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976, and regulatory approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission and other regulatory agencies.

OCIO partnerships can provide structured decisionmaking, documentation and oversight that strengthen board confidence and fiduciary responsibility.
For mission-driven organizations, the OCIO model offers stability, scalability and professional execution.
Despite advances in technology and governance, successful OCIO partnerships still rely on trusted collaboration, shared purpose, disciplined execution and human insight.
In an environment defined by complexity and accountability, that combination has become the hallmark of modern institutional investment management.","As investment oversight grows more complex, institutions are increasingly turning to the outsourced chief investment officer model to help strengthen governance, execution and efficiency across their portfolios. Once reserved for large endowments and foundations, OCIO services are becoming increasingly popular across the broader nonprofit and institutional landscape, offering the sophistication of an in-house investment office without expanding internal resources.

Nonprofit organizations are adopting the OCIO model at an accelerating pace, driven by funding volatility, lean staffing and rising fiduciary expectations. For many, discretionary management has become a practical necessity for achieving financial stability and advancing mission goals. OCIO partnerships can provide structured decisionmaking, documentation and oversight that strengthen board confidence and fiduciary responsibility. For mission-driven organizations, the OCIO model offers stability, scalability and professional execution.

The model’s success depends not only on delegation, but on how the relationship is structured and sustained. The most effective partnerships are built on trust, transparency and alignment of purpose, combining institutional rigor with adaptability.

Building Effective Partnerships

Transitioning from an advisory relationship to a discretionary investment partnership represents a significant organizational shift that requires clarity, communication and role definition.

Establishing clear governance boundaries at the outset is critical. Each party must understand where the OCIO holds discretion and where the committee or staff retains oversight. Establishing and documenting these parameters early in the OCIO engagement prevents confusion and keeps decisions aligned with policy and mission objectives.

A structured communication cadence reinforces transparency and alignment. Strong OCIO relationships feature timely updates, standardized agendas and pre-meeting briefings. Real-time communication related to key actions helps maintain confidence and continuity. This approach allows both sides to recalibrate expectations and build mutual trust. A formal feedback process, initiated by senior OCIO leadership, can also help ensure ongoing alignment and service refinement.

The OCIO should function not as an external vendor, but as an integrated extension of board, investment committee and staff, in alignment with the organization’s mission, culture and long-term goals.

Strengthening Governance and Strategic Alignment

Investment committees may struggle to balance short-term pressures with long-term strategies. A well-structured OCIO partnership can provide the discipline needed to bridge that gap.

Strong governance begins with clear process and accountability. A deliberate governance structure covering key aspects of fiduciary oversight and responsibility enables committees to operate strategically rather than reactively. Delegating implementation to the OCIO allows an organization’s leadership to refocus on priorities that directly support the mission.

Continuity is equally important. Committee membership changes frequently, and without documentation, institutional memory can erode. The OCIO can maintain that continuity through consistent reporting and context-rich communication, preserving alignment even as personnel evolve.

A well-governed OCIO partnership can enhance decision quality and oversight, creating a structure that supports fiduciary accountability and long-term impact.

Liquidity and Administrative Relief

For nonprofit organizations, another driver leading to increased adoption of an outsourced model is liquidity management. With inconsistent public funding and fluctuating donations, nonprofits must balance short-term obligations with long-term return objectives. OCIOs can design portfolios that integrate spending policies, cash-flow forecasting and reserve strategies, helping to ensure flexibility and discipline coexist.

Administrative efficiency is another catalyst. Many nonprofit finance offices lack capacity for trading, reconciliation or detailed performance monitoring. An OCIO can help alleviate these burdens by managing operations, including trade orders and subscription documents. An OCIO also can provide audit support and lead interactions with the custodian, all with the client’s interest in mind.

Enhancing Efficiency, Preserving Judgment

Advancements in data analytics, automation and artificial intelligence are transforming OCIO operations. Leading firms leverage these tools to streamline workflows, improve transparency and enhance responsiveness while maintaining human oversight at the core.

AI and automation can consolidate data, generate reporting and identify portfolio anomalies. Using such tools to create these efficiencies can reduce manual workload and improve accuracy, allowing investment teams to devote more time to analysis and client engagement.

However, technology must support, not replace, human judgment. Investment management remains inherently relational, requiring experience and contextual understanding. The most effective OCIOs integrate technology to inform decisions, not to make them, preserving the human insight that defines sound fiduciary management. The result is an evolved model, in which technology amplifies the adviser’s ability to deliver clarity, not automation.

Sustaining Long-Term Partnerships

A successful OCIO relationship is not transactional; it is a strategic alliance that grows over time. As the OCIO develops a nuanced understanding of the organization’s objectives, risk parameters and culture, its ability to provide proactive, customized solutions expands significantly.

Long-term success requires mutual accountability. Regular reviews, qualitative assessments and open dialogue create a feedback loop that promotes continuous improvement. Both sides share responsibility for refining objectives, evaluating results and adapting to changing circumstances.

Durable partnerships are built on trust, earned through consistent delivery, responsiveness and transparent communication. When the OCIO becomes embedded as an extension of the internal team, the relationship evolves from outsourcing to strategic integration, enabling the organization to pursue its mission with confidence.

The New Standard in Institutional Investment

The OCIO model has evolved from a niche offering to an institutional standard, reflecting a broader shift in how organizations approach investment management. Integration, accountability and agility now define the modern governance landscape.

For nonprofits and mission-driven institutions, OCIO partnerships deliver measurable advantages: streamlined operations, enhanced liquidity management, improved oversight and greater alignment between financial resources and mission outcomes.

Despite advances in technology and governance, successful OCIO partnerships still rely on trusted collaboration, shared purpose, disciplined execution and human insight. In an environment defined by complexity and accountability, that combination has become the hallmark of modern institutional investment management.

Trump administration to finalize 2026 biofuel quotas by early March.

EPA may adjust bio-based diesel targets slightly lower.

Moves reflect compromise between biofuel producers and oil refiners.

Jan 15 (Reuters) - The administration of President Donald Trump plans to finalize 2026 biofuel blending quotas by early March, keeping them close to its initial proposal while dropping a plan to penalize imports of renewable fuels and feedstocks, according to two sources familiar with the plans.

If finalized, the plan would mark a partial compromise between rival oil and farm industry groups by preserving increased blending targets sought by biofuel producers while dropping a proposal that U.S. refiners had warned would disrupt fuel markets and raise costs.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which oversees U.S. biofuel policy, has told industry stakeholders it aims to send the final proposal to the White House budget office for review later this month, with finalization expected roughly 30 days later after the White House conducts industry interviews.

The EPA in June proposed total biofuel blending volumes at 24.02 billion gallons in 2026 and 24.46 billion gallons in 2027, up from 22.33 billion gallons in 2025. The total included a target of 5.61 billion gallons for bio-based diesel, a significant jump from the 3.35 billion gallons in 2025.

The EPA is now considering a range of 5.2 to 5.6 billion gallons for bio-based diesel in 2026, the sources told Reuters.

The potential downward adjustment is partially related to the EPA's plan to ditch a proposal that would slash the value of renewable fuel credits given by the U.S. government for imported biofuels, an ""America First"" policy hailed as a victory by the soybean and biodiesel industries.

Big Oil, led by the influential American Petroleum Institute industry group, had argued that limiting credits for foreign supply could constrain availability and push fuel prices higher - an outcome the White House is eager to avoid as affordability remains a central political concern heading into mid-term elections this year.

Reuters previously reported that the EPA was considering delaying the proposal for at least a year.

The EPA told Reuters the agency is still reviewing comments on the proposed rule. ""As publicly stated in court filings, the agency aims to finalize 'in the first quarter of 2026,"" the agency said.

The EPA is also expected to decide whether to require larger refiners to make up for gallons exempted under the agency's small refinery waiver program, a determination that could significantly affect overall biofuel blending quotas.

The EPA in August cleared a backlog of more than 170 small refinery exemption requests dating back to 2016. They have issued additional exemptions since then.

The biofuel industry and its legislative allies have been urging the administration to require refiners to offset 100% of those exempted gallons, while the oil industry is resisting the obligations. The EPA has sought comment on various proposals, ranging from zero reallocation to 100%.

Reuters previously reported that the EPA is considering a plan for refiners to offset 50% of the those exempted gallons.

The trial demonstrated the effectiveness of managed charging in shifting EV load out of high-cost periods and reducing peak demand.","Active management can reduce on-peak EV charging by 59–93% compared to unmanaged charging, significantly mitigating grid congestion and improving load diversity.

That is the finding of a study conducted by global consultancy Brattle on behalf of EnergyHub, the result of a trial conducted in Washington State using EnergyHub’s EV managed charging solution.

The report, titled ‘Demonstrating the Full Value of Managed Electric Vehicle Charging’, sets out how managed charging strategies can provide value for EV drivers and avoid distribution system upgrades.

Increased electrification in the move away from fossil fuels is putting an increasing strain on electricity grids globally, as the infrastructure struggles with the additional load. While infrastructure upgrades will be an inevitable (and expensive) part of the energy transition, there are solutions to get around the constraint.

By increasing hosting capacity and deferring capital expenditures, active managed charging offers a scalable solution to accommodate growing EV adoption without overburdening existing infrastructure.

The study highlights that both active and passive managed charging strategies can reduce system costs, defer infrastructure upgrades, and improve customer satisfaction.

Active vs. passive managed charging: Key differences

The trial evaluated two distinct approaches to managed charging:

Observed performance: Shifting load and reducing peaks

According to the report, while effective in shifting load, passive strategies lack the precision of active management in optimising grid performance.

Active managed charging increases the hosting capacity of distribution grid assets by 1.3x to 3.2x, enabling utilities to defer upgrades by up to 10 years. This reduces distribution grid costs by about US$200 per EV annually, with potential savings reaching US$400 per EV per year.

The trial demonstrated the effectiveness of managed charging in shifting EV load out of high-cost periods and reducing peak demand.

‘Active management smooths EV load at the service transformer and feeder levels, reducing distribution grid congestion,’ the report notes.

Enhancing customer experience

Consumer engagement is a key element in managed charging, and a metric that is arguably hard to predict on a wide scale. However, the Brattle trial recorded an opt-out rate of just 3%. The report puts this down to EnergyHub’s solution, which prioritises customer convenience, balancing optimisation with driver satisfaction.

The report states that ‘100% of EVs that plugged in with sufficient time to charge reached their desired target state of charge by the end of the optimisation window’.

A similar trial that is ongoing in the UK, run by home charging solutions provider Ohme, also noted ‘very low’ dropout rates.

Business implications: Cost savings and infrastructure deferral

By deferring the need for infrastructure upgrades, the report found that active managed charging offers cost savings for utilities, relative to unmanaged charging or passing time-of-use strategies.

As EV adoption accelerates, utilities face mounting pressure to adapt their infrastructure to meet rising demand. Managed charging strategies provide a cost-effective pathway to address these challenges.

The report suggests that leveraging active management solutions will be key to balancing grid performance, cost efficiency, and customer experience; flexibility more generally, through demand and energy storage, is well-known to be a key part of the energy transition. With the potential to defer infrastructure upgrades by up to a decade and deliver significant cost savings, managed charging represents a critical opportunity for industry leaders to future-proof their operations in the face of rapid electrification.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt452efb5f3e725f7e/blt23f6236f1d608792/6968d4c98a6c8443b1f2596b/chuttersnap-xfaYAsMV1p8-unsplash.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-15 11:01:03.950673

He said he’s not opposed to all data centers, but argued they need to respect the desires of the community.
She says she plans to introduce another bill that would create a two-year moratorium on data center development.
This comes after township supervisors declined to vote on a proposed ordinance that would create more restrictions over the planned data center.
He compared the spread of data centers to the rise of the oil and gas industry in the past decades.","HARRISBURG — Steve Hacker’s well ran dry in October 2024 for the first time since he moved to Chester County in 1983.

Hacker, now retired and working part-time at the local Colonial Theatre, says he went 39 days without running water in his house. He showered at his workplace or the local YMCA during that time. The well ran dry due to a drought, Hacker said, but he’s worried that it’s a sign of things to come.

Hacker’s township of East Vincent is considering plans to build a data center campus, which would house computer servers and equipment. These facilities require huge amounts of energy and millions of gallons of clean water annually to cool their servers.

“They want to pull millions of gallons [of water] out — I don’t see how that can work,” Hacker told Spotlight PA. “Who is responsible if all the wells in my town dry out? Who’s going to compensate us?”

Pennsylvania residents across the state, from Allegheny to Lackawanna Counties, have expressed concerns about planned data centers and their impacts on energy prices, water usage, and pollution. In a recent poll, 42% of Pennsylvanians said they do not want one built in or near their community. Yet many state and local lawmakers — even skeptics — have accepted the proliferation of data centers in Pennsylvania as a fact of life.

“I've had people tell me, ‘Well, just let's bar them. We'll prohibit them,’” state Sen. Gene Yaw (R., Lycoming) told Spotlight PA. “Then let's go to the library and burn all the books too while we're at it.”

Companies such as Amazon Web Services and Blackstone have announced tens of billions of dollars in private investments to build data centers across the state. Legislative supporters say the projects will create thousands of temporary construction jobs and hundreds of permanent ones, attract more workers to the state, and enable the U.S. to compete with China in technological development.

Even lawmakers who are concerned about the spread of data centers say that the number is likely to increase, and that the legislature should create regulatory bodies or economic incentives for developers to prioritize environmental safety.

Hacker wants to see elected officials push back against data centers but fears that most, from township supervisors to Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro, are “gung-ho” on the prospect of private investment.

“They want to go full speed ahead. But I want them to slow down,” Hacker said. “That’s the number one thing I want from the state government: I want to slow down. I would want a moratorium on building these things.”

What’s on the table?

State lawmakers have offered a range of proposals regarding data centers, including making them easier to build and adding checks.

Some legislation focuses on speeding up the permitting process, which often requires government permission to excavate and dig under land, manage stormwater drainage, mitigate air pollution, and begin construction. Two such bills, both from Republicans, would tie speedier permitting to a commitment “to improved environmental outcomes.”

Other bills are aimed at ensuring that increased energy demand from data centers does not impact consumer energy costs and at creating a regulatory framework.

A bill from state Rep. Rob Matzie (D., Beaver) would allow the Public Utility Commission to regulate data centers, including implementing fees for building out transmission lines and deposits to begin construction.

Other proposals would amend an existing tax exemption to incentivize data centers to use clean energy when powering their campuses or mandate that developers request a meeting with local officials, including zoning and planning officials.

State Rep. Elizabeth Fiedler (D., Philadelphia) chairs her chamber’s Energy Committee, which would likely consider many of these proposals before they became law. Fiedler told Spotlight PA that Matzie’s oversight bill, and a proposal to mandate data centers report energy and water usage to the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, are among the measures she expects to review.

“Right now, there’s a real lack of regulation,” Fiedler told Spotlight PA. “So if we’re able to get any of these bills through … that would make a real difference.”

Pushback from lawmakers

Positions on data centers are not cleanly divided by party affiliation. Some of the most vocal legislative opponents represent districts where they will be located.

State Rep. Jamie Walsh (R., Luzerne) opposes a data center that is planned in his district, saying he’s seen “corporate bullying” on the part of developers.

“The Pennsylvania taxpayer, quite frankly, has had enough,” Walsh told Spotlight PA.

Walsh said that residents are concerned about water and electricity costs and closeness to residential housing. He said he’s not opposed to all data centers, but argued they need to respect the desires of the community.

“If a municipality feels that it can support a data center with water [usage], electricity isn’t going to shoot through the roof … and the community is OK with the zone it’s going in, then it should be left up to that community,” Walsh said.

Walsh intends to introduce legislation that would establish standards to ensure data center development in the state “occurs responsibly, transparently, and with real community involvement.” A memo seeking support for the proposal did not detail what those standards would look like, but Walsh told Spotlight PA there would be measures to protect consumers against AI deepfakes and prevent them from “footing the bill for these AI data centers.”

State Sen. Katie Muth (D., Montgomery) has also pushed back against data center development. Her district includes the planned data center that Hacker is concerned about.

Muth told Spotlight PA that the bills to regulate costs for ratepayers are the bare minimum.

Increased energy demand from data centers in other states connected to the same massive regional grid already affects costs in Pennsylvania, she said.

She has criticized the lack of attention being paid to emergency planning and the long-term health impacts on residents. If a battery fire or other emergency broke out on the planned campus in her district, for example, Muth wants developers to have a plan to stop it from spreading to a nearby nuclear power plant.

She says she plans to introduce another bill that would create a two-year moratorium on data center development. The hope, she says, is to give local officials enough time to properly investigate the plans for data centers.

“Who has control about the information of these projects is really key,” Muth said. “These decisions are being made in vacuums.”

Leadership on data centers

Party leaders largely support building more data centers, citing the potential to create jobs and bring private investment into the state.

State Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R., Indiana) said he wants to see the “responsible growth of data centers,” though he hasn’t been specific about what type of legislation he would support.

“To me, the biggest concern is data centers coming online without commensurate supply,” Pittman said at a news conference last November. “At the end of the day, these data centers are coming. It's the reality of technology. We've got to be prepared to match the supply [of energy.]”

Democrats who control the state House didn’t commit to backing specific data center legislation when asked by Spotlight PA. A spokesperson said lawmakers “must take a balanced, responsible approach to data centers” and the caucus is exploring legislative solutions that “provide reasonable oversight, protect energy and natural resources, and help keep utility costs affordable for consumers.”

Shapiro has thrown his support behind data centers, celebrating a planned $20 billion investment from Amazon Web Services for the buildout of two in eastern Pennsylvania last summer.

“I announced the largest private sector investment in the history of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania just a few months ago, right here in northeastern Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said last October. “A deal with AWS, Amazon, that's going to create 10,000 construction jobs, and it's also, at the same time going to create over 1,000 permanent jobs.”

Shapiro has also said he views AI development as inevitable. The question, he says, is whether the U.S. will be able to outpace China.

“I do not want China to beat America in this,” he said at a news conference last August. “There are just less than a handful of states in the entire country that are poised the way we are to be leaders on this data center development, leaders on AI development … and I believe Pennsylvania is poised to do that.”

When asked about resident concerns regarding data center deals, Shapiro said in October that “with any of these deals, you’ve got to work with the local community.”

In Chester County, the fight over data centers continues to play out.

Pennhurst Holdings LLC, the company that owns the land where the data center is slated to be built, is currently applying for conditional use permitting — wherein a local government can approve land use that is not explicitly permitted under its zoning code — from the township. This comes after township supervisors declined to vote on a proposed ordinance that would create more restrictions over the planned data center.

Matt McHugh, an attorney for the company, says that the hearings will address many of the public’s concerns over water and electricity usage, among other issues.

“Ultimately, the township can impose conditions on an approval if they so choose, to which we would be obligated to adhere to as part of moving forward with the development,” McHugh told Spotlight PA.

East Vincent Township’s supervisors have remained quiet on the issue. Messages from Spotlight PA to Township Manager Bob Zienkowski were not returned.

“We have to keep an open mind,” said Township Supervisor Craig A. Damon II. “The board cannot prejudice itself for or against a data center.”

And residents like Hacker have gotten involved, attending local zoning meetings and reaching out to local elected officials and state lawmakers.

But Hacker worries his efforts won’t make a difference. He compared the spread of data centers to the rise of the oil and gas industry in the past decades. The oil and gas wells drilled were later revealed to be correlated with negative health impacts, like increased risk of cancer.

“To let industry do whatever they want and deal with the consequences later, we should know better,” Hacker said. “I absolutely want our state legislators as a whole, right up to Shapiro, to listen to the people.”",https://www.spotlightpa.org/imgproxy/insecure/rt:fill/w:1200/h:900/g:sm/el:1/q:75/MjAyNi8wMS8wMW1wLWF6a2EteHAzNC1iMmUwLmpwZWc=.jpeg,N,,2026-01-15 14:00:33.840203

“The global car industry is a cornerstone of many national economies, directly employing more than 10 million people worldwide and supporting millions of additional jobs,” says Fatih Birol, the Executive Director of the IEA.
As such, the adoption of EVs will be one of the most crucial parts of the global energy transition.
“The global car industry is currently undergoing major changes that have significant implications for economies around the world and for the energy sector,” Fatih explains.","The IEA's new report, What Next for the Global Car Industry, is an eye opener.

The report evaluates the progress the transport sector is making when it comes to electrification, highlighting the encouraging signs and causes for concern alike.

It also calls attention to the ""profound changes"" that are taking place with regards to the geography of car sales and the adoption of EVs.

China powers ahead in the energy transition

The IEA reports that global sales of pure petrol and diesel vehicles have dropped by around 30% since their 2017 peak, thanks to policies, pressure and the cost of technology. Nowadays, the market is far more tilted towards clean energy than ever before.

In 2024, for instance, of the 80 million cars sold around the world, around 30% of them were electric or hybrid. This is expected to continue to rise in the near future, notwithstanding certain regional barriers.

Speaking of regions, the IEA's report regularly points to China as the current Mecca of EVs, with its dominance in EV manufacturing, infrastructure and resources making it the undisputed world leader in sustainable mobility.

The country now produces around 40% of the world’s cars, overtaking the EU as the top vehicle exporter in 2024. Its production rate has more than doubled its output since 2010. What's more, around 70% of all EVs sold globally originate from Chinese factories now.

China's pre-eminence in both EVs and renewable energy now make it a leading force in the field of global sustainability.

The electrification of the transport sector

In its report, the IEA notes that the restructuring of the automotive sector is as much a story about energy as it is about industry.

“The global car industry is a cornerstone of many national economies, directly employing more than 10 million people worldwide and supporting millions of additional jobs,” says Fatih Birol, the Executive Director of the IEA.

“The market for cars is one of the largest for a single product and cars are the single largest source of global oil demand today,"" he adds.

As such, the adoption of EVs will be one of the most crucial parts of the global energy transition. Electric vehicles consume electricity instead of liquid fuels and are far more energy-efficient, converting a greater share of power into motion.

The shift towards EVs also has major implications for steel, aluminium and battery supply chains, as well as for regional energy demand.

The sector already represents about 6% of global steel use and 17% of aluminium demand, with these figures expected to rise as lightweight materials become more important to energy efficiency.

Battery manufacturing, which is now the largest single driver of industrial energy use growth, is clustering near cheap and reliable electricity sources.

For instance, Shanghai alone is home to 26 battery plants, together representing more than 5% of global capacity.

The difference in capacity from region to region is beginning to sharpen too. While Europe and North America still dominate traditional engine manufacturing, Chinese firms now account for roughly 80% of capacity for battery-related production as EV components scale rapidly.

Costs, materials and the new economics of energy

The IEA’s data shows that EV production in China remains cheaper due to integrated energy supply chains and economies of scale.

Battery cell prices are more than 30% lower than in Europe and over 20% lower than in the US, amplifying cost advantages for energy-efficient manufacturing hubs.

“The global car industry is currently undergoing major changes that have significant implications for economies around the world and for the energy sector,” Fatih explains.

“Three structural shifts are underway, in terms of the geography of production, in terms of the regions that are driving sales growth and in terms of the technologies that car buyers are choosing.

“Against this backdrop, this new IEA report provides a strong basis to inform discussions and decision-making by governments and industry, noting that there is no one-size-fits-all model.”

Batteries are now a strategic energy asset in their own right. For the EU, which imports a high share of components, this is driving concern about energy security and supply resilience.

Meanwhile, China and Japan are maintaining integrated supply chains that give them a much tighter control of energy and mineral flows.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/7a64127bfcddfd445458fb37c9227efb:2cbf5120d13626fdc2c03e0c1b87ace9/graphics-for-work-2026-01-15t144011-152.jpg.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 11:01:07.799372

This auction is the first to include the Clean Industry Bonus, which provides financial incentives for developers investing in UK supply chains and cleaner manufacturing facilities.","The UK government’s record AR7 auction has attracted £3bn of private investment into domestic ports, factories and supply chains, backed by £204m of public funding through the new Clean Industry Bonus.

The government said the AR7 results mean successful offshore wind projects will procure infrastructure from across Britain’s industrial regions, supporting up to 7000 jobs.

It added that the scheme will bring up to £1.1bn of supply chain investment and as many as 2400 clean energy jobs to Scotland.

The auction secured 8.4GW of offshore wind capacity, enough to power over 12 million homes, according to the statement.

“We promised to take back control of our energy with clean, homegrown power – and today we’re delivering in a way that brings good industrial jobs for Scotland and the rest of the country,” said prime minister Keir Starmer.

“Billions in investment will flow into hardworking industrial communities to build clean energy supply chains in Britain,” he added.

“Our clean energy mission is creating thousands of good jobs for working people in their hometown, bringing transformational opportunities for Britain and reversing decades of industrial decline,” said energy secretary Ed Miliband.

This auction is the first to include the Clean Industry Bonus, which provides financial incentives for developers investing in UK supply chains and cleaner manufacturing facilities.

The government said the bonus is a first-of-a-kind initiative and represents a significant vote of confidence in Britain’s industrial strategy.

Tion Renewables GmbH (“Tion Renewables” or “Tion”) and clearvise AG (”clearvise”) today announced that the outsourcing agreement between the two companies has become fully effective as of the start of the new year 2026. The agreement was entered into between the companies on September 24, 2025 and supports clearvise’s strategic transformation into a dividend-focused and cost-efficient YieldCo. With the decision of the complete outsourcing, essential operational business activities and all employees had been transferred to Tion Renewables.

Tion Renewables, in parallel being clearvise’s largest minority shareholder, endorses this strategic shift, emphasizing dividends, cost control, and operational efficiency as essential for listed renewables platforms in the current stock market environment. By the end of 2025, clearvise managed an onshore wind and solar portfolio of ~489 MW, thereof 388 MW operational.

For Tion, with its renewables portfolio of some 430 MW in operation (end of 2025), integrating clearvise’s operational team and serving as long-term business services partner, makes sense before the background of Tion’s ambitious growth targets. The management of a combined renewable portfolio of almost 1 GW enables meaningful synergies in operations, faster digitalization and a more efficient deployment of a highly skilled expert team – benefitting both companies.

“This partnership is a win-win. As a shareholder we fully support clearvise’s YieldCo strategy,” said Ingmar Helmke, CEO of Tion Renewables. “At the same time, taking on the team and operational day-to-day responsibility as service provider fits perfectly with Tion’s ambition to scale into one of Europe’s leading independent green power and storage providers. Greater scale, shared expertise and accelerated digitalization will lift quality and efficiency across both portfolios.”

Petra-Leue Bahns, CEO of clearvise AG, commented, “Now clearvise’s strategic shift towards a dividend-focused YieldCo is completed. The outsourcing of our day-to-day operations under a long-term service agreement fully supports our YieldCo strategy by creating sustainable cost savings. Partnering with Tion enables seamless operations, as the whole clearvise team joined Tion and its unique knowledge and well-functioning processes remain available. In addition, the full outsourcing to Tion is allowing clearvise to benefit from greater scale, operational excellence and long-term efficiency improvements.”

This new chapter for Tion Renewables will also bring changes to the management:

Co-Founder Christoph Strasser will step away from his role as CIO of Tion Renewables and leave the company in the summer at his own request to take on new professional challenges. Co-Founder Dr. Martin Siddiqui has departed end of 2025.

Manuel Sieth (former clearvise CFO) became Tion’s CFO in October 2025 already and will assume the role of the CIO. Oliver Störkel (former Head of Asset Management at clearvise) will going forward lead Asset Management & Execution at Tion. Martin Lemmer, so far Investment Director DACH, will be promoted as Head of Investment Management.

With these developments, Tion Renewables enter the new year with greater scale, strengthened capabilities, and clear momentum for future growth.

So functionally, Illinois wetlands have been written out of the Clean Water Act.
So, the state would run their own wetlands protections program, but we don't have that currently.
We relied on the federal Clean Water Act.
Illinois lawmakers should take note that there's widespread and broad desire to protect Illinois wetlands.","More than 96% of Illinois wetlands are at risk of losing federal protections. The Environmental Protection Agency is in the process of redefining the Waters of the United States (WOTUS), and their proposed definition rolls back many safeguards that have been in place to protect waterways and wetlands across the country. Dozens of community organizations signed onto a formal objection to the Environmental Protection Agency, which was drafted by Prairie Rivers Network. WNIJ’s Jess Savage sat down with Director of Water Policy Robert Hirschfeld to learn more about why they wrote to the EPA about the ruling.

(This interview has been edited for length and clarity.)

Robert Hirschfeld: We felt it was important that, for the historical record, groups from Illinois let EPA and the Trump administration know that we support strong Clean Water Act protections; strong protections for our water and our wetlands in Illinois.

I think the Trump administration has been very clear and consistent that they want to roll back water and air protections. They view those as impeding the industry's ability to pollute. And it is also important for the historical record, should lawsuits ever be filed over this redefinition.

Jess Savage: I'm curious; what would you say is important for Illinois residents to understand about the role wetlands play in their lives and at home?

RH: Wetlands are critical infrastructure. In Illinois, we already live with the loss of about 90% of our historic wetlands. Wetlands filter pollution. They keep runoff out of streams and rivers and lakes.

And wetlands are also extremely effective and valuable [for] flood reduction infrastructure. Some of the best research on wetlands shows that in Illinois alone, even just the wetlands that remain, they have a value somewhere around $750 million a year. $750 million annually in residential flood protection.

JS: What are the impacts you anticipate from this new WOTUS ruling?

RH: The impacts to Illinois are severe and dramatic. EPA’s own impact analysis shows that 94.6% of Illinois' wetlands are probably no longer going to be protected by the Federal Clean Water Act. So functionally, Illinois wetlands have been written out of the Clean Water Act.

Illinois does not have strong state wetlands protections, so Prairie Rivers Network, and many of our partners, we are trying to pass legislation where the state would step in where the federal government is stepping back. So, the state would run their own wetlands protections program, but we don't have that currently. We relied on the federal Clean Water Act.

JS: So, you at the Prairie Rivers Network drafted the formal comments, and 42 other community organizations signed on. What was it like to get that type of response?

RH: Well, on one hand, it's very heartening that all of these community organizations — including environmental groups, public health groups, labor, environmental justice and other community advocacy organizations — they all want to protect clean water, and they want to protect wetlands, and so the response was immediate and overwhelming in in their support of this.

What we are pushing for is strong, science-based protections for our water here in Illinois. And you know, frankly, the rule that's been proposed ignores the basic science of water and hydrology.

And so even though it was a disparate set of groups, both geographically and in terms of mission, I think we all share an interest in defending Illinois water quality and ecosystems and public health. Illinois lawmakers should take note that there's widespread and broad desire to protect Illinois wetlands.

JS: What are the next steps for you at the Prairie Rivers Network?",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4548eb2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1075+0+278/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc9%2F02%2F9cb62c544f729ce6964763a37494%2F250724-wnij-volostock-img-16.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 10:02:13.381238

In the first year of his second term, President Donald Trump worked across agencies to roll back practical and political momentum to address the climate crisis.

Experts say the array of administration policies supporting the fossil fuel industry could halve U.S. progress on reducing carbon emissions, and actions such as withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement are projected to erase at least 0.1°C (0.18°F) of international efforts to limit warming by 2100.

Rolling Back Climate Policy

Trump’s interagency effort to roll back critical climate policies began immediately. An executive order (EO) signed on the first day of Trump’s second term titled “Unleashing American Energy” ordered additional oil and gas exploration, accelerated permitting for such drilling, eliminated credits and regulations favoring electric vehicles, and revoked 12 climate- and energy-related EOs issued by the administration of President Joe Biden.

In March, the EPA indicated it would move to reconsider the 2009 Endangerment Finding, which states that greenhouse gases “threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations.” The Endangerment Finding underpins the federal government’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, power plants, oil and gas facilities, and factories.

On 29 July, the EPA formally proposed to rescind the finding, and the Department of Energy (DOE) published a report finding that carbon dioxide–induced warming “appears to be less damaging economically than commonly believed,” that U.S. policy actions have “undetectably small direct impacts on the global climate,” and that claims of increased frequency or intensity of storms are “not supported” by historical data.

In September, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine conducted their own review, stating that “EPA’s 2009 finding that the human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases threaten human health and welfare was accurate” and is “beyond scientific dispute.” In a letter to the National Academies, House Oversight Chair James Comer (R-KY) dismissed the review as a “blatant partisan act to undermine the Trump Administration.”

In August, the American Meteorological Society published a report identifying “five foundational flaws” in the DOE report that each place the report “at odds with scientific principles and practices.”

In addition to reconsidering the Endangerment Finding, the Trump administration immediately began to dismantle the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a $27 billion lending program meant to spur private investment in clean energy. In March, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin terminated $20 billion of this funding. Numerous lawsuits followed, but in July, Trump rescinded all funding for the program.

In February, Congress repealed a Biden era rule implementing a federal tax on methane pollution, which would have been the United States’ first tax on greenhouse gases. In June, the administration also proposed to rescind all greenhouse gas emissions standards for coal-, oil-, and gas-fired power plants.

The One Big Beautiful Bill, the omnibus spending bill that became law on 4 July, removes or rapidly phases out most clean energy, electric vehicle, and clean manufacturing tax credits introduced by Biden’s key climate bill, the Inflation Reduction Act. While reducing support for clean energy projects, the law also grants $40 billion in new subsidies and tax credits to the fossil fuel industry through 2035, according to a report from Oil Change International, an anti–fossil fuel advocacy group.

In total, the One Big Beautiful Bill is expected to cut the development of new clean-power-generating capacity by up to 59% through 2035, according to a report by the Rhodium Group. An analysis by Carbon Brief and Princeton University found the passage of the law will set the United States up to drop emissions to 3% below current levels by 2030 rather than the 40% mandated by the Paris Agreement.

In November, the EPA announced it would delay methane emissions reduction requirements set by the Biden administration, giving oil and gas companies until January 2027 to comply. In December, the White House and Department of Transportation announced a proposal to revoke vehicle fuel efficiency standards that were tightened in 2024. The administration is expected to finalize this proposal in 2026.

Boosting Fossil Fuels, Obstructing Renewables

Trump’s declaration of a “national energy emergency” gave federal agency heads authority to grant emergency approvals to expedite the completion of energy projects.

“We’re going to drill, baby, drill,” Trump said after being sworn in. That day, Trump issued an executive order (EO) to resume processing permit applications for new liquefied natural gas projects, which had been halted under Biden.

In an April EO seeking to revive the “beautiful clean coal industry,” the Trump administration directed agencies to identify possible new coal resources on federal lands. The order also laid out plans to identify and revise existing regulations and policies that might lead the country away from coal power or coal production. “It is the policy of the United States that coal is essential to our national and economic security,” the EO states.

Also in April, the Department of the Interior said it intended to fast-track approvals for coal, gas, oil, and mineral projects. The administration opened up millions of acres of federal land to oil and gas companies and additional millions of acres to potential coal mining projects. In September, the DOE announced it would invest $625 million to retrofit and modernize aging coal power plants, followed by an additional $100 million in federal funding for similar projects. In May, the administration ordered a coal power plant in Michigan to abandon its plans to shut down, citing a “shortage of electric energy” in the Midwest. In December, it also ordered two coal plants in Indiana, two in Colorado, and one in Washington to remain open.

Among the federal land opened to oil drilling is the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, an iconic wilderness area in northern Alaska. In October, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced the federal government would open 1.56 million acres (631,000 hectares) of the refuge to oil and gas leasing, reversing a Biden moratorium on drilling activity there.

In November, the administration announced it planned to open almost 1.3 billion additional acres (526 million hectares) of U.S. coastal waters to new oil and gas drilling. The One Big Beautiful Bill mandated at least 36 oil and gas lease sales in federal waters.

“An offshore lease issued next year could keep pumping carbon into the atmosphere for the next 40 years,” Rebecca Loomis, an attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told The New York Times.

Renewable energy projects have mostly received the opposite treatment, as federal agencies made a concerted effort to halt existing solar and wind energy projects and slow the permitting and approval process for new ones. Trump took particular aim at wind energy: An EO on the first day of his term withdrew all new offshore wind energy lease opportunities and suggested the possibility of terminating or amending existing leases. A coalition of state attorneys sued the administration, saying Trump does not have the authority to unilaterally make such mandates. In December, a federal judge wrote that the EO violated federal law.

“This arbitrary and unnecessary directive threatens the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and billions in investments, and it is delaying our transition away from the fossil fuels that harm our health and our planet,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said of the EO.

Solar projects have suffered, too. The Trump administration slowed development on a solar project in Nevada that, if built, would be one of the world’s largest. In October, the EPA canceled $7 billion in grants for a popular clean energy program, Solar for All, meant to help low- and moderate-income households install solar.

Oil and gas permitting, but not renewable energy permitting, continued during the 44-day government shutdown this fall, as the Trump administration approved more than 470 permits to drill on public land. After the January 2026 military action in Venezuela, President Trump announced the country “will be turning over” 30-50 million barrels of oil and that the federal government would maintain control over Venezuela’s oil industry.

Hindering Climate Science

As the Trump administration hindered clean energy projects and boosted fossil fuels, it also targeted climate science. In February, Trump prohibited federal scientists from traveling to take part in a planning meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Federal scientists were reportedly told to stop work on all IPCC-related activities, though some nonfederal U.S. scientists are still involved.

In April, the administration dismissed all scientists working on the United States’ own National Climate Assessment (NCA). In July, a spokeswoman for NASA told The New York Times that NASA would no longer host previous NCAs online. AGU and the American Meteorological Society have responded by creating a special collection on climate change to help catalyze and advance synthesis science to inform our understanding of risks and solutions for U.S. climate research and assessments. In December, the Trump administration asked a group of scientists known for their climate skepticism—the same group that authored the DOE report undermining the 2009 Endangerment Finding—to write the next installment of the NCA.

Additionally, many programs and offices collecting and analyzing climate data were shuttered this year because budgets were cut and staff were fired, creating a widening climate data void. In April, for example, the EPA failed for the first time to meet the obligations of a 1992 treaty setting greenhouse gas reporting requirements for wealthy countries. The Environmental Defense Fund released the data after filing a Freedom of Information Act request. The same month, political appointees told EPA staff that they planned to virtually eliminate the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which requires the country’s largest industrial sites to report their emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide.

“The public has a right to know how much climate pollution is being emitted,” Vickie Patton, an attorney at the Environmental Defense Fund, told The New York Times. “The attack on the data, the attack on the science, is irresponsible.”

Pieces of signature energy reports from the Energy Information Administration, a data-tracking arm of the Department of Energy, were removed, while the publication of its International Energy Outlook for 2025 was scrapped.

NOAA, once identified as “one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry,” has come under intense scrutiny. Under the Trump administration, the agency ended support for key data products at the National Snow and Ice Data Center, retired its Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters data product (though the nonprofit Climate Central is bringing it back to life), suspended work on a massive dataset meant to predict extreme rainfall, and consolidated climate data hosted on Climate.gov on another NOAA domain. The administration also canceled its lease for NOAA’s Global Monitoring Laboratory in Hilo, Hawaii, an important site for scientists tracking carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Trump proposed cutting virtually all funding for climate research at NOAA, though Congress is considering spending bills that include much more modest cuts. Congress is also considering a bill that would ensure the uninterrupted storage of NOAA datasets indefinitely.

NASA’s climate programs suffered, too: This spring, the Trump administration began the process of shrinking the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which maintains critical climate data records. And over the summer, the administration directed NASA employees to draw up plans to end satellite missions designed to monitor carbon dioxide emissions. Acting Administrator Sean Duffy made clear the agency will deprioritize all climate science.

The Department of the Interior cut funding to a third of the U.S. Geological Survey’s Climate Adaptation Science Centers, which funds projects aimed to help people, wildlife, land, and water adapt to local effects of climate change. This includes mapping risks of wildfire and flooding, maintaining infrastructure such as storm drains, and assessing fish and wildlife populations for both hunting and conservation.

The Trump administration also axed funding for the U.S. Global Change Research Program, a decades-old congressionally mandated interagency climate research program. And in November, a new organizational plan for the Energy Department no longer showed various offices that had overseen clean energy technology development.

More than 100 National Science Foundation (NSF) grants for climate-related science have been canceled as well. In December, the Trump administration announced that it would dismantle the NSF-funded National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), one of the world’s leading climate and Earth science laboratories.

The administration also systematically removed mentions of climate change and related language from agency websites and directed the Department of Energy not to use certain language, including the words “green” and “decarbonization.” The EPA also erased references linking human activities to climate change from sections of its website.

And while geoengineering has not been a priority of the Trump administration, Rep. Marjorie Tayler Greene (R-GA) introduced the Clear Skies Act in July, which would impose $100,000 fines and potential jail time for anyone conducting “weather modification” activities.

Stalling Global Progress

The Trump administration’s approach to climate and energy policy has reverberated globally. The administration’s decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement (to take effect in January 2026) will set global projected emissions back 0.1°C (0.18°F) by 2100, according to a United Nations report.

The same EO that withdraws the United States from the Paris Agreement also directs the administration to revoke contributions to international climate finance funds. This directive means the global climate finance goal agreed upon at COP29 (the 29th Conference of the Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change) will be much more difficult to meet. In March, the administration also pulled the United States out of the Board of the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage, a U.N. climate damage fund created at COP28 dedicated to helping finance developing countries’ climate adaptation efforts. The same month, the United States withdrew from the Just Energy Transition Partnership, an international collaboration formed at COP26 meant to help developing countries implement clean energy.

The Trump administration did not attend COP30 in Belém, Brazil, a move that other leaders admonished. “Mr. Trump is against humankind,” said Colombian President Gustavo Petro. It was the first time in COP history that the United States did not send a delegation.

In January 2026, the White House issued an EO ordering the withdrawal of the United States from the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, a 1992 treaty that set the legal framework for international negotiations on climate change. According to the terms of the treaty, the formal withdrawal will occur one year after the government submits paperwork to the U.N., after which the United States will be the only country not engaged in the global agreement. The EO also ordered the withdrawal of the United States from the IPCC.

At an International Energy Agency meeting held in London in April, Trump administration staff members opposed policies to regulate fossil fuels. In September, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright traveled to Italy to attend the world’s largest natural gas conference. While in Europe, Wright urged European governments to ditch methane regulations, called net-zero goals “a colossal train wreck,” and downplayed the risks of climate change. “It’s turned out that not only does climate change not look to be an urgent threat…but doing something about it has proven remarkably difficult,” Wright told reporters in Brussels.

The Trump administration also attempted to use economic levers to encourage other nations to walk back their climate goals. In July, for instance, the administration agreed to reduce some tariffs on the European Union (EU) if the EU purchased $750 billion in American oil and gas. In December, the Trump administration asked the EU to exempt US oil and gas companies that sell oil and gas to Europe from European methane regulations.

Next Steps

Despite criticism of the DOE report and widespread opposition to the reconsideration of the rule—even Tesla wants to preserve it—the EPA is expected to move forward with revoking the Endangerment Finding in early 2026. The decision is expected to face serious legal challenges, and the Trump administration faces an ongoing lawsuit from the Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists over the controversial DOE report. Final repeals of federal vehicle fuel economy standards and power plant emissions limits are also expected in early 2026.

The future of climate programs like the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, Solar for All, electric vehicle infrastructure funds, and other climate-related grants likely lies in the courts, not the ballot box. Environmental groups and other stakeholders have filed multiple lawsuits challenging these actions, and they are still proceeding through the legal system. A coalition of states has even sued Trump and his administration over the president’s initial declaration of a “national energy emergency.”

PEER Demands Accounting from Interior Department Over “Freedom250” Use of Taxpayer Funds

Diversion of Funds Raises Serious Questions

Washington, DC — Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) today sent a letter to Department of the Interior (DOI) Secretary Doug Burgum demanding detailed disclosures regarding the creation, funding, and oversight of “Freedom250,” a separate entity that has reportedly received taxpayer funds appropriated by Congress for the America250 commemoration program.

Congress authorized and funded America250 as the official, bipartisan vehicle for commemorating the nation’s 250th anniversary. That authorization established specific structures, safeguards, and lines of accountability intended to ensure lawful use of public funds and meaningful congressional oversight.

PEER’s letter raises concerns that public money may have been redirected from America250 to Freedom250, an entity operating outside the framework Congress created. If confirmed, such a diversion would raise serious questions about compliance with appropriations law, transparency requirements, and DOI’s authority to redirect congressionally authorized funds.

In its letter, PEER calls on DOI to provide prompt, public answers to the following questions:

How at least $100 million in taxpayer funds redirected to Freedom250 are being spent, including budgets, funded activities, contractors or grantees, and who holds decision-making authority;

Whether Freedom250 is raising or accepting private funds in addition to public dollars, and if so, the sources and amounts of those funds, along with safeguards to prevent conflicts of interest or political influence; and

What role, if any, the National Park Foundation is playing in supporting Freedom250, including whether Foundation funds, staff time, or in-kind resources are being used and whether those activities are consistent with its statutory mission.

“Congress created America250 to ensure that public funds for this commemoration are spent lawfully and subject to oversight,” said Tim Whitehouse, executive director of PEER. “Routing those funds through a separate entity without clear authorization or transparency undermines Congress’s intent and the public’s right to know how its money is being used.”

PEER warned that allowing a parallel entity to carry out work similar to America250 risks weakening statutory safeguards and obscuring responsibility for decisions involving substantial public expenditures.

“The Department of the Interior can address these concerns by producing a full accounting of Freedom250’s budget, disclosing all fundraising activity, and clearly explaining the legal basis for its involvement,” Whitehouse said. “Transparency and accountability are not optional when taxpayer funds are at issue — they are legal obligations.”

The letter was copied to members of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the House Committee on Natural Resources.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This news release contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information ‎within the meaning of Canadian securities legislation (collectively, ""forward-looking ‎statements"") that relate to the Company's current expectations and views of future events.","TORONTO, Jan. 15, 2026 /PRNewswire/ - PowerBank Corporation (NASDAQ: SUUN) (Cboe CA: SUNN) (FSE: 103) (""PowerBank"" or the ""Company""), a leader in North American energy infrastructure development and asset ownership, is pleased to announce that it has executed a lease agreement on a 5 MW AC hybrid solar plus battery energy storage project known as the NY-Holland Glnwd project (the ""Project""), in New York.

The Project is expected to be eligible for incentives under the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (""NYSERDA"") NY-Sun and Retail Energy Storage Incentive Programs, along with federal Investment Tax Credits under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025.

The rapid growth of wind and solar power and the rising demand for electricity from data centers are making batteries a necessity. They store surplus renewable energy for when it's not windy or sunny, and maintain a balance between energy supply and demand. There has been a 90 percent drop in the cost of batteries over the last 15 years as new factories have come on line, resulting in significant growth in this sector globally.

The Company is in the process of initiating the preliminary screening analysis as part of the interconnection process. Assuming receipt of interconnection approval, the Company will work to complete the permitting process and secure the necessary financing for the construction of the Project.

Once completed, the Project will likely be operated as a hybrid community solar plus energy storage project. Community solar is a solar project with access to the local electricity grid. Once the project is connected and generating electricity, energy from the site feeds into the local power grid. Depending on the size and number of panels the project has, dozens or even hundreds of renters and homeowners can save money from the electricity that is generated by the project. By subscribing to a project, an electricity customer can earn credits on their electric bill every month from their portion of the solar that's generated by the project, accessing the benefits of solar and energy storage without installing any equipment at their location. This allows electricity customers to realize a reduced cost per kilowatt-hour from the power they consume versus standard utility rates.

PowerBank's proven expertise, with over 100 MW of completed projects and a development pipeline exceeding 1 GW, underpins the project's execution. Strategic partnerships and institutional-grade development capabilities position PowerBank to deliver reliable, high-impact renewable energy solutions.

The Project advances New York's ambitious Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act goal of 6 GW of solar capacity by 2025. As a national leader in community solar, New York accounts for nearly one-third of the United States' 6.2 GW of installed solar capacity, and PowerBank is honored to contribute to this transformative milestone.

There are several risks associated with the development of the Project. The development of any project is subject to receipt of a community solar contract, receipt of interconnection approval, receipt of required permits, the availability of third-party financing arrangements for the Company and the risks associated with the construction of a solar power project. In addition, governments may revise, reduce or eliminate incentives and policy support schemes for solar power, which could result in future Project no longer being economic. Please refer to ""Forward-Looking Statements"" for additional discussion of the assumptions and risk factors associated with the Project and statements made in this press release.

For advanced machines requiring single-crystal blades or exotic materials, the qualification process becomes even more complex, the EPRI experts noted.
Often, however, this only becomes evident after components enter service, making them difficult to trace, the EPRI experts explained.
Supply chain challenges, combined with long-term demand growth, are driving renewed interest in advanced nuclear and long-duration energy storage, the EPRI experts noted.
The turbine bottleneck, while painful in the near term, may ultimately accelerate the transition toward a more diversified and resilient power generation fleet.","The gas turbine industry is facing its most significant supply chain challenge in decades, with backlogs extending years into the future and utilities scrambling to secure dispatchable capacity. To better understand the scope of the problem and what options utilities have, POWER spoke with John Shingledecker, principal technical executive with EPRI, and Bobby Noble, senior program manager for Gas Turbine Research and Development (R&D) with EPRI and an American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Fellow.

According to the EPRI experts, rotor forgings and hot-section blades have emerged as the primary bottlenecks, constrained by limited suppliers and highly technical manufacturing processes. The situation has grown severe enough that some large frame turbines have been shipped without rotors or blades, with installation occurring later onsite to maintain construction schedules. Delays in new hot-section blade deliveries have also driven increased emphasis on component re-use, re-manufacturing, and repair programs, they said.

Vendor Qualification Challenges

Qualifying new vendors offers no quick fix, the researchers explained. The timeline for bringing a new supplier online is highly dependent on the original equipment manufacturer (OEM), supplier, and specific component involved. Large forgings present particular challenges, the researchers noted, because only a limited number of suppliers exist globally, many of whom already serve multiple OEMs. Adding a new supplier may not significantly ease constraints if they are already engaged across the industry.

For advanced machines requiring single-crystal blades or exotic materials, the qualification process becomes even more complex, the EPRI experts noted. While raw material availability is generally not the issue, materials costs are driving up prices. Competition for nickel superalloys and cobalt has intensified, particularly with the rise of lithium-ion batteries. Aerospace and energy were once the primary users of cobalt, but battery demand now exerts strong influence on pricing, they said.

A Different Demand Driver

Unlike the gas turbine boom of the late 2000s, which was driven primarily by low gas prices, today’s demand stems from multiple converging factors, according to Shingledecker and Noble. These include near-term needs from data centers, limited dispatchable power options due to increasing non-dispatchable resources on the grid, and long-term electricity growth from electrification. New coal generation is no longer a viable option for most utilities, and natural gas supplies are more abundant than previously thought during the first boom, providing added stability for gas-fired generation investment.

Data centers are driving particularly acute short-term demand for dispatchable power, the EPRI researchers said. While they are not typically competing for large-frame turbines, they do compete directly with utilities for small- and mid-sized turbines in the 30 MW to 100 MW range—prime peaker territory. This competition has opened opportunities for new market entrants.

Near-Term Options for Utilities

For utilities needing capacity by 2028 but facing backlogs extending to 2030, options remain limited but available. According to the EPRI experts, many utilities are extending the life of existing thermal assets, pursuing repowering projects, and implementing turbine uprates through technologies such as inlet fogging and advanced modifications. EPRI, in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Energy Technology Laboratory, is exploring uprate scenarios with potential double-digit percentage increases in output, they said. Meanwhile, renewables paired with battery storage continue to be part of the capacity mix.

The capacity pressure is accelerating adoption of smaller, modular solutions, the researchers noted. Orders for turbines under 20 MW reached record highs in 2025, and reciprocating internal combustion engine (RICE)-based power plants are also gaining traction. Aeroderivative units offer flexibility and rapid deployment, though they face similar backlog pressures due to competition with the commercial aviation industry for components and manufacturing capacity.

Quality and Market Dynamics

When supply chains are stretched, quality problems sometimes emerge. Often, however, this only becomes evident after components enter service, making them difficult to trace, the EPRI experts explained. EPRI’s research, including process compensated resonance testing (PCRT), has proven instrumental in detecting quality issues early. Past differences between vendors have been identified through serial number structures, they said.

The competitive landscape is also evolving. While GE Vernova, Mitsubishi Power, and Siemens Energy remain dominant, some reshuffling is expected, according to Shingledecker and Noble. Doosan Enerbility recently entered the North American market, signaling new competition. However, with the overall market expanding due to growing demand, market share shifts may be less significant than the overall growth in opportunity.

Long-Term Implications

Predicting how long the backlog will persist remains difficult, the researchers acknowledged. Expanding factory capacity and onboarding new vendors is a long-term process, not a quick fix. The prolonged turbine unavailability could alter the generation mix for 2030 and beyond.

Supply chain challenges, combined with long-term demand growth, are driving renewed interest in advanced nuclear and long-duration energy storage, the EPRI experts noted. Utilities increasingly recognize the need for diverse generation portfolios to manage risks related to supply chains, fuel costs, and system flexibility, they said. The turbine bottleneck, while painful in the near term, may ultimately accelerate the transition toward a more diversified and resilient power generation fleet.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/fig1-ge-gas-turbine.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 10:01:57.000217

It allows us to harness the energy of the sun and use it in our homes and businesses.

This article shines a light on the rapid growth of solar energy in Europe in recent years and its benefits for both consumers and the EU as a whole.

Solar technology at a glance

A range of solar technologies are available to harness the sun’s energy in different ways.

Solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, comprised of individual solar cells, convert sunlight into electricity.

Solar thermal panels harness the sun’s heat and are primarily used to heat water and spaces in buildings, can provide steam for industry, or even air conditioning and cooling.

Concentrated solar power technology uses mirrors to concentrate sunlight and produce heat and steam to generate electricity.

Growth of solar energy in Europe

The growth of solar energy in Europe in recent years is a trajectory we can all be proud of.

Solar PV has become the most competitive source of electricity in many parts of the EU, thanks to massive decreases in its cost. Eurostat reports that 47.5% of the EU’s electricity consumption came from renewables in 2024, of which solar PV accounted for almost a quarter at 23.4%, and in June 2025, for the first time in history, the sun was the main source of the electricity we generated!

The EU’s solar PV capacity reached an estimated 406 GW in 2025. This is compared to 338 GW in 2024 and comfortably surpasses the objective of the EU Solar Energy strategy from 2022 that aimed at reaching 380 GW by 2025 (source: SolarPower Europe).

Meanwhile, 11 million rooftops in Europe are equipped with solar thermal and thermal storage. The total installed capacity of solar thermal in mainland Europe was 41 GW in 2023. (source: Solar Heat Europe).

What are the benefits of solar energy for households and businesses?

Solar photovoltaic and solar thermal panels can be installed on rooftops and even integrated into buildings, for instance as solar roof tiles or facades. In some EU countries, homeowners and tenants can install plug-in mini-solar panels on balcony railings, walls or terraces.

If more energy than needed is produced by solar PV panels at a given moment, it can be

stored in local batteries or in local thermal storage

shared with other consumers

injected to the electricity grid and sold

While not every building is suitable for installing solar panels, energy communities and energy sharing solutions mean that you can still enjoy the benefits of this clean and cheap energy source, even if it’s not possible to install them on your own building.

Solar thermal can be a great source of clean and affordable hot water and space heat not only for homes, but also industry. Examples of industries using solar thermal in the EU include the paper industry, agri-food, the flowers industry and the beverages industry.

What are the benefits of solar energy for the EU as a whole?

Solar energy has a significant role to play in the EU’s transition towards cleaner, more affordable and secure energy, and our journey to become the world’s first climate neutral continent by 2050. Listed as one of the key technologies in the Net Zero Industry Act, which is aiming at scaling up the manufacturing of clean technologies in the EU, solar PV and solar thermal are expected to grow further in the coming years.

As a cheap and abundant energy source that we can produce at home, solar contributes to reducing the price of our electricity, putting the EU at a competitive advantage and helping to drive economic growth and create jobs.

The EU has a strong manufacturing base for solar thermal, with 90% of our demand already met by EU production. The EU countries with the largest solar thermal installed capacity are Germany (13 285 MWth), followed by Greece (4 2024 MWth) and Italy (3 829 MWth), according to Solar Heat Europe.

An estimated 7.2 million people were employed in solar PV in 2024, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency’s Annual Review 2025. 10.6% of these jobs were located in the EU, providing employment for an estimated 764 400 people. Additionally, solar heating and cooling and concentrated solar power contributed 19 000 and 5 000 jobs respectively.

Furthermore, solar PV generation is often decentralised in nature, which can play a key role in strengthening our energy system’s resilience. Although solar is a variable energy source, meaning it cannot be produced 24/7, the energy produced can be stored and shared, allowing solar systems to supply electricity even at night or during grid disruptions.

A neon pink sign flashes these words—part of an installation by artist Alicia Eggert—at a DC museum just steps from the White House. Until a year ago, I often used an image of this art installation in my work presentations, to illustrate a particular point.

Among my responsibilities at the White House and then at the US Department of Transportation was working on the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the CHIPS and Science Act, as a means of tackling the climate crisis. This trifecta of legislative victories represented more climate progress than I could have imagined in ten years of prior advocacy at UCS. I used that presentation slide to help the public, universities, and state and local decision makers see that a brighter future was possible because of the ambitious investments being made by the federal government towards climate and clean energy goals.

Unfortunately, there is also a flip side to those words. In the year since I’ve returned to UCS, we’ve seen a different unimaginable future unfold, in which the Trump administration has worked to destroy all of that climate and clean energy progress; disrupt longstanding government programs and processes; and disregard the rule of law. The administration has clawed back funding that was agreed on by Congress and promised to scientific institutions, illegally fired federal employees, and gutted congressionally mandated programs. President Trump and his administration have rolled back policies protecting our health, safety, and environment; set new policies with no regard for data and evidence; silenced people’s voices on issues that affect them; given polluting industries free rein; denied climate science; and taken step after step towards authoritarianism. There is no recent precedent for all of this; even for those of us who read each page of the Heritage Foundation’s “Project 2025,” this present moment was unimaginable.

The scope, severity, and speed of attacks on science have been dizzying. But if the past year has taught us anything, it’s that we are not powerless to stop them. Across the country, scientists and science supporters have organized and fought back in response to the Trump administration’s actions, and UCS has embraced our role in leading the charge.

Early in the new term, UCS led an effort to unify the scientific community with a sign-on letter boasting signatories from 56 scientific societies representing more than 100,000 scientists. We took our defense of science to the courts, filing lawsuits focused on the administration’s illegal actions: against the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) for acting beyond their power to cut funding and fire federal employees; against administration officials for trying to base policy off of an unlawfully created report from a secretly convened group of climate contrarians; and challenging the Trump administration’s removal of public information from climate and environmental justice federal agency websites. After the first 100 days of the administration, UCS launched the “You Need Science. Science Needs You” campaign, connecting supporters to their elected officials to demand that funding for US science be preserved.

As the administration disbanded and weakened scientific advisory committees that provide analyses for important decisions about our health, UCS provided guidance for experts to launch their own independent committees, and supported many such efforts—which represent a huge contribution of time and expertise in the name of ensuring science reaches those who need it.

Throughout the year, we helped organize and turned out for mass mobilizations across the country, including the Stand up for Science rally, and sponsoring the most recent No Kings protest last October. I co-authored an editorial in Science magazine that provides a roadmap to resistance specifically for scientists—because I truly believe we were made for this moment. We armed our supporters, including our growing Science Network of experts, with a toolkit for engaging their elected officials during the August Congressional recess.

We’ve sent our experts to testify against dangerous policy proposals, brought widespread media attention to the communities facing the greatest risks to their health and safety because of the administration’s actions, and rallied the scientific community to fight together. And all year long, the scientific community published op-eds, attended Congressional meetings, and organized across the country: making it loud and clear that the anti-science actions of the Trump administration are unacceptable.

I’m heartened by the moral clarity and persistence of those around me who remain committed to science and its role in informing decisions that affect us all. Let’s be real: the consequences of standing up to this administration can be scary. Plenty of people have lost their jobs, their funding, their life’s work (and even their homes, loved ones, and lives) to its capricious cruelty. Because of that, we might not have anticipated such a strong response. It’s not easy to resist an authoritarian regime—or even a wannabe authoritarian regime.

But. We. Showed. Up. And we’re not going anywhere.

As we enter 2026, we’re going to build on our achievements and doggedly continue doing the work we know is right, and necessary. This includes making more progress on climate and clean energy at the state level, carrying on momentum from last year’s huge wins in California, Maine, and Illinois. We’ll keep shining a light on the administration’s attacks on science, for accountability and to publicize the human toll these policy decisions exact. We’ll be releasing more groundbreaking scientific research into quantifying the climate harms caused by massive tech companies and industrial agriculture, tracking the implications of two major international court decisions last year, and supporting existing cases against Big Oil with our expertise and advocacy. We’ll be calling out bad actors from Big Ag to the federal government. And most importantly, we’ll be doing this in partnership with the scientific community at large, offering many opportunities for scientists and science supporters to get involved and speak up for what matters.

We must set our eyes on a different kind of unimaginable future—one where our hard work in the trenches defending our progress and advancing our goals pays off. A future in which we fully realize a safer, healthier, and more equitable world because of our steadfast commitment to science for the people.

Hochberg,,,,,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2026-01-15/housing-affordability-small-business-administration-home-disaster-loan-program,"Nearly 70% of American adults polled recently said that the central promise of the American Dream — that hard work can earn a good life — is no longer true or never was.
At the center of this squeeze is housing — the cornerstone of the American Dream.
The program costs about $1 billion to operate, a relatively small portion of the Small Business Administration’s budget.
Would this one quick fix solve the housing crisis?
If done right, this would ease housing costs while serving nearly everyone’s interests.","Nearly 70% of American adults polled recently said that the central promise of the American Dream — that hard work can earn a good life — is no longer true or never was.

It’s easy to understand why. Decades of policy choices, rising costs and stagnant wages have eroded the path that once led from work to security. An affordability crisis is continuing to hammer working- and middle-class Americans, making it harder than ever for many just to get by. At the center of this squeeze is housing — the cornerstone of the American Dream.

Home prices are 50% higher today than they were only five years ago — and Americans’ paychecks have not grown to match. Young people, in particular, have been left out in the cold: The average age of first-time home buyers has climbed to 40, the highest on record.

A number of ideas have been floated to address this crisis, including a ban on large institutional investors scooping up private homes — an approach put forward by congressional Democrats multiple times in recent years and raised anew by President Trump earlier this month. Some of these ideas have merit; others do not. But nearly all would take years to implement.

What if there were already a program on the books that could help solve the problem right now?

At the Small Business Administration, where I once served as the deputy and acting administrator, a little-known initiative called the Home Disaster Loan program has been in operation since the 1960s, providing long-term home loans at a low, fixed interest rate for people whose homes or businesses have been damaged by natural disasters. These loans have served as a lifeline for Americans experiencing disasters, and versions of this program have been expanded during broader moments of crisis, including in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Americans today are in a crisis of affordability — so why not expand the program to reach them?

Congress could amend the Disaster Loan program and instantly drop mortgage rates by about 2.25 percentage points, to about 4%, for millions of Americans. For a roughly typical home buyer — seeking a $500,000 house, and making an 18% down payment — this simple change would cut the monthly mortgage payment to $1,950 from $2,450, saving about $6,000 a year.

Crucially, this would not impose a major burden on taxpayers. In 2024, the Home Disaster Loan program issued about 18,000 loans, with interest rates subsidized to allow homeowners and businesses to borrow at the same rate the government does. The program costs about $1 billion to operate, a relatively small portion of the Small Business Administration’s budget. And because taxpayers are on the hook only for the cost of defaults, even a major expansion of the program wouldn’t create a serious cost burden relative to the widespread benefits that would come from cooling off the housing market.

To help mitigate those costs, Congress should maintain the program’s current cap: The loans aren’t available for homes over $500,000. The agency already has strong underwriting standards that ensure that loans go to dependable borrowers, not the subprime candidates whom some past government lending supported. Loans should also be made available to the many current homeowners who would love to buy a new house, but who are inadvertently keeping the housing market frozen because they feel trapped in starter homes they bought at favorable rates.

Would this one quick fix solve the housing crisis? Of course not. But by lowering the financial barrier to homeownership for many, it could help take the pressure off the housing market in much the same way America did a century ago with the advent of the 30-year mortgage — a simple innovation that helped lift homeownership from under half of American families to nearly two-thirds. The policy change I am proposing could bring about a similar effect on a smaller scale: cooling prices, eliminating volatility by replacing constantly shifting interest rates with a friendly and stable option, and opening the door for more Americans to own their own home.

The president’s recent openness to cracking down on high home prices — an issue long popular with Democrats — suggests that there may be a political opening for Congress and the White House to get something done.

If done right, this would ease housing costs while serving nearly everyone’s interests. It serves traditional liberal values by helping raise the standard of living of working Americans. It serves traditional conservative values by bringing more stability and less transience to our communities. And at a time when our leaders have struggled to improve affordability, it offers a concrete step in the right direction — one that the president, who prides himself as a builder, may find attractive.

At a time when Americans are losing faith not only in the American Dream but also in the capacity and willingness of our leaders to defend it, expanding the Home Disaster Loan program can be a small part of the antidote: a simple, immediate, tangible, bipartisan action that can improve people’s lives and help restore that dream — today.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8d39b5b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+254/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa8%2F77%2F13acfda24b18b5e71e01a52268e6%2F57356464.JPG,N,,2026-01-15 10:02:03.677854

While far from exhaustive, here are some of the major assaults on climate and clean energy from the Trump administration that we’ve seen in the last year: 1.
Clawing back renewable energy funding and attacking clean energy projects The administration has illegally frozen and clawed back billions in funding for climate and cutting-edge clean energy investments, including Department of Energy (DOE) grants and the Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.
DOE Secretary Chris Wright has repeatedly attacked clean energy, rolled back energy efficiency standards, overseen mass staff cuts at the agency, and renamed the world-renowned National Renewable Energy Laboratory to strike “renewable energy” from its name.","As we come up on the one-year mark of the second Trump administration, it’s painful to reflect on all that’s been lost on climate and clean energy progress for our nation and the grave consequences for people and the economy. As families across the nation struggle to pay their rising energy bills, the Trump administration’s efforts to gut clean energy projects and boost volatile, risky, and polluting fossil fuels are a threat to health and pocketbooks. And with the world on the brink of breaching 1.5°C of global warming, this administration’s actions to increase US heat-trapping emissions will have profound implications for years to come.

Fair warning, this blogpost covers some pretty grim ground. But stick with me, please. Documenting the harms and injustices perpetuated by this administration now, as they occur, ensures we bear witness and that the hard work that made prior progress possible is not erased. Let’s make sure we don’t forget the important details as we fight to build a better, brighter future beyond this dark time. A healthier, safer, and more equitable future is ours to create, as UCS President Gretchen Goldman says.

Annus horribilis for people in the United States

From Day One, it was clear that this deeply anti-science administration was intent on blatantly furthering a fossil fuel agenda—people’s health and welfare be damned. President Trump has assembled around him an extremely unqualified, obsequious cabinet and set of advisors, most of whom have no dedication to the public interest and are instead devoted to doing his every bidding.

This increasingly authoritarian regime has operated with impunity to tear up climate and clean energy policies, lie about the scientific realities of climate change and the facts on renewable energy, and ram through measures to boost fossil fuels and the profits of polluters. They have attacked the federal scientific enterprise built up over decades through taxpayer investments, fired or forced out agency experts, and cut funding for critical science. And a compliant Congress has enabled this destructive agenda, including by rubberstamping some of the President’s illegal actions and by failing to exercise its constitutional powers to check his tyrannical power grabs. The passage of the OBBBA, with its multiple provisions directly aimed at undermining clean energy—including wind, solar, batteries, grid infrastructure, and energy efficiency—at the President’s behest was a particularly egregious example of this.

The Sabin Center’s Climate Backtracker shows that, as of January 14, 2026, the Trump administration has taken nearly 300 actions to scale back or halt climate and clean energy progress. UCS’s six-month report on the Trump administration summarized many of the attacks on science and democracy as of July 2025. Many of these actions were previewed in the Project 2025 manifesto, but the magnitude of the harms, and the speed and intensity of the attacks, are shocking, and the impacts have been mounting.

Early destructive actions were taken by DOGE, spearheaded by Elon Musk, taking a hatchet to federal agencies tasked with protecting the public interest and advancing science and innovation. Subsequently, Director of the Office of Management and Budget Russell Vought, an architect of Project 2025, has taken a personal and vicious role in many of these attacks (see here and here, for example).

And unfortunately, the full weight of the impacts on people and our economy are only going to become clearer this year, as words and cuts are translated into lived realities for communities across the country. At the same time, many of the administration’s unlawful actions are being challenged in court, and it has lost many of these cases, putting some brakes on some of its worst excesses.

Before diving further into details, it’s important to note two key themes: The Trump administration’s destructive actions are a direct threat to our health, our economic well-being, and to our nation’s ability to build a thriving, fair, innovative economy. These actions demonstrate an utterly corrupt government hell-bent on prioritizing the interests of polluters and billionaires over the needs of ordinary people.

While far from exhaustive, here are some of the major assaults on climate and clean energy from the Trump administration that we’ve seen in the last year:

1. Attacking agencies and organizations engaged in life-saving climate science research, data collection and monitoring

This has included threats to dismantle NOAA and NSF-NCAR; disbanding the author team for the sixth National Climate Assessment; taking down the US Global Change Research Program’s website, which includes all previous National Climate Assessments; and halting US federal scientists’ engagement with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). NOAA, the nation’s foremost climate science agency, has faced reckless firing of staff, budget cuts, and slashed resources for climate research, satellite programs, data, and modeling.

Under Department of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick’s watch, the agency’s weather forecasting and climate monitoring capabilities are being undermined and many National Weather Service offices have been dangerously understaffed—undercutting critical resources that communities, first responders, farmers, mariners, businesses, and local decisionmakers rely on to protect lives, infrastructure, and economic activity. It’s crucial that the forthcoming Congressional appropriations process rejects the Trump administration’s budget proposals and restores healthy funding levels for federal science agencies.

2. Clawing back renewable energy funding and attacking clean energy projects

The administration has illegally frozen and clawed back billions in funding for climate and cutting-edge clean energy investments, including Department of Energy (DOE) grants and the Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. These actions have been challenged in court, and just this week a court has ruled that the Trump administration’s cancellation of some grants based on which states grantees are in violates the law.

DOE Secretary Chris Wright has repeatedly attacked clean energy, rolled back energy efficiency standards, overseen mass staff cuts at the agency, and renamed the world-renowned National Renewable Energy Laboratory to strike “renewable energy” from its name.

In addition to the major harms to clean energy inflicted by the OBBBA, the administration has also repeatedly and arbitrarily intervened in the leasing and permitting of a huge range of renewable energy projects, including pausing offshore wind, onshore wind, and solar projects. Wind and solar developers have just sued the Department of the Interior and the Army Corps of Engineers for “pursuing a concerted and illegal strategy to choke the ability of private developers’ ability to build new and much-needed energy generation projects.” Numerous attacks have been lobbed at offshore wind projects—including projects that were nearly completed—most recently by citing bogus “national security” considerations. The administration just suffered a major setback in a case brought by Revolution Wind, a project of Ørsted, a Danish offshore wind developer. These attacks on renewable energy have been accompanied by a raft of disinformation spouted by the President and his administration, contrary to the facts about the tremendous economic and health benefits of renewable energy, including solar and wind.

3. Gutting pollution standards and boosting fossil fuels

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator Lee Zeldin has launched an all-out assault on regulations, guidance, and scientific research aimed at protecting public health and the environment. This has included weakening, rescinding, or delaying EPA regulations to limit heat-trapping pollution from power plants, vehicles and the oil and gas industry, as well as giving exemptions to polluters causing toxic air pollution from coal-fired power plants and other industrial sources.

The agency is also in the final stages of a process to overturn the science-based Endangerment Finding, a bedrock legal determination establishing the health-harming impacts of heat-trapping emissions. And in a major departure from precedent and long-standing best practice, EPA is also moving away from quantifying the public health impacts— including lives lost or saved—associated with agency rulemakings, debuting this egregious practice in a just-released rule for NOx pollution standards for new gas turbines. This alarming action is a complete capitulation to polluter interests and upends the agency’s mission to protect public health and the environment.

They’ve also taken unprecedented steps to cut the public out of the process of weighing in by eliminating the customary notice-and-comment period for regulations they arbitrarily designate ‘unlawful,’ and a sweeping executive order essentially allows agencies to wipe off whatever regulations they want to—as well as enforcement of those regulations in the time between.

The administration has also launched multiple direct attempts to boost coal, oil, and gas use under the guise of a spurious “national energy emergency.” DOE Secretary Chris Wright and Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum—both with deep fossil fuel industry ties—have aggressively embraced the president’s fossil fuel agenda. Burgum’s actions have included expanding oil and gas leases on public lands, rescinding requirements for environmental impact statements, and fast-tracking permits for fossil fuel energy, all while repeatedly interfering to stop deployment of renewables. The administration’s latest shocking move in this vein is its imperial and illegal grab for Venezuelan oil.

4. Attacking FEMA’s disaster response capabilities and investments in climate resilience

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has overseen the firing and forcing out of more than 20 percent of FEMA’s staff already, with further steep cuts to FEMA’s “Cadre of On-Call Response/Recovery Employees” (CORE) expected imminently. At various points last year, Secretary Noem and President Trump went as far as calling for FEMA’s abolition! The agency has faced unending turmoil and dysfunction, with a series of unqualified acting chiefs quitting or being fired only to be replaced by yet another poor choice. This chaos led to major gaps in responding to disasters like the Texas flash flood last year. As the GAO points out, staffing shortages at FEMA have serious consequences for the agency’s ability to do its job to help communities hit by disasters.

The Trump administration also illegally cancelled FEMA’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program grants for states, which a coalition of twenty states took the administration to court over, and recently won their lawsuit. The Trump administration has taken actions that will leave communities less prepared and more at risk from worsening climate impacts, including rescinding the science-informed federal flood risk management standard, disbanding expert advisory councils, and politicizing and delaying disaster aid for states. My colleague Shana Udvardy has been carefully tracking the attacks on FEMA, including the recent last-minute cancellation of a recent FEMA Review Council meeting where they were supposed to release a report with recommendations, which has been under threat of interference from Secretary Noem.

5. Taking down or altering climate-related websites and datasets

This includes taking down the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) website and all the previous National Climate Assessments; taking down climate.gov, a free public portal for essential information on climate science and impacts (some of the information is now being curated at climate.us); removing climate science information from the EPA website; proposing to discontinue the GHG Reporting Program and datasets (like NOAA’s billion-dollar weather and climate-related disasters dataset, and its snow and ice data products); and failing to release the EPA’s Annual GHG Inventory for the United States (which the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) successfully retrieved via a FOIA filing).

6. Lying about the facts on climate science

The most egregious example of this is the sham DOE “climate” report, which weaponized disinformation and uncertainty to downplay the risks of climate change and was invoked by EPA as part of its motivation for proposing to overturn the Endangerment Finding. This mirrors a classic strategy of employing disinformation and deception long practiced by the fossil fuel industry, now dangerously being adopted by the US government.

The Environmental Defense Fund and UCS have filed a lawsuit against the administration citing its violation of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) in the secret, illegal preparation of this report by five handpicked climate contrarians forming the Climate Working Group (CWG). The court has held that the CWG was an advisory committee subject to FACA and had ordered the administration to release all records related to its work. Other examples of this strategy include zeroing out the social cost of carbon (widely used as a measure of the monetary costs of climate damages caused by an additional ton of carbon emissions), directly ignoring the steep and mounting costs of climate change driven by fossil fuel emissions.

7. Withdrawing from international climate agreements and organizations

The most notable examples include withdrawing the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Paris Agreement. The administration also single-handedly prevented the adoption of a major global agreement on reducing emissions from shipping, negotiated in the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Over 100 nations were on the verge of signing, but using bullying tactics—including direct threats to other nations—the administration succeeded in blocking and delaying this agreement.

Together, these actions underscore that this authoritarian, anti-science administration is determined to sacrifice people’s well-being and destabilize global cooperation. But forward-looking US states and the rest of the world recognize that devastating and costly climate impacts are mounting rapidly, and collective global action remains the only viable path to secure a livable future for our children and grandchildren. Withdrawal from global climate agreements and venues will only serve to further isolate the United States and diminish its standing in the world following a spate of deplorable actions that have already sent our nation’s credibility plummeting, jeopardized ties with some of our closest historical allies, and made the world far more unsafe.

As important as these individual attacks are, it’s crucial to also see the administration’s destructive strategy: They are trying to bury the evidence on climate change to advance a pro-fossil fuel agenda that delivers huge profits for a select few while the rest of us suffer the health and economic costs. And we can’t let them because the stakes are too high, for people today and for future generations. The stakes are especially dire for communities that have long been marginalized and discriminated against, those that bear the brunt of health-harming pollution and climate impacts and lack access to affordable clean energy and climate-resilient homes, here in the United States and around the world.

Looking back and fighting for a brighter future

Why look back on such a painful year? Because it’s a way to acknowledge and honor the people who were directly and harshly affected by the actions of this administration, including federal government scientists and frontline communities. Because remembering our shared history is how we build solidarity for the inevitable fights ahead. Because adversity teaches lessons. Because I believe the seeds of the destruction of this administration’s ill-conceived policies lie in their cruel overreach. Because we can take courage and inspiration from all the ways people across the nation showed up for our democracy, for science, for their communities.

This year has also brought extraordinary efforts to expose and fight back against the worst excesses of this unhinged administration. UCS has fought alongside many others by taking the Trump administration to court; advocating with members of Congress to stand up to the administration; filing technical comments with agencies; shining a light on the latest climate science and facts about clean energy; galvanizing the scientific community to get organized, join sign-on letters and call their elected representatives; uplifting the work of environmental justice experts; securing wins in states; joining nationwide demonstrations; and using our voice loudly in every venue we can to speak truth to power.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Blog-Thumbnail-Trump-at-desk-in-oval-office.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 08:57:53.843477

South Korean battery makers are pressing ahead with large-scale investments to build 14 battery plants with a combined capacity of about 580 gigawatt-hours across seven U.S. states.","Unease has deepened across South Korea’s battery industry after vehicle battery supply contracts worth trillions of won were canceled in the United States last month. Kim Jeong-gwan, the minister of trade, industry and energy, recently met with executives from LG Energy Solution, SK On and Samsung SDI and urged them to seriously consider whether the industry’s current three-company structure remains sustainable. After petrochemicals and steel, warning lights are now flashing over secondary batteries, a pillar of South Korea’s future growth strategy.

The industry is under mounting pressure as battery demand weakens following cuts to electric vehicle subsidies in the United States and Europe, while competition from Chinese manufacturers intensifies. Europe’s reduction of EV subsidies in 2023 triggered a sharp drop in battery demand. South Korean firms saw their share of the European market fall to 48.8 percent in 2024 from 63.5 percent in 2022. By contrast, Chinese companies focused on cost-competitive lithium iron phosphate batteries increased their market share to 47.8 percent from 34 percent over the same period. Last year, South Korean battery makers were also overtaken by Chinese rivals in global market share outside China.

Conditions in the U.S. market, where order cancellations continue, are even more challenging. The shock from the Trump administration’s decision to scrap electric vehicle tax credits has rippled through the battery sector. South Korean battery makers are pressing ahead with large-scale investments to build 14 battery plants with a combined capacity of about 580 gigawatt-hours across seven U.S. states. However, cancellations by U.S. automakers now threaten their ability to fully benefit from battery production tax credits worth up to $45 per kilowatt-hour.

Batteries are a future industry with the potential to reshape the industrial paradigm. South Korean companies are struggling with high electricity costs and limited access to raw materials. Chinese firms, by contrast, have secured inputs at low cost and built massive production facilities backed by government subsidies that far exceed those available to South Korean competitors. At a time when major corporations are investing heavily for long-term growth, and when the United States and China are pouring vast public funds into advanced industries, it is unrealistic to expect voluntary restructuring under a “self-help first, government support later” principle that withholds policy backing until companies submit restructuring plans.

Private-sector self-rescue efforts are unavoidable. These include shifting production lines toward energy storage systems, where demand is rising alongside the artificial intelligence boom, or toward cost-competitive lithium iron phosphate batteries, as well as pursuing mergers and acquisitions. At the same time, government incentives must accompany these efforts to steer autonomous industrial restructuring. Possible measures include introducing advanced industry production tax credits or direct refunds for investment tax credits, as practiced in the United States and China, or extending the special electricity rate discount for energy storage systems that is set to expire this year. The government should also work to create new sources of demand, such as batteries for military drones and robotics. Regulations under the Fair Trade Act that hinder voluntary corporate restructuring should also be reviewed. Shifting responsibility entirely onto the private sector risks missing a critical window for action.",https://image.donga.com/mdonga_ad/donga800-500.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 08:00:20.974509

Relying on allies for help In addition to trying to boost domestic production, the Trump administration has sought to secure some of these crucial elements through allies.
The Biden administration sought to increase demand for critical minerals domestically by pushing for more electric vehicle and windmill production.
But the Trump administration largely eliminated the incentives for those products and instead chose to focus on increasing critical minerals production directly.","WASHINGTON (AP) — A bipartisan group of lawmakers have proposed creating a new agency with $2.5 billion to spur production of rare earths and the other critical minerals, while the Trump administration has already taken aggressive actions to break China’s grip on the market for these materials that are crucial to high-tech products, including cellphones, electric vehicles, jet fighters and missiles.

It’s too early to tell how the bill, if passed, could align with the White House’s policy, but whatever the approach, the U.S. is in a crunch to drastically reduce its reliance on China, after Beijing used its dominance of the critical minerals market to gain leverage in the trade war with Washington. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a one-year truce in October, by which Beijing would continue to export critical minerals while the U.S. would ease its export controls of U.S. technology on China.

The Pentagon has shelled out nearly $5 billion over the past year to help ensure its access to the materials after the trade war laid bare just how beholden the U.S. is to China, which processes more than 90% of the world’s critical minerals. To break Beijing’s chokehold, the U.S. government is taking equity stakes in a handful of critical mineral companies and in some cases guaranteeing the price of some commodities using an approach that seems more likely to come out of China’s playbook instead of a Republican administration.

The bill that Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., introduced Thursday would favor a more market-based approach by setting up the independent body charged with building a stockpile of critical minerals and related products, stabilizing prices, and encouraging domestic and allied production to help ensure stable supply not only for the military but also the broader economy and manufacturers.

Shaheen called the legislation “a historic investment” to make the U.S. economy more resilient against China’s dominance that she said has left the U.S. vulnerable to economic coercion. Young said creating the new reserve is “a much-needed, aggressive step to protect our national and economic security.”

Rep. Rob Wittman, R.-Va., introduced the House version of the bill.

New sense of urgency

When Trump imposed widespread tariffs last spring, Beijing fought back not only with tit-for-tat tariffs but severe restrictions on the export of critical minerals, forcing Washington to back down and eventually agree to the truce when the leaders met in South Korea.

On Monday, in his speech at SpaceX, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth revealed that the Pentagon has in the past five months alone “deployed over $4.5 billion in capital commitments” to close six critical minerals deals that will “help free the United States from market manipulation.”

One of the deals involves a $150 million of preferred equity by the Pentagon in Atlantic Alumina Co. to save the country’s last alumina refinery and build its first large-scale gallium production facility in Louisiana.

Last year, the Pentagon announced it would buy $400 million of preferred stock in MP Materials, which owns the country’s only operational rare earths mine at Mountain Pass, California, and entered into a $1.4-billion joint partnership with ReElement Technologies Corp. to build up a domestic supply chain for rare earth magnets.

On Wednesday, Trump announced in a proclamation that the U.S. is “too reliant” on foreign-sourced critical minerals and directed his administration to negotiate better deals. He said possible remedies would include minimum import prices for certain critical minerals.

“Reshoring manufacturing that’s critical to our national and economic security is a top priority for the Trump administration,” said Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson.

The drastic move by the U.S. government to take equity stakes has prompted some analysts to observe that Washington is pivoting to some form of state capitalism to compete with Beijing.

“Despite the dangers of political interference, the strategic logic is compelling,” wrote Elly Rostoum, a senior fellow at the Washington-based research institute Center for European Policy Analysis. She suggested that the new model could be “a prudent way for the U.S. to ensure strategic autonomy and industrial sovereignty.”

Companies across the industry are welcoming the intervention from Trump’s administration.

“He is playing three-dimensional chess on critical minerals like no previous president has done. It’s about time too, given the military and strategic vulnerability we face by having to import so many of these fundamental building blocks of technology and national defense,” NioCorp’s Chief Communications Officer Jim Sims said. That company is trying to finish raising the money it needs to build a mine in southeast Nebraska.

Relying on allies for help

In addition to trying to boost domestic production, the Trump administration has sought to secure some of these crucial elements through allies. In October, Trump signed an $8.5 billion agreement with Australia to invest in mining there, and the president is now aggressively trying to take over Greenland in the hope of being able to one day extract rare earths from there.

On Monday, finance ministers from the G7 nations huddled in Washington over their vulnerability in the critical mineral supply chains.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has led several rounds of trade negotiations with Beijing, urged attendees to increase their supply chain resiliency and thanked them for their willingness to work together “toward decisive action and lasting solutions,” according to a Treasury statement.

The bill introduced on Thursday by Shaheen and Young would encourage production with both domestic and allied producers.

Past efforts to bolster rare earths production

Congress in the past several years has pushed for legislation to protect the U.S. military and civilian industry from Beijing’s chokehold. The issue became a pressing concern every time China turned to its proven tactics of either restricting the supply or turned to dumping extra critical minerals on the market to depress prices and drive any potential competitors out of business.

The Biden administration sought to increase demand for critical minerals domestically by pushing for more electric vehicle and windmill production. But the Trump administration largely eliminated the incentives for those products and instead chose to focus on increasing critical minerals production directly.

Most of those past efforts were on a much more limited scale than what the government has done in the past year, and they were largely abandoned after China relented and eased access to critical minerals.

The Principal Investigators and Co-Recipients of the winning proposals are:

Artificial Intelligence: Kristen Grauman, Ph.D., Professor, Department of Computer Science, The University of Texas at Austin

Dr. Grauman has been awarded the 2026 Hill Prize in Artificial Intelligence for pioneering research on video understanding models that help people acquire physical and procedural skills. Her work addresses the complex challenge of teaching AI to interpret human activity from first‑person video—a key step toward intelligent systems that can actively support people in everyday life. With the prize funding, Dr. Grauman and her interdisciplinary team will develop new methods for AI to perceive human movement, reason across time, and deliver personalized feedback. Their innovations will power AI coaching systems on smart glasses, assisting users in contexts such as physical therapy, sports training, and household repairs. This project lays the foundation for AI that goes beyond observation to instruction, offering a transformative approach to skill development and accessibility.

Biological Sciences: Susan M. Rosenberg, Ph.D., Ben F. Love Chair in Cancer Research and Professor of Molecular & Human Genetics, Biochemistry & Molecular Pharmacology, and Molecular Virology & Microbiology, Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine

Dr. Rosenberg’s proposal was chosen for the 2026 Hill Prize in Biological Sciences for her groundbreaking strategy to combat antibiotic resistance by targeting the evolutionary process itself. Antibiotic resistance is a global health crisis, causing millions of deaths and making once-routine infections life-threatening. Conventional strategies focus on developing new antibiotics, but bacteria evolve resistance faster than new drugs can be developed – leaving current approaches increasingly unsustainable. Dr. Rosenberg’s team is pursuing a novel solution: discovering drugs that inhibit the bacterial stress responses that drive mutation and survival during antibiotic treatment. These “evolution-slowing” drugs reduce the emergence of resistant strains and improve infection clearance. Early studies identified two promising compounds, including one already FDA-approved. Her team will utilize the prize funding to screen a 14,000-compound drug library to identify additional candidates, study their mechanisms and test their ability to boost antibiotic effectiveness in animal models. The long-term goal is to move successful candidates into clinical trials, beginning with veterans suffering from recurrent infections. This work has the potential to extend the utility of existing antibiotics and transform the way bacterial infections are treated worldwide.

Engineering: Naomi J. Halas, Ph.D., D.Sc. (NAE, NAS), University Professor and Stanley C. Moore Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Rice University

Co-Recipients: Peter J. A. Nordlander, Ph.D., Wiess Professor of Natural Sciences and Professor of Physics and Astronomy, Rice University; Hossein Robatjazi, Ph.D., Vice President of Research, Syzygy Plasmonics Inc.; Adjunct Professor of Chemistry, Rice University

Dr. Halas, Dr. Nordlander and Dr. Robatjazi’s proposal was selected for the 2026 Hill Prize in Engineering to advance light-driven technologies for sustainable ammonia synthesis. Ammonia is essential for global agriculture as fertilizer and is emerging as a promising hydrogen carrier and fuel for maritime and land transport. Today, its production relies on the fossil-fuel-intensive Haber–Bosch process, which consumes vast energy resources and generates significant greenhouse gas emissions. Building on their groundbreaking work in antenna-reactor photocatalysts — nanoscale systems that capture light and use photon energy to drive chemical reactions — the team will design and demonstrate highly specific catalysts and prototype photoreactors that enable ammonia synthesis under mild conditions, without external heating or emissions. This approach dramatically lowers activation barriers for industrial reactions, opening the door to decentralized, point-of-use applications with electrically switchable control not possible in conventional thermal processes. With support from the Hill Prize, the team will improve light-driven catalysts for converting nitrogen into ammonia, refine prototype reactors for practical deployment and partner with industry collaborators to advance larger-scale applications. By completing the nitrogen cycle with light‑based ammonia synthesis, this innovation has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and expand access to clean fertilizer and energy solutions worldwide — driving a more sustainable future.

Medicine: Raghu Kalluri, M.D., Ph.D., Professor, Department of Cancer Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center

Dr. Kalluri was chosen for the 2026 Hill Prize in Medicine for developing eye drops to treat age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and other posterior eye diseases. AMD is the leading cause of vision loss globally, and current treatments rely on direct injection of anti-VEGF drugs into the eye. Dr. Kalluri engineered exosomes to treat AMD and formulated them as eye drops, demonstrating their ability to fully penetrate the eye and reach the retina. This non-invasive delivery system is designed to replace standard intravitreal injections, which are costly and carry risks including infection and retinal damage. Dr. Kalluri and his team engineered the exosomes to carry VEGF-targeting siRNA (iEVVEGF), which was effectively delivered to the damaged retina, achieving vascular repair in preclinical models. The eye drop treatment showed equivalent or superior effectiveness to current FDA-approved therapies at a fraction of the dosage and cost. The team has also built a scalable, GMP-grade manufacturing pipeline for clinical translation. Dr. Kalluri will utilize prize funding to accelerate IND-enabling studies and support testing for additional ocular conditions. Dr. Kalluri’s innovation has the potential to disrupt standard ophthalmic care by providing a safe, affordable, and self-administered alternative to intraocular injections.

Physical Sciences: Karen L. Wooley, Ph.D. (NAS), W.T. Doherty-Welch Chair and Distinguished Professor of Chemistry, Texas A&M University

Co-Recipient: Matthew Stone, Managing Director, Teysha Technologies

Dr. Wooley and Mr. Stone’s proposal was chosen for the 2026 Hill Prize in Physical Sciences for innovative research that transforms agricultural waste into safe, degradable plastics and chemicals. Their work directly addresses the global challenge of replacing toxic, petroleum-derived materials – such as bisphenol A (BPA) – with sustainable alternatives. Dr. Wooley and her team have developed patent-pending chemistry that converts sugars and natural phenolic compounds into BPA analogs designed to safely degrade after use. These new materials match or exceed the performance of traditional plastics while eliminating long-term environmental and health risks. The team will use the prize funding to scale production, optimize chemical processes and purchase critical equipment to accelerate translation from lab to market. In collaboration with Teysha Technologies, founded by Mr. Stone, they aim to develop commercially viable alternatives to conventional plastics. The Hill Prize will accelerate the development of these next-generation polymers that are safer for people and the planet.

Dr. Matsui’s proposal was chosen for the 2026 Hill Prize in Public Health for identifying climate change-related environmental exposures – specifically extreme heat and air pollution – as key contributors to adverse maternal and birth outcomes and associated disparities. The U.S. continues to see rising rates of preterm birth, infant mortality and pregnancy complications, with Texas experiencing particularly sharp increases. Despite this public health crisis, there are currently no effective primary prevention strategies. Dr. Matsui and her multidisciplinary team will use the prize funding to generate high-resolution, actionable data that links the timing and types of heat and air pollution exposure to specific maternal and infant health risks. Her team has already secured statewide birth data and will combine it with fine-scale environmental data to uncover how these exposures contribute to racial, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities. The outcome aims to establish a foundation for testing prevention strategies – ranging from individual-level interventions to policy changes – that could significantly reduce poor pregnancy outcomes and close health equity gaps.

Mr. Swogger, Dr. Bosnyak and Mr. Krupp’s proposal was chosen for the 2026 Hill Prize in Technology for addressing critical environmental and safety concerns related to tire performance and chemical toxicity. A key ingredient in nearly all tires – 6PPD – has been linked to aquatic toxicity and potential human health risks, yet it remains essential for preventing ozone-related cracking in rubber compounds. Mr. Swogger and his team will use the prize funding to advance the development and commercialization of MOLECULAR REBAR® (MR), a patented carbon nanotube technology that replaces 6PPD without compromising tire durability or safety. Working with leading industry partners, the team will formulate and test full-size prototype tires using this safer alternative. The new compounds will maintain crack resistance, improve performance and significantly reduce the environmental impact of tire wear. Additionally, the team will use these new compounds during tire trials to validate previous findings that the use of MR reduces the most breathable and hazardous particles (PM2.5, PM10) generated during tire wear- improving the safety profile of tire wear particles. This breakthrough paves the way for a new generation of eco-conscious, high-performance tires, addressing both regulatory pressure and sustainability goals across the global tire industry.

Bill would create Strategic Resilience Reserve for minerals

Seven-person board would govern stockpile's operations

Minerals would be stored in warehouses around US

Measure could spark Western price structure for minerals

Bill seeks to counter Chinese dominance of key minerals

Jan 15 (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers on Thursday introduced a bill to create a $2.5 billion stockpile of critical minerals, a move aimed at stabilizing market prices and encouraging domestic mining and refining.

The bill marks Washington's latest attempt to offset what policymakers view as Chinese manipulation of prices for lithium, nickel, rare earths and other critical minerals - vital for items from electric vehicles to high-tech weaponry - that has stymied American mining companies for years.

A China-generated glut of lithium, for example, led North Carolina-based Albemarle (ALB.N), opens new tab to pause U.S. expansion plans in 2024. The Pentagon became the largest shareholder in Nevada-based rare earths company MP Materials (MP.N), opens new tab in July amid intensifying Chinese competition.

The 68-page bill says China has moved to ""weaponize its influence over prices and volumes in the contest for access to critical minerals.""

BILL AIMS TO 'INSULATE U.S. FROM FOREIGN THREATS'

China has rejected assertions that it manipulates the market for critical minerals, saying in November it is committed to ""upholding the security and stability of global production and supply chains.""

To become law, the measure must pass the House of Representatives and the Senate and be signed by President Donald Trump.

The bill would create a Strategic Resilience Reserve with a seven-person board, modeled on the Federal Reserve's governance structure, which would oversee the fund.

Members, appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, would be tasked with buying minerals considered critical by U.S. agencies and stockpiling them at warehouses across the country. The board would need the technical expertise to ensure the minerals are stored properly. Certain lithium derivatives, for example, emit hydrogen when exposed to water.

The bill prioritizes recycled material, but minerals extracted from mines would be eligible. Allied countries would be able to join the reserve if they contributed at least $100 million.

Minerals could be sold for private-industry or defense purposes. Any profit would be used to buy more minerals and keep the stockpile active in perpetuity.

""Providing targeted investments and stockpiling key inputs will help insulate the U.S. from foreign threats and will provide a significant - and cost effective - boost to the U.S. economy,"" said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Senator Todd Young, an Indiana Republican, co-sponsored the legislation. Representative Rob Wittman, a Virginia Republican, introduced the same measure in the House.

The reserve's board would have flexibility over how to buy minerals, according to Senate aides. It could, for example, agree to pay twice the existing market price for rare earths - a market dominated by China - if such purchases supported U.S. mines.

Many niche-but-essential minerals on which Beijing has imposed export controls are not traded or lightly traded, sparking a push for minerals prices not tied to Chinese production.

""It's certainly possible this reserve could create a Western price for certain critical minerals,"" a Senate aide said.

Group of Seven finance ministers this week discussed floors for minerals prices. Trump on Wednesday said U.S. over-reliance on other nations for critical minerals is a national security threat.

Australia is also developing its own critical minerals reserve.

Meeting that challenge will require discipline, market-driven solutions and a firm commitment to policies that strengthen, not restrict, the state’s energy supply.

Missouri consumes far more electricity than it produces. As demand increases from advanced manufacturing, agricultural processing and new technologies, and as older power plants retire, expanding in-state generation is no longer optional. It is essential to maintaining economic competitiveness and grid reliability.

That is why proposals to impose moratoriums on utility-scale solar are deeply misguided. A moratorium does not stop demand, it limits supply. When government restricts supply, prices rise. Blocking the lowest-cost and fastest-to-build source of new generation forces Missouri to rely more heavily on expensive, out-of-state power and volatile wholesale markets, directly increasing electricity costs for ratepayers.

The consequences extend well beyond utility bills.

Companies considering investments in Missouri look closely at energy availability and price stability. Advanced manufacturers and agricultural processors cannot expand, or even operate, without dependable, affordable electricity. Artificially constraining generation through a solar moratorium creates an energy shortage by government decree, putting Missouri at a competitive disadvantage to neighboring states that are expanding supply and welcoming investment.

Solar development has already proven its value in Missouri. More than $1.1 billion has been invested, generating $3.7 million in state and local tax revenue that supports schools, public safety and infrastructure, without raising taxes. In rural communities, these projects provide stable, long-term revenue at a time when family farms face increasing economic pressure.

Equally important, solar respects private property rights. Farmers and landowners who voluntarily choose to host projects are exercising their right to use their land productively, strengthen their operations, and diversify income. A blanket moratorium replaces individual choice with government control, undermining the principles of property rights and free enterprise that Missouri conservatives have long defended.

Solar energy is not a government mandate or a political statement; it is a practical tool. It is affordable, reliable, and can be brought online quickly to meet rising demand. Expanding solar strengthens grid resilience, keeps energy dollars in Missouri and reduces dependence on outside suppliers.

Missouri’s success has always been driven by innovation, private investment and respect for property rights, not by government-imposed scarcity. As lawmakers consider the state’s energy future, they should reject moratoriums and embrace market-based solutions that lower costs, protect landowner rights, and ensure Missouri has the power it needs to grow.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Panels2-scaled-e1768426687144-2048x1229.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 13:00:50.199252

House Republicans appear to be united over the eminent domain ban, despite the differences from the Senate.","A bill that would prohibit the acquisition of land via eminent domain for carbon sequestration pipelines in Iowa advanced Wednesday from a House committee.

House Study Bill 507 is one of several expected bills related to property rights and carbon sequestration pipelines expected in the 2026 session.

Opponents of the bill said it would kill the proposed Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline which, according to lobbyists for the company, already has more than 1,400 easements with willing landowners for the pipeline.

Rep. Steven Holt, R-Denison, sponsored the bill and said it protects Iowans’ “fundamental right” to private property.

“Eminent domain should be incredibly rare and must meet the constitutional requirement of a public use,” Holt said.

Proponents of the bill said it is a simple bill, unlike the bill that Gov. Kim Reynolds vetoed last year that would have restricted the use of eminent domain by CO2 pipeline operators.

A group of Republican lawmakers have been vocal in their opposition to the carbon sequestration project, which was granted the right of eminent domain by the state utilities commission in 2024. The House passed a similar bill in 2025 to ban the use of eminent domain by carbon capture pipelines, but the Senate did not take up the bill.

Rep. Ross Wilburn, D-Ames, expressed hesitancy advancing the bill Tuesday during a subcommittee meeting on the proposed legislation, because of the Senate’s inaction on the similar bill last year and the governor’s veto.

Wilburn reiterated his concern Wednesday, noting that Reynolds was “silent” on the issue of eminent domain and property rights during her Tuesday Condition of the State address.

“So when I say nothing has changed, the political conditions around this have not changed,” Wilburn, who was one of two no votes on the bill, said.

Holt responded that neither the House nor the Senate can control what the governor does, nor can the two chambers control one another.

“What we do is, we do what is right and we move forward and who knows what dynamics might change,” Holt said.

In addition to bringing tax credits associated with the ultra-low carbon ethanol market, lobbyists for Summit argued in the subcommittee Tuesday the pipeline project would also be an economic opportunity for Iowa due to tax credits for enhanced oil recovery that were recently made available in the federal “big beautiful” law.

Ethanol producers would have access to 45Z tax credits for producing the low carbon fuel by sequestering carbon dioxide into the pipeline. The carbon sequestration pipeline would be eligible for 45Q tax credits as it transports the carbon to underground storage and now, as that carbon is strategically pumped underground to increase the efficiency of oil wells.

Holt said the Summit project is not a public use project, but “an economic development project.”

Holt said public use refers to infrastructure projects like roads, schools or essential energy projects that are “convenient and necessary.”

“The use of government power to seize property for a private economic development project is not constitutional,” Holt said.

Senate leadership has also indicated it plans to file a bill that would address the property rights issue by allowing pipeline operators to deviate from their state-approved routes in order to find willing landowners.

House Republicans appear to be united over the eminent domain ban, despite the differences from the Senate. The only other dissenting vote on the bill in committee Wednesday came from Rep. Rick Olson, D-Des Moines.

House Speaker Pat Grassley said in a Wednesday taping of “Iowa Press” that the House’s narrow eminent domain bill was rolled out early on to show that “it still is something that we really care about.”

Grassley said the fact that the Senate is working on its own bill is a “positive sign towards finding some level of resolution.”

“For the last several years, it’s just been bill after bill from the House’s perspective, heading over to the Senate,” Grassley said. “Regardless if we agree with one another, I think it’s a positive step forward … that there’s actual movement on both sides.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-83/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/img_0145-1024x6831768435481.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=EOdvzc_J,N,,2026-01-15 11:03:45.090519

[1] The OBBBA impacted baseline federal health spending projections since CBO’s January 2025 Budget and Economic Outlook.","Republicans won in 2024 in part by vowing to lower the cost of living through restraining federal spending, and ending policies that drive up prices.

Reconciliation is a powerful policy tool for realizing those goals and delivering results for the American people. As House Budget Committee Chairman Jody Arrington put it, “You do the right thing, and the people will reward you for it.”

Republicans have also shown discipline by allowing the pandemic-era expansion of Obamacare subsidies to expire, even amid vocal pressure from some in the conference to extend the policy. That decision avoided locking in a massive new $488 billion entitlement.

Republicans should build on that victory with a second reconciliation bill that focuses on where Congress can move the needle most: health care and welfare. Health care programs are the biggest drivers of federal spending growth, while federal welfare programs have proven disturbingly vulnerable to waste and fraud.

The primary goal for reconciliation 2.0 must be spending cuts. The first package made real progress on growth and affordability, but increased deficits significantly. A second bill that fails to deliver large, durable deficit reduction is worse than doing nothing.

What follows is a menu of health care, welfare, and related tax changes that would reduce spending and deficits, and show that Republicans are serious about restraining federal spending, reining in welfare abuse, and improving health care affordability by removing government-created distortions. Figures are 10-year deficit-reduction estimates, relative to the current-law baseline. Estimates of budgetary savings, therefore, do not necessarily indicate reductions in federal spending.

Obamacare

Repeal the Affordable Care Act

Obamacare doubles or triples premiums for most enrollees, reduces plan choice, and creates incentives to restrict access to care for the sick. Repealing the ACA would reduce federal spending, restore the freedom of individuals to make their own health insurance and health care decisions, reduce premiums for most individuals by 50 percent or more, force insurers to compete on and improve quality, reduce federal deficits and debt, reduce political conflict, and devolve authority over government assistance for the sick to the states, as the US Constitution provides.

Make Obamacare relief universal and permanent

When Obamacare restricted access to affordable coverage, Presidents Obama and Trump provided relief by removing barriers to Obamacare-exempt plans. The Congressional Budget Office found such plans offer comprehensive coverage at premiums about 60 percent lower than the cheapest Obamacare options. Making both types of relief universal and permanent would expand affordable insurance without expanding Obamacare. In addition, doing so would move on-budget many of the implicit taxes and subsidies that Obamacare currently places off-budget.

Reduce Obamacare Spending by Reducing Benchmarks

Obamacare uses the premium for a “benchmark” health insurance plan—currently, the second-lowest-cost silver plan available to an individual—to calibrate an eligible individual’s premium subsidy. Anything that reduces the benchmark—e.g., capping benchmarks at 125 percent of the national average for second-lowest-cost silver plans, or designating lower-cost bronze or catastrophic plans as the benchmark—would reduce spending on Obamacare premium subsidies.

Require Minimum Out-Of-Pocket (OOP) payments toward premiums

Benchmark-plan premiums are often so high that they yield subsidies that completely insulate enrollees from having to pay any of the premium for certain plans. Reducing Obamacare subsidies in a manner that requires all enrollees to pay at least something toward their premiums would reduce federal spending both directly (by reducing premium subsidy amounts) and indirectly (by reducing the ability of fraudsters to secure subsidies for “phantom” enrollees).

Medicaid

Consolidate Medicaid and CHIP into One Zero-Growth Block Grant ($4.4 trillion)[1]

Congress should consolidate Medicaid and CHIP into a single, fixed block grant set at $342 billion for FY 2026 with a zero percent annual growth rate. This would eliminate the existing matching-grant system that encourages states to overspend, ignore fraud, and shift costs to federal taxpayers.

Repeal Excess Funding for Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion ($604 billion)[2]

Obamacare gives states seven times more money when they spend on able-bodied adults versus vulnerable Medicaid enrollees (disabled adults, pregnant women, and children). Reducing Obamacare‘s 90 percent “enhanced” matching rate to each state’s standard matching rate (FMAP) would save taxpayer money and end this perverse incentive.

Reduce Medicaid Subsidies to Wealthy States ($667 billion)[3]

Federal law specifies a minimum amount of federal dollars that wealthy states receive for each dollar they spend on Medicaid. If Congress retains Medicaid’s perverse matching-grant system, legislators should eliminate that “floor,” which would require high-income states to pay for a larger share of their Medicaid programs. This change would reduce federal spending and encourage fiscal discipline in the wealthiest states with the most expensive programs (California, New York, Massachusetts, etc.).

End Medicaid Financing Scams ($386 billion)[4]

States use various financing scams—e.g., provider taxes, intergovernmental transfers, and certified public expenses—to capture federal Medicaid dollars without sacrificing anything to fund their programs as federal law envisions. These shell games are a form of legal Medicaid fraud and encourage states to turn a blind eye to other frauds. The only way to eliminate Medicaid financing scams is to eliminate Medicaid’s matching-grant system, such as by adopting block grants. Until then, Congress should at least try to eliminate states’ ability to game the matching-grant system.

Medicare

Cut Medicare spending, cap spending growth, and convert Medicare into a cash-transfer program

Medicare encourages waste, fraud, and excessive prices because politicians, bureaucrats, and enrollees do not spend government money as carefully as their own. Congress should cut baseline Medicare spending and convert Medicare into a Social Security–style cash-transfer program that sends risk and income-adjusted “Medicare checks” directly to enrollees. These changes are compatible with any level of baseline spending reduction. Research suggests roughly one-third of Medicare spending provides no health benefit, which implies that Congress could cut spending by that amount without harming enrollee health. These changes are also compatible with any limitation on the growth of total Medicare spending. Medicare spending currently grows faster than GDP. Congress should limit program growth to a sustainable measure, such as chained CPI.

Other Medicare Savings Options:

The foregoing proposals would deliver durable savings by directly reducing baseline Medicare spending and spending growth, while weakening the health care industry’s incentives to lobby for reversing those cuts. By contrast, the following proposals rely on technocratic formulae and bureaucratic mechanisms that the industry can readily game, making the resulting savings uncertain and politically fragile. Even though eliminating deficits requires far deeper cuts than these, Congress should pursue every effort to reduce Medicare spending.

Increase Medicare premiums for high-income enrollees ($1.2 trillion)[5]

Medicare currently subsidizes wealthy seniors who do not need assistance. High-income enrollees already pay higher premiums than other enrollees. But these requirements only apply to about 8 percent of enrollees, and taxpayers still subsidize up to 65 percent of those enrollees’ physician spending. Congress should expand means-testing to more high-income enrollees and for those it already affects.

Cut “benchmark” subsidies to Medicare Advantage plans ($615 billion)[6]

The formula for calculating Medicare Advantage subsidies to private health insurance companies begins with setting a “benchmark” subsidy level. Research suggests the benchmarks Medicare Advantage uses result in wasteful spending. Reducing those benchmarks would reduce excessive subsidies and encourage Medicare enrollees to choose more efficient private plans.

Cut “risk adjustment” subsidies to Medicare Advantage plans ($1.32 trillion)[7]

The additional “risk adjustment” subsidies that compensate private insurance companies for high-cost Medicare Advantage enrollees are also excessive. Medicare Advantage pays more for each additional patient diagnosis that private health insurance companies submit. “Fee-for-diagnosis” payment creates incentives for insurance companies to submit unnecessary diagnoses. MedPAC estimates that the cumulative effect of “baseline” and “risk adjustment” subsidies is that Medicare Advantage costs taxpayers 20 percent more per enrollee than traditional Medicare, or $84 billion per year. Projections indicate that a 20 percent across-the-board cut in risk-adjustment subsidies would reduce 10-year Medicare Advantage spending by more than $1 trillion below baseline.

Expand enrollee cost-sharing in traditional Medicare ($195 billion)[8]

Traditional Medicare provides more comprehensive coverage than enrollees would likely choose on their own, making them less price-sensitive when consuming medical care. This leads enrollees and providers to waste taxpayer resources on low-value medical care. Increasing enrollee cost-sharing would reduce wasteful Medicare spending by making enrollees more price-conscious.

Reduce Medicare subsidies for hospital “bad debt” ($60 billion)

Medicare reimburses hospitals for some unpaid beneficiary cost-sharing, which encourages excessive prices and shifts expenses to taxpayers that patients could cover themselves. Reducing these subsidies would reduce those perverse incentives and reduce Medicare spending relative to the baseline.

Reduce Medicare subsidies for graduate medical education (GME) ($110 billion)

Medicare currently issues two separate types of GME subsidies. The Congressional Budget Office projects that total spending on GME subsidies will grow at an annual rate of 7 percent over the next decade. Consolidating the two types of subsidies into a single grant program and limiting spending growth to one percentage point below inflation would increase incentives for hospitals to be cost-conscious and reduce Medicare spending by roughly $11 billion per year.

Reduce excessive Medicare prices for hospital outpatient services ($180 billion)[9]

For the same services, Medicare sets and pays higher prices to hospital outpatient departments than to lower-cost physician offices. These distortions encourage hospitals to acquire physician practices. Reducing these excessive Medicare-set hospital prices—which some call “site-neutral payment”—could reduce Medicare spending relative to baseline by $180 billion over the next decade.

Reduce excessive Medicare prices for “340B” drugs ($85 billion)[10]

Medicare sets and pays much higher prices for pharmaceuticals than necessary. Projections suggest that cutting the Medicare prices for so-called “340B” drugs by 27 percent would reduce Medicare spending over the next decade by $85 billion below baseline.

Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)

Devolve SNAP Funding to the States ($404.34 billion with a ten-year phaseout, or $628.90 billion with a five-year phaseout[11]

Waste, fraud, and abuse are ongoing problems in SNAP because the program is funded almost entirely by the federal government. Consequently, states have little incentive to constrain costs, reduce improper payments, or improve participant outcomes to minimize dependency. Congress should gradually devolve the federal government’s share of SNAP’s total costs to the states, empowering them to assume full responsibility for their nutrition assistance programs. This would give states the authority and the accountability to design programs that best meet their constituents’ needs, and a direct financial stake in ensuring they manage their programs effectively.

Eliminate Broad-Based Categorical Eligibility (BBCE) ($100 billion)

States can use BBCE to make households categorically eligible for SNAP if they receive certain non-cash TANF benefits, including minimal services such as pamphlets or hotline referrals, even if they fail to meet the program’s statutory income and countable asset requirements. Eliminating BBCE would help enforce SNAP’s statutory eligibility standards and close a loophole that states have used to draw federal taxpayer dollars to pay for benefits for those the program wasn’t originally designed to help.

Rescind the 2021 Thrifty Food Plan Reevaluation ($274 billion)

The OBBBA did not rescind the USDA’s 2021 Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) reevaluation, which violated a 45-year precedent by increasing TFP’s cost beyond inflation, increasing benefits by 23 percent without congressional approval. Undoing this unlawful, partisan expansion will save billions of taxpayer dollars and reinforce Congress’s role as the primary decision-maker over SNAP’s size and scope.

Health Care Tax Changes

End the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored health insurance (higher revenues: up to $6 trillion)[12]

The tax exclusion promotes excessive health coverage, excessive prices, wasteful health care spending, and huge gaps in coverage. Ending the exclusion would provide trillions of dollars in new revenue that Congress could apply to deficit reduction and/or use to lower marginal tax rates. Ending the exclusion would further reduce excessive medical prices and eliminate the implicit tax penalties that compel workers to let employers control $1 trillion of their earnings each year in the form of health insurance benefits. Workers would lose a portion of that $1 trillion to taxes, and labor markets would return the remainder to workers largely in the form of higher cash wages. Short of full elimination, Congress could cap the exclusion.

Enact tax-free Universal Health Accounts (UHAs)

An alternative approach could let workers control nearly all of that $1 trillion in earnings and restore workers’ freedom to make their own health decisions. Universal health accounts (UHAs) would convert the exclusion and all other existing health-related tax preferences into a single tax exclusion for deposits into worker-owned, tax-free UHAs. Congress could set UHA deposit limits at levels that would achieve revenue- and deficit-neutrality or deficit reduction. Finally, Congress would let patients use UHA funds to purchase any health insurance plan from any source, tax-free. UHAs would make health care more universal—better, more affordable, more equitable, and more secure.

Other Tax Changes

Repeal the Earned Income Tax Credit (budget savings: $800 billion; higher revenues: $7.9 billion)[13]

The Earned Income Tax Credit is a “refundable” tax credit for low-income workers intended to encourage labor force participation and reduce poverty. The non-refundable portion of the credit will reduce recipients’ tax liabilities (and federal revenues) by $7.9 billion over the 2026-2035 period. The refundable portion is cash that the federal government sends to eligible individuals. Over the same period, the refundable portion of the credit will trigger $800 billion in federal spending. In practice, the credit is highly complex, generates large improper payment rates, creates work disincentives as benefits phase out, and causes other economic distortions that may outweigh the benefits.

Repeal the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (higher revenues: $194.8 billion)

The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit subsidizes developers and investors to finance housing for low-income households. The program is costly, administratively complex, and prone to corruption, with most of the subsidy captured by investors and intermediaries rather than meaningfully lowering housing costs or expanding housing supply for low-income residents.

Repeal the New Markets Tax Credit (higher revenues: $14.4 billion)

The New Markets Tax Credit was intended to spur private investment in low-income communities by offering tax credits to investors. After 25 years and more than $76 billion in authorized credits, the evidence suggests that most subsidized projects would have occurred anyway, the benefits largely accrue to investors and financial intermediaries, and the program’s complexity makes it an inefficient tool for economic development.

Repeal the Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit (higher revenues: $6.5 billion)

The Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit subsidizes investments in historic buildings. By subsidizing the preservation of smaller, old buildings over larger-occupancy new construction, the credit suppresses housing supply and raises housing prices, undermining affordability goals while distorting real estate investment decisions.

An Overdue Course Correction Congress Should Make Now

Republicans used the first reconciliation bill to advance minor welfare restraints to require work and strengthen program integrity after years of unchecked expansion. These changes targeted assistance toward the most vulnerable and discourage open-ended dependence.

Health care and welfare cuts offer Congress its best opportunity to do more—quickly, meaningfully, and through reconciliation. The proposals in this document would reduce federal spending and deficits, strengthen work incentives, reduce fraud, and make health care more affordable by correcting government-created distortions.

We construct an adjusted baseline based on CBO health spending projections, incorporating estimates of OBBBA’s Medicaid spending reductions (-$910 billion over 10 years). We then calculate savings from our block grant proposal by assuming that Congress holds Medicaid and CHIP spending flat at $342 billion between 2026 and 2035, reducing spending relative to our adjusted baseline by $4.4 trillion over ten years.

[4] Pre-OBBBA, CBO estimated that eliminating the provider tax “safe-harbor” threshold would save $612 billion over 10 years. OBBBA limited provider taxes, saving an estimated $226 billion. We take the difference between the two figures and estimate that fully eliminating the provider tax scam could generate $386 billion in savings. This is likely a significant undercount of possible savings, given the breadth of Medicaid financing scams.

House Bill 1002, a House Republican priority proposal, would reshape utility providers’ low-income customer assistance programs, block service shut-offs to such customers on dangerously hot days, put all ratepayers on predictable billing plans and refashion ratemaking into three-year plans outfitted with performance-based incentives.

“The goal … is to prioritize affordability for Hoosier ratepayers and ensure our utilities are maintaining transparent, cost-effective practices,” the bill’s author, Rep. Alaina Shonkwiler, R-Noblesville, said in a statement after Tuesday’s committee meeting.

“Any potential changes to the bill will align with those goals,” she continued.

Only testimony was taken in in the House’s utilities committee on Tuesday, with amendments and a vote expected next week.

Advocates like Delaney Barber Kwon of Indiana Conservation Voters thanked Shonkwiler for her work but suggested “further clarification in order for intent to match implementation.”

The legislation would require electricity suppliers under Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission jurisdiction that don’t already offer low-income customer help programs to do so by July. The companies would fund those offerings to at least half the amount they recovered from ratepayers under their IURC-approved energy efficiency programs in the most recent year.

Luke Wilson, the chief policy officer of the Indiana Office of Energy Development, estimated that could direct up to $30 million annually to low-income Hoosier households.

“That is a cost shift that is already in bills,” he added, “so ratepayers are not feeling additional impact.”

The provision encountered mixed testimony.

Danielle McGrath, president of the Indiana Energy Association, said lawmakers shouldn’t use that funding mechanism because the revenue varies by utility and by year, while Kerwin Olson, executive director of Citizens Action Coalition, said it’s “more than adequate funding.”

Committee Chair Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, noted the money has to come from somewhere, lest the bill be caught up in the finance-focused House Ways and Means Committee.

Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, and others pushed for greater regulator oversight of the program requirements instead of leaving it largely up to the utilities themselves.

The legislation would require providers to notify customers of assistance programs on their websites. Rep. Cherrish Pryor, D-Indianapolis, asked that the text also go directly on bills to better reach elderly ratepayers.

“My daughter is my parents’ IT support, so I appreciate your point,” Shonkwiler joked.

Another provision intended to ease the burden on low-income Hoosiers would mimic current policy banning winter electricity service shut-offs — from Dec. 1 to March 15 — to the summertime. A key difference, however, is the pause would be triggered by federal extreme heat warnings instead of taking effect across the hottest months of the year.

Pierce and customer advocates argued a months-based approach would be simpler to administer and benefit customers more.

“We need to be really careful (that) we just don’t pile up four months of debt on these people, and now they’re looking at trying to get reconnected, and the price is so high they can’t do it,” Soliday replied.

Debt fears also arose in detailed discussion over so-called budget billing plans, which promote predictability for customers by holding monthly bill amounts steady despite changes in usage. But when utilities settle up, shocked customers may find themselves on the hook for large sums.

“Families think they’re being on a program to help stabilize their finances, and they feel like they’re being preyed upon,” said Rep. Alex Burton, D-Evansville.

Pryor suggested a name change.

“I think part of what’s confusing the people is they hear ‘budget billing,’ and they think … there is a savings,” she said. “So, maybe, the word ‘budget’ needs to be changed to something that’s more reflective of what it really is.”

“It is confusing,” Soliday agreed. “… It doesn’t save you money. It saves you from spikes, is what it does. And some folks can endure spikes, and (for) others, it’s really painful.”

House Bill 1002 would require that every customer be put on such plans, but be given the ability to opt out. Utilities would settle up with participants at least twice a year, in an effort to avoid the sticker shock of a once-annual true-up.

Several witnesses recommended removing “at least” from the legislation to ensure true-ups don’t occur so often they erode the predictability budget billing is supposed to bring. Other suggestions included limiting implementation to just low-income customers, adding more detail on when the debt is due and pushing the effective day back from July.

Bill explores longer rate cycles, incentives

The measure would also switch up Indiana’s traditional ratemaking process by requiring utilities to pursue IURC approval of multi-year rate plans. The first year would be done “in the same manner” as now, while the second and third years would be based on projections.

Although Soliday said the intent was to make utilities file the same detailed information as is currently required, some warned the language may not be explicit enough.

Joe Rompala, representing the Indiana Industrial Energy Consumers, also testified there’s no mechanism to settle the difference between the projected data and what actually transpires.

“This helps ensure that customers are only paying for assets which have actually been put into service, and which are actually being used to serve them when rates go into effect,” Rompala said. “This upholds a longstanding legal principle which helps shield ratepayers from excessive investment, which generates no direct benefits to them.”

Pierce and several witnesses objected to language specifying that the multi-year rate plans operate “independently” of trackers — requiring that regulators consider them “separately.”

Trackers allow utilities to increase rates based on certain expenses they have.

Sam Carpenter, the executive director of the Hoosier Environmental Council, feared that could “undermine some of the cost-containment goals.” He asked for lawmakers to clarify the “interaction” between those mechanisms.

Soliday previously said some trackers may “disappear” if multi-year ratemaking is adopted, telling the committee, “I’ve had some (utilities) say to me, they may just drop (the Transmission, Distribution, Storage Improvement Charge) completely, because it works into the plan.”

The multi-year rate plans would be paired with new performance metrics and incentives tied to customer affordability and service restoration.

Several witnesses suggested incentivizing additional priorities, like reducing peak load demand or promoting environmental sustainability. Others asked that the incentives be tailored to specific utilities or said the proposed incentive range is too small to drive utility decision-making.

It’s unclear which chunks of the bill could get the biggest revisions.

“I appreciate everyone who testified in the committee today and expect any amendments put forth to reflect the valuable insights and feedback we continue to receive from experts, stakeholders and residential ratepayers,” Shonkwiler said.",http://indianaeconomicdigest.net/Images/Images/164493.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 11:03:50.918677

Funding for home energy efficiency upgrades, which are designed to lower household energy bills, was also eliminated by the current administration, the report says.","This month marks a year since President Donald Trump began his second term, and climate activists are highlighting how his policy changes have affected Georgia and its economy.

A new report from Climate Power, a nonprofit whose mission is to educate Americans about clean energy investments and fossil fuel pollution, said there has been an increase in household energy costs and decreases in clean energy jobs and investments as result of a number of actions taken by Trump.

“In just one year, Trump spiked energy bills from his all-out war on clean energy, decimated pollution protections, and placed us further at risk by playing politics with disaster aid and cutting our ability to predict and respond to extreme weather,” the report from Climate Power reads.

The report references studies and analysis from several outside sources such as the U.S. Energy Information Administration, as well as some in-house analysis from the Climate Power research team, painting a detailed picture of how much has changed since Trump took office in January of last year.

From September 2024 to September 2025, household electricity costs increased by more than 12% in Georgia, according to the U.S. EIA. On top of that, energy bills in the state are projected to increase by $110 by 2030 and $270 by 2035 due to clean energy cuts, according to Energy Innovation.

In addition, funding for home energy efficiency upgrades, which are designed to lower household energy bills, was also eliminated by the current administration, Climate Power said.

Trump’s clean energy cuts led to seven cancelled or delayed battery, solar and clean technology projects, resulting in the loss of more than 3,000 jobs and $4.4 billion in investment in the state, according to data cited in Climate Power’s report.

The Climate Power report attributes a range of policy actions to rising costs, lost jobs and environmental harm.

A key measure includes the passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which gives tax breaks for pollutant-heavy fossil fuels while cutting clean energy programs, effectively raising household energy bills, according to the report.

“Trump’s cuts to federal clean energy tax investments are expected to reduce the build-out of new clean power generating capacity by 53% to 59% from 2025 through 2035,” the report reads. “Already, the U.S. has lost tens of thousands of megawatts of capacity that could have powered millions of homes, including: 658 MW of battery capacity, 149 MW of solar capacity and 24,152 MW of wind capacity.”

In tandem with moving away from clean energy investments, over 30 pollution protections have been gutted, resulting in the loss of an estimated $275 billion in annual societal savings from higher health care costs from poorer air and water quality, according to the report. It also links an estimated 30,000 additional premature deaths each year to increased air and water pollution, according to the report.

Funding for home energy efficiency upgrades, which are designed to lower household energy bills, was also eliminated by the current administration, the report says.

An estimated three-quarters of people who lost their homes in the fire didn’t have enough homeowners' insurance to cover rebuilding costs.
Before the Marshall Fire, they thought their homeowners' insurance was sufficient.","On May 20, 2024, tornado sirens blared throughout the small Eastern Plains town of Yuma as hail the size of baseballs thrashed trees and homes.

""Mother nature was brutal,"" said Keven Means.

The storm lasted less than an hour, but by the time it was over, residents were wading through ice-choked streets and the town of 3,400 was reeling.

Means, who was born and raised in Yuma, is a local contractor and has been working nonstop repairing homes since the storm. He estimates that 99% of roofs were destroyed, even the ones with the most hail-resistant building materials.

Yuma has experienced its fair share of hailstorms over the years, but this latest one exacerbated one issue in particular — the shaky state of homeowners' insurance.

“When our insurance renewed this year, it went up about $2,000,” said Megan Hansen, who lives in Yuma.

“There's a lot of insurance that won't cover this area,” said Julie Jamison. “We have to either stay with what we've got or there's a lot of people that can't afford the insurance.”

Stories like those from Yuma and the Marshall Fire have caught the attention of the Colorado legislature and Gov. Jared Polis. But they are wrestling with how best to get involved in the insurance marketplace, whether through regulation, incentives, or a little bit of both.

“We are in the most challenging property insurance market that we've seen in a generation,” said Carole Walker, an insurance industry lobbyist and head of the Rocky Mountain Insurance Association.

“So what we’ve really seen play out in Colorado is, unfortunately, a lot of pressure on the insurance marketplace here, which puts pressure on those individual homeowners,” she said.

Yuma’s experience is an extreme example of impacts being felt by homeowners across the state.

In the last five years, the average premium in the state has gone up 65%, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Colorado is now one of the top ten most expensive states in the country for homeowners' insurance.

Climate experts say that is partly a result of more frequent and damaging weather driven by a warming planet.

Dual catastrophe state

Florida is well-known for its hurricanes and floods — California for its earthquakes, mudslides and wildfires. But Colorado is no slouch in the natural disaster arena either. It’s what’s known in the insurance industry as a “dual-catastrophe” state dealing with both wildfires and hail. And Coloradans' love of nature contributes to the challenge.

Almost half of the state's population lives in what’s called the wildland urban interface — areas where homes and businesses butt up against forests and open spaces — making them vulnerable to wildfires. On top of that, the Front Range and Eastern Plains experience frequent hailstorms, some parts have earned the unenviable nickname “Hail Alley.”

Since 1980, Colorado has had more than 76 weather-related disasters — including fires, storms, hail and floods — that each caused more than $1 billion in damages. And it's getting worse — most of those disasters occurred in the past decade.

Climate change isn’t the only reason billion-dollar disasters are happening more frequently. More people live in Colorado now, and the cost of replacing buildings and property after disasters just keeps increasing.

Each disaster adds up for insurers — who pass those costs on to their policyholders. According to state figures, hail damage to homes is the biggest driver of those costs. On average, 60% to 70% of the amount of premium that people pay across the state is from hail risk, even in places that don’t get hail.

Escalating rates are something that state lawmakers, like Boulder Senator, Democrat Judy Amabile, have started really worrying about.

“When we talk about the cost of housing, we have to talk about insurance as part of that,” Amabile said. “That is absolutely becoming a significant part of somebody's monthly cost to own the home or to rent, because those costs are going to get passed through one way or another.”

Since 2007, rates in Colorado have gone up 233%, according to the Insurance Information Institute, and the rates are higher in Colorado than in states like California and North Carolina.

“It's a major crisis in Colorado and a number of other states, in that insurance costs for homeowners has gone up far above the rate of inflation,” said Gov. Jared Polis.

In addition to costs, Polis is worried about availability.

“We also have many homeowners who have a lot less choices, even some down to one choice, and to insure with less competition also means higher rates,” Polis said. “So it's become a major problem.”

Currently, Polis and Colorado’s Insurance Commissioner Michael Conway said they don’t think companies will wholesale leave the state.

“I'm concerned that some insurance companies may make choices not to write in certain parts of the state, not to provide coverage in certain parts of the state, and that will drive up the affordability challenges in those parts of the state,” said Conway.

That is already happening, as pockets of Colorado become insurance deserts.

Insurance agent Steve Hakes said companies are scaling back in certain zip codes.

“This one's actually Allstate,” Hakes said, pointing to a spreadsheet of zip codes in Boulder County. “You've got three columns of zip codes that are simply ineligible to be written in any of those particular areas.”

The FAIR plan

In 2023, state lawmakers, with broad bipartisan support, created state-backed coverage for properties at extreme risk of disaster that were rejected by three different insurance companies. It was an effort to stabilize the housing market, and the program officially launched in April.

The FAIR plan is more expensive than traditional insurance policies, and the payouts are also limited, capped at $750,000. If a home is worth more than that and it burns down, the Fair Plan would not cover all the losses.

The idea isn’t unique to Colorado. States like California and Washington first started offering plans like this in the late 1960s, and there are now FAIR plans in more than 30 states.

As of this December, eight months after the program’s launch, Colorado’s Fair Plan had sold about 140 insurance policies.

“When we started with the fair plan, our hope was that no one would ever need it,” said Amabile, who sponsored the legislation. “But we are already seeing that people do need it. And I would expect that number will grow dramatically in the next few months as people hear about the Fair Plan and as more insurance companies start to turn people down.”

Underinsurance

Despite the benefits, the FAIR Plan does raise the risk of underinsurance — and that’s a problem some homeowners with private insurance have faced for years.

The issue was front and center after the Marshall Fire in Boulder County, the state’s most destructive wildfire. An estimated three-quarters of people who lost their homes in the fire didn’t have enough homeowners' insurance to cover rebuilding costs.

That's exactly what happened to Manu Sobti, his wife Amita and their two children. They live in Superior, a suburb of Boulder, and moved into their house a decade prior. Before the Marshall Fire, they thought their homeowners' insurance was sufficient.

Manu remembers the day of the fire clearly. It was in late December 2021 that he and his family were on a beach vacation in Mexico, enjoying their kids’ winter break, when they started hearing that their subdivision was on fire.

“The early morning, we had breakfast, and suddenly the calls and texts start coming in that, ‘hey, man, where are you guys?’”

Manu and his family watched the whole thing unfold from the Ring camera at their house.

“Being that far away was definitely helpless. You couldn’t do anything.”

It turns out losing their home was just the beginning of a long and arduous saga. They decided to rebuild in the same location and stay in the community that they grew to love.

But as they re-built, they soon realized how underinsured they were. Manu said they ended up spending $1 million more than what their insurance paid — half for the rebuild, and half to replace all the items that burned in the home.

Manu said his insurance company treated him fairly, the company paid what he was owed under his policy, but it just didn’t come close to covering everything he lost.

“The concept of insurance is there. You feel safe. At least this covers you a bit, but it's still a big financial liability to be able to build back.”

The couple decided to build what’s called a passive house — a home that is more energy efficient and fire-resistant. While it costs more to build a passive house, Sobti said even if he hadn’t rebuilt his home that way, he would still be significantly underinsured.

Underinsurance is common. One study found that more than half of homeowners in California and Colorado are underinsured. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as not updating a policy after a big renovation; failing to include expensive items like jewelry or artwork in an insurance plan; and not adding supplemental coverage, known as extended replacement cost, into a policy in case rebuilding costs end up higher than expected.

After the Marshall Fire, lawmakers passed a bill to address underinsurance. It requires the state to create an annual report on estimated rebuilding costs and requires insurers to be more upfront about those costs in their policies. Insurance companies are also required to offer more comprehensive supplemental insurance options.

Policy solutions

Sufficient insurance is only one part of the puzzle — lawmakers are also trying to make insurance more affordable. One way to do that is through mitigation.

Gov. Polis had a proposal last legislative session to set up a grant program to help people buy hail-resistant roofs, often known in the industry as class 4 shingles.

“At the end of the day, the more hail-proof roofs we have, especially in the Eastern Front Range, Aurora, East Denver, the lower rates are going to be for everybody,” Polis said.

The bill would have set up a fund, paid for by a one percent fee on every homeowner's insurance policy. That money would have paid for two things: grants for hail-resistant roofs and money for insurers to help offset their losses in wildfire-prone areas.

The proposal didn’t garner enough support from state Republicans or Democrats. The big sticking point was the fee on homeowners to fund the program, amid concerns that it took too much money out of people’s pocketbooks.

The Polis administration plans to reprise this bill this session and potentially look at other ways to fund it. Democratic House Speaker Julie McCluskie of Dillon will be a main sponsor and said it’s a top priority made extra challenging by the lack of money in the state budget.

“We've just seen our revenues drop dramatically, and that means that these very important programs that we're trying to get off the ground, we've got to find funding and resources for them in other ways, and we're committed to doing that.”

Polis’ proposal for a roof enhancement program is an example of mitigation — the idea that people must be proactive to try to limit damage to their homes — and help reduce insurance claims.

“When we're talking about bringing down insurance premiums, I think what we really have to be talking about is how do we reduce the risk?” said Walker. Part of the effort is finding ways to get people to do the mitigation work.

“You need to do the mitigation. Your neighbor needs to do it, and then it needs to be at scale. Because we know for wildfire, fire doesn't care. It doesn't know any boundaries. So I think the commitment we need as a state is how can we put these mitigation programs in place?”

In 2025, Colorado passed a law requiring insurance companies to be more transparent about how they calculate rates in wildfire-prone areas. Companies are now required to explain different ways homeowners can mitigate to lower their wildfire risk, and potentially their rates.

Some communities in Colorado are already at the forefront of mitigation. Wildfire Partners, a Boulder County-run mitigation program, started a little more than a decade ago. Since then, it’s performed more than 4,000 home assessments. The county sends specialists to homes to work up a laundry list of actions to take, from creating a 5-foot buffer around the house to cleaning debris off the roof.

“Every year we have more and more interest from our residents as wildfire risk increases and people see on the news in Los Angeles or other fires from across the country. They recognize that with climate change and our new era of climate-driven wildfires, they need to take action,” said Wildfire Partners program manager Jim Webster.

Boulder’s program also offers a certificate to homeowners who have completed all of the necessary mitigation work — and that can be really important to insurance companies.

It ended up being critical for Nick Schneider and his wife Erica Ellingson, who live in a scenic valley just outside of the town of Lyons, surrounded by hills and prairie grass. They have a wooden house with cedar siding and knew they needed to take action to protect their property, but like a lot of people, they kept putting it off.

“I will admit it, I was the foot-dragger. I just didn't want to hear that we were going to have to, you know, pave the whole area around the house, cut down favorite trees or anything like that,” said Schneider.

But that all changed in December 2023 when their insurance company reached out.

“We got the letter from our insurance company that said: We will not renew your insurance because of the risk of wildfire. And so, of course, we panicked,” said Ellingson.

The couple turned to Wildfire Partners for help and put in long hours removing brush and grasses around the house and fortifying their wooden decks. They tackled the yard, but were still able to keep some of their favorite trees and have a beautiful garden.

They were also able to keep their insurance. Boulder County certified its work, and the insurance company renewed its policy.

That mitigation couldn't have come at a better time. Just a few months after mitigating, in July 2024, a wildfire known as the Stone Canyon Fire ripped right through their neighborhood.

“It was very surreal when I looked out the window, and I saw the trees on fire so close to the house. I couldn't believe it for a moment,” said Ellingson.

The wildfire approached the home from all sides, but the flames receded as they hit the defensible barrier.

The fire ended up taking five homes, but not Nick and Erica’s, and not any of the other nearby homes that Wildfire Partners certified as mitigated.

“If we hadn't gotten that kick in the pants from our insurance company, we wouldn't have dealt with [it] in time,” said Schneider.

Implementing large-scale mitigation programs and getting a lot of homeowners to do it, however, is not an easy task. It costs money, takes time (approximately 100 hours, according to Webster) and effort. In 2022, voters in Boulder County approved a tax to help fund the program, something that would be politically untenable in some parts of the state.

So far, the state said it has no immediate plans to mandate mitigation work or require insurance companies to offer a discount for doing it. But this is Polis’ last session — so it’ll likely be up to the next governor to decide if this is the direction Colorado should go.

Ellingson said their experience taught them that programs to make homes safer really work.

“For certain, our house would have been lost in that fire,” she said.",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2026/01/DISASTER-INSURANCE-RATES-COURTESY-RMPBS-05.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 10:02:33.172157

EPA officials detailed their findings in an inspection report that formed the basis of a consent order that requires the company to address violations inspectors documented during an Oct. 7 visit to the Roseland facility. The agency made the report public Tuesday, stating in a news release that inspectors found an estimated 250 damaged containers, 200 chemical spills and more than 300 containers of unlabeled or unidentified substances.

Clay Garside, a New Orleans environmental law attorney, said the findings depict a “horror show” unlike any he has seen. He is representing the advocacy group Louisiana Environmental Action Network in a lawsuit against Smitty’s Supply to ensure the company fully addresses the impact of the disaster.

“I’ve seen some pretty bad stuff but nothing this egregious,” Garside said.

Smitty’s Supply did not respond to a request for comment. It has filed its own lawsuit against the companies that made and maintained the tanks that exploded.

The EPA conducted the inspection a month and a half after the Aug. 22 Smitty’s Supply disaster sent millions of gallons of hazardous materials onto neighboring properties and pouring into waterways, including the Tangipahoa River.

The report includes alleged violations discovered in two undamaged warehouses that are the apparent focus of a related environmental crimes investigation, though the agency has said little about that case. The EPA Criminal Investigative Division, with assistance from the FBI, served a search warrant at the facility Nov. 18 that paused recovery operations near Warehouse 6 and Warehouse 10 for two days, according to information from other EPA records.

Records reveal federal criminal search warrant served at Smitty’s Supply

The October inspection was led by the EPA’s compliance division, which gathers evidence for the agency’s more common civil enforcement proceedings such as the administrative consent order.

According to its report, EPA inspectors found evidence of active and old chemical spills, many from unlabeled containers that were haphazardly stored. The containers included large 275-gallon totes, 55-gallon drums and 5-gallon buckets. Hundreds were found damaged, corroded, bulging, crushed, leaking, punctured, fallen or at risk of falling from high stacks or shelves.

Many containers had no labels except for rudimentary hand-written notes with vague warnings such as “Danger,” “Waste,” “Bad,” “Expired,” and in one instance “Do Not Touch must do Labs.” Some labeled with “Corrosive” placards had their tops cut open with oily liquids, trash and debris inside.

In one area of the facility called the Truck Stop, inspectors found a collection of drums with “Radioactive” placards, with yellow police crime scene tape wrapped around the barrels.

Oily liquids were found in open drums, buckets and other containers — many without lids or with pieces of cardboard serving as makeshift covers. Some open drums sat outside with unidentified oily liquids, trash and random discarded items inside. Others were in patches of grass with no containment area to prevent spills from escaping.

Many containers had spilled or were actively spilling chemicals at the time of the inspection, the records said. Some unlabeled containers were surrounded by weeds and visibly deteriorating, and others were surrounded by barren patches of soil saturated with an unknown oily material.

Some totes, which are large, plastic containers with metal support cages, appeared damaged, corroded or bulging with pressure. In one section of pavement used as an outdoor storage area, many unlabeled totes and drums were precariously stacked on top of others without the support of pallets and dangerously leaning over. Some stacks were leaning, and others had fallen over with puddles of chemicals on the ground nearby. None of the containers were labeled, except for one with the word “Bad” written on it.

In one warehouse, a 55-gallon drum of oil was roped off with red caution tape bearing the word “Danger.” The drum was sitting on a crushed wooden pallet next to sealed pallets of brake fluid.

Also inside of that warehouse was evidence of other spilled chemicals on the floor underneath totes and bulging containers. One tote contained an industrial form of concentrated hydrogen peroxide, a volatile chemical that can cause skin burns and explode under certain conditions.

Inspectors were unable to fully examine one storage area because its access points were blocked by a grease spill approximately 3 inches thick and spanning about 100 square feet, according to the EPA report.

In some cases, inspectors said Smitty’s Supply employees made half-hearted attempts to clean spilled chemicals by covering them with cardboard. Other spills were left untouched, forming puddles on the floors of warehouses and on the ground outdoors.

Animal tracks were found on the floor inside one of the warehouses, indicating wildlife had access to the space. The animal appeared to track an unknown white substance across the floor.

Bottled and packaged chemical products on shelves were leaking and in danger of tipping over.

Some incompatible products were hazardously stored together in the same area with one pallet of corrosive chemicals placed next to a pallet of flammable chemicals.

Sealed drums labeled “corrosive” had an unknown liquid leaking onto them, and totes of other corrosive chemicals were actively leaking onto the floor at the time of the inspection with no evidence of cleanup attempts.

Other findings included:

Concrete containment walls surrounding large permanent tanks had cracks with unknown liquids seeping through, some flowing offsite. There was no evidence of repairs, though someone had painted arrows on one wall to mark a crack.

A tote of sulfonic acid had a leaking spigot dripping its contents onto the floor of the facility’s grease plant. A worker had stuffed a rag in the spigot to try to plug the leak.

Grease tanks had pipes and valves caked with an accumulation of leaking contents.

Containers of open unidentified substances were stored at the top of a staircase.

Old lead-acid vehicle batteries were strewn randomly across the property. In one workshop, a collection of old batteries was leaking next to a pair of unlabeled compressed gas cylinders.

The report totals 230 pages, most showing photographic evidence of the findings.

Many of the containers looked old and weathered and as if they hadn’t been moved in years, while others looked as if they had been moved more recently possibly as part of the recovery operations following the Aug. 22 disaster, according to the photos in the report.

Although Smitty’s Supply voluntarily agreed to the EPA’s consent order, the company has neither admitted to or denied the allegations in the inspection report. The order doesn’t prevent the EPA from enforcing other allegations including any criminal allegations that might be under investigation.

Candy Cardwell, whose home is among those closest to the Smitty’s Supply plant, was packing up her life in Roseland when reached by phone Wednesday. Unable to go outside without becoming physically ill, Cardwell said she is moving to California this week.

“I never thought in a million years something like this would happen,” Cardwell said, adding that she hasn’t been able to sell her house.

The EPA’s inspection findings show a company with little regard for human life, she said.

“The owners have taken every opportunity in front of them and exploited it … to the extent that I question their ethical and moral standards,” Cardwell said. “And I think this has gone on for a long time.

“I think that the company has taken every shortcut, trying to maximize profits and putting their employees at risk and the residents in surrounding areas at risk with no qualms about what they were gonna destroy.”

STEM workforce.
The Capitol Hill visit highlighted how faculty advocacy can connect classroom and research experiences at Elon University to national conversations about innovation, economic growth, and workforce development.","In January 2026, Associate Professor of Mathematics Hwayeon Ryu traveled to Washington, D.C. to participate in #MathSciOnTheHill, a national advocacy event organized by the American Mathematical Society and 17 partner mathematical societies. The event brought together more than 290 mathematicians from across the United States to meet with members of Congress and their staff and to advocate for policies that strengthen STEM education and the U.S. STEM workforce through sustained federal investment.

Participants were organized into advocacy teams based on geographic location. Ryu and her team (of North Carolina 4th Congressional District) met with the offices of U.S. Senators Ted Budd and Thom Tillis through their legislative assistants and held an in-person meeting with U.S. Representative Valerie Foushee of North Carolina’s 4th Congressional District. In each meeting, Ryu participated in the discussions focused on STEM education and continued federal funding, through the National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Energy (DoE), and National Institutes of Health (NIH), to sustain and strengthen the U.S. STEM workforce.

The conversations emphasized that mathematics is foundational to nearly every STEM field, including artificial intelligence, biotechnology, cybersecurity, climate modeling and advanced manufacturing. While often operating behind the scenes, mathematical sciences provide the analytical framework that enables innovation across STEM fields. Federal support, such as NSF, ensures that students receive high-quality training in quantitative reasoning, data analysis, and interdisciplinary problem-solving—skills that are increasingly critical in a rapidly evolving economy.

As a faculty member at a primarily undergraduate institution, Ryu highlighted how her NSF-supported research directly benefits students from various STEM majors at Elon University. NSF funding allows faculty to engage undergraduates in authentic research experiences that integrate teaching and scholarship. Through these projects, students gain hands-on experience working with real data, computational models, and collaborative research teams. Many of her former and current students have gone on to graduate programs in STEM, federally funded research positions, or STEM careers in industry and healthcare, contributing directly to the national workforce pipeline.

The meetings also underscored the important role that primarily undergraduate institutions play in educating a diverse STEM workforce, including first-generation students and those from rural or underserved communities. Investments in NSF programs that support undergraduate research help expand access to STEM pathways and ensure that talent from a wide range of backgrounds is represented in the nation’s scientific workforce.

By participating in #MathSciOnTheHill, Ryu helped amplify a collective message from the mathematical sciences community: continued federal investment in mathematics education and research is a strategic investment in the strength, adaptability, and competitiveness of the U.S. STEM workforce.

The Kansas City Council will consider a change to the city’s zoning code at its meeting Thursday.","The green glass building at 1601 McGee towers over the Crossroads. It has sat empty since 2019, when the Kansas City Star closed its printing press there, and was once the Royals’ preference for a downtown ballpark.

Now the building is a data center. And it’s one of the first in the nation to receive a clean energy loan. Kansas City-based Patmos is undergoing a $1 billion retrofit of the 400,000-square-foot structure, which will also include office, event and conference space.

The company says retrofitting an existing building makes it cheaper, faster and more environmentally friendly to build. But critics say that doesn’t go far enough, and they argue AI data centers of all sizes need to be more regulated. The Kansas City Council is considering a change to its zoning law that would add more restrictions to data center developments.

Patmos received a $100 million commercial property assessed clean energy, or C-PACE, loan provided by PACE Loan Group, a private funding source. That’s the largest C-PACE loan granted in Missouri and one of the first in the country for a data center.

The loan will be used as financing to optimize the company’s HVAC system, which cools the data center load. That change should reduce the amount of electricity the center consumes over the 20 years of the loan agreement.

Josh Campbell, the executive director of Missouri Energy Initiative and administrator of Show Me PACE, said he thinks incentives like the clean energy loans could encourage data centers that are already planning to come to the state to be more energy efficient.

“My hope is that PACE loans can put that on their balance sheet, in their business plan, that they want to be more energy efficient,” Campbell said. “If this financing tool makes them look at it, then that's great.”

How a data center gets a clean energy loan

Joe Morgan, the chief operating officer at Patmos, said the data center is working to be a good neighbor to its Crossroads community. That includes making the decision not to put ventilation on the east side of the building so it wouldn’t impact the restaurants neighboring Patmos on Oak Street.

“It was important as part of this project that we pay our fair share and come in and not be a tax to the community by offsetting our stuff,” Morgan said.

C-PACE loans can only be used for parts of the project that save energy in some form. In Missouri, the loans are a public-private partnership through which the Show Me PACE board and staff approve projects requested by a property owner. Then, a private lending group loans the money, which is paid back over time through an additional line item on the developer’s property tax bill.

Campbell said he believes the loans will become more common for smaller data centers as that market grows.

Massive, hyperscale data centers like the ones by Google and Meta in Kansas City’s Northland likely won’t qualify for PACE loans. But Campbell said he hopes the financing tool will encourage other developers to use the loan to make their projects more energy efficient.

“What we're doing is trying to make sure that energy conservation is part of the conversation when any project is developed,” Campbell said. “That property will last longer, stay there better, produce more because their costs are lower, and they'll do so with a lower energy demand than they would have likely without PACE.”

More regulation for data centers

The rapid boom of data centers is putting a strain on the environment. The International Energy Agency predicts that electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to double by 2030, and climate pollution from the power plants that run them could more than double by 2025.

Communities across the country where data centers are built often complain about noise and the strain on utilities. And more than 230 environmental groups have written to Congress to ask for a nationwide moratorium on data centers that power AI.

There aren’t many other regulations or restrictions on data centers in Missouri. In fact, most data centers don’t have to pay sales tax on construction materials, machinery or equipment. Patmos did not receive financial incentives from Kansas City, but did get a sales tax break from the state.

Missouri’s and Kansas’ public service commissions recently approved a tariff on energy bills to large data centers that use more than 75 megawatts of peak load energy per month.

Though the utility tariffs include protections for residential rate payers, the staff report from the Missouri Public Service Commission notes that the large users still add to the overall system, which could increase costs.

Morgan said Patmos is committed to creating a mixed-use space that redevelops an existing building. The data center takes up a small part of the building, he said, and the rest will be dedicated to event and coworking spaces. Three companies have already begun to lease space in the building.

Morgan said the company is working with its engineering team to “ensure air, noise, and water demands are appropriately accounted for in our plans.” Patmos hasn’t conducted any environmental impact studies to see how the center will affect air and noise pollution or water demands.

Patmos also plans to use 12 diesel generators to power the center during peak energy times or when there’s a blackout. Morgan said they will be in a basement and shouldn’t have a large effect on noise in the neighborhood.

Ashley Sadowski serves on the Show Me PACE Clean Energy and Development Board and lives in Kansas City. She said PACE loans can be helpful to ensure that energy efficient measures are taken on big projects and to relieve the cost pressures that could affect other rate payers. But the loans can’t be prescriptive or make something like a data center completely environmentally friendly.

Environmental impact studies aren’t part of the review for PACE loans, and Show Me PACE can’t make demands from developers or factor in water usage or savings like the lending bodies can in other states.

Sadowski wants to see more regulation on data centers and thinks the city and other financial incentive bodies should tighten their restrictions before allowing them to be built.

“It is unclear how its (Patmos’) energy and water needs will impact others who are connected to the downtown district energy system,” Sadowski said. “I am glad to see the KC Star building utilized, but the Crossroads is an important neighborhood for our city, and we need to make sure surrounding residents and businesses are not harmed by this development.”

The city council will weigh in

More regulation could be coming. The Kansas City Council will consider a change to the city’s zoning code at its meeting Thursday. The change would limit where data centers could be located in the city and would require a review to ensure there’s adequate utility service for the projects when the council considers applications.

Morgan submitted a public testimony on behalf of Patmos in support of the zoning change.

“It's good for the community that they create some of these rules to make sure that they're good stewards of the citizens’ property,” Morgan said.

Some city council members also expressed interest in changing the city’s code to have more defined rules on the water and energy use of data centers.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a5b187a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1260+0+195/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe2%2F77%2F7aa1553f4f2b93823c38734b806c%2Fstar-building.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 10:02:09.198363

The proposed rule would revise a 2023 rule by former President Joe Biden’s administration on Section 401 of the Clean Water Act that gave states and tribes authority to protect waterways in their reviews of projects like pipelines and power plants requiring federal permits.

Biden’s rule replaced a rule from President Donald Trump’s first administration that limited the ability of states and tribes to block or force changes in the projects.

Jess Kramer, the EPA assistant administrator for water, told reporters the 2023 revision was “fundamentally flawed and it’s inefficient and ineffective.” Kramer said Biden’s revision led to lengthy certification timelines. The proposed rule, Kramer said, will lead to predictable permitting that would “unleash American energy dominance” and support emerging artificial intelligence infrastructure.

The 2023 rule had been praised by conservationists and environmental justice groups concerned about pollution effects on waterways and communities depending on them.

“Trump wants to allow fossil fuel companies to pollute our air and water with impunity, regardless of the consequences for our health or safety,” Cathy Collentine, a Sierra Club official, said in a release about the proposal.

Kramer said the proposed rule will ensure that Section 401 is “not weaponized by states to shut down projects for political purposes.” It would set timelines and standardize approaches that states and tribes use in water quality certifications that are required before the federal government issues project permits, the EPA said.

It was the latest move by Trump’s environmental agency to roll back Biden-era environmental rules while supporting development of energy including fossil fuels.

The Biden administration had already narrowed the rule in August 2023 after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 9-0 to limit the regulatory reach of the EPA on the rule, after many farmers and landowners had slammed the agency for what they called regulatory overreach.

The proposed rule will undergo a 30-day comment period and the EPA hopes to finalize the rule in the spring, Kramer said.",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2026/01/Energy-Projects.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 06:59:47.903539

But it also demonstrated two hard truths about offshore wind and the wider push towards clean power.
First, the days when offshore wind got cheaper every year are over.
We are a very long way from the hopeful days of 2022 when offshore wind was still tumbling in price.
Something has to be built because several nuclear power stations will soon close, and a third of the gas power plant fleet is nearing the end of its life.","The government has defied gloomy price expectations for its latest auction for offshore wind capacity. The worry a few months ago was that bill payers would be forced to pay more than £100 a megawatt hour (MWh) via contracts that give developers guaranteed prices for their electricity output. In the event, winning projects landed at roughly £91/MWh.

Cue some forgivable crowing from Ed Miliband, the energy secretary. “A monumental step towards clean power by 2030,” he declared. Officials pointed to calculations by the energy consultants Aurora and Baringa that £94/MWh would have been a “cost-neutral” outcome for consumers even though today’s wholesale price, usually set by gas generation, is about £81/MWh (the analysts’ reasoning is that using less gas lowers the wholesale price, offsetting the cost of the subsidies for new windfarms).

But let’s not get carried away. Yes, this auction was Europe’s “biggest ever” in commissioning 8.4GW of capacity in one go – and it again proved the virtue of competitive tension in the bidding process. But it also demonstrated two hard truths about offshore wind and the wider push towards clean power.

First, the days when offshore wind got cheaper every year are over. The last auction at the end of 2024 bagged capacity at £82/MWh but those contracts were for 15 years. Miliband’s switch to 20-year contracts this time probably knocked £5/MWh off headline numbers, so a like-for-like comparison might score this year’s outcome at closer to £96/MWh. That equates to inflation of 17%. We are a very long way from the hopeful days of 2022 when offshore wind was still tumbling in price. Higher borrowing rates and tighter supply chains have changed the arithmetic.

The second point flows from the first: the rollout of offshore wind at these prices will not knock squillions off the price of electricity. Any downward pressure on bills cannot be enormous when we’re talking about the difference between £91 and a theoretically neutral price of £94. Yes, more renewables offer protection against spikes in the price of gas. But, remember, Wednesday’s inflation-linked prices are being locked in for 20 years in a system that already produces some of the highest electricity prices in the developed world.

Onshore wind and solar, where auction results are due in fortnight, should come in cheaper. But offshore, with its greater generating capacities, is the renewables workhorse. The consensus among energy analysts is that “whole system” savings from a renewables- and nuclear-heavy system will only start to appear sometime about 2040.

None of which should be read as an argument against offshore wind. Something has to be built because several nuclear power stations will soon close, and a third of the gas power plant fleet is nearing the end of its life. As Miliband pointed out, new gas plants aren’t cheap either, given bottlenecks in the supply of turbines – call it £147MW/h for building and operating one, says the energy department.

Instead, this auction has really demonstrated that we are deep in the world of trade-offs in energy transition. There are no more easy 2022-style pickings. Is it, for example, vital to hit Miliband’s target for clean power, defined as 95% generation from low-carbon sources, by 2030? Of course not. The deadline was always artificial.

As it is, the government is probably on course for 85%-90% after Wednesday’s auction. Why bother with the last bit if, as seems to be the case, the law of diminishing returns is setting in? Electricity also needs to be cheaper (or, at least, not even more expensive) to encourage the take-up of electric vehicles, heat pumps and so on.

Instead, the most pressing questions in energy-land are different. Is it possible to take a chunk out of the towering £80bn bill for rewiring the electricity grid? If 90% low-carbon is deemed enough, possibly, as retail energy suppliers have argued. Will new transmission cables arrive before the new windfarms are built? That is critical to keep a lid on “constraint” payments that run on to billions of pounds.

And what is the government’s plan for gas? It barely talks about the backup system for cold, windless winter days that will be retained. That is despite the scariest report out of the energy department in recent months being the one that warned of an “emerging risk” of running out of gas supplies by 2030 if an important piece of kit, such as a pipeline from Norway or an LNG terminal, were out of action.

Encouragingly, there are hints of greater pragmatism. Chris Stark, the head of “mission control” unit in the energy department, said the 2030 target for offshore wind is “on track” but it is “not essential” to hit it given the strong result in the latest auction; there is scope to be “choosy” on projects in future. Good.

For the next step, Miliband could say out loud what everybody already knows: the 2030 generation deadline can be ditched because 90% clean power is fine and bigger energy challenges lie elsewhere.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae194759ab246c9f9d80ac7ec6209888b31dd133/150_0_4639_3710/master/4639.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=d68997253d3d0b4614a919d8f4110388",N,,2026-01-15 06:59:51.296393

Policy shifts are rapid, trade relations are uncertain, and investment decisions are increasingly shaped by the convergence of sustainability, fiscal incentives, and industrial policy.

Governments are deploying grants, subsidies, and targeted credits to secure critical industries, advance decarbonization, and retain investment at home.

The International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook projects global growth at 3.1% for 2026, a modest downgrade despite the recent wave of US tariffs and geopolitical tensions.

The IMF cautioned that this resilience may be temporary, as tariff rates remain high and inflationary pressures persist. Yet the broader message is clear: The world economy is adapting and changing, looking for more regional, strategically hedged networks.

Protectionism and Incentives

Across major economies, fiscal and trade policies are increasingly focusing on industrial competitiveness.

In the US, industrial and fiscal policy now move in lockstep. The Inflation Reduction Act and the massive 2025 tax-and-spending package offer production-linked credits, accelerated depreciation, and investment deductions for energy, semiconductors, and advanced manufacturing. Many credits are refundable or transferable, effectively operating as grants and improving liquidity.

These fiscal tools are supported by evolving import tariffs on steel, electric vehicles, and clean-tech components. This combination attracts global capital but adds uncertainty.

Tariff schedules and the 2025 tax-and-spending law provisions have changed several times, complicating project timelines and modeling. The US remains a major destination for industrial investment, yet multinational enterprises must factor in policy revisions and short implementation cycles.

In the EU, high energy and labor costs, plus a dense regulatory framework, continue to pressure competitiveness. One of the EU’s strategies is to turn decarbonization into an economic advantage. The Clean Industrial Deal and competitiveness compass aim to channel funding toward green manufacturing, circular-economy projects, and digitalization.

The Clean Industrial State Aid Framework, expected this year, will expand member countries’ ability to grant tax credits, accelerated depreciation, and direct funding for low-carbon projects. Additional programs such as the Innovation Fund, Important Projects of Common European Interest initiatives, and Horizon Europe complement this approach.

Meanwhile, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and EU Emissions Trading System seek to equalize carbon costs between EU producers and importers.

But simplification efforts under the omnibus legislative packages are bringing mixed results. Constant regulatory updates on key regulations such as the corporate sustainability reporting directive, corporate sustainability due diligence directive, and carbon border adjustment mechanism are creating uncertainty and this is only the beginning of a scheduled regulatory simplification wave.

Integrated data and full understanding of the supply chain is necessary to manage this complexity and access available funding streams.

Fiscal incentives, protectionist measures, and sustainability goals are now intertwined across these regions.

Pillar Two

The OECD Pillar Two framework was designed to end the global “race to the bottom” in corporate taxation by establishing a 15% minimum effective tax rate for large multinational groups. By late 2025, over 50 jurisdictions had implemented the Pillar Two rules or a domestic top-up tax of 15%.

The US didn’t implement the Pillar Two rules as it maintains that its net CFC tested income (formerly known as (GILTI), regime achieves similar goals. In the first week of January, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Inclusive Framework members reached agreement on a side-by-side approach, allowing the US system to operate alongside Pillar Two through dedicated safe harbors and creating the potential for other jurisdictions with eligible regimes to seek similar treatment.

Rather than delivering a fully uniform minimum tax framework, the side-by-side and ultimate parent entity safe harbors are expected to result in a more differentiated pattern of implementation over time. While many jurisdictions apply Pillar Two from fiscal year 2024, others will apply the rules from fiscal year 2025 or later, and further divergence may emerge depending on whether countries legislate for, or seek eligibility under, the new safe harbors.

Multinational groups are therefore likely to face a patchwork of outcomes that interact differently with domestic tax systems and incentive regimes.

A central question is how grants, tax credits, and other incentives are treated under this evolving framework. As part of its side-by-side package the OECD issued new administrative guidance on tax incentives, confirming that certain refundable or marketable tax credits recognized as income may retain their value under Pillar Two, subject to conditions.

The package also introduces a substance-based tax incentive safe harbor for selected expenditure-based and production-based incentives linked to real economic activity, while income-based incentives such as tax holidays or patent boxes still may depress effective tax rates and trigger top-up tax obligations.

At the same time, the guidance tightens integrity conditions by excluding incentives granted under discretionary governmental arrangements from beneficial treatment, in order to prevent incentives from being used to return tax in a way that would undermine the global minimum tax.

Further guidance is expected this year to address cases where incentives formally meet the definition of qualifying tax incentives but in practice offset the impact of Pillar Two.

Administrative guidance adopted in the first week of January further clarifies the treatment of government-granted tax benefits, including a limited grace period, generally covering fiscal years 2024 and 2025, for certain deferred tax expenses arising from arrangements in place before November 2021. The guidance also reinforces integrity safeguards to prevent the creation of new deferred tax assets designed to undermine the 15% effective tax rate.

For some time already, countries have been adjusting their tax frameworks in anticipation of these rules, converting deductions into grants, shortening refund periods, or making research and development credits refundable. For example, a renewable energy project supported through a refundable credit recognized as income is more likely to preserve its value under Pillar Two than one relying on a long tax holiday.

This allows governments to maintain competitive, investment-focused incentive regimes while operating within the constraints of the global minimum tax.

Adapting to Uncertainty

The current environment is turbulent. Existing geopolitical global dynamics complicate long-term investment planning. Incentives that appear beneficial today may lose value if their treatment evolves, and tariff changes can alter cost structures overnight. The IMF has noted that the private sector has responded with agility by front-loading imports, diversifying sourcing, and rerouting trade flows, but volatility remains a defining feature.

To navigate this environment, companies should invest in data traceability and scenario modeling. Mapping supply chains, origins, and combined nomenclature codes helps firms quantify tariff exposure, carbon costs, and compliance requirements under EU regulations.

AI-driven analytics are increasingly used to model the combined impact of tariffs, incentives, and minimum tax rules, providing corporate boards with timely insights into regulatory and fiscal risk.

Effective governance is equally important. Tax, trade and customs, treasury, sustainability, and government affairs teams should collaborate from the start of project planning to ensure that investment structures are both compliant and optimized. Waiting until projects are underway often means missed opportunities or higher exposure to policy changes.

The reversal was tucked away in Duke Energy’s latest long-term blueprint, which was filed in October and will be evaluated and finalized by regulators this year. Clean energy advocates had expected to fight that blueprint on familiar fronts — from its inclusion of new gas-fired power plants to its complete lack of near-term wind energy — but they were surprised by the backpedaling on the Bad Creek storage facility, located just over the border in South Carolina.

“Duke put this forward as something they were going to do, and everybody agreed,” said David Neal, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center. ​“To take out the one thing that everybody agreed on, without any announcement, without any fanfare,” he said, ​“is just baffling to me.”

Pumped hydro is a uniquely useful form of carbon-free electricity. It’s available on demand and can dispatch power over a much longer period than a lithium-ion battery can. It’s also rare: Construction of new pumped hydro facilities in the U.S. has stagnated for decades.

Duke’s original Bad Creek expansion plan would have catapulted the company to become the nation’s leader in pumped hydro. Now, advocates fear its about-face will undermine the state’s zero-carbon law by opening the door for a fleet of new gas plants instead.

A massive natural battery

Hydropower is one of the oldest forms of electricity generation — and it’s how Duke Energy, then called the Catawba Power Company, got its start in the early 1900s. A trio of entrepreneurs, led by James B. Duke, built a series of dams and lakes along the Catawba River, fostering the growth of mills and other industries that helped diversify the region’s economy.

Today, traditional hydropower makes up a tiny fraction of Duke-owned power capacity, with nearly 1.3 gigawatts spread across 25 different sites in the Carolinas. There’s no push to change that number, as conservation groups focus on removing the thousands of other dams in North Carolina that provide little to no upside to outweigh the ecological damage they cause.

Pumped storage hydropower — like that at Bad Creek — is a related but different beast. Two bodies of water at different elevations are connected with reversible turbines, producing or storing electricity, depending on what the grid needs.

“Let’s say it’s a spring day, a sunny day, a lot of solar on the grid, but not a lot of demand. You just bring that water uphill,” to store in the upper reservoir, Neal explained. ​“When you’re in a peak period, you run the water back downhill to generate electricity. It’s a very efficient, clean way of having storage.”

Duke launched its first pumped storage project in 1975 after building a dam between what is now Lake Jocassee and Lake Keowee below it. On the South Carolina side of the Blue Ridge Mountains, the four reversible turbines are slated to operate for at least another two decades.

The Bad Creek complex followed in 1991. The upper reservoir sits at an elevation of 2,310 feet, and Lake Jocassee, more than 1,000 feet below, serves as the lower reservoir. They’re linked by an underground concrete tunnel and a four-turbine powerhouse, capable of supplying enough electricity to power 1 million homes.

Totaling over 2.4 gigawatts, the Jocassee and Bad Creek plants function as massive batteries, and are the largest source of energy storage anywhere on Duke’s six-state electric system. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, only two states, Virginia and California, have more pumped storage capacity.

Duke recently upgraded the existing Bad Creek facility, increasing its capacity to nearly 1.7 gigawatts. But the utility has also long envisioned drilling a new tunnel and adding another four-turbine powerhouse at the site, adding another roughly 1.8 gigawatts. Doing so would help the company zero out its carbon emissions by midcentury, as required by state law.

In 2022, the company offered four pathways to limit its pollution; all included the expansion, dubbed Bad Creek II, by 2034. The additional Bad Creek capacity was also cemented in a compromise Duke struck with stakeholders to help get its last carbon-reduction plan approved. Regulators on the North Carolina Utilities Commission blessed the deal, directing the company to pursue ​“all reasonable development activities” to put Bad Creek II in place.

“It seems like a really bad deal”

But in October, when Duke submitted its 2026 carbon proposal, Bad Creek II was barely mentioned. Among 10 different pathways the company charted toward climate neutrality, only one included the new pumped storage capacity.

Earlier in 2025, Duke had quietly removed Bad Creek II from an engineering study that evaluated the impact of new power plants on the transmission system. The removal means that the soonest Bad Creek II could come online is now 2040 — six years later than previously envisioned — but the company doesn’t recommend even that late date or pinpoint a new one.

“Notwithstanding the delayed development timeline,” Duke said in its plan, the utility remains ​“committed to exploring the potential for additional [pumped storage hydro] capacity at the Bad Creek II site.”

The backtracking has alarmed clean energy advocates, who point out how well pumped storage complements other sources of renewable energy. Duke’s own modeling shows that adding Bad Creek II would enable more solar, onshore wind, and batteries, while eliminating the need for over 2 gigawatts of new gas plants.

“That all seems like a really good deal, and if we could do that sooner, as Duke had committed to in the last plan, and as the commission ordered it to do,” Neal said, ​“we’d be on such a clear path to complying with state law and having a much more diverse portfolio.”

Duke acknowledged that Bad Creek II would lead to lower overall costs than its preferred plan through 2050. Viewed in that light, Neal said, ​“it seems like a really bad deal for customers for Duke to be turning its back on this project.”

In its proposal, Duke offered no specifics on the long-term cost impacts of Bad Creek II, but did say that removing it from the grid impact study showed savings of approximately $358 million in ​“network upgrade costs.” By punting on the project, the company also put off spending tens of millions of dollars on developments.

Asked for more justification, beyond those up-front savings, for Duke’s bid to delay the project, spokesperson Bill Norton said via email: ​“More work is needed to assess whether Bad Creek II will be part of a least-cost plan for customers.”

As to whether the company might shelve the project entirely, Norton said that it ​“remains a potential resource in the future.” He added that Duke plans to spend enough money to qualify the expansion for time-limited 30% federal tax credits and that the potential for additional turbines is included in Duke’s relicensing application to federal regulators.

“While there is no specific timeline today for a second powerhouse,” Norton said, ​“our continued licensing work preserves the option for the future, and we will continue to engage our regulators on this decision.”

As the commission evaluates Duke’s long-term plans, advocates will be pushing for a green light on the Bad Creek expansion — especially as an alternative to the other, more speculative sources of firm power that the utility is banking on, like small modular reactors.

In contrast to that form of nuclear power, pumped hydro is ​“not a nascent technology,” said Justin Somelofske, senior regulatory counsel at the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association. That’s why in past hearings over the utility’s plans, he noted, ​“it was the one resource that was not in controversy and not contested.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/duke-energy-bad-creek.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=cbb250b0a81637a189448734db34afd9,N,,2026-01-15 03:59:56.949700

“FSD will only be available as a monthly subscription thereafter,” Musk wrote, offering no details about how that change would affect the software’s pricing.

Boosting Tesla’s Full Self-Driving software to 10 million monthly active subscriptions before 2035.","The EV maker announced Wednesday that going forward, its Full Self-Driving (Supervised) software will only be available as a monthly subscription—not a onetime payment. Tesla CEO Elon Musk broke the news on X, the social media platform he owns, noting that the shift will happen on February 14. “FSD will only be available as a monthly subscription thereafter,” Musk wrote, offering no details about how that change would affect the software’s pricing.

While the price of access to Full Self-Driving (FSD) mode has fluctuated over time, the current purchase price for the software is $8,000, or $99 paid as a monthly subscription. Tesla once charged as much as $15,000 for the technology, which promises to “intelligently and accurately complete driving maneuvers for you,” including steering, making lane changes, and parking. The feature requires “active driver supervision” and doesn’t “make the vehicle autonomous,” Tesla disclaims on the Full Self-Driving website.

Tesla’s decision to flip to a subscription model for its self-driving software may not land well with some Tesla buyers, but it doesn’t come as a total surprise. In November, Tesla’s shareholders approved an eye-watering pay package for Musk that consolidates even more power at the company with the mercurial billionaire, with the promise of a payout that could be worth $1 trillion. One of the pay package milestones Musk must hit to unlock the biggest executive payout in history? Boosting Tesla’s Full Self-Driving software to 10 million monthly active subscriptions before 2035.

Much of Tesla’s future revolves around the future of its self-driving tech, but Musk has broken many promises about the software along the way. In California, the company is facing legal woes over deceptive marketing practices that suggested Tesla’s technology was autonomous, even as it required close supervision from a human driver at the wheel—hence the software’s current nomenclature: “Full Self-Driving (Supervised).” Musk has also asserted that Tesla’s vehicles would be “appreciating assets,” thanks to the self-driving software—a claim not borne out by Tesla’s recent tanking used-vehicle prices.

Tesla’s competition heats up

Depending on where you look, Tesla’s competition is either out ahead or catching up fast. Earlier this month, Chinese company BYD bumped Tesla from its top slot as the world’s best-selling electric vehicle maker. Tesla reported that it delivered 1.64 million EVs last year, a 9% dip from the year prior. In the last quarter of 2025, Tesla missed sales expectations, tallying 418,227 sales—a decline connected to Trump’s decision to kill the hefty U.S. tax credits designed to give Americans a break on qualifying EVs.

Tesla, like Musk, has a lot of irons in the fire. The company is also investing aggressively into the robotaxi business, even as its self-driving tech faces scrutiny from federal regulators for reckless behavior. Tesla has a lot of catching up to do on that count, with Alphabet’s Waymo leading the push into autonomous taxi service across major U.S. cities like Austin, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2026/01/p-1-91474691-tesla-full-self-driving-paywall.jpg",N,,2026-01-15 11:01:10.983113

Copper demand continued to grow in 2025, driven by energy-transition requirements originating in the transportation sector, as well as emerging demand from data centers. The market enters into a deficit in 2026. Copper supply faces acute long-term pressure, as a boom in copper-intensive data centers coincides with mine disruptions and slow permitting.

A tight copper market in 2026 signals higher price risk and potential supply-chain constraints for electrification projects. The proliferation of EVs, the expansion of grids and the manufacturing of batteries could face cost inflation or delays.

Japan power – Average baseload power price for 2026 will fall to ¥11.4 per kilowatt-hour

Japan’s power prices are set to trend downward over the next five years as flat demand meets supply growth. BNEF expects Japan’s power prices to average ¥11.4 per kilowatt-hour in the coming year, a 5.1% drop from 2025. Japan’s declining average power prices may relieve industrial cost pressures but will challenge merchant generators.

However, structural shifts – such as aging fossil fuel generators being displaced by nuclear and renewable generation, along with hotter, prolonged summers – could still create sharp peaks and stress the power system.

EU carbon – Carbon price hits €87 per ton

Prices in the European Union’s Emissions Trading System will rise 16% in 2026 to €87 per ton. This is primarily due to a 21% drop in allowance supply – the result of a downward revision on free allocation benchmarks, the phase-in of the levy for the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and shipping allowance cancellations. A tighter allowance market will raise compliance costs for heavy industry and power producers, increasing the incentive for fuel switching, efficiency measures and early decarbonization.

LNG supply – 29 million metric tons of new capacity to come online in 2026

The global LNG market is headed for a glut in supply, with new production capacity slated to commission from the US, Qatar, Australia, Mexico and Africa in 2026. About 8 million tons of export capacity is expected online from the major Qatari North Field Expansion project, and the Golden Pass LNG project in Texas adds two out of three production trains in 2026 – at 5.2 million tons capacity each.

The level of supply entering the market will depend on the commissioning timelines and ramp-up schedules set by the operators. Much of this new capacity is not directly tied to long-term LNG contracts and could find its way into the spot market, putting downward pressure on prices –already reflected in the forward curves for the European gas benchmark price and the Asian spot LNG price marker in coming years.

Renewable fuels – 1.07 billion gallons per year of new renewable fuels production capacity announced for China

China’s 15th five-year plan, to be announced in March, is widely expected to introduce a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blending target. As the market evolves from pilot programs to mandated consumption levels, the volume of announced production capacity targeted to come online in 2026 has hit a high over 1 billion gallons per year, almost half of all global additions announced in the year ahead.

China’s move toward a national SAF mandate positions it to dominate global renewable-fuel manufacturing capacity. This could shift supply chains, lower SAF costs globally, and intensify competitive pressure on Western producers.

Petrochemicals – 15.6 million metric tons per year of new ethylene production nameplate capacity

China’s rapid capacity expansion has cut into its imports, redirecting them to Europe and squeezing the region’s older and smaller assets that were already struggling with high costs and thin margins. The strain has triggered a wave of closures, the latest being Exxon Mobil Corp.’s 800,000 metric tons per year ethylene plant in Fife, Scotland. A massive wave of new Chinese-led ethylene supply will deepen global oversupply, pressure margins and accelerate closures in Europe. Petrochemical producers outside China face heightened competitiveness challenges.

Weather – +0.5°C temperature anomaly in summer

The US National Center for Environmental Prediction’s Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CSFv2) forecast puts the Niño 3.4 temperature anomaly at +0.5°C for June–August 2026. That suggests that La Niña may linger into early next year before easing toward neutral or even El Niño territory.

If this shift happens earlier than forecast, expectations for a cold La Niña winter could fade. That would reduce US heating degree days and leave natural gas supplies more comfortable by the end of winter.

US power – Power demand from data centers to reach 48.3GW

The rapid expansion of the US data center fleet will lead to a 7.7GW jump in average power demand from the sector in 2026.

Analysis of key power market regions like PJM Interconnection and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (Ercot) indicates that grid tipping points are already emerging, as planned power supply fails to keep pace with accelerating data-center growth.

Data centers are now a system-wide driver of grid stress. Major markets may face capacity shortfalls unless generation and transmission expansions accelerate, increasing reliability and pricing risk.

US gas – $3.90/MMBtu marginal supply cost for Haynesville, Texas, dry gas

The US needs to unlock more gas supply to feed a growing number of LNG export terminals along the Gulf Coast and support data centers’ rising power demand. The Haynesville shale basin is expected to be a key driver of US natural gas supply growth in the medium term, given its proximity to LNG terminals and pipeline constraints limiting growth in other regions. BNEF’s latest breakeven cost estimates place the Texas-side of Haynesville as the marginal gas producing region. US Henry Hub gas price futures for 2026, as of Dec. 15, were trading at an average of $3.86/MMBtu – just below BNEF’s marginal gas production cost estimate. Maintaining supply growth to meet rising demand may require higher US gas prices or further improvements in well productivity, drilling and completion costs.

These include a plant in Michigan that Secretary of Energy Chris Wright ordered to remain open, citing an “emergency” energy shortage.
Wright has said he expects most coal plants will stay online to service the energy demands of A.I.
Nuclear plants take years to plan and build, and rarely finish ahead of schedule.","Energy-hungry data centers have been a lifeline for ailing U.S. coal plants, analysts say.

U.S. data centers are predicted to consume up to 106 gigawatts of power by 2035, up from just 35 gigawatts in 2024, according to BloombergNEF. Power utilities are citing the spread of data centers as a rationale to keep coal plants online — plants that have, for decades, been losing ground to solar, wind, and natural gas.

Chris Womack, head of power utility Southern Company, said at a recent industry conference, “We’re going to extend coal plants as long as we can because we need those resources on the grid.”

Since the beginning last year, at least 15 coal plants have had their planned retirements delayed, some indefinitely, according to a recent DeSmog analysis of Energy Department data. These include a plant in Michigan that Secretary of Energy Chris Wright ordered to remain open, citing an “emergency” energy shortage.

Wright has said he expects most coal plants will stay online to service the energy demands of A.I. Coal, he said in September, “will be essential to powering America’s reindustrialization and winning the A.I. race.”

Wright has also looked to nuclear as a way to meet demand from data centers. Globally, nuclear is gaining steam. Fifteen nuclear reactors are slated to go online worldwide this year, up from just two in 2025, according to BNEF. Another 50 reactors are due to be switched on before 2030.

But analysts say U.S. nuclear may struggle to compete with other forms of electricity. Nuclear plants take years to plan and build, and rarely finish ahead of schedule. So while A.I. could give nuclear a boost, said BNEF analyst Chris Gadomski, “Unless the nuclear industry responds quickly, this opportunity may be lost to fossil fuels and renewables.”

NASA and the U.S. Department of Energy on Tuesday said they were renewing their commitment to deploying nuclear reactors on the Moon and in orbit.","New York will target development of 5 GW of new nuclear power, vastly expanding on a 1-GW goal set last June, Gov. Kathy Hochul announced Tuesday in her State of the State address.

Hochul’s speech was short on details regarding her nuclear aspirations. The state’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act requires New York to achieve a 100% zero-emission electricity system by 2040. And last month, the New York State Energy Planning Board adopted a new state energy plan that cast nuclear energy as key to New York’s reliability and decarbonization goals.

The plan, which offers “broad” guidance rather than binding targets, also highlighted some of the challenges facing nuclear. It described nuclear projects’ “long lead times and uncertain costs,” and noted the likely need for changes to zero emission credit programs and wholesale markets to balance concerns over capacity, reliability and ratepayer impacts.

A policy book released alongside Hochul’s speech says the governor plans to direct state agencies to “establish a clear pathway for additional advanced nuclear generation to support grid reliability.” A nuclear reliability “backbone” will be developed through a new Department of Public Service process “to consider, review, and facilitate a cost-effective pathway to 4 gigawatts of new nuclear energy.”

If successful, the buildout would bring New York’s total nuclear fleet to more than 8 GW. The state currently has three plants with four operating reactors totaling 3.4 GW of capacity, all owned by Constellation Energy. Nuclear power supplies about 21% of New York’s electricity.

“Go big or go home,” the democratic governor said during her address, adding that the state seeks to build more nuclear generation “than has been built anywhere in the United States in the last 30 years.”

In 2024, Georgia Power completed an expansion of Plant Vogtle in Georgia, including the first two new nuclear reactors built in the U.S. in decades. The reactors came online years late and cost more than double the original estimate of $14 billion, and continue to roil energy politics in Georgia.

Utilities and large energy users have increasingly explored small modular reactors as a potential alternative to the large, traditional reactors like those deployed at Vogtle, but none are operating in the U.S. currently and the technology is nascent.

Doreen Harris, president and CEO of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, praised the governor’s plan for creating a “nuclear reliability backbone.”

“This effort will provide firm, clean power that will compliment over 50 GW of incremental renewable energy resources and reduce NY’s reliance on fossil fuel generation,” Harris wrote on LinkedIn. “By creating a stable foundation of always-on energy, the Backbone will allow renewable resources to operate more efficiently and flexibly.”

Hochul also said New York will “launch a nuclear workforce development program” to ensure the state is ready to build the new plants.

There have been a spate of nuclear projects announced around the U.S. recently, as utilities and large consumers look for ways to meet rising electricity demand. Much of the need centers around the development of data centers to serve artificial intelligence.

Meta announced Friday that it has struck deals with Oklo, Vistra and TerraPower to supply up to 6.6 GW of nuclear power to its data centers by 2035.

President Trump has said he wants the U.S. to deploy 300 GW of net new nuclear capacity by 2050 and have 10 large reactors under construction by 2030. In October, Westinghouse Electric, Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management announced they’d entered into a strategic partnership with the U.S. government to deploy $80 billion in new nuclear reactors.

NASA and the U.S. Department of Energy on Tuesday said they were renewing their commitment to deploying nuclear reactors on the Moon and in orbit.

Back on Earth, New York’s grid operator anticipates electricity demand could increase by 50% to 90% over the next two decades, driven by the electrification of heating and transportation and the development of energy intensive projects and industry such as data centers.

“Data centers are vital for an innovative future,” Hochul said in her Tuesday address. “But they guzzle up tremendous amounts of energy and leave ratepayers footing the bill. So if they want to build in New York, they’ll have to pay their fair share for the power they use and ultimately generate their own power independently.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/tet_ubyIFCLo-RhmHY9Jiyo2Q12nd_JC_mvbzIQbBhc/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9ob2N1bC5wbmc=.webp,N,,2026-01-15 06:59:57.293573

Moving forward, my values will remain unchanged.","Today, as our first Council action of 2026, my colleagues and I elected Councilor Jamie Dunphy to serve as our next Council President and Councilor Olivia Clark to serve as our next Vice President.

I want to congratulate each of my colleagues on their elections. They are both thoughtful, detail-oriented, future-focused, and deeply committed, as proven over long careers, to our community. I look forward to watching them lead with integrity, compassion, and vision for our city.

I also want to congratulate District 1 on having one of their Councilors elected as Council President. I think it is noteworthy that North/Northeast and East Portland have held the president's gavel under this new form of government, and I look forward to seeing the gains we can make for East Portland with their Councilor at the helm.

It has been an honor to serve as the Portland City Council's first President, and I am proud of the work my office accomplished during that time. We built a new Council-led government from the ground up, and did so while fending off unwarranted and unprecedented attacks from the federal administration. We passed critical policies, often unanimously, drafted with crucial input guided by Portlanders' testimony and our own diverse experiences. And we began to establish norms for how we work with the Administrative and Executive branches of our City. I look forward to sharing what I have learned and providing counsel to Council President Dunphy as he carries forward the torch, and seeing the innovative ways he adds to the creation of this work.

The process to elect this year's leadership was incredibly challenging. I have always said that democracy is messy, and designed to be so – but this particular discussion was beyond messy, and I have heard from many of you that we failed to build confidence from Portlanders in this Council's ability to do the people's business. That is not what our city deserves or should expect.

I am thankful we were able to reach a resolution, and I believe the call to action is clear – we have to do the people's business. We have to put politics and personality aside.

Now, I'm stepping into a new pair of shoes: full-time City Councilor for District 2. Moving forward, my values will remain unchanged. As Councilor, I will continue to emphasize the importance of responsive, effective government, bringing a resolution to make E-Council, our system for tracking policy, more transparent and accessible to the public.

I will also continue fighting for Portland families, working to make Portland affordable, and protecting our basic rights and freedoms. Some of my priorities for this year include:

Restoring and reopening the Columbia Pool, as it plays a vital role in District 2 for working families

Bringing forward an ordinance with co-sponsors Council President Dunphy and Councilor Tiffany Koyama-Lane, updating City Code to provide greater access for families, caregivers, and all community members to single-use restrooms across the city

Today, a coalition of 34 organizations filed a rulemaking petition urging the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Rural Business-Cooperative Service (RBCS) to deem anaerobic digesters that are located at industrial livestock operations or use livestock manure ineligible for grants and loans under the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP). At the same time, Earthjustice filed a lawsuit on behalf of petitioner Friends of the Earth, challenging the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)’s violation of the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for illegally withholding public records that detail the agency’s decisions to fund manure digesters using REAP dollars.

REAP exists to help farmers and rural small businesses lower energy costs and foster stronger communities, not prop up factory farms,” said Molly Armus, Animal Agriculture Policy Program Manager at Friends of the Earth. “If USDA wants to save taxpayer dollars, it should stop wasting its funds on inefficient, costly digesters and instead invest in projects that truly benefit rural communities.”

The petition urges RBCS to disqualify manure digesters from REAP funding because these projects undermine the very goals the program was created to advance. REAP was created to help farmers and rural small businesses cut energy costs and strengthen local economies; yet hundreds of millions of tax dollars have been funneled into expensive, polluting manure digesters. Manure digesters, which are meant to capture methane emissions and generate energy from large amounts of animal waste, overwhelmingly benefit industrial-scale livestock operations, fuel consolidation in rural areas, and contribute to air and water pollution that threatens nearby residents.

The petition also notes that over the last five years, new manure digesters received average loan guarantees of $18.7 million, almost three times more than the average loan guarantees for solar projects, all while delivering far less energy per taxpayer dollar than the solar projects. As farmers and rural communities confront worker losses, reduced project funding, and declining markets, it is critical that federal funding supports projects that do not deepen these harms.

“Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from industrial livestock operations is critical, but manure digesters are a false solution,” said Kara Goad, Senior Associate Attorney at Earthjustice. “Manure digesters do not offer cost-effective emissions reductions or energy generation, and supporting them keeps limited funds from going to practices that reduce emissions, support small farms, and mitigate air and water pollution.”

Petitioners include: Socially Responsible Agriculture Project, Animal Legal Defense Fund, Buffalo River Watershed Alliance, Campaign for Family Farms and the Environment, Cape Fear River Watch, Center for Food Safety, CleanAIRE NC, Climate Action California, Environmental Justice Community Action Network, Farm Aid, Farm Forward, Food & Water Watch, Friends of Toppenish Creek, Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, Kansas Rural Center, Kissimmee Waterkeeper, Michiganders for a Just Farming System, Milwaukee Riverkeeper, North Carolina Environmental Justice Network, National Family Farm Coalition, Nebraska Communities United, Northeast Organic Dairy Producers Alliance, Organic Farming Research Foundation, Potomac Riverkeeper, RE Sources, RedTailed Hawk Collective, Rural Empowerment Association for Community Help, Shenandoah Riverkeeper, Southern Coalition for Social Justice, Sustain Rural Wisconsin Network, Upper Potomac Riverkeeper, and Waterkeeper Alliance.

Meanwhile, the lawsuit filed today challenges USDA’s unlawful use of the “deliberative process” exemption under FOIA to withhold 25 spreadsheets that show how the agency evaluated digester funding applications. These records reflect final decisions, not internal deliberations, and are critical for the public to understand why USDA uses its limited REAP funds to support these harmful and ineffective projects.

The petition outlines how funding for digesters is hurting – not helping – farmers and our environment, including:

Benefits go to the biggest polluters. Subsidies for anaerobic digesters primarily benefit the largest industrial animal operations, giving them another subsidized competitive advantage over smaller farms and accelerating the loss of independent farms and rural economic vitality.

Environmental harms. The petition documents numerous environmental harms associated with digesters, including spills and overflows releasing hundreds of thousands of gallons of waste into waterways as well as increased ammonia and nitrate pollution from the leftover byproduct, digestate. Methane leaks and herd expansion linked to manure digesters also make their impact on greenhouse gases dubious.

High costs and poor returns. Digesters often cost between $2–12 million, require enormous taxpayer subsidies, and rarely recoup their costs. They’re also inefficient, with the digesters that received loan guarantees generating 4.5 times less energy per dollar than solar loan guarantee recipients. Specifically, the digesters that received loan guarantees generate an average of 8,047 BTUs annually per REAP dollar, while the solar projects that received loan guarantees generate an average of 36,728 BTUs annually per REAP dollar. Data further shows that many digesters shut down prematurely, making them a risky investment of public dollars.

Better alternatives to build resiliency exist. REAP is consistently oversubscribed, so by making digesters ineligible, more funding could support projects like solar panels for small farms or energy-efficient refrigeration for rural grocery stores. These are the types of projects that lower costs and deliver lasting community benefits.

“There is no way to make factory farm gas sustainable,” said Sherri Dugger, Executive Director at Socially Responsible Agriculture Project. “Rather than using already limited REAP funds to subsidize these toxic operations, USDA should support the independent farmers, small business owners, and rural residents who are working to build healthier outcomes in their home communities.”

“These enormously expensive digesters serve as a subsidy for factory farms, incentivizing them to get bigger to produce more waste as they push small and mid-sized farms out,” said Ben Lilliston, Director of Rural Strategies and Climate Change at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy. “Digesters are an increasingly risky investment, when more stable and cost effective options for renewable energy are in high demand from farmers.”

“This petition is important to the people of south central Washington where farmers are struggling to survive after three straight years of drought,” said Jean Mendoza, Executive Director of Friends of Toppenish Creek. “The REAP program should endeavor to disperse funds as equitably as possible with a goal of maximizing environmental benefits for all farmers. REAP funding should not be siphoned off to benefit a segment that actively and brazenly pollutes the land.”

“The use of anaerobic digesters exacerbates the already heavy burden imposed by factory farming on communities and the environment,” said Patience Burke, Pure Farms, Pure Waters National Campaign Manager at Waterkeeper Alliance. “This petition removes the veil and is a powerful illustration of how factory farm biogas is not a clean source of energy. Limited REAP funding should be available to truly renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, and not used in a way that perpetuates the abysmal manure management practices of factory farming.”

“It is important that the government takes steps to ensure that applicants selected for this funding are using the best available technology for the protection of the public’s health,” said Sherri White-Williamson, Executive Director of Environmental Justice Community Action Network.

“For too long, USDA has allowed factory farms and their Big Ag backers to syphon limited conservation funds toward expensive, ineffective, and dirty factory farm biogas projects,” said Tyler Lobdell, Senior Attorney at Food & Water Watch. “USDA must cut them off. It’s time these federal dollars were put back in the pockets of sustainable farmers who need them most.”

“REAP should help build the Michigan we all want to see by supporting truly clean energy, not subsidizing polluting manure digesters on factory farms.” said Val Schey with Michiganders for a Just Farming System. “Ending REAP funding for digesters would ensure the program works for Michigan’s rural communities, not against them.”

“In North Carolina, communities are living next to some of the nation’s largest hog operations, many of them owned by international corporations,” said Anne Harvey David, Chief Counsel for Environmental Justice at Southern Coalition for Social Justice. “That reality is a far cry from the small family farms REAP was meant to serve.”

“Factory farm gas is being sold as climate progress, but in reality, it locks in the very pollution and consolidation that rural communities are struggling to escape,” said Andrew deCoriolis, Executive Director of Farm Forward. “Taxpayer dollars spent on digesters prop up industrial animal operations while worsening air and water pollution. USDA should redirect these funds to farmers and ranchers who are producing food in ways that actually protect the climate, public health, and rural livelihoods.”

“Factory farm biogas production further enriches industrial animal agriculture and biogas developers at the expense of rural communities,” said Christine Ball-Blakely, Senior Staff Attorney at the Animal Legal Defense Fund. “REAP funds exist to help rural communities, not the industries that harm them.”

If they win, the casualties will be good-paying jobs, small and large renewable energy businesses, cleaner air, and climate action.
In short, the war on solar is real, and the general public doesn’t care.","With the Federal Government renaming and redefining the mission of the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) to the “National Laboratory of the Rockies,” it’s time for the solar, wind, and renewable energy industries to declare the quiet part out loud: The U.S. government is waging a financial and regulatory war against the development and deployment of renewable energy.

You might think that a “war on solar” is aggressive language. But this war is far from a secret. The President, his cabinet, and many conservative lawmakers publicly attack renewables as “the green new scam” and spread misinformation about its cost and reliability. Sadly, their aggressive actions speak even louder than their words.

Not only has the Trump administration redefined NREL, but they’ve also taken numerous actions to defund and aggressively regulate the development and deployment of renewable energy, including:

Leading the repeal of the IRA’s clean energy subsidies.

Using presidential executive orders to add hurdles to renewable energy development and favor more expensive fossil fuels.

Cancelling approved permits for renewable energy and transmission projects that are already under construction.

Clawing back hundreds of millions in grants for community solar and grants for low-income people.

Proposing that fossil fuel pollution isn’t harmful to our health.

Laying off thousands of Federal environmental, pollution, and renewable energy researchers, lawyers, and administrators.

In short, the Trump administration has weaponized the government to do everything in its power—no pun intended—to slow down renewable energy’s growth. There is no longer a level playing field or an “all-the-above” U.S. energy strategy. For this administration, U.S. “energy dominance” refers mainly to fossil fuels and expensive nuclear power.

If they win, the casualties will be good-paying jobs, small and large renewable energy businesses, cleaner air, and climate action. America will also become less competitive with China. Worst of all for everyone, electricity prices are going to continue to rise.

But here’s the good news: I know that we can and will win this war. Why? Follow the money: Despite all these challenges, solar and energy storage are still the cheapest to and fastest way to build new capacity for the grid. Nuclear, gas, and coal can’t compete for speed or cost.

But economics and technology can’t win this war alone. For renewables to truly win, we need to win the hearts and minds of local and national policymakers and consumers.

Like any war, we need strong public support. The public—especially voters—must be aware and care that solar, wind, battery, and other new energy and “electrotech” companies are unfairly being attacked.

Likewise, the same people must understand that these industries are directly affecting their lives by:

Decreasing electricity bills.

Supporting self-reliance and energy independence.

Inexpensively powering new AI data centers.

Creating new jobs today and for the future.

Helping farmers preserve their land and earn extra income.

Contributing local tax revenue where we build projects.

Earning a return for energy investors.

Helping America innovate and compete against China and other global tech competitors.

Decreasing pollution and its health, environmental, and financial costs.

And did I mention decreasing electricity bills? That’s worth repeating.

Beyond lawsuits and lobbying, the way to defend our valuable industries is through consistent, positive, accurate, creative communications that flood social media, influencers, and front-page headlines. This will generate social media conflicts, but that conflict will inspire conversations that will eventually neutralize anti-renewable energy propaganda.

This war of words playbook isn’t new. It’s pretty much a copy of the oil and gas industry’s tactics. What could be new is that the renewable energy industry finally steps up to fund and deploy our own clean energy messaging and lobbying dollars with the same media weapons.

If we don’t act now and make consumers and policymakers care about the benefits of solar, storage, and other renewables, we run the risk of being unfairly blamed or used as a scapegoat for the most important topic in everyone’s minds right now – energy affordability. While the facts are clear that solar and storage are the cheapest forms of new energy additions onto the existing grid, the misinformation campaign that the other side is waging is louder and being heard over ours. Energy economics will always win in the long run, but the long run will take some time, and I am concerned about the consistent black eye that the industry will receive in between now and then.

So far, our industry response has been muted or preaching to the solar choir. We must be more aggressive. It’s up to every renewable energy company to engage our workers, the media, family, and friends. When they casually ask how we’re doing, we must take the opportunity to say that there’s an aggressive and pointless government war against solar businesses and solar jobs. We must explain how this war is directly affecting their health, their children’s future, and their electric bills.

2026 can be renewable energy’s year to fight back. A word-of-mouth grass-roots effort can be cost-effective for the entire industry if we continually volunteer our attention, voices, and social media accounts.

This is a moment for everyone who believes in clean energy, innovation, and truth to step up. If you’re interested in organizing, contributing funds or time to a fresh fight-back campaign, join this campaign list. Let’s come together and share our ideas, dollars, and mindshare to beat this thing. By donating to support a broad public-education campaign, you can help stop misinformation in its tracks and make sure voters and communities hear the facts—not the fearmongering.

In short, the war on solar is real, and the general public doesn’t care. If we’re not pushing back on X, TikTok, and the news, we lose.

Congress is rushing to beat a Jan. 30 deadline to pass the annual appropriations bills to avoid another government shutdown.

Top lawmakers on the Senate and House appropriations committees released a two-bill package Sunday that contains funding for the Departments of State, Treasury and other related agencies.

The House voted 341 to 79 to pass the package, kicking it over to the Senate.

The Senate, meanwhile, is moving through procedural votes on a three-bill package that includes funding for the Departments of Commerce, Justice and Interior, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency. The House approved the package last week in a vote that was overwhelmingly bipartisan.

If both pieces of legislation make it to President Trump's desk, Congress will have four more appropriations bills to pass to fully fund the government through the end of the fiscal year.

But the Senate has a weeklong recess next week and the House is scheduled to be out the week after — creating a quick turnaround on the final bills, including a controversial measure to fund the Department of Homeland Security.

Plans were dropped to include the Homeland Security Department appropriations in the package unveiled this week after an ICE officer fatally shot a Minnesota woman. Democrats have threatened to withhold their support for this funding if it does not include ICE reforms.

""It's a politically very sensitive topic,"" GOP Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, said Tuesday. ""That's why we decided not to push ahead with a Homeland bill this week.""

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said it's ""one of the major issues that the appropriators are confronting right now.""

Cole said negotiations on the other remaining bills are ""very close"" to wrapping up and he expected passage in both chambers.

""Then we've just got to strategize how to get Homeland, if we can,"" he said. ""But most of the government should be up and functional.""

If a deal can't be reached on Homeland Security, Cole said lawmakers would likely pass another temporary measure, which would maintain funding for the agency at its current level.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/08/1fe9b272-8c58-4164-ae7e-4c7c721f6a4c/thumbnail/1200x630g2/5bace918166d731eb22dd91665528dff/gettyimages-2254819076.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 23:58:41.989333

A nonresident spouse’s wealth is included in the covered taxpayer’s net worth for wealth tax purposes.
Any wealth tax imposes significant economic costs, and the impact of a state-level tax of 5 percent is likely to be particularly severe.","Introduction

The 2026 Billionaire TaxA tax is a mandatory payment or charge collected by local, state, and national governments from individuals or businesses to cover the costs of general government services, goods, and activities. Act,[1] a California ballot initiative, would ostensibly impose a one-time tax of 5 percent on the net worth of the state’s billionaires. Due, however, to aggressive design choices and possible drafting errors, the actual rate on taxpayers’ net worth could be dramatically higher.

One particularly momentous policy choice has the potential to strip the founders of some of the world’s largest companies of their controlling interests and force them to sell off a significant portion of their shares. This could send stock prices plummeting to the detriment of tech employees and investors of all stripes, including ordinary workers whose 401(k)s would take a beating if Silicon Valley founders had to offload their shares in a hurry.

The poorly drafted initiative creates many scenarios in which tax liability would be vastly more than 5 percent of net worth, but this analysis focuses on six of them:

Valuation can be based on voting interests in a company when they exceed actual economic stakes.

Assessment rules for privately held businesses can substantially overvalue them.

Draconian underpayment penalties for taxpayers and potentially ruinous penalties for their appraisers encourage substantial overstatement of the value of privately held businesses to avoid a dispute with tax authorities.

Presumptive drafting errors on anti-avoidance rules result in taxing significantly more than the amount of the transfers.

Provisions regarding spousal assets and indebtedness to relatives would tax a nonresident spouse’s assets and, in the event of a divorce, would tax the California resident on formerly held assets that had been obligated to the ex-spouse in a divorce settlement.

Deferral regimes have eligibility limitations and impose additional costs, and run the risk of taxing wealth that might no longer exist.

Each of these features makes an already unprecedented tax even more destructive. If the initiative passes, California must brace for an exodus of founders and investors fleeing not just extraordinarily high tax burdens, but also the potential loss of the companies they created. A loss of jobs, startups, investment capital, and economic growth would be among the consequences of a large wave of departures, and of the tax burden on those who remain or whom state officials deem not to have escaped the clutches of the tax.

Valuation by Voting Rights Can Break Up Controlling Interests

The proposed wealth taxA wealth tax is imposed on an individual’s net wealth, or the market value of their total owned assets minus liabilities. A wealth tax can be narrowly or widely defined, and depending on the definition of wealth, the base for a wealth tax can vary. has distinct valuation methods for different asset classes and ownership structures. Publicly traded assets are valued based on the assets’ market trading value, but there are different rules for assets that are not publicly traded.

Under the initiative, “For any interests that confer voting or other direct control rights, the percentage of the business entity owned by the taxpayer shall be presumed to be not less than the taxpayer’s percentage of the overall voting or other direct control rights.”[2]

Founders often hold private Class B or other super-voting shares with transfer restrictions preventing them from being sold to the public, but which confer voting control over a publicly traded company. Together, for instance, Larry Page and Sergey Brin own about 11.3 percent of Alphabet (Google) but control 52.3 percent of voting rights. Similarly, Mark Zuckerberg owns about 13.6 percent of Meta but has 61.0 percent voting control.[3]

It is possible that the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB), charged with administering the new tax, would determine that these shares are publicly tradable because they have an ascertainable value and can be converted into tradeable Class A shares under a dual-class structure. In that case, they would be taxed by their market value.

Of considerable concern for founders, though, is the very real possibility that they would not be considered publicly traded assets, in which case the proposed wealth tax would apply to founders’ and early investors’ share of voting rights, even if they are not at all representative of their actual economic stake in the company. This could force founders to convert their Class B shares to Class A and sell them as common stock, surrendering their controlling stakes and liquidating large portions of their investment.[4]

Two billionaires represent opposite extremes: Tony Xu, the founder of DoorDash, owns 2.6 percent of his company but controls 57.6 percent of the vote, yielding wealth tax liability of $2.62 billion on an ownership interest worth $2.41 billion. Since selling his shares incurs capital gains taxA capital gains tax is levied on the profit made from selling an asset and is often in addition to corporate income taxes, frequently resulting in double taxation. These taxes create a bias against saving, leading to a lower level of national income by encouraging present consumption over investment. , moreover, and the entire value of these shares is capital gains for him, his total tax liability for his DoorDash shares would be $4.17 billion—173 percent of their value. The tax would bankrupt him absent an FTB determination to set aside this valuation. (Xu’s valuation is so clearly incorrect that he would almost certainly prevail on this point. Others may have less success.)

Conversely, Jensen Huang of NVIDIA is the rare founder without preferred voting shares. His 3.8 percent stake in NVIDIA gives him 3.8 percent of the vote, yielding wealth tax liability of $8.5 billion on an ownership interest worth $170 billion.

Most founders are somewhere in between, but their voting share is typically much larger than their ownership share. They would be required to sell off significant stakes in their companies to pay the tax in 2027. Those sell-offs might reduce the price they can get for the shares even though the taxable valuation would be fixed at December 31, 2026, levels, before the share liquidation. The consequences of founders relinquishing control and dumping vast holdings, moreover, would be significant—in some cases, potentially catastrophic—for employers and investors as well.

Founders could challenge the voting rights assumption, arguing that substituting their economic stake plus some control premium is necessary to avoid a substantial overstatement of liability,[5] but since drafters gave priority to voting rights with a clear understanding that they often dramatically outstrip actual ownership stakes, the FTB and the courts might be loath to permit alternative valuations in all but the most extreme cases. Furthermore, as discussed later, proposing an alternative through the submission of a certified appraisal carries its own risks.

The only other possible “out” for such founders would be the use of Optional Deferral Accounts (ODAs), discussed later, but this would also put founders under substantial constraints and would retain the inflated tax liability generated by voting interests.

The following table shows voting and ownership shares for six tech founders, with estimates of their wealth tax liability and their total liability (net of capital gains tax on the distributions made to satisfy wealth tax liability), and how that liability compares to the total value of their holdings.

Table 1. Corporate Founders Lose Controlling Interests and Face Extremely High Rates Under Wealth Tax

Note: Total Tax includes federal and California capital gains tax on liquidating assets to remit wealth tax owed. Market cap and other corporate financial data are as of January 13, 2026. Value and tax share of value are based on the estimated share of ownership in the founder’s company, excluding any other investments. Estimates assume that super-voting shares are not publicly traded assets for the purpose of the proposed wealth tax. In some cases, taxpayers may be able to pursue alternative valuation methods.

Source: Fintool data on founders’ equity and voting stakes; Tax Foundation calculations.

Brin and Page already cut ties with California, reportedly leaving before the January 1, 2026, residency date indicated in the initiative.[6] Since the measure’s retroactive “snapshot” assessment date is sure to draw a legal challenge, many other founders—incentivized not only by personal financial considerations but also by the desire to retain voting control over the companies they founded—may do the same should the initiative gain steam, and particularly if it is approved by the voters in November.

Assessment Rules for Private Businesses Can Substantially Overvalue Them

Private business interests are notoriously difficult to value. The initiative’s valuation rules make a challenging proposition worse by requiring systematic overstatements of business value.

Fair market value for non-public businesses is presumed to be equal to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) book value plus 7.5 times average annual profits, multiplied by the taxpayer’s percentage interest in the company.[7] Many closely held businesses do not use GAAP accounting. Beyond that initial hurdle, this approach uses an accounting concept (book profit) without regard to features that drive market pricing, including risks, cyclicality, capital intensity, regulatory exposure, and, most importantly in the case of closely held firms, illiquidity. All these factors would ordinarily translate into valuation discounts compared to a publicly traded company with similar profits, but the rules of the proposed wealth tax ignore this distinction.

The initiative also establishes a floor that can overvalue struggling businesses. If a business is posting losses, its book profits are treated as $0, not a negative value, meaning that losses do not reduce the value of the business for tax purposes.[8] Other valuation floors can lock in outdated valuations that may not reflect a company’s present-day reality.

For instance, the measure holds that a business’s value cannot be less than the valuation reflected in any funding round or equity sale within the past two years unless the taxpayer can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence—a high standard—that the valuation would significantly overstate the entity’s value.[9] But a company’s value can decline in two years, and valuations in equity rounds often involve preferred terms that are not available to all owners and which would overvalue the company as a whole when used as a valuation floor.

Additionally, the initiative denies ordinary discounts for minority interests and lack of marketability, even though any realistic valuation would take these factors into account. A stake in an illiquid company is not worth as much as a similar fully liquid stake, and the ownership stake cannot be sold at a price that disregards that discount—assuming it can be sold at all.

If a taxpayer has a profit interest in a business entity, moreover, their ownership share is presumed to be at least the maximum interest in the company’s profits they may earn subject to certain conditions being met, even if those conditions have not yet been—and may never be—met.[10] This provision taxes interests the taxpayer does not actually possess.

Other provisions stipulating that fair market value excludes forced-sale pricing and treating insurance coverage as a valuation minimum can also artificially inflate business value,[11] overstating what the taxpayer’s share of the company is worth on the open market. And forced-sale pricing could be exactly what taxpayers get if they liquidate some or all of their holdings to pay the wealth tax.

Draconian Penalties Incentivize Overstatement of Liability

Some prior wealth tax proposals have charged tax authorities with valuing billionaires’ assets, including the value of their closely held (non-traded) businesses. The California initiative relieves the state of that burden and instead charges the taxpayers themselves with determining their net worth and remitting the appropriate tax on it.

For traded assets, like shares in a publicly traded company, these valuations are straightforward. For a privately held business, however, valuation is innately difficult. Particularly for startups, valuation may be speculative and uncertain, even given the valuation rules provided in the initiative. Good faith estimates could vary substantially.

The proposed wealth tax, however, does not tolerate different answers arrived at in good faith. If the FTB settles on a different valuation than the one certified by the taxpayer, then a penalty applies to any resulting underpayment: 20 percent for an understatement of tax liability that exceeds the greater of $1 million or 20 percent of the tax shown on the taxpayer’s return, and 40 percent for an understatement of liability that exceeds the greater of $10 million or 40 percent.[12] These are large amounts, to be sure, but the range of valuations one might reasonably attach to a promising tech startup pre-IPO, for instance, could easily vary by that much.

Certified appraisals could also be used when arguing for an alternative valuation for Class B shares, contending that using voting rights rather than economic stake substantially overstates the value of these holdings. It would be up to the appraiser to determine what premium to attach to their super-voting privileges, and should the FTB disagree with that determination, this could yield substantial penalties.[13]

Notably, penalties for underpayment do not end with the taxpayer. If a substantial underpayment is attributable to a certified appraisal, then the FTB is permitted to impose penalties on the appraiser at 2 or 4 percent of the understatement of tax. For an appraiser, such a penalty could be ruinous, and the result—besides any costly insurance—would be to incentivize appraisers to be more solicitous to the state, padding appraisals (particularly on hard-to-appraise businesses) to avoid serious financial penalty.

Imagine, for instance, a private business the FTB concludes is worth $6 billion. If the appraiser thought it was worth $5 billion, they could personally owe $1 million in penalties, in addition to the $10 million in penalties imposed on the taxpayer.

Poorly Drafted Anti-Avoidance Rules Can Over-Tax Transfers

The initiative’s drafters included anti-avoidance rules that, among other things, disregard transfers intended to reduce wealth tax liability. Under the proposal, for instance, a billionaire cannot transfer wealth or incur a debt to their children to reduce liability, cannot escape wealth taxation by transferring property to a trust, and cannot work around limits on such transfers by selling assets for less than market value. The way these provisions are written, however, will dramatically overstate taxable net worth in at least two ways.

First, the language captures the entire value of any trust to which assets are transferred in 2026, not just the value of that transfer. Under the proposal, “net worth shall for all purposes include the value of property held by any trust (other than a grantor trust or tax-exempt trust) to which the individual transfers property in 2026, and seventy-five percent of the value of such property transferred in 2025.”[14]

Perhaps the intention was to tax the full value of transfers made in 2026 and 75 percent of the value of transfers made in 2025 (the extreme retroactivity of the latter provision will certainly be challenged), but as written, the initiative incorporates 75 percent of the value of transfers made in 2025 but the full value of property held by any trust to which property was transferred in 2026. This would expose the entire trust to taxation as if it were the taxpayer’s wealth.

Curiously, a provision providing for proportional allocations if multiple people contributed to the same trust suggests that the 2026 treatment is not a drafting error, even though its implications are hard to comprehend as intentional policy and are inconsistent with the “ordinary” treatment of transfers made in 2025.[15]

Second, net worth includes “the value of any property the individual transferred . . . for less than fair market value after October 15, 2025,” provided that property’s value exceeds $1 million. This is intended to address a scenario under which a covered taxpayer “sells” an asset to a friend or family member for a trivial or deeply discounted amount, but in a way that is not a consideration-free transfer that would be disregarded under other anti-avoidance rules. As written, however, the amount added back to net worth is the entire value of the transfer, not the difference between the sale price and fair market value. If the FTB reviews a billionaire’s sale of an asset and concludes that it was underpriced, intentionally or otherwise, this provision could require that tax be paid as if the asset was never sold and was still in the possession of the taxpayer.

Elsewhere in the proposal, drafters are at pains to establish that the fair market value of an asset “shall not be . . . [t]he price that a forced sale of the property would produce,”[16] but in practice, the need to obtain liquidity to pay the tax could force taxpayers to sell assets at prices well below their ordinary market value. If a taxpayer began selling assets in 2026 in anticipation of 2027 tax liability, and did so at a discount, they could theoretically be taxed on both the forgone asset and the income it brought in. The FTB may choose not to take such an aggressive posture, but the language creates meaningful risk.

Marriage and Divorce Can Both Lead to Over-Taxation

The wealth tax’s aggressive residency rules can establish a billionaire as a California resident for wealth tax purposes even if they are not domiciled in California and are a resident in another state for income tax purposes. Consequently, it is possible for one spouse to have wealth tax residency and the other not to, even if they do not live apart by ordinary definitions. A nonresident spouse’s wealth is included in the covered taxpayer’s net worth for wealth tax purposes.

Additionally, whether one or both spouses are California residents, the tax is imposed at a household level, so a couple with a combined net worth of $1 billion or more is subject to the tax, whereas two unmarried individuals with just under $1 billion apiece would not be taxed.

These peculiarities might lead a sufficiently tax-motivated couple to revisit their marriage vows: until they are parted by death or taxes. A timely divorce could yield substantial tax savings, especially if a nonresident billionaire spouse’s wealth is swept into the tax. Whether California would acknowledge the divorce or treat it as an avoidance strategy and disregard it is unclear.

An even thornier issue arises if a billionaire couple divorces in 2026 without tax savings in mind. Debts to related persons are added back to net worth if incurred after October 15, 2025,[17] and a related person is defined as “any person that is related to the taxpayer . . . as of January 1, 2026.”[18] If a divorce resulted in a division of assets, any indebtedness to the taxpayer’s ex-spouse would be treated as if no such debt was incurred, with those assets still subject to tax.

Taxpayers could avoid this trap by finalizing divorce terms and paying out by year’s end,[19] but in some cases, they may be constrained by liquidity issues, exacerbated by the tax bill coming due.

Deferral Regimes Raise Costs and Introduce Risk

Taxpayers subject to the proposed wealth tax have the option of remitting the entire amount with their tax payment for 2026 (by April 2027) or paying it in five annual installments, subject to a 7.5 percent annual deferral charge on the remaining unpaid balance. With deferral charges, the effective rate becomes 5.75 percent of asset value as of December 31, 2026.

Investments can, of course, lose value. Businesses can fail. If an illiquid taxpayer whose wealth is tied up in their business elects to pay over five years and their net worth declines sharply during that period, then they are still liable based on their net worth as measured at the end of 2026. They could owe substantial tax on wealth that no longer exists.

Certain liquidity-constrained taxpayers would be eligible for Optional Deferral Accounts (ODA), under which tax would be owed every time income from non-traded assets was realized or any withdrawal or transfer was made, until the tax indebtedness was paid in full. Functionally, the state becomes a co-investor in the assets. If these assets appreciate in value over time, California can tax the additional accumulated wealth even if the taxpayer has long since left the state. But unlike with the five-year deferral option, if the assets decline in value, California is also a partner in that reduction in value.

These accounts are only available to those with wealth tax liability in excess of the combined value of their publicly traded assets.[20] Because capital gains tax would have to be paid on publicly traded assets sold to satisfy wealth tax liability, it would be possible for a taxpayer to have publicly traded assets worth more than their wealth tax liability but still be insufficiently liquid to cover actual liability—and be ineligible for an ODA.

Some of the language surrounding ODAs is ambiguous. However, eligibility for an ODA is a threshold question of whether publicly traded assets exceed liability, but once a taxpayer is eligible to maintain an ODA, they can only attach assets to the account “to the extent that the amount of additional tax that would be owed . . . (without the use of an ODA) would exceed the sum of the combined value of all the taxpayers’ [publicly traded] assets.”[21] This suggests that any taxpayer using an ODA must first liquidate all traded assets and use them to satisfy whatever portion of wealth tax liability they can, attaching assets to the ODA for the residual amount owed.

Founders with Class B super-voting shares may be able to place those shares in an ODA to avoid the need to divest control of the company, but only after selling off all other tradable assets other than personally owned real property. Their remaining liability would still be based on the expansive asset valuation based on voting rights rather than actual ownership, and they would owe 5 percent on any material distributions until tax liability was fully satisfied. Entering into an ODA also subjects taxpayers to California personal jurisdiction indefinitely and binds them to whatever contractual terms and regulatory requirements the state devises for assets attached to the deferral account, which may prove restrictive.

Conclusion

The California Billionaire Wealth Tax ballot initiative, through a mix of intentionally aggressive policy design and potentially inadvertent drafting choices, would impose liability far in excess of 5 percent of net worth for many taxpayers.

Any wealth tax imposes significant economic costs, and the impact of a state-level tax of 5 percent is likely to be particularly severe. But 5 percent is a profound understatement. The initiative systematically overvalues assets, exacerbating the proposed tax’s economic harm and enhancing the case for outmigration to avoid such an aggressive, economically destructive tax.

The initiative’s drafters sought to forestall an exodus by selecting a January 1, 2026, date for determining residency, but that provision is highly susceptible to legal challenge. Given the many ways that tax liability can far outstrip the advertised 5 percent rate, many billionaires may wish to test the validity of that residency standard if the tax appears poised for passage, depriving the state of jobs, investment, and existing tax revenue from some of the key players in California’s economy.

However, some flat roofs may be better suited to smaller solar canopies that act as elevated shade structures on shared rooftops.

Rooftop canopies come with a whole different set of structural requirements to attach to buildings than ground-mounted carports and canopies. Instead of poured concrete columns for the foundations, solar canopies are typically attached to the parapet walls or structural beams on a roof.

Brooklyn SolarWorks, a PV contractor based in Brooklyn, New York, saw potential for solar canopies in a city where rooftop gathering spaces far outnumber grass lawns. New York City fire codes require a clear 6-ft path both front-to-back and side-to-side on residential buildings for firefighter access; and roof obstructions like hatches and vent pipes minimized sizing potential for roof-mounted solar projects.

“We knew if [a canopy] was 9-ft high it should meet the fire code requirements,” said Gaelen McKee, president and co-founder of Brooklyn SolarWorks. “We engaged with a design studio and an engineer, and we finally got this concept, and we brought it to a fabricator and made a prototype.”

The company iterated on that first solar canopy, making it lighter and faster to install, but still able to withstand the elements on New York City rooftops. Brooklyn SolarWorks was manufacturing aluminum canopy structures for its own projects, but other contractors around the country also wanted to build these arrays. So, Brooklyn SolarWorks started distributing them under the name Brooklyn Solar Canopy Co.

“It finally flipped so that we’re actually selling more canopies third-party than we are using ourselves,” McKee said.

Brooklyn Solar Canopy produces four different types of canopies and carports. Its A-Frame and Post-Truss structures can be installed on the ground or roof.

The A-Frame uses pairs of triangular supports attached at the top to trusses, and guiding rails hold the solar panels. Post-Truss uses upright columns for foundations, and supporting trusses run along the exterior and between column rows, with module-guiding rails atop.

Canopy components can be hoisted or, if there is enough space in the stairwell, carried by hand to the roof.

Installing a solar canopy requires reviewing building blueprints to determine what size rafters are under the roof surface, how far they’re spaced apart and their material. Base tracks on columns are positioned parallel to the top of a masonry/parapet wall or other roof surface so lag bolts can be driven perpendicularly into the rafters, which are often wooden. Attachment points should be spread across different rafters for proper load distribution.

“So, all the point loading is not on the masonry wall, but right inside of it, on the wood,” McKee said. “We will sometimes mount those structures to the actual parapet walls themselves, but because it’s New York, because its building stock is 150 to 200 years old, a lot of that brick is fairly degraded. You’re in a better position to fasten to the wood, just because the brick can be pretty crumbly and uneven.”

In new construction projects where fresh concrete is poured, the canopy can be bolted directly into the concrete wall. Solar States, a residential and commercial PV contractor based in Philadelphia, has made solar canopy projects a regular part of its output, and many of those elevated arrays have been installed on new or recently built homes.

Many Philadelphians add shade structures to town- or rowhouses with roof access — locally known as “roof decks.” Solar States wanted solar canopies as an option for Philly roof decks, but the city initially considered them an “unknown use.” They weren’t traditional rooftop solar or a canopy. They were considered an auxiliary structure and required individual zoning variance with each project.

“If you look around Philadelphia, there’s tons of people that go to Home Depot and buy a backyard patio or pergola and just throw it up on the roof. That’s not permitted,” said Jared Pashko, director of sales and marketing at Solar States. “We need to do everything permitted, and in order to get it permitted, it needs to be structurally stamped.”

The company successfully advocated for a piece of legislation that codified solar canopies for rooftop construction within the city. Every city will have individual quirks for this type of solar project.

When building solar canopies in Philadelphia, Solar States isn’t covering the entire roof. These 5- to 8-kW arrays often occupy about one-third of the space, due to obstructions like stairwell enclosures on roofs.

There’s more material involved in building a solar canopy than a traditional rooftop solar project, but Pashko said the costs are comparable to having a non-PV shade structure built on a roof — except these ones are creating more living space in a home while increasing its property value and saving on energy costs.

“I think that being able to offer that to homeowners is great. Separately, for solar contractors, it opened up a new market segment for us,” he said. “We’re able to install high-profit-margin projects that customers are asking for where there’s not a lot of competition, and that’s a really great thing. It gives us more resources at our disposal to deploy solar and transition to a sustainable economy.”",https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/solar-states-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 22:58:10.375203

In March, residential customers will experience another approximately $11 decrease – meaning their bills will be $44 lower when compared to January

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla., Jan. 14, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Duke Energy Florida announced that the storm cost recovery charge – the result of costs associated with the company's approximately $1.1 billion response to hurricanes Debby, Helene and Milton – will be removed from customers' bills a month earlier than originally scheduled.

What this means

Because the full amount for all three storms was recovered ahead of schedule, beginning in February (instead of March):

Residential customers can expect an approximately $33 reduction on their monthly bills, when compared to January, for every 1,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity they use.

Commercial and industrial customers' monthly bills will be lowered between 9.6% and 15.8%, also when compared to January, though the specific impact will vary depending on several factors.

Our view

""We understand all of our customers have been affected by the rising costs of living, many may be facing financial challenges, and some are even having to decide which bills they can afford to pay every month,"" said Melissa Seixas, Duke Energy Florida state president. ""It was important to us that our customers get this significant rate relief as soon as possible while we continue to deliver the safe, reliable power they expect and deserve.""

More savings coming soon

In March, residential customers will experience another approximately $11 decrease (per 1,000 kWh) on their monthly bills, reflecting a seasonal decrease that Duke Energy Florida institutes annually (March-November) to help customers save money during times when energy use is typically higher.

This means, when compared to January, their March bills will be approximately $44 lower – again, per 1,000 kWh.

Even more savings

Recently, the company also:

Made efficiency improvements at many of its natural gas plants (see here), saving customers $340 million in fuel costs

This translates to $10 savings on customers' monthly bills

Completed three new solar energy sites (see here and here), saving customers another $750 million from displaced fuel costs

Passed on $65 million in Inflation Reduction Act tax credits to customers

This saves residential customers at least $2.50 per 1,000 kWh

Help is available

While Duke Energy Florida is focused on keeping its own costs in check, the company is committed to connecting customers with practical ways to save energy and manage their bills, including flexible payment plans. For more information, please visit duke-energy.com/SeasonalSavings.

How Might Federal Legislative Proposals Impact Advanced Recycling Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are pushing initiatives to boost recycling and clarify rules for advanced recycling.
It offers a 30% investment tax credit for recycling infrastructure, including advanced recycling facilities.
Advanced recycling stands out as a transformative, converting materials that traditional recycling rejects into valuable components.
While SB 54 does not directly regulate advanced recycling, its ambitious requirements make advanced recycling an attractive compliance tool.","The recycling industry, traditionally seen as stable, is in an era of innovation and growth. A class of advanced recycling technologies is emerging to address plastics that conventional recycling methods cannot process, converting materials like mixed film and multilayer packaging into reusable chemical ingredients. While some of the core processes have been around for decades, what’s new is how these technologies are being refined, scaled, and integrated into circular-economy strategies. Modern applications are quickly gaining momentum as brands pursue circularity, states enforce waste-reduction measures, and artificial intelligence-driven efficiencies enhance processing. What started as a promising concept is quickly becoming one of the most closely followed growth stories in the materials sector.

To provide context for this growth, it is notable that Precedence Research recently projected that the advanced recycling market would reach US$7.26 billion by 2035, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.16%.1 Meanwhile, Future Markets, Inc. projected market revenues to exceed US$15 billion by 2040, with CAGRs exceeding 25%.2 Evaluating the broader chemical recycling-service market, Knowledgeable Sourcing Intelligence projected a US$196.2 billion valuation by 2035 based on market growth at a CAGR of 25.8%.3

However, despite these optimistic projections, the industry must contend with opposition from traditional recyclers and environmentalists, as well as with a complicated, ever-changing, and frequently uncertain regulatory landscape characterized by changing definitions, fluctuating state and federal regulations, and continuous discussions about classification and oversight. Successfully managing compliance and innovation depends on effectively navigating this framework. Key challenges to be faced in 2026 are outlined below.

The Clean Air Act: How Should Advanced Recycling Operations Be Regulated?

How advanced recycling operations are regulated under the Clean Air Act (CAA) depends on the technology employed. Currently, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates facilities that combust nonhazardous waste in a starved-air primary chamber and afterburner—such as those using pyrolysis, gasification, or other thermochemical conversion technologies—as solid waste incinerators. These facilities must meet the strict Other Solid Waste Incineration (OSWI) standards outlined in Section 129 of the CAA. This includes adhering to Maximum Achievable Control Technology emission limits for nine specific pollutants, conducting performance tests, continuous emissions monitoring, maintaining operating limits, keeping records, submitting reports, and often obtaining Title V permits.

While facilities complying with the OSWI standards face significant compliance costs and operational challenges, in contrast, facilities that utilize non-combustion-based decomposition methods (such as solvolysis or enzymolysis) or physical purification techniques (like dissolution) are subject to less stringent, category-specific emission standards under the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants.

Notably, this regulatory framework could undergo changes in the near future. Under the Trump administration, the EPA has signaled possible revisions to how pyrolysis and similar units are regulated under the CAA.4 Specifically, in 2021, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) to gather feedback on whether to continue classifying pyrolysis units under OSWI rules. Possible outcomes of the ANPRM include maintaining the current standards, streamlining permitting and monitoring requirements, or establishing a new category for advanced recycling with customized standards. A decision not to regulate thermochemical conversion technologies as solid waste incinerators could dramatically reduce compliance costs and accelerate innovation for thermochemical technologies. However, it remains unclear if the EPA will take such action. Environmental groups are opposed, arguing that pyrolysis and gasification units combust waste and emit pollutants similar to traditional incinerators, and that removing pyrolysis units from OSWI classification or creating a separate category with customized standards will weaken air protections.

RCRA: Is Advanced Recycling Waste Disposal or Manufacturing?

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) sets the federal framework for managing both hazardous and non-hazardous waste. RCRA applies when the material being processed qualifies as “solid waste” under 40 C.F.R. § 261.2 and, if so, whether it is classified as hazardous. A material is considered solid waste if it is discarded—whether abandoned, recycled in certain ways, or inherently waste-like. It becomes hazardous waste if it exhibits hazardous characteristics or appears on the EPA’s hazardous waste lists.

Because advanced recycling typically uses waste plastics as feedstock to produce new materials, these operations often fall within RCRA’s scope. However, states that administer their own waste programs have significant discretion to define what constitutes “waste” and determine whether specific processes are regulated as waste management activities.

If a state concludes that advanced recycling turns discarded plastics into feedstock for new products without creating major disposal concerns, it may classify these operations as manufacturing rather than waste management. This classification can significantly reduce the applicability of RCRA requirements.

Opponents argue that this approach weakens environmental protections by removing stringent waste management standards and creates inconsistencies compared to other recycling operations. According to the opponents, while converting old plastics into new plastic products can reasonably be considered recycling, advanced recycling operations that convert plastic waste into fuels or energy rather than new plastic products is not recycling. They contend that labeling these processes as “recycling” is inconsistent with standards applied to other materials and warn that applying a different standard to plastics risks undermining recycling integrity and environmental protections. Industry advocates counter that converting plastics into fuels or energy should still count as recycling because it recovers value from hard-to-recycle plastics that would otherwise be landfilled or incinerated without energy recovery. Despite these concerns, since 2017, 25 states have taken this approach to encourage innovation and cut landfill use. They now treat advanced recycling as manufacturing instead of waste disposal. This shift offers big advantages. Facilities labeled as manufacturers often face fewer hazardous waste rules under RCRA. For example, if a recycler converts plastic waste into valuable feedstock—such as a solvolysis plant breaking down PET bottles into monomers—the plastic may not meet the definition of “solid waste” under RCRA Subtitle C. That could exempt the material from RCRA waste management requirements.

A manufacturing designation can also help operators argue that their entire process counts as a single Manufacturing Process Unit. This allows them to manage certain hazardous wastes without triggering strict permitting and tracking rules. It may also help recyclers avoid being classified as a Treatment, Storage, or Disposal Facility, or TSDF, which carries heavy compliance burdens.

Not all states agree. Some explicitly regulate advanced recycling as solid waste management. One state has even banned certain advanced recycling facilities. For this reason, location plays a critical role in determining whether an operation will succeed.

Toxic Substances Control Act: Are Chemical Products Derived From Advanced Plastics Recycling “New Chemicals Substances”?

Like the Clean Air Act and RCRA, advanced recyclers face uncertainty under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The big question is whether chemicals made from recycled plastics are classified as “new chemical substances.” If they do, they must undergo rigorous pre-market review. If not, they’re treated like existing regulated products.

Under TSCA, any chemical not listed on the EPA Inventory is considered new. Before it can be sold, the company must file a Pre-Manufacture Notice (PMN). EPA then reviews the chemical for safety. If data is lacking or risks appear serious, EPA issues a Section 5(e) order. That order can restrict or stop production until more information is provided. Later, EPA often formalizes these limits through Significant New Use Rules (SNURs), which require companies to notify EPA before using the chemical in new ways.

In August 2022, the EPA issued a Section 5(e) Consent Order to a major fuel producer for five PMN substances made from plastic waste. A community group challenged the order in court, citing cancer risks from contaminants. By mid-2023, EPA proposed SNURs for 18 similar substances. These SNURs targeted feedstocks with PFAS, heavy metals, dioxins, BPA, and other toxins. The rules would have required prior notice before using these plastics in advanced recycling or downstream manufacturing, or in fuel applications. However, due to ongoing litigation, the EPA withdrew both the Section 5(e) Consent Order and the proposed SNURs. That move left the industry in limbo. Future SNURs could reshape compliance obligations for recyclers, refiners, and manufacturers.

The Trump administration has indicated it plans to require impurity testing for new chemicals from waste plastics on a case-by-case basis. So far, that has not happened. Many PMNs remain pending. Companies do not know what rules will apply. Manufacturers, importers, and businesses in biotech, advanced materials, and consumer products need to stay alert. EPA’s next steps could change the game.

The Clean Water Act

The Clean Water Act (CWA) governs pollutant discharges into US waters, and advanced recycling facilities, particularly those using chemical processes, are subject to its requirements. Operations that discharge process water or wastewater must obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit, which sets limits on pollutants and requires monitoring and reporting. Facilities also need to manage stormwater runoff from feedstock storage and chemical handling to prevent contamination during rain events or spills.

Environmental groups are calling for stronger water protections, arguing that current CWA standards do not adequately address chemical contaminants associated with advanced recycling processes, including PFAS, heavy metals, and dioxins. They urge the EPA to update effluent guidelines and to require comprehensive monitoring and reporting for wastewater and stormwater discharges. Advocates also emphasize the need for advanced treatment technologies to ensure hazardous substances are removed before water is released into the environment. In their view, exemptions or relaxed standards would undermine public health and environmental integrity, making robust oversight essential. Additional concerns include stormwater runoff from feedstock storage, accidental spills, and thermal pollution from process water—issues critics believe demand stringent monitoring, treatment standards, and transparent reporting to prevent contamination of surface and groundwater.

How Might Federal Legislative Proposals Impact Advanced Recycling

Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are pushing initiatives to boost recycling and clarify rules for advanced recycling. One proposal, the Accelerating a Circular Economy for Plastics and Recycling Innovation Act, would set national standards for plastics recycling. It calls for plastic packaging to include at least 30% recycled content by 2030 and defines advanced recycling as a manufacturing process, not waste disposal. If passed, this would standardize definitions and reduce regulatory uncertainty.

Another bill, the Cultivating Investment in Recycling and Circular Local Economies (CIRCLE) Act, takes a financial approach. It offers a 30% investment tax credit for recycling infrastructure, including advanced recycling facilities. This could lower capital costs and speed up adoption of advanced recycling technologies, making them more competitive.

Together, these legislative changes—harmonized federal standards and new financial incentives—could open doors for growth and reshape compliance strategies, investment plans, and market positioning.

Extended Producer Responsibility: How Extended Producer Responsibility Laws Are Affecting Advanced Recycling

States are taking bold steps on waste management, with Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) laws leading the way. By late 2025, California, Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington had rolled out EPR programs for packaging. These laws make producers responsible for post-consumer packaging and link costs to recyclability and environmental impact, thereby pushing investment into technology that tackles hard-to-recycle plastics. Advanced recycling is emerging as a game-changing solution. It turns materials traditional recycling rejects into valuable components, helping producers hit sustainability targets, and cut fees under certain regulations.

Advanced recycling stands out as a transformative, converting materials that traditional recycling rejects into valuable components. This not only helps producers achieve sustainability goals but also reduces fees under certain environmental regulations.

California’s SB 54, the Plastic Pollution Prevention and Packaging Producer Responsibility Act, exemplifies this trend. By 2032, all regulated packaging must be recyclable or compostable, plastic use must decline by 25%, and recycling rates must reach 65%. While SB 54 does not directly regulate advanced recycling, its ambitious requirements make advanced recycling an attractive compliance tool. Proposed regulations would allow producers to leverage advanced recycling to meet reduction and recyclability goals without completely redesigning packaging. Still, companies must navigate federal rules under RCRA and TSCA, since chemical recycling feedstocks can trigger hazardous waste or new substance reviews.

To succeed, businesses need a proactive strategy—partnering on advanced recycling, tracking lifecycle impacts, and staying on top of regulations.

Conclusion

Advanced recycling has huge growth potential. But in 2026, success depends on agility.

That move came after the city’s first large scale response tied to an electric vehicle. The Chattanooga Fire Department says a fire broke out at an apartment complex in the early morning hours of Nov. 22, 2024. Fire officials ruled the fire an accident and traced it to an electric vehicle charging in the parking garage.

After that fire, the condominium complex moved to stop electric vehicle charging.

Some residents later sued, arguing the complex overreached.

We are now hearing from a former HOA president who says the conversation around electric vehicles started years earlier.

“At some point during the four years I was president of the HOA, we had a handful, very small handful, and there's still a small handful of EV owners, they requested the ability to plug into some existing electrical outlets in the garage,” said Buck Tasker, a One North Shore resident and former HOA president.

Tasker says those electric vehicle owners were allowed to charge in the garage at the time.

A lawsuit filed against the current HOA board says that changed in July 2025.

Tasker says discussions about electric vehicles and how to handle them happened while he served as HOA president, but intensified after the 2024 fire at a nearby garage on Frazier Avenue.

The fire at 417 Frazier Avenue in 2024 burned for more than an hour and destroyed or damaged dozens of vehicles.

Tasker says the board noticed power issues in the aftermath of that fire.

“Some of those EV chargers were tripping those breakers and causing the fire alarm to go off because they were drawing too much power,” Tasker said. “The building has no infrastructure for EV charging when it was built in 2008.”

Attorney Herbert Thornbury lives at 417 Frazier Avenue, where the 2024 fire happened. He is not involved in the current lawsuit, but says the fire left a lasting impact.

“This fire just raged for how long, hour and 20 minutes. They couldn’t put it out,” Thornbury said.

He says four of his vehicles were lost, and nearly 20 cars in total were destroyed or heavily damaged.

“19 cars down here, they were all totaled, smoke damage,” Thornbury said.

Thornbury says it is difficult to predict how the lawsuit will play out.

“The litigation is incredibly complicated, you can imagine, you know, to get an expert to figure out where the fire started,” he said. He added, “I don't think that the lawsuit's going anywhere.”

There is good news from Carbon Brief this week. It reports that the use of coal to generate electricity fell in both China and India in 2025 — the first time that has happened simultaneously in both countries in more than fifty years. It says electricity generation from coal in India fell by 3% year-on-year (57 TWh) and in China by 1.6% (58TWh).

The decrease in coal-powered thermal generation coincides with an increase in renewable energy last year. That increase was more than enough to meet rising demand for electricity in both countries. “Both countries now have the preconditions in place for peaking coal fired power, if China is able to sustain clean energy growth and India meets its renewable energy targets,” Carbon Brief says.

“These shifts have international implications, as the power sectors of these two countries drove 93 percent of the rise in global carbon dioxide emissions from 2015 to 2024. Challenges remain, but the decline in coal power output in both countries “marks an historic moment, which could help lead to a peak in global emissions,” according to Carbon Brief.

Maybe. The energy mix in any country is the result of a number of factors. Hydropower goes up when reservoirs are full but declines when water levels decline. Weather is a major factor, as colder temperatures increase the need to heat buildings, while hotter temperatures drive up the demand for cooling.

In China, demand for electricity increased by 5% in 2025, but it was more than offset by the increase in renewables, particularly solar. But there are recent policy changes in China that could impact its ability to supply the super cheap solar panels that have transformed how electricity is used in much of Africa and in Pakistan.

Policy Changes

According to The Energy Mix, last year China removed a policy that gave solar panel manufacturers a guaranteed rate of return. Export incentives have also been reduced or eliminated. Those regulatory changes have caused many observers, including the International Energy Agency, to predict there will be less solar power to be installed in 2026, even if the decrease is modest. But once the industry adapts to the new regulatory environment, the IEA expects solar installations to tick upwards again in 2027.

While an increase in the availability of renewable energy in China and India has suppressed the demand for coal power, locking in future declines in coal generation will depend on meeting a series of challenges. First, power grids will need to be operated more flexibly to accommodate the increasing amount of renewable energy available. That means updating old power market structures that were built to serve coal-fired generating stations in China and India.

Both countries have continued to add new coal-fired power capacity. If the number of coal-powered generating stations under construction and permitted are completed, they would increase coal power capacity by 28% in China and 23% in India.

The necessary result of bringing more coal power online will be a decrease in the utilization rates of those facilities, which will drive up the cost of operating them and lead to higher costs for grid supplied electricity. In the longer term, new coal capacity would have to be slowed substantially while retirements are accelerated in order to make space for further expansion of clean energy in the power systems of the two countries.

Carbon Brief says power generation in China and India were responsible for more than 90% of the increase in global CO2 emissions from all sources between 2015 and 2024, with 78% attributable to China and 16% to India. Therefore, reducing emissions from their electricity generating sectors is the key to lowering global emissions.

US Emissions Rise

In marked contrasts to the good news from China and India, the latest report from the Rhodium Group claims that greenhouse gas emissions in the US rose 2.4% last year. “The increase in emissions was driven primarily by the buildings and power sectors. Colder winter temperatures drove higher space heating demand in buildings, pushing up direct emissions from fuel use in buildings by 6.8 percent. Higher natural gas prices and growing power demand boosted coal electricity generation, resulting in a 3.8 percent rise in power sector emissions,” the report said.

“The increase in 2025 emissions was driven by increases of 6.8 percent in the buildings sector and 3.8 percent in the power sector. Transportation remained the highest-emitting sector, though emissions rose only slightly by 0.1 percent from 2024 levels. Emissions rose more modestly in the industrial and oil & gas sectors.”

Data centers, cryptocurrency mining operations, and other large load customers drove electricity demand up by 2.4%, with most of the increase occurring in Texas, the Mid-Atlantic, and the Ohio Valley regions. Electricity to charge battery-powered vehicles was also a factor in the increased demand.

The main driver of higher coal use, the Rhodium Group says, was higher natural gas prices, which were up 58% at Henry Hub in 2025 compared to the very low prices recorded in 2024. An increase in the export of liquefied natural gas drove up methane prices substantially, as the current administration’s all out attempt to make the US great again leaves more and more people in America worse off financially.

Simple Economics

A first year business school student would know that when supplies go down, prices go up, but apparently the Moron of Mar-A-Loco was absent that week — or that year, as the case may be. Because of the wrong-headed policies of the US administration, fewer coal-fired generating stations were retired last year than in 2024. Through November, only 2.5 GW of conventional steam coal capacity was retired, compared with 4.5 GW in 2024 and an average of nearly 9 GW a year since 2020.

The fastest growing power generation source in 2025 was solar, which surged by 34%, the report said. That is the highest growth rate since 2017 and pushed the grid share of zero-emitting sources up by one percentage point to 42%, despite only a modest increase in wind and flat nuclear and hydroelectric generation. Natural gas remained the single largest source of electricity, though it fell by nearly three percentage points to 40% of the grid mix.

The US Emissions Picture Has Changed

In this year’s report, the Rhodium Group has lowered its projections for future decreases in US emissions since 2005 from 38 to 56% by 2035 to 26 to 35%. “This slowdown is largely due to changes to energy tax credits made by the 119th Congress in the 2025 budget reconciliation bill and the repeal of climate regulations by the Trump administration,” it said in its latest report.

“Apart from some modest contributions to increased coal generation from Department of Energy orders to keep a few plants running, we aren’t yet seeing the direct effects of these policy changes in US emissions. That could change in the coming year or two, particularly if data center electricity demand continues to surge and the grid responds with more output from existing fossil generators instead of new, clean resources. The growth in electric vehicles, which has in part helped keep a lid on transportation sector emissions, may also stall in the absence of federal tax credits and regulatory policies.”

Bury The Data

“Beyond policy changes that will result in higher emissions, the Trump administration has also moved to stop collecting and reporting a multitude of data on GHG emissions and climate change. Two of these data products in particular — the EPA’s annual GHG inventory and its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program for major emitting facilities — are integral inputs to our work,” the Rhodium report says.

“Typically, we would expect EPA to give the US its final GHG report card for 2025 in spring 2027. However, EPA only released the 2023 inventory earlier this year when compelled by a Freedom of Information Act request, and most of the work had already been completed under the Biden administration. Given the Trump administration’s hostility to collecting and reporting data related to climate change, we may not receive any further inventories under this administration.” [Emphasis added.]

“The loss of this data means we are heading into murkier waters when it comes to understanding the second-largest emitter of GHGs in the world. While US emissions rose, 2025 was the second or third hottest year on record across the globe. Because emissions and their impacts persist even when the government does not count them, we will continue to adapt to this new landscape in order to inform critical US energy and climate policy debates.”

Translation: This assemblage of sycophants who have all pledged allegiance to a known liar, fraudster, pussy grabber, admirer of underage girls, and convicted sexual abuser are working full time to reward campaign donors while telling Americans to breathe dirtier air, drink dirtier water, drive dirtier cars, pay more for health insurance, and struggle to make ends meet. Yet over 70 million mostly white Americans who style themselves as devoted Christians voted to put this fat buffoon in office.

Making America Irrelevant

Whether America will ever be great again will depend on people coming to the senses. Based on the observable evidence, that is not likely to happen anytime soon. People in positions of power delight in pushing others down because they view equality as a form of punishment.

Until we fix that misconception, America will never be more than an afterthought, an historical anomaly like Carthage or Rome — entities that enjoyed a period in the sun and then became irrelevant. The blather and bluster emanating from the White Man’s House today is reminiscent of this soliloquy from the Shakespeare play Macbeth.

Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,

Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,

To the last syllable of recorded time;

And all our yesterdays have lighted fools

The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!

Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player,

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has changed how it evaluates air pollution regulations, opting to stop assigning a monetary value to human health benefits when setting certain clean air rules, according to a New York Times report.

The updated approach applies to regulations governing fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone. Both pollutants are widely regulated due to their documented impacts on human health. The change appeared in a preliminary version of a new power plant emissions rule posted on the EPA’s website late last week.

Under the revised framework, the agency will continue to evaluate industry compliance costs but will no longer calculate the dollar value of avoided deaths or illnesses associated with reductions in PM2.5 and ozone. The EPA said previous efforts to monetize these health benefits relied on estimates that were too uncertain.

The agency stated it will continue to consider the health impacts of these pollutants but will not assign a specific monetary value. EPA officials said emissions will continue to be quantified while the agency works to improve its modeling before monetizing those impacts again.

This marks a significant shift from longstanding EPA practice, which typically compared regulatory compliance costs with estimated economic benefits associated with improved health outcomes. The agency detailed its rationale within the power plant rule, noting that declining emissions and evolving science have made impact estimates less precise.

The move has drawn attention because cost-benefit analyses play a central role in shaping federal environmental regulations. Industry groups have previously criticized the EPA’s methods for calculating health benefits, arguing they overstated gains and underestimated uncertainty.

The policy shift is part of a broader set of environmental actions taken under the Trump administration. In recent weeks, the administration has withdrawn the United States from several international climate-focused organizations and signaled plans to revise federal authority over greenhouse gas regulations.

The EPA’s new approach may face legal scrutiny. Courts have historically required agencies to weigh both costs and benefits when issuing regulations. Any challenges would likely focus on whether the revised framework meets established administrative standards.",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01142026-EPA-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 20:59:27.616461

Opportunities of On-Site Power Traditional industrial development models have assumed that utilities could reliably deliver new or upgraded service within a project’s construction window.
On-site generation can accelerate project readiness and reduce operational risk, but it remains a capital asset subject to regulatory, legal, and operational considerations.
Manufacturing and industrial operations once accepted occasional outages as part of doing business, but today they cannot.
For owners and developers, on-site generation offers a direct way to secure the power needed to keep projects on schedule.","Advanced manufacturers, large campus developers, and economic development agencies increasingly face delays between an approved site plan and a production-ready facility because they lack timely and dependable access to adequate electric power. After nearly two decades of flat electricity demand, the United States has entered a new era of accelerated load growth driven by reshored manufacturing, process electrification, and growing power needs driven by data centers and artificial intelligence applications that now compete directly with industrial users for capacity. Utilities are working to expand transmission and distribution systems, but long interconnection queues, equipment backlogs, and multiyear planning cycles are extending timelines well beyond what project finance structures or market windows can support.

For manufacturers and industrial operators, this is now an investment decision. Waiting for grid access stalls investments, delays revenue generation, and prolongs operational uncertainty. On-site power generation removes that constraint by providing immediate, controllable electricity that keeps projects moving, protects critical processes, and decouples growth from external bottlenecks.

Increasingly, the difference between stalled and scaled growth comes down to a power infrastructure decision.

Realities of Grid Strain

Utility forecasts and market projections show a sharp rise in national peak demand as grid operators replace aging generation and accommodate unprecedented load growth driven by data center campuses. This tightening supply-demand balance means many manufacturers now face extended, uncertain interconnection timelines — often stretching five to 10 years — along with unpredictable long-term energy costs and heightened exposure to reliability risks tied to grid congestion and aging infrastructure.

While data centers illustrate the extremes of this demand landscape, manufacturing plants, chemical facilities, and industrial parks face similar exposure. Reshoring initiatives, automation investments, and accelerated project schedules make it increasingly impractical to wait for transmission and distribution expansion before beginning operations.

Opportunities of On-Site Power

Traditional industrial development models have assumed that utilities could reliably deliver new or upgraded service within a project’s construction window. Today, multiyear equipment lead times and crowded interconnection queues challenge that expectation.

On-site generation breaks the interconnection and equipment bottleneck. Modular combined heat and power (CHP) systems, fuel cells, and solar-plus-storage solutions can be designed, permitted, and commissioned in months rather than years, potentially delivering power on a timeline years faster than waiting for grid upgrades. The result is a direct path from groundbreaking to production while maintaining control and managing development risk.

CHP systems typically deliver energy savings of 30 percent to 40 percent when thermal loads are integrated. Industrial solar installations frequently reach payback in under five years, strengthening the business case for hybrid or fully on-site solutions.

Protecting Operations Against Disruption

Modern manufacturing tolerates little downtime. A single loss of power can cost millions in lost output, damage sensitive equipment, or trigger contract penalties and regulatory issues. On-site generation capable of islanded operation — meaning it can operate independently from the grid — provides resilience by sustaining operations during outages. When paired with battery storage, these systems also mitigate short-duration voltage sags, frequency instability, and other power-quality disturbances that could otherwise disrupt production processes.

Additionally, many manufacturers that invest in on-site generation can participate in grid support programs. Providing demand response, frequency regulation, or backup capacity can qualify facilities for revenue opportunities or utility incentives. Flexible on-site assets give facility owners more control over energy spend while contributing to broader grid reliability.

What On-Site Power Entails

Developing an effective on-site generation strategy begins with a master plan, a long-range framework that aligns generation investments with expansion, resilience, modernization, and sustainability objectives. This planning effort requires detailed electrical load studies for current operations and future scenarios, including seasonal peaks and expansion phases. It also requires comprehensive site analysis to determine optimal locations for generation assets based on major loads, land availability, and fuel access. The plan must include defined contingency and resilience strategies outlining how the facility will operate during grid events, as well as environmental and permitting assessments covering air quality, noise, and stakeholder engagement requirements.

A well-structured master plan allows owners to evaluate capital costs, operations and maintenance requirements, federal tax credits, utility incentives, and potential financing models such as power purchase agreements or energy-as-a-service structures that reduce upfront investment and shift technical risk to specialized partners.

On-site generation can accelerate project readiness and reduce operational risk, but it remains a capital asset subject to regulatory, legal, and operational considerations. Solutions must meet interconnection rules, air permitting requirements, and utility standby power policies. Early engagement with regulators and utilities helps eliminate development bottlenecks and clarifies technical expectations. Aggregated distributed generation or microgrid configurations can further increase flexibility and strengthen negotiating leverage for large industrial parks.

Master Planning and Forecasting for On-Site Power

New on-site generation may require upgrades to existing electrical distribution systems, process steam networks, or cooling infrastructure. Facilities built decades ago often have electrical equipment sized for lower loads than modern production demands, prompting upgrades to transformers, switchgear, or circuit protection. Thermal networks may need reconfiguration to fully capture and distribute waste heat from CHP systems.

Such infrastructure upgrades can be the largest cost driver after generation equipment itself. Evaluating them early during master planning allows owners to sequence investments, negotiate realistic lead times with suppliers, and synchronize upgrades with broader modernization initiatives.

Road maps should outline phased investment and define key decision milestones such as site selection, procurement, permitting, and commissioning. Road maps should also establish go-live targets and key performance metrics. Regular updates help align the plan with evolving market conditions, operational needs, and project constraints. On large campuses, phased deployment aligns generation additions with facility expansion, spreads capital requirements, and allows early-phase assets to generate returns while later phases advance.

The Path Forward

Power availability can no longer be assumed and grid reliability is no longer guaranteed. Manufacturing and industrial operations once accepted occasional outages as part of doing business, but today they cannot. The shift toward mission-critical production environments requires a new approach to energy resilience.

Advanced manufacturing depends on precision, speed, and control. Yet interconnection backlogs, equipment bottlenecks, and accelerating load growth increasingly threaten those requirements. On-site generation provides a practical alternative — the ability to secure reliable, high-quality power on a schedule defined by the project rather than the grid.

For owners and developers, on-site generation offers a direct way to secure the power needed to keep projects on schedule. The choice directly influences a facility’s schedule, operational reliability, and long-term growth.",https://cdn9.areadevelopment.com/article_images/id3093_on-site-energy1000.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 11:03:19.302583

His first such job was in a Times Square hotel with Jewish owners, a Pakistani manager, and a Nigerian bellman.
Against the intense glow of neon lights, Hiatt found himself considering morality, sacrifice, and his own values and their impacts.
In 2007, the couple’s big city adventure ended for the best possible reason: the arrival of their baby boy.
He started as a contract operator on the docks and in the finished tank farm where the jet fuel, gas and diesel were stored.","For James Hiatt, the 43 year old founder and director of For a Better Bayou, a nonprofit seeking to foster alternatives to the fossil fuel economy in Southwestern Louisiana, the oil and gas industry isn’t just in his blood; it’s in his nostrils.

“My dad worked at Conoco, now Phillips 66. He’d come home in his Nomex [fire retardant garments] smelling like the refinery after 12-hour shifts,” Hiatt said. “He missed a lot of family stuff. I told myself I was never going to work in the refinery.”

Instead, he got married at 19 and moved in 2002 with his wife to New York City, a young couple with a plan: she’d teach school while earning a master’s degree, and he’d pursue rock star dreams and get a day job to help pay the bills.

His first such job was in a Times Square hotel with Jewish owners, a Pakistani manager, and a Nigerian bellman. His previous worldview — conservative, Christian, conformist — was exploded by the diversity. The owner, a Holocaust survivor, had a number tattooed on his arm by the Nazis; the bellman fasted for the entire month of Ramadan while hauling luggage up three or four flights without a sip of water. Against the intense glow of neon lights, Hiatt found himself considering morality, sacrifice, and his own values and their impacts.

“I started recycling. I stopped buying things made by exploited foreign labor just because they were cheaper. The belief structure I’d been given told me that everybody’s burning in hell unless you save them, unless you convince them to believe the way you believe. And that didn’t work for me anymore,” he said.

In 2007, the couple’s big city adventure ended for the best possible reason: the arrival of their baby boy. Returning home to raise him (and later two daughters) among family (who were mostly working in refineries), Hiatt soon got a job at Citgo, a Venezuelan oil company in Lake Charles. He started as a contract operator on the docks and in the finished tank farm where the jet fuel, gas and diesel were stored. When a better paying opportunity came his way in the refinery’s lab, he went for it.

His wallet fattened, but it came at a price. “Like my dad, I was really grouchy working those 12-hour shifts. My poor wife and kids. You know, you only sleep a couple hours, and you’re up to try to do something, and then you’re in a bad mood,” he said.

Those “bad moods” eventually led Hiatt to a 12-step program. Now ten years sober, his personal transformation feeds his professional commitments: if individuals can be released from the grip of self-obliterating addictions, societies can, too. And he set to work to help make it so, first as a campaigner in a nonprofit focused on halting the liquid natural gas (LNG) expansion in the area, and since 2023, at the helm of For A Better Bayou, which more broadly seeks to protect the health, livelihoods, and cultural heritage of Southwest Louisiana amid expanding industrial pollution and accelerating climate impacts. Funding comes from individual donations and through foundation support.

The focus is on opposing harmful fossil fuel infrastructure, while supporting fisherfolk and frontline communities, nurturing community empowerment, advancing coastal restoration and climate resilience efforts, and building pathways toward a just economic transition rooted in local knowledge and stewardship. Hiatt shoulders that work with one paid staff member.

When not meeting with local residents and workers, their days, and not uncommonly evenings and weekends, are spent documenting environmental harms, reviewing permits and regulatory filings, engaging with local, state, and federal agencies, and building coalitions with partner organizations to advance community-led solutions.

“I tell folks, pick whatever lights you up, whatever pisses you off. Is it the LNG buildouts, the data centers, carbon capture? Pick one, and let’s work on that,” he explained.

Hiatt’s ties with big oil weren’t severed in a golden moment of epiphany and grace. He was pushed out — fired in the midst of workplace drama that his union successfully resolved on his behalf, resulting in a payout he used for tuition to retool. He earned a psychology degree while hustling in the gig economy for Grub Hub and Door Dash.

“I was aiming to be a social worker because I love the ability to help people (myself included) stretch beyond the patterns and behaviors we can’t always see that cause the issues — like the externalized costs that are never, ever attributed to these refineries.”",https://bluedotliving.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/the-shift-superfund-site-gate.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 21:00:18.922198

It would be the largest territory the United States ever added, if the United States were to acquire it.
But that has not deterred Mr. Trump and his team so far.
Daniel Immerwahr, a historian at Northwestern University, said Mr. Trump seemed more interested than any other recent president in expanding American borders.
“I love maps,” Mr. Trump said, according to an interview he gave for the book.","In the 19th century, the young United States grew in leaps and bounds.

First there was the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, in which Thomas Jefferson bought from the French a chunk of what is now America’s Midwest, West and South.

Next was the Mexican Cession, in 1848. As part of a peace deal after the Mexican-American war, Mexico handed over territory including what is now California, Nevada and other states.

And then there was the Alaska Purchase, from the Russians, in 1867, which at the time was derided as an icebox and too expensive.

But if President Trump gets his way and, as he has insisted, takes over Greenland “whether they like it or not,” it would be bigger than any of those, according to the National Archives, the U.S. census and the C.I.A. World Factbook. At 836,000 square miles, Greenland is bigger than France, Britain, Spain, Italy and Germany — combined. It would be the largest territory the United States ever added, if the United States were to acquire it.

Mr. Trump has based his fixation on Greenland, which has been part of the Danish Kingdom for more than 300 years, on reasons of “national security,” citing threats from Russia and China. But he made a past remark about Greenland’s size, and scholars say the territorial grandeur itself is at least part of what appeals to him.

“Trump’s a real estate guy,” David Silbey, a historian at Cornell University, said in an email, “and the idea of grabbing that much land seems to me his particular guiding force: THE MOST LAND EVER.”

He added that Mr. Trump “likes to pick on targets that are too weak to fight back, which certainly describes Denmark,” he added.

This week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio is meeting to discuss the future of Greenland with Danish and Greenlandic officials, both of whom say that the island, the world’s largest, is not for sale.

But that has not deterred Mr. Trump and his team so far.

In an interview last week with The New York Times, Mr. Trump said the best way for the United States to handle Greenland would be to own it because ownership is “psychologically needed for success.”

Mr. Trump has dismissed the importance of a longstanding American-Danish defense pact that already guarantees the U.S. broad military access in Greenland. During World War II and the Cold War, the United States had thousands of troops and more than a dozen bases on the island; now it has just one.

Daniel Immerwahr, a historian at Northwestern University, said Mr. Trump seemed more interested than any other recent president in expanding American borders. He cited Mr. Trump’s insistence on taking back the Panama Canal, his repeated comments that Canada could become America’s 51st state, his talk last year of taking over Gaza and his fixation on Greenland.

“It’s clear that Trump is bent on territorial annexation in a way that presidents in past decades have not been,” Dr. Immerwahr said. “Trump’s annexationist ambition echoes those of presidents in the distant past — Polk, Teddy Roosevelt — but no one in the post-1945 period.”

Greenland’s size was indeed part of Mr. Trump’s thinking, according to “The Divider,” a book about the first Trump administration written by Peter Baker, a White House correspondent for The Times, and Susan Glasser, a staff writer for The New Yorker.

“I love maps,” Mr. Trump said, according to an interview he gave for the book. “And I always said: ‘Look at the size of this. It’s massive. That should be part of the United States.’’’

American officials floated the idea of buying Greenland in 1867 and 1946, but it never materialized.

Greenlanders find the whole idea insulting. Even if the United States were to offer each of Greenland’s 57,000 residents a million dollars, Greenlanders wouldn’t take it, said Aqqaluk Lynge, a former member of Greenland’s Parliament.

“We don’t sell our souls,” he said.

The resources were first announced in a with Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-OH-9) and leaders from the United Steelworkers and United Auto Workers.

A recording of the briefing can be found on the BlueGreen Alliance YouTube Channel.

“Today, I was proud to join leaders from the BlueGreen Alliance, United Auto Workers, and United Steelworkers to draw attention to the cancellation of $11 billion in Department of Energy projects across the country, including over $100 million of cancellations for companies in the Northwest Ohio district I represent alone,” said Rep. Kaptur. “These awards were authorized by Congress, and the funds were appropriated. Then the Department of Energy approved them, announced them, and signed contracts with the recipients. But under the Trump administration, they have now been revoked! These project terminations are a matter of real consequence for hardworking American families across our nation, for our global competitiveness, and for the communities I represent across Northwest Ohio.”

During 2025, several administrative and congressional actions cut federal funding to advanced manufacturing projects and the clean tech industry. Notably, in July, Trump signed the GOP budget bill repealing nearly $550 billion in funding that would have supported good union jobs, clean energy, and manufacturing investments.

“More than 410,000 workers are currently building clean vehicles and components in this country,” said David Green, Director, United Auto Workers Region 2B. “In recent months, we’ve seen a number of these workers laid off, including over a thousand employees at GM’s Factory Zero and another thousand plus employees at Ultium Cells in the Lordstown area.

“To see those workers bear the brunt of short-sighted corporate and political wavering is infuriating.”

In addition to that repealed funding, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has canceled hundreds of contracted awards worth $11 billion for domestic manufacturing, innovation, and decarbonization projects, including over $100 million in awarded federal investments in Ohio’s 9th district. The new data dashboard unveiled today tracks where these canceled or at-risk projects are located across the country, the lost DOE funding, details any community benefits plans attached to the awards, and tallies associated private investment and potential job loss.

“These projects weren’t just about technology—they were about people,” said Roy Houseman, Legislative Director and Assistant to the President, United Steelworkers (USW). “The Inflation Reduction Act was passed in 2022 with the support of USW and other unions to create jobs and strengthen U.S. competitiveness. By late 2024, it had already helped create 150,000 jobs, with projections of 13.7 million jobs and $1.9 trillion in economic growth. The DOE cuts undermine that progress.”

“Canceling projects for political reasons unrelated to their merit doesn’t just halt funding it kills jobs, undermines U.S. competitiveness, and erodes trust in public-private partnerships,” said Jason Walsh, Executive Director, BlueGreen Alliance. “Congress must defend its constitutional authority, restore funding for canceled projects, and recommit to a long-term industrial strategy. DOE should reverse course and partner with industry to keep America in the driver’s seat of the clean energy economy. Anything less risks locking the United States into dependence on foreign supply chains.”",,N,,2026-01-15 01:58:44.465448

In Monday’s court arguments, representatives for Revolution Wind said the 704-megawatt wind farm was 87% complete.
Meanwhile, Massachusetts wind farm Vineyard Wind is also mostly complete and operational.
The high cost of building an offshore wind farm is offset by its ability to generate inexpensive electricity.
And state officials have warned that without this wind energy on the grid, the lack of available energy will only force prices higher.","There is a glimmer of hope for the long embattled offshore wind industry.

One project in Massachusetts has been sending power back to the grid for months, even as the Trump administration suspended offshore wind farm construction in December. And this week, another nearly complete project off the coast of Connecticut and Rhode Island got the green light from a federal judge to continue building.

Monday’s ruling allowing Revolution Wind to resume construction was the first in a series of court cases that businesses and states are bringing over the course of this week, challenging the administration’s December suspension of all five offshore wind projects currently under construction in the Atlantic Ocean.

It’s a big win for power-starved New England, whose regional grid operator says it needs the electrons generated by these wind projects to maintain electricity reliability in the region for years to come.

President Donald Trump, however, continues to double down on his distaste for offshore wind.

“My goal is to not let any windmill be built; they’re losers,” Trump said on Friday, during a meeting with oil CEOs. “We don’t approve, and I told my people, we will not approve windmills.”

The Interior Department did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment on Monday’s ruling.

Trump’s stance has resulted in the administration blocking projects that are nearly finished. In Monday’s court arguments, representatives for Revolution Wind said the 704-megawatt wind farm was 87% complete. Construction had already been stopped once before by the administration, in August.

Meanwhile, Massachusetts wind farm Vineyard Wind is also mostly complete and operational. That project has been allowed to send power to the grid even amid Trump’s suspension, a spokesperson for regional grid operator ISO-New England told CNN in an email.

Offshore wind has long been sought by New England and mid-Atlantic states, which rely mostly on natural gas for electricity and heating — and are lacking other ready energy infrastructure. At Monday’s court hearing, representatives for Revolution Wind said their wind farm was the only project of such size ready to come online and start providing power to New England’s grid soon. It’s ultimately expected to generate enough electricity to power upwards of 350,000 homes. When complete, the slightly smaller Vineyard Wind project is expected to power around 200,000 homes.

The largest wind farm impacted by the December order is a sprawling Virginia project that could eventually be the largest in the nation. Set to be completed by the end of this year, it would supply electricity to the region with the world’s largest cluster of power-hungry data centers.

Residential customers in the mid-Atlantic region, including Virginia, desperately need more energy to service the skyrocketing demand from data centers — and many are seeing spiking energy bills while they wait for new power to be brought online. In a notable move, that region’s grid operator PJM Interconnection joined a lawsuit on behalf of the Virginia project, calling its 2.7 gigawatts an “integral component” of electricity generation in the region.

“Extended delay of construction and operation of the CVOW [Virginia] project will cause irreparable harm to the 67 million Americans served by PJM,” PJM wrote in a legal brief.

The Revolution and Vineyard wind farms are “particularly important” to meeting New England’s winter energy needs, energy experts and the regional grid operator ISO-NE say. In a December statement, ISO-NE said the projects were important to maintaining “system reliability in the winter when offshore wind output is highest and other forms of fuel supply are constrained.”

“Canceling or delaying these projects will increase costs and risks to reliability in our region,” the regional grid operator added in a statement.

New England’s winter energy woes are driven both by temperature and the fact that this region is the last stop on the nation’s natural gas pipeline system. Competing needs for electricity and home heating can send energy prices for consumers surging.

“The colder it gets on a given day, the more demands that are placed on the gas pipeline system, not just to generate electric power, but to heat people’s homes,” said Francis Pullaro, president of RENEW Northeast, a clean energy industry association based in New England. “If there’s less demand for something, you’ll lower the price.”

There’s another way offshore wind will have downward pressure on prices, Pullaro said. The regional grid operator typically directs the cheapest units to run first, which means wind — which carries no cost for fuel — will be called on more, as more facilities get up and running.

Wind and solar “have very little marginal cost; they essentially bid zero,” Pullaro said. “The more wind you have on the system, and when it’s running at these peak times, it essentially means you’re not having to turn on that peaker gas or oil unit, because it’s just not needed.”

Pullaro’s organization commissioned a recent study that found that having 3.5 gigawatts of offshore wind on New England’s grid last winter would have resulted in New England utility Eversource’s residential customers saving between $15.83 - $32.13 total in electric bills over the course of a three-month winter period.

However, if Revolution and Vineyard wind are both built, they will add less than half of that amount of wind energy to the grid, and there’s no publicly available data yet to show how offshore wind has impacted electricity prices in the region this winter.

Trump administration officials have frequently claimed that offshore wind is the most expensive form of energy. On Monday, Interior Sec. Doug Burgum repeated that, calling the form of energy “some of the most expensive projects ever conceived.”

Offshore wind projects do have high initial costs, in large part because the limited supply chains and high inflation rates that have dogged the US economy affect construction. But, once built, projects like Vineyard are in such demand that they will begin operation with the electricity they generate already spoken for — and paid for. The high cost of building an offshore wind farm is offset by its ability to generate inexpensive electricity.

And state officials have warned that without this wind energy on the grid, the lack of available energy will only force prices higher. Without Revolution Wind, consumers in Connecticut could pay a lot more for energy during times of high demand — as much as $200 million annually starting next year, the Connecticut Department of Energy & Environmental Protection estimated in a recent report.

This week, massive wind turbine blades, towers and other components could be seen sitting at the Connecticut State Pier in New London — waiting to be taken out to sea and constructed.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/01-ap25356646674574.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-14 19:58:53.605985

There is a disconnect between rapid deployment and workforce development in the energy market, says Francesco La Camera, Director General, IRENA. He stresses that governments need to align trade, industrial and labor policies to support domestic capacity and skills development, while strengthening international cooperation to help countries lagging in the energy transition. Such efforts, he says, are critical to meeting the goal of tripling renewable power capacity by 2030 and ensuring broader socio-economic benefits.

Green jobs are highly beneficial for both the environment and society as a whole, says Rodrigo Osorio, Director General, Energy Agency of Puebla. “To be considered green, a job must meet high standards that are required to enhance the life conditions of workers,” he says. “Employees with green jobs must have their voice heard at work, equality must be ensured, everyone must receive a fair income for what they do and the conditions at work must be safe and dignifying. It is imperative to push the social agenda together with the environment to be able to move forward without leaving anyone behind.”

The joint Renewable Energy and Jobs – Annual Review 2025 report found that jobs in the sector increased by 2.3% from 2023, bringing total employment to 16.6 million worldwide. The report points to geopolitical and geoeconomic tensions, along with increasing automation across supply chains, as factors shaping labor dynamics in the energy transition.

Beyond employment totals, the report places a strong emphasis on inclusion and equity. It argues that a just transition requires deliberate action to address the underrepresentation of women and people with disabilities in the renewable energy workforce. According to the study, existing barriers continue to limit participation despite growing labor demand across technologies.

Disability inclusion must be embedded in renewable energy policies from design to implementation, says Gilbert Houngbo, Director General, ILO. He calls for accessible training systems, inclusive hiring practices, and workplaces that accommodate diverse needs, noting that inclusion is essential for resilient labor markets and sustainable development.

The analysis highlights persistent regional imbalances. China maintained its position as the dominant player in renewable energy employment, reflecting its large-scale, integrated manufacturing and deployment capacity. In 2024, China accounted for an estimated 7.3 million renewable energy jobs, representing 44% of the global total.

Employment levels in other major markets showed more modest changes. The European Union held steady at 1.8 million jobs, unchanged from the previous year. Brazil reported 1.4 million renewable energy jobs, while India and the United States saw limited growth, reaching about 1.3 million and 1.1 million jobs, respectively.

Jan 14 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge will rule on Thursday on whether to allow Norwegian offshore wind developer Equinor to resume construction of the Empire Wind project off the coast of New York in a lawsuit over the Trump administration's suspension of the industry.

U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington had declined to issue an immediate ruling at a hearing on Wednesday, two days after the same court ruled Danish offshore wind developer Orsted (ORSTED.CO), opens new tab could restart work on its nearly completed Revolution Wind project off Rhode Island.

The telephonic hearing will take place at 11 a.m. (1600 GMT) local time, according to the court.

The court decisions in these cases hold high stakes for companies and their shareholders because they could allow multi-billion-dollar projects to be completed, but the underlying lawsuits and the administration's aversion to offshore wind will continue to create uncertainty.

FIVE PROJECTS PAUSED

Equinor's request for an injunction, which would allow work to continue while the lawsuit proceeds, is the latest in a string of legal challenges to U.S. President Donald Trump's all-of-government opposition to the offshore wind sector.

Trump's Interior Department last month paused activity on five offshore wind leases, citing new classified information on risks to national security from radar interference.

During the hour-long hearing, Empire Wind attorney Ann Navaro said the pause created an ""existential risk"" for the company, and that it could lose access to construction vessels it needs to complete the $5.5 billion project.

U.S. Department of Justice attorney Stanley Woodward, arguing for the administration, said national security concerns justified the halt and argued the ""parade of horribles"" Empire Wind said would result from the pause was ""speculative.""

Nichols questioned whether the government's national security concerns would apply during construction of the project as opposed to during operations. Empire Wind said the project is not slated to start operations until October.

The judge, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, also raised the possibility of temporarily halting the pause before ruling on the merits of the case in an expedited proceeding.

Equinor (EQNR.OL), opens new tab has spent $4 billion on its project, and said in court papers that it faces likely termination if it cannot proceed by January 16.

Empire Wind is located 20 miles (32 km) off the coast of Long Island and is about 60% complete. It is expected to produce electricity to power about 500,000 homes.

Offshore wind developers, including Equinor, have faced repeated disruptions under Trump, who says wind turbines are ugly, expensive and inefficient. Empire Wind was halted previously by the administration for a month last year.

But PJM, our region’s grid manager, has moved slowly, effectively blocking nearly 2,000 energy projects from connecting to the grid.
And we must act quickly if we’re going to avoid the worst of the looming energy crisis.","Pennsylvania is welcoming the new year with an old problem: while temperatures have hovered around single digits in some counties, energy costs are too high for many people to afford.

The impact is huge: 1 in 5 Pennsylvanians had trouble paying their utility bills last year, and shutoffs are up 38%. Every day, my neighbors in South Philly stop by our district office asking for help keeping their heat on. The alternatives are turning on their oven, skipping medication to afford to pay their bills, or simply doing without heat in the freezing cold.

Warmth in the winter is not a luxury; everyone should be able to live comfortably through the coldest months. But so many people are working so much – multiple jobs, overnight shifts, on weekends – and still can’t get ahead. For poor and working people, the struggle to keep up with a mountain of bills is nothing new; between utilities, groceries, student debt, medical debt and housing, the bills have kept growing and wages have failed to keep up. The affordability crisis is widespread, and energy costs in particular have become a fast-growing problem.

So why is this happening? And more importantly, what can we do to keep costs down and the heat on for everyone?

One factor is rising energy demand. Due to immense growth in digital technologies – artificial intelligence, cloud devices, crypto mining – demand is outpacing supply. In response, Big Tech corporations are rapidly building out data centers. Increased air conditioning use due to climate change and the electrification of fossil fuel-based industries also contributes to the strain on the grid.

Second, not enough generation is coming online quickly enough to meet this increased demand. We know wind and solar projects are the cheapest and fastest energy sources to build. But PJM, our region’s grid manager, has moved slowly, effectively blocking nearly 2,000 energy projects from connecting to the grid. 90% of those projects are clean energy sources that could lower costs for ratepayers. And last year, President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans gutted the Inflation Reduction Act, which offered the surest path to jumpstarting clean energy investments in the U.S. As a result, shovel-ready renewable energy projects have been scrapped, and programs that saved consumers money on their energy bills, like Solar for All, were illegally halted.

All of this together feels like a challenge nearly too big to tackle. We have no choice but to try to do just that if we’re going to avoid the worst predictions of energy shortages. Blackouts and brownouts will cost people their livelihoods and, in some cases, their lives as temperatures soar (or plummet) and they are unable to turn on their air conditioning (or heat). People will die.

We know that generating more clean power is both the fastest and cheapest way to get more energy on the grid.

That can be done through legislation to install more solar on large warehouse roofs, open the door to new geothermal and nuclear investments, and promote battery storage to make these energy sources even more reliable 24/7. And we must find a way to make our membership in PJM work better for Pennsylvanians: According to a new report, the average Pennsylvania household would save $505 a year if PJM connected more clean energy to the grid.

Hardworking parents and families shouldn’t have to foot the bill for data center development driven by major corporations, especially during a nationwide affordability crisis. That’s why we’re advancing my colleague Rep. Rob Matzie’s bill, House Bill 1834, which ensures that costs from data centers, like upgrades to transmission and distribution infrastructure, won’t be passed on to ratepayers. Hardworking parents and seniors are already having a hard time paying the bills; they shouldn’t be expected to pay even more.

As chair of the House Energy Committee, I’m also interested in ways we can directly reduce costs by improving the efficiency of the grid (including by adopting demand response measures, advanced transmission technologies; and virtual power plants, which would allow customers to enroll power cells like sustainable batteries and EV chargers into a program that supplies energy to the grid during peak demand) and by updating energy efficiency standards so we all use less energy in the first place.

Our neighbors are counting on these reforms. And we must act quickly if we’re going to avoid the worst of the looming energy crisis. That crisis will be felt by working people and families as overdue bills pile up, blackouts and brownouts become a reality, and people risk their lives in the cold.

It’s incumbent upon us, as lawmakers, to lead with a new vision for the future – one where everyone has heat, power, and time to spend with their loved ones.

The partners will use $3 million in REPI funds, along with $4.3 million in partner contributions, to treat 2,000 acres of National Forest System land and nonfederal lands near the U.S. Air Force Academy and Cheyenne Mountain Space Force Station.

The REPI program preserves military missions by avoiding land use conflicts near military installations, addressing environmental restrictions that limit military activities and increasing military installation resilience.

The partners include the Forest Service, Air Force Civil Engineer Center, U.S. Army, Colorado Springs Fire Department, Colorado State Forest Service, Colorado Springs Utilities, Palmer Land Conservancy and the Pikes Peak Area Council of Governments.

$3 million REPI-funded projects

Old Stage Road: Treatments began in August 2025 and will continue throughout 2026 along the Old Stage Road (National Forest System Road [NSFR] 368) and Gold Camp Road (NFSR 370) in partnership with the Colorado Springs Fire Department.

East boundary: Scheduled to begin in coordination with the U.S. Air Force Academy in 2026 and continue throughout 2027, this project will protect the U.S. Air Force Academy. The Forest Service will establish resilient landscapes by removing unhealthy trees and reducing dangerous fuel sources, as well as creating strategic firebreaks and control lines near the military installation.

$4.3 million partner-funded projects

The additional funding in partner contributions will support additional treatments on approximately 1,000 acres at other locations near the military installations.

As part of these projects, residents living within or near the Colorado Springs wildland urban interface can expect to see removal, chipping or mastication of small to intermediate-sized vegetation, mostly along roadway corridors. The work will be completed using various small and large machines, including masticators, harvesters, forwarders, skidders, brush hogs, mowers and chippers, as well as chainsaws, brush saws and nonmotorized hand tools.

The partners will collaborate to implement multiple projects using REPI and partner funding, capitalizing on partnerships, and leveraging the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service’s National Active Forest Management Strategy and the key priorities outlined under President Trump’s Executive Order: Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production.

The War Department’s REPI program was established in 2002 as part of the fiscal year 2003 National Defense Authorization Act by supporting cost-sharing agreements between the military services, other federal agencies, state and local governments and private organizations.

Illinois continues to deliver a strong environment for private investment in EV infrastructure by expanding access to reliable, convenient charging for drivers.

“Whether you’re headed out on a long-range road trip, taking the kids to school, or on the job site, EV ownership should be easy, affordable, and reliable. Here in Illinois, we’ve put shoulder to the wheel to get the EV industry off the ground, and we’ve seen significant investments in our state as a result,” said Governor JB Pritzker. “Over the next few years, Illinois’ EV ecosystem will continue to grow — creating more quality jobs, building out more charging infrastructure, and making EVs an even more accessible and affordable option for our families.”

IONNA is a joint venture founded by eight global automakers, deploying EV fast charging infrastructure nationwide. IONNA’s charging stations are accessible to all-electric vehicles with NACS or CCS connectors. Among the new charging sites in Illinois, IONNA is powering 10 charging bays — electrified by ComEd — at Wally’s in Pontiac, creating access to local retail operations for Illinois EV drivers.

“Our goal at IONNA is simple: provide easy and stress-free EV charging for our drivers,” said IONNA CEO Seth Cutler. “By bringing fast, reliable charging to familiar stops like Wally’s in Pontiac, we’re giving Illinois drivers the confidence to travel farther, stop comfortably, and enjoy the journey — whether they’re commuting, running errands, or taking a road trip.”

“Wally’s — the Home of the Great American Road Trip — is proud to partner with IONNA to bring EV charging to Pontiac, strengthening the Midwest travel corridor while delivering the convenience, comfort, and reliability our guests expect,” said Wally’s Co-Founder and CEO Michael Rubenstein.

“The new and improved EV infrastructure at Wally's is another step forward for our community — supporting cleaner transportation, encouraging innovation, and making it easier for residents and visitors alike to choose sustainable options,” said Pontiac Mayor Kelly A. Eckhoff. “New station will attract road travelers, encourage longer stops, and brings more dollars to our local economy, while also preparing Pontiac for the future of transportation.”

“ComEd is committed to helping northern Illinois customers and communities unlock the sustainability and cost saving benefits of EVs,” said ComEd President and CEO Gil Quiniones. “Working closely with the state of Illinois, EV companies and communities across the region, we have helped facilitate the expansion of a widespread network of charging stations to serve the region, strengthened by the most reliable grid in the country.”

The State of Illinois has fought to ensure federal resources are delivered as promised, securing the release of critical funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) grants. So far, a total of $148 million has been allocated to IDOT to deliver the NEVI program in Illinois. To date, IDOT has awarded $43.8 million in NEVI grants for 62 projects throughout the state, which will facilitate the construction of 349 new charging ports.

As federal EV tax credits are no longer available, Illinois continues to operate its own state EV rebate program. Illinois’ EV rebate program — which delivers a check to eligible purchasers — includes $4,000 for low-income Illinoisans, $2,000 for others purchasing an EV, and $1,500 for electric motorcycles. By doubling down in the face of federal roadblocks, Illinois is encouraging sustained growth in the EV sector.

Illinois EV Growth

This combination of public leadership and private investment is helping drive rapid EV growth statewide:

Illinois’ commitment to expanding EV infrastructure benefits Illinois’ local economies and EV and component manufacturers alike. As the state’s EV market grows through strategic investments and competitive incentives, more well-paying jobs are created for Illinois’ unmatched workforce. In May, Governor Pritzker announced EV manufacturer Rivian’s $120 million investment in a new supplier park, which will support hundreds of new jobs and suppliers.

Alongside the charging site in Pontiac, other IONNA rechargeries across Illinois include:

Six other IONNA charging sites in Springfield, Chicago, North Aurora, St. Charles, Arlington Heights, and Des Plaines are either contracted or scheduled to go live.

Such a ruling could give companies more negotiating power over the FCC, said NSR’s Blair Levin

The FCC is also in the middle of a congressional oversight hearing

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) now faces Supreme Court scrutiny over its power to issue fines, stemming from the agency’s decision to penalize the major carriers for location sharing.

In 2024, the FCC fined AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon nearly $200 million for illegally sharing access to customers’ location information without consent. All three carriers sought review from the U.S. Court of Appeals, arguing the FCC’s procedure violated their Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial.

The Fifth Circuit agreed with AT&T that the FCC violated the constitution, whereas the Second Circuit and the District of Columbia Circuit (which reviewed Verizon’s and T-Mobile’s cases, respectively) sided with the FCC.

The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments for both the AT&T and Verizon cases, which in turn could impact the ruling against T-Mobile. A T-Mo spokesperson told Fierce in August it’s “currently reviewing the court’s action.”

No matter how the hearing shakes out, the FCC won’t lose its enforcement role, said New Street Research Policy Analyst Blair Levin in a note today. If the Court upholds the Fifth Circuit’s decision, the FCC would not be able to impose monetary penalties on defendants without a jury trial.

The carriers chose to pay the fines and then appeal them in the circuit courts. Interestingly, had they declined to pay, the Department of Justice could have brought a collection suit which would have resulted in a jury trial, Levin said.

The Commission “will retain authority to investigate, develop factual records, issue subpoenas and other actions necessary to investigate potential rule violations,” he said, as well as the ability to negotiate settlements based on its investigative findings.

Companies would also have a bigger say against FCC decisions. “All companies that are the target of FCC investigations will be in a stronger negotiating position,” Levin added.

FCC in hot water with Congress

The Supreme Court hearing looms as the FCC testifies before Congress on agency oversight.

Today’s congressional hearing comes as FCC Chair Brendan Carr boasts a massive telecom deregulatory initiative while increasing scrutiny over diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), mergers and broadcast media.

Concerns about the FCC’s oversight further arose after Carr in December commented that the FCC ""is not an independent agency, formally speaking."" The word “independent” is no longer included in the FCC’s online mission statement.

In his opening remarks, Rep, Richard Hudson (R-N.C.) welcomed today’s hearing as “an opportunity to discuss the many important issues before the FCC.” He praised the agency’s deregulatory agenda but urged the FCC to be mindful of issues such as Universal Service Fund (USF) reform, spectrum policy and “modernizing outdated media ownership rules.”

On the other hand, Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) slammed Carr for overstepping the FCC’s bounds.

“Over the last year, Chairman Carr has grossly distorted the power and purpose of the FCC,” Pallone stated. “He has weaponized the agency to benefit Trump and punish anyone who challenges him. He has rubber-stamped shady deals between media conglomerates when those deals have included monetary and political benefits for the President.”",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud4/media/image/esmmmc_starr_image_of_a_gavel_in_the_U.S._Supreme_Court._11a156fa-9da6-4410-a516-ce8ad075b458.png?VersionId=oTsSZBO.ReTGaAh.4.0dMSNb4.xD_gL.,N,,2026-01-14 17:59:22.747691

Manufacturing construction spending in the U.S. has gone down after peaking in 2024, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

The latest report from E2 shows that in 2025, companies canceled over $32 billion worth of clean energy manufacturing projects due to reduced government incentives and funding cuts, as well as tariff policies.

But, at the same time, some industry giants have significantly increased investment in the U.S. Last year, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. announced a $100 billion investment with three new fabs, two advanced packaging facilities and an R&D center. Midyear, Micron revealed plans for a $200 billion investment in Idaho, New York, and Virginia with semiconductor manufacturing plants and an R&D center.

These investments partly stem from the new federal policies that aim to incentivize domestic production by making imports and hiring foreign workers more expensive. Other factors include funding from the CHIPS Act as well as state or local tax credits for job creation.

The announcements are a combination of building new facilities and expanding existing plants. Here are some of the biggest projects set to break ground or begin operations in 2026.

Micron

Product: Memory chips

Overall investment: $200 billion

Locations: Idaho, New York and Virginia

Timeline: Construction of the New York fab began in January

Micron’s memory manufacturing facility in New York broke ground earlier this month, and production at its Idaho site is expected to begin next year.

The company is investing $200 billion across multiple facilities, with plans to spend $150 billion on fabs and $50 billion on R&D. The project includes two fabs in Idaho, four fabs in New York and the expansion of its existing manufacturing fab in Virginia.

The project, which aims to produce 40% of the company’s dynamic random access memory in the U.S., is estimated to create 90,000 direct and indirect jobs.

The announcement was made in partnership with the U.S. Department of Commerce with $6.4 billion in funding through the CHIPS and Science Act.

Samsung Electronics

Product: Semiconductors

Investment: $17 billion

Location: Texas

Timeline: Expected to be operational in 2026

Samsung’s “initial minimum investment” for a semiconductor manufacturing plant in Taylor, Texas, is said to be the largest foreign investment in the state.

Construction was halted last year due to reduced demand and resumed in mid-2025. The factory is expected to be operational in 2026, and the company estimates the project will create 1,800 jobs within a decade.

Earlier, Samsung had planned $44 billion worth of investment in Texas, for which it was granted $6.4 billion in funding under the CHIPS Act. As the company reduced the investment to $37 billion, funding was cut to $4.7 billion.

The project is a part of a broader multibillion-dollar expansion in the region, where the company said it has invested over $47 billion since the 1970s.

Stellantis

Product: Vehicles

Investment: $13 billion

Locations: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio

Timeline: Indiana facility begins production in 2026, others by the end of the decade

Stellantis is investing $13 billion across the U.S. to expand production by 50% over the next four years.

In Indiana, the company will produce a new four-cylinder engine beginning in 2026. In Illinois, there are plans to reopen a facility and begin production of two new Jeep vehicles in 2027.

In Michigan, the project will retool the Warren Truck Assembly Plant for a new range-extended electric vehicle and large SUV expected to be ready by 2028. The Detroit Assembly Complex will see production of the next-gen Dodge Durango by 2029.

This is the company’s biggest investment in the U.S. and is expected to create over 5,000 jobs.

Lilly is set to begin construction on its $6 billion active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing facility in Huntsville, Alabama, this year. The plant is part of the company’s $27 billion investment to build four new pharmaceutical production facilities across the U.S.

One of the confirmed sites includes a $6.5 billion plant in Houston. This facility is expected to be operational within roughly five years after construction begins. The second site is a $5 billion cancer drug facility in Richmond, Virginia, also expected to be completed in five years.

Together, the projects fall under the company’s broader plan to invest $50 billion in expanding production in the country, which it describes as the largest pharmaceutical investment in U.S. history.

Texas Instruments

Product: Semiconductors

Investment: $11 billion

Location: Utah

Timeline: Construction previously projected to begin in 2026

Texas Instruments is investing $11 billion to expand its semiconductor manufacturing with a new 300-millimeter fab in Lehi, Utah.

The new facility will be located next to the company’s existing fab, which it acquired from Micron in 2021.

Production is targeted to begin in 2026. It is expected to create about 800 direct jobs and thousands of indirect jobs in the coming years.

Rivian

Product: Electric vehicles

Investment: $5 billion

Location: Georgia

Timeline: Construction begins in 2026

Despite the Trump administration rolling back certain incentives, EV maker Rivian has started working on a long-delayed $5 billion facility in Stanton Springs, Georgia.

Construction is expected to ramp up in 2026, and the 9-million-square-foot site is scheduled to produce 400,000 vehicles annually by 2028.

The company is slated to receive $1.5 billion of incentives through the state if it creates 7,500 jobs paying at least $56,000 a year on average.

The pace of change has been unusually rapid, with policy direction driven largely by executive action, emerging national security priorities, tariff expansion, shifting enforcement patterns, and supply chain pressures that require companies to rethink how they structure cross-border trade.

Over the last year, there have been fundamental changes with regard to tariffs, export controls, sanctions, and US outbound investment regulations. These changes are altering risk profiles and challenging long-standing assumptions. Businesses are navigating these developments against a backdrop of global conflict, geopolitical realignment, domestic policy reversals, evolving due diligence expectations, and increasingly complex international commercial relationships.

The US approach remains highly dynamic: transactional in tone, industry-specific in impact, and shaped by shifting policy levers used to advance national and economic security objectives. Looking ahead to 2026, companies should expect continued movement in tariffs, growing export control restrictions, and trade enforcement investigations, with long-term implications for supply chains, investment strategy, compliance planning, and commercial contracting.

This Insight highlights key themes and takeaways from 2025, organized around three core areas: (1) trade and investment policy trends, (2) export controls and sanctions developments, and (3) tariff expansion and litigation outlook.

TRADE AND INVESTMENT POLICY: STRUCTURAL SHIFTS WITH OPERATIONAL CONSEQUENCES

A Markedly Different Policy Environment

The US administration entered this term with more focused preparation, clearer objectives, and a more expansive policy agenda than in 2017. The result is an assertive approach to trade and investment, focused less on multilateral engagement and more on maximizing US leverage and domestic economic outcomes. Businesses are seeking to understand the implications of this shift, particularly as policy is now centered on a more mercantilist, transactional framework that elevates economic nationalism and hard-power trade tools over soft-power diplomacy.

Tariffs have been a primary driver of this new posture. Many increases exceeded expectations in both scale and scope, particularly for China, with rates in some categories rising far beyond the levels the market anticipated earlier in the year. These changes contributed to significant planning challenges and reshaped sourcing strategies, pricing models, and investment decisions for companies across sectors, although in many cases implementation of the tariff increases were postponed or exemptions were created, muting the overall effect.

Governance by Executive Action

The Trump administration relies heavily on executive orders and emergency authorities to implement trade and investment measures, ranging from tariff imposition to sanctions expansion and investment controls. This approach reflects both a broad view of presidential authority and a willingness to test the limits of that authority through litigation up to the Supreme Court, if necessary. This emphasis on executive authority and an accommodative majority in Congress has diminished the role of the legislature and increased legal and operational uncertainty for businesses planning around public policy timelines.

Effects on Multinational Corporations

Macroeconomic, policy, and geopolitical dynamics combined to create new layers of commercial complexity. Some of the most significant business impacts include the following:

Persistent supply chain disruption: Ongoing global conflicts, dynamic imposition of tariffs, and expansion of export controls continue to affect sourcing, transportation flows, logistics planning, and long-term manufacturing footprints.

Tariff-driven cost pressure: Tariffs remain difficult to predict, and exemption pathways have been unevenly implemented, increasing cost and slowing decision-making. Companies face pressure to realign sourcing, but many hesitate without greater clarity.

Fragmented ESG and DEI legal environment: Conflicting state, national, and international environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) requirements are producing overlapping (and sometimes contradictory) legal obligations, particularly in disclosures, sustainability strategy, and climate transition planning.

Immigration-related workforce challenges: Talent mobility has become more difficult amid tightened controls on visas and student access, heightened enforcement activity, and changing compliance expectations.

Sector-specific effects: Deregulation and policy support for oil, gas, coal, artificial intelligence, and digital assets stand in contrast to increasing pressure on renewable energy, life sciences, and automotive/retail supply chains.

New Challenges for Corporate Planning and Compliance

Legal and compliance teams are operating in an environment where policy shifts can materially alter contract rights, pricing models, investment strategies, and disclosure requirements.

Organizations face pressure to remain current on rapidly shifting executive actions, assess enforcement risk in evolving regulatory regimes, and align public disclosures with material tariff and trade risks. Many are also confronting conflicting obligations across jurisdictions and increasingly renegotiating supply contracts to account for cost volatility and tariff exposure.

These pressures mean risk management now requires deeper integration of trade policy forecasting with commercial planning and capital allocation models, and greater emphasis on scenario analysis, contract flexibility, and proactive stakeholder communication.

EXPORT CONTROLS, SANCTIONS, AND NATIONAL SECURITY REVIEWS: A MORE AGGRESSIVE ENFORCEMENT LANDSCAPE

Shift in National Security Priorities

The US administration’s 2025 priorities reflect heightened focus on trade and customs fraud, sanctions violations, drug cartel-related activity, and countering China. These priorities are shaping enforcement activity and driving new due diligence requirements, particularly in higher-risk markets and regions.

Export Controls: Broader Jurisdiction and Enhanced Risk

Export controls are increasingly used as an economic policy tool in addition to their traditional national security function. Recent developments include (1) expanded export controls targeting semiconductors, AI, and other sensitive technologies, and China-related supply chains; and (2) broadening of the Entity List to include affiliates of listed entities, which significantly increases due diligence burdens.

Although implementation of the Affiliates Rule is suspended for one year as part of a bilateral economic agreement with China, companies should use this period to prepare for expanded compliance requirements and documentation expectations once the suspension period ends.

Sanctions: Evolving Tools and New Applications

This year also saw meaningful changes to sanctions programs, including the below:

Designation of major drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, increasing exposure risk for companies with operations or counterparties in Mexico and Latin America. These designations expanded investigative tools and authorities available to investigators, including material-support-to-terrorism charges and enhanced intelligence access.

Use of FinCEN special measures as a sanctions-like tool to restrict funds transfers involving financial institutions linked to illicit opioid trafficking.

New sanctions programs and novel uses of existing programs targeting perceived adversaries of the US administration under corruption and counter-narcotics programs. The administration reinstated sanctions on the International Criminal Court.

Additionally, 2025 saw the termination of the Syria and West Bank sanctions programs along with a heightened focus on Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, and Russia. While it has been slow to impose additional sanctions on Russia, the current administration did announce in the last quarter sanctions on two major oil and gas companies to put additional pressure on Russia to engage in peace negotiations over Ukraine.

Outbound Investment and Supply Chain Restrictions

Regulators continue to sharpen focus on outbound investment flows affecting sensitive technology sectors in China in an effort to curtail US investments facilitating the development of sensitive technologies and furthering China’s Military-Civil Fusion strategy.

Requirements now include notification obligations and, in some areas, prohibitions on US investment in Chinese companies operating in certain sectors and industries.

This trend is reinforced by Foreign Entity of Concern rules under the Inflation Reduction Act, limiting tax credit eligibility for renewable energy components with certain Chinese ties, as well as ongoing developments under the ICTS supply chain program. The National Defense Authorization Act passed in the last quarter did include provisions addressing both outbound investment in and the procurement of biopharmaceutical inputs from countries of concern.

Operational Challenges

Across the cross-border transaction landscape, businesses face sharply increased expectations around due diligence and reduced predictability in licensing and review timelines. These pressures are prompting companies to reassess compliance resources, documentation practices, and internal review protocols to identify and mitigate gaps that could elevate enforcement or transactional risk.

Compounding these challenges is a significant backlog on export classification and licensing applications before US government regulators. Much of this backlog has been exacerbated by staffing reductions, agency turnover, and disruptions caused by the recent government shutdown. Taken together, these factors delay processing times, increase uncertainty around timing and outcomes, and require companies to build greater flexibility into commercial planning, supply chain decisions, and investment strategy.

Companies are reevaluating their compliance frameworks, particularly around counterparty screening, recordkeeping, training, and reporting procedures, as the enforcement environment continues to evolve.

TARIFFS AND TRADE REMEDIES: NEW STRUCTURES, HIGHER RATES, LITIGATION RISK

Tariff Expansion Continues

Tariff activity accelerated significantly in 2025, reshaping import economics and altering long-term strategic planning for US and multinational companies. Tariffs are being deployed as a tool for both economic leverage and national security objectives, affecting a wide range of goods and industries. Key areas of focus include the following:

Section 232 (national security) tariffs affecting imports of steel, aluminum, vehicles and parts, copper, timber, trucks, and lumber and timber, with ongoing investigations concerning semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, critical minerals, and more

Section 301 tariffs targeting acts and practices of identified trading partners, primarily China, related to identified unfair trading practices

Section 201 safeguards relating to solar cells and modules (expiring February 2026)

International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) tariffs imposed under emergency authorities, including broad reciprocal rates and trafficking-related tariffs targeting Canada, Mexico, and China

Secondary tariffs on Venezuelan and Russian oil, currently imposed only on India

Elimination of de minimis entry thresholds for low-value goods

These measures, layered on top of standard customs duties, have led importers to assess classification, valuation, country of origin, and eligibility under trade agreements with greater precision.

Ongoing bilateral negotiations with major trading partners are creating tariff variability based on region and product category, offering targeted relief but also increasing planning uncertainty.

Litigation and Policy Horizon for 2026

Importers closely await the Supreme Court’s decision on IEEPA-based tariff authority, argued on November 5, 2025. A ruling is expected in early 2026, although the timing may shift. The outcome could reshape tariff structures, refund potential, and future presidential authority, all of which is driving increased interest in protective refund claims and importer-specific litigation.

Meanwhile, pending trade investigations under Section 232 could trigger new tariffs on critical industries, and the first joint review under USMCA will occur in July 2026, potentially opening the door to major renegotiation.

Practical Impacts for Businesses

Importers should expect

continued tariff cost volatility,

increased complexity in supply chain contracting,

valuation and classification challenges,

expanded due diligence requirements, and

intensified scrutiny in corporate transactions, investor reporting, and insurance underwriting.

Companies should also prepare for potential refund scenarios under certain tariff programs, particularly if litigation outcomes or negotiations alter duty obligations retroactively.

LOOKING AHEAD

The United States continues to redefine its role in global trade and investment. Increased and novel use of trade policy tools such as emergency tariffs, outbound investment controls, and sanctions tied to cartel activity, are now fundamental. Export controls are broadening in scope and purpose, sanctions programs are expanding into new areas, and the implementation of outbound investment restrictions are changing how businesses implement their commercial and operational strategies.

For companies, the result is a more complex and risky regulatory environment that demands proactive planning and resilient operating models. To address this, companies are

evaluating and strengthening trade compliance infrastructure,

increasing their visibility into multi-tier supply chains,

reassessing sourcing and logistics footprints,

integrating tariff, export control, and sanctions forecasting into budgeting,

updating contractual protections to reduce the risk of indirect violations and specifically allocate risk and responsibility for tariffs, and

aligning public disclosures with evolving risk profiles.

Building agility into trade strategy will be critical in 2026. The companies best positioned to thrive in this environment will be those that embed trade intelligence into cross-functional decision-making—connecting policy tracking to procurement, pricing, capital investment, manufacturing, and technology strategy.

The Washington Post identified Trump’s heckler as TJ Sabula, who said Ford had suspended him while it investigates the incident.
Bill Ford downplayed the incident as “6 seconds out of an hour tour.” “I was embarrassed because we’re the host,” Ford said.
“In some ways, it's just in character for him to be that way, and obviously my sympathies are with the worker and not the president.” Sabula is a member of the UAW.
“The leadership of the automotive sector by rights ought to be in America, and it ought to be right here,” Buttigieg said.","As Trump was exiting the plant Tuesday, a worker could be heard on video obtained by TMZ calling the president a “pedophile protector,” an apparent reference to the records of convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Trump could be seen shouting an expletive and extending his middle finger in response, Automotive News reported.

The Washington Post identified Trump’s heckler as TJ Sabula, who said Ford had suspended him while it investigates the incident. Bill Ford downplayed the incident as “6 seconds out of an hour tour.”

“I was embarrassed because we’re the host,” Ford said. “I understand that gets a lot of social media play, and that’s the world we live in. But it was a very small part of the day.”

A White House spokesperson said in a statement to TMZ: “A lunatic was wildly screaming expletives in a complete fit of rage, and the President gave an appropriate and unambiguous response.""

In his keynote conversation with Michigan State University President Kevin Guskiewicz on Wednesday at Huntington Place convention center, Buttigieg said Trump has been a union buster and presided over the loss of manufacturing jobs across America.

“And then when somebody sees someone as powerful as him come into their workplace, (Trump) gives them the old f- you,” said Buttigieg, who served in the Biden administration. “In some ways, it's just in character for him to be that way, and obviously my sympathies are with the worker and not the president.”

Sabula is a member of the UAW. Laura Dickerson, UAW vice president and Ford department director, said in a statement that the union will protect its workers' free speech rights on the job.

""The UAW will ensure that our member receives the full protection of all negotiated contract language safeguarding his job and his rights as a union member,"" Dickerson said in a statement. ""Workers should never be subjected to vulgar language or behavior by anyone — including the President of the United States.""

Sabula is already the beneficiary of multiple GoFundMe campaigns launched on his behalf, which as of mid-afternoon Wednesday total more than $600,000.

One campaign, opened by Sean Williams, who is based in South Carolina, according to his GoFundMe profile, calls Sabula a ""patriot,"" and had raised $374,003 and with nearly 17,000 donations as of Wednesday afternoon. The other, organized by Diandra Gourlay of Highland Park, had raised $227,509 with more than 9,000 donations.

“This is a worker who spoke his mind to the most powerful person in the country, and he is well within his rights to do that as an American,” Buttigieg said to reporters.

In 2020, President Joe Biden was in a testy exchange with a pro-gun autoworker during a plant tour in Detroit over Biden's plan to reinstate an assault weapons ban. Biden told the worker he was ""full of s---"" after the worker confronted him and accused him of working to end Second Amendment rights.

Buttigieg’s conversation with Guskiewicz was punctuated by the occasional rumble of the Detroit People Mover traveling through the Huntington Place station near the convention center. Buttigieg used the opportunity to speak on how innovation in the transit space is necessary to reduce the risk of automotive crashes.

Approximately 40,000 people die preventable deaths each year while driving in the U.S., Buttigieg said.

“Getting from an airport to a city center in this country is an embarrassment compared to what it is in most places. We could do something about it, using technology and public investment to better integrate transit with roadways,” Buttigieg said. He also voiced support for autonomous vehicles, calling them safer than the average American driver.

Waymo, a Google-affiliated autonomous vehicle company, came to Detroit in November to begin testing fully autonomous ride-hailing services across the city.

“The leadership of the automotive sector by rights ought to be in America, and it ought to be right here,” Buttigieg said.

To keep it that way, he called for a bigger push of investment in electric vehicles, criticizing the “whiplash” between the policies of the two recent federal administrations.

“There is no question about whether this technology will be the future of the sector,” Buttigieg said. “There is a big question about whether America will lead that. I see the innovation, the determination, the dedication of U.S. automakers and their teams, their workers and their leaders to make sure that is so.”

There is some speculation about Buttigieg's interest in the 2028 presidential election. He plans to travel to Cleveland on Thursday for an appearance and plans to participate in a town hall in La Crosse, Wis., on Friday.",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/447592617.jpg,N,,2026-01-14 16:59:44.130860

As the world’s top producer of oil and natural gas and the leading LNG exporter, the United States is integral to ensuring energy security while driving lower emissions. Sommers stressed the efficiency and environmental standards that differentiates U.S. energy on the global stage:

“No other country has matched America’s ability to produce more energy with fewer emissions. It’s the result of a system built on certainty, stability, and clear rules—where companies can invest, innovate, and deliver energy at scale with confidence.”

Demand Is Rising and Energy Realism Is Taking Hold

Speakers rejected the notion that oil and natural gas demand is peaking. Instead, global and domestic demand reached record highs in 2025, driven by broad economic and human needs. Coined the “demand decade,” API estimated that U.S. electricity demand will surge by 35-50 percent between 2024 and 2040. Many speakers argued that AI is not the only factor driving energy demand, rather demand is multifaceted.

Kevin Book of ClearView Energy Partners summarized the economic importance of this growth plainly:

“Energy is the essential input that drives the entire economy… Not everyone is a driller, everyone is a driver.”

Looking ahead to the midterm elections, Sommers highlighted a national shift in public and political attitudes toward energy:

“As we head into this midterm election year, we are looking at a national shift. Americans are embracing energy realism.”

This is evident in blue-states walking back ambitious climate targets across the country. States that initially pushed ambitious climate mandates are now adjusting as cost and reliability gaps become clear. California has expanded drilling and encouraged refineries to stay open, while New York is reconsidering parts of its 2019 climate law due to rising energy costs and potential grid shortfalls, just to name two. These examples show policymakers and consumers are increasingly demanded abundant, affordable and reliable energy.

Infrastructure Is the Limiting Factor

Despite record production, speakers emphasized that insufficient infrastructure remains a central constraint on affordability and reliability. Expanding pipelines, power generation, and transmission capacity are critical to meet rising demand through effective permitting reform.

Toby Z. Rice, President & CEO of EQT discussed the urgent need to build quickly:

“To win the AI race, this country needs a tremendous amount of infrastructure. If you want access to this power, you’ve got to build it… Our number one priority is keeping the lights on and keeping bills low. We are dead set serious about that, and building infrastructure is the key.”

Speakers agreed that expanding infrastructure and addressing regulatory bottlenecks are essential. Outdated permitting rules are a major bottleneck, with environmental reviews now taking nearly four years on average – double the time they took in the 1970s. Projects face additional delays due to litigation, creating uncertainty and deferring investment in critical infrastructure.

Without clear policies and timely permitting, affordability, reliability, and U.S. energy leadership are at risk.

Regulatory Complexity

Beyond physical infrastructure, regulatory complexity is a major barrier to meeting rising energy demand. Panelists emphasized that permitting reform and clear rules are closely connected—without regulatory certainty, even approved projects face delays, higher costs, and operational challenges.

President and CEO of Cheniere Energy Jack Fusco highlighted the scale of oversight facing developers:

“Regulatory overreach. We deal with 54 agencies. We need clarity and coordination…We need help making sure we can do our jobs and do them well and not stuck publishing reports.”

These delays have real consequences for consumers and the broader economy. As sectors like data centers and AI drive unprecedented electricity demand, slow decision-making and overlapping regulations strain the energy system and prevent buildout.

Addressing regulatory complexity is essential not only for operational efficiency, but for keeping energy affordable, reliable, and competitive in the “demand decade.” Chairman, President and CEO Maryann Mannen of Marathon Petroleum underscored this importance for future U.S. dominance:

“Permitting reform, policy clarity, putting rules in place that are supportive of ensuring we’ve got U.S. energy independence is really critical.”

U.S. Energy Leadership and Global Competitiveness

Panelists reinforced the critical role of American energy in both domestic and global markets. Sommers noted the nation’s leadership, stating:

“U.S. oil and natural gas companies now play an outsized role in meeting global energy demand, reducing the influence of hostile regimes and providing the vital products that have lifted billions out of poverty and enable people all over the world to thrive.”

For example in 2025 the U.S. exported a record 11 million metric tons of LNG, marking a 24 percent year-over-year increase. With monthly and annual production hitting all-time highs, the U.S. is reinforcing its position as the world’ benchmark for stable and abundant energy. This unprecedented production provides balance to international markets, reduces global price volatility, and ensures Americans have access to dependable energy at home.

Panelists said U.S. energy leadership keeps energy affordable at home and competitive abroad, with American production widely seen as the global benchmark. As Sommers put it, U.S. energy is the “envy of the world,” but sustaining that leadership will require continued investment and infrastructure to meet growing global demand.

This leadership is particularly important as U.S. and global markets grapple with a potential reopening of Venezuela oil markets.",https://www.energyindepth.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/eid_favicon_new.png,N,,2026-01-14 16:59:48.713714

Nuclear energy stores immense amounts of energy directly in its fuel.
Nuclear energy is also a strategic national asset.
Countries that lead in advanced nuclear technology will control supply chains, safety standards, and long-term geopolitical influence.
When it comes to powering the next century of economic growth and national defense, advanced nuclear is not optional: it is essential.","Northern PSC Commissioner Chris Brown says nuclear energy is the future of large-scale power generation. Serious nations know it.

America’s economy is entering a new phase: one that requires enormous amounts of reliable electricity. Artificial intelligence, data centers, advanced manufacturing, military installations, and modern infrastructure all depend on power that is available every hour of every day, no matter the weather.

That reality matters deeply in Mississippi, where families, businesses, hospitals, and military facilities cannot afford rolling outages or skyrocketing power bills. If the United States wants to remain economically competitive and nationally secure, we must be honest about what works, and accelerate investment in advanced nuclear energy.

Much of today’s energy debate focuses on the falling cost of renewable power, especially solar. That progress is real and useful. But it often ignores a critical distinction: cheap power on paper is not the same as dependable power in the real world.

Solar energy can be inexpensive when the sun is shining. But electricity demand does not stop at night, during storms, or during prolonged cloudy periods. To deliver round-the-clock power, solar must be paired with massive battery systems. Those batteries are expensive, wear out over time, and must be replaced regularly. Once those costs are included, the price of “dispatchable” solar power rises sharply.

Once you require dispatchable, 24/7 power, the economics flip.

Cost per kWh (firm power):

• Advanced Nuclear: $0.06–$0.10

• Solar + 4h batteries: $0.09–$0.13 (still not fully reliable)

• Solar + 24h batteries: $0.20–$0.35

• Hardened solar (multi-day): $0.40–$0.80+

Dispatchable solar costs 2–8× more per kWh.

When measured fairly, comparing only power that is available on demand, the difference becomes clear. Advanced nuclear energy can produce electricity for roughly six to ten cents per kilowatt-hour, with plants operating more than 90 percent of the time and lasting for decades. By contrast, solar paired with enough storage to provide continuous power often costs two to four times more, and systems designed to handle multi-day outages can cost even more.

This is not a political issue. It is a matter of physics and engineering. Nuclear energy stores immense amounts of energy directly in its fuel. Solar energy must be generated when conditions allow and stored externally in batteries that require large amounts of land, minerals, and ongoing replacement.

Reliability matters more than ever as electricity demand grows. Data centers, manufacturing plants, military installations, and critical infrastructure cannot simply power down when conditions are unfavorable. A grid built primarily on intermittent generation like solar and wind becomes more fragile, not more resilient, without firm power sources to anchor it.

Advanced nuclear reactors are designed for exactly this challenge. Modern designs rely on passive safety systems, simplified construction, smaller footprints, and decades of operational experience. Unlike other technologies, nuclear power becomes more economical as it runs longer, without requiring massive new infrastructure, and only small amounts of additional fuel.

Nuclear energy is also a strategic national asset. Countries that lead in advanced nuclear technology will control supply chains, safety standards, and long-term geopolitical influence. Russia and China understand this clearly and are investing heavily to dominate the next generation of nuclear power. The United States cannot afford to fall behind, or worse, outsource its energy future while competitors lock in theirs.

Nuclear energy is the future of large-scale power generation. Serious nations know it. Rather than continuing to funnel billions of dollars into subsidized solar projects that depend on weather and constant backup, America should focus on technologies that deliver reliable power, strengthen national security, protect ratepayers, and secure long-term leadership. When it comes to powering the next century of economic growth and national defense, advanced nuclear is not optional: it is essential.",https://magnoliatribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-14-133930.png,N,,2026-01-14 19:00:19.541521

Registrations between January and June came in at just 9,000 vehicles, down from more than 26,000 in the same period in 2024.
DesRosiers Automotive Consultants, an auto industry data firm, confirmed that Tesla’s Canadian sales fell by more than 60%, but also noted a partial recovery later in the year.
Zero-emission vehicle sales across Canada fell between 32% and 43% through the first three quarters of the year, according to Automotive News.
By the fourth quarter, imports of tariff-free European Model Y vehicles helped stabilize sales, but the damage was already done.","Tesla’s once-dominant position in Canada took a dramatic hit in 2025, as a perfect storm of policy changes, trade tensions, and market shifts sent sales tumbling to their lowest level in years.

New registration data compiled from multiple industry sources shows Tesla delivered between 18,300 and 20,000 vehicles in Canada for the full year, down significantly from the roughly 55,000 units in 2024.

That works out to a 63–67% year-over-year decline, making Canada one of Tesla’s weakest major markets globally in 2025.

The damage was most severe in the first half of the year. Registrations between January and June came in at just 9,000 vehicles, down from more than 26,000 in the same period in 2024. Quebec was hit especially hard after the province paused its EV rebate program at the end of 2024 for several months, causing Tesla sales in the province to plunge nearly 85% in Q1 alone.

DesRosiers Automotive Consultants, an auto industry data firm, confirmed that Tesla’s Canadian sales fell by more than 60%, but also noted a partial recovery later in the year. That rebound came after Tesla began importing Model Y vehicles from Giga Berlin, which allowed the company to avoid U.S.-related tariffs that were applied to American-built vehicles entering Canada.

That shift was crucial. U.S.–Canada trade measures imposed in 2025 made Teslas built in Fremont (Tesla has never imported vehicles from Giga Texas into Canada) far more expensive, just as federal and provincial EV incentives were being reduced or eliminated.

The broader EV sector also struggled in 2025, but not nearly to the same degree. Zero-emission vehicle sales across Canada fell between 32% and 43% through the first three quarters of the year, according to Automotive News. Meanwhile, overall new-vehicle sales actually grew about 2%, reaching roughly 1.9 million units.

Globally, Tesla also faced a difficult year. The company delivered 1,636,129 vehicles in 2025, down about 9% from 2024. While Tesla does not publish country-level sales figures, this data shows Canada’s decline was far steeper than Tesla’s worldwide average, highlighting how uniquely difficult 2025 was for the brand north of the border.

By the fourth quarter, imports of tariff-free European Model Y vehicles helped stabilize sales, but the damage was already done. With incentives gone and trade barriers still in place, Tesla now enters 2026 facing a very different Canadian market than the one that powered its record-breaking 2024.",https://driveteslacanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/modely-snow.png,N,,2026-01-14 16:01:06.340741

""Whilst a lot of the focus of today’s announcement has been on the benefits these wind farms bring by cutting bills and strengthening our energy security, there are also substantial long term benefits for the UK's economic confidence.

The UK needs vast amounts of new electricity generation to meet the demands of new data centres, housing and industry, and offshore wind will play a critical role in meeting that need cost-effectively.”

Andrew Elmes, Supply Chain Vice-Chair of the Offshore Wind Industry Council and Head of Government Affairs (UK and Ireland) for Siemens Energy said:

""Thanks to the record volume of winning projects in this auction round, over the coming years we would hope to see billions of pounds of supply chain investment flow into all corners of the UK to deliver these offshore wind farms. As the bulk of offshore wind infrastructure is out at sea, the scale up of associated jobs and businesses will be in coastal areas across Scotland, England and Wales and should support local economic revitalisation, as we have already seen in regions such as the Humber and East Anglia.

""The UK is world-leading in many aspects of offshore wind development, notably the manufacturing and installation of cutting-edge turbine technology, the cables which transmit electricity to shore, foundations to anchor floating turbines to the seabed, as well as operating and maintaining the assets out at sea.

Those who live in manufactured homes also tend to have less income than those in site-built varieties, making these needlessly high energy costs even harder to handle.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development last updated standards for manufactured homes in 1994.
This fact shows that better-built manufactured homes can benefit the industry and consumers alike, say affordability advocates, far better than the bill that’s now before the Senate.
​“However, the lower purchase price on a home for a family is eroded if they’re unable to make monthly payments due to high and rising energy costs.”","The U.S. House just voted to cancel efficiency standards for new manufactured homes — a move that could hit especially hard in the Southeast, where such housing is common and energy insecurity is high.

The measure would rescind 2022 criteria for insulation, air sealing, and other energy-saving features in prefabricated, or mobile, homes, restoring weaker standards more than 30 years old. The legislation comes as utility bills are rising fast nationwide — and if it is passed by the Senate and signed into law, it could cost households in double-wide houses hundreds more per year in increased electricity costs.

“The very first energy bill that the House of Representatives passed this year would increase energy costs on some of the households and families in the United States that are most struggling to make ends meet,” said Mark Kresowik, senior policy director with the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. ​“This will have more harmful impacts in the Southeast than anywhere else in the country.”

Of the 4.7 million prefab homes delivered nationwide in recent decades, more than half are in just 10 southern states. Texas leads the country, with nearly 600,000 units, and North Carolina is second, with over 330,000, according to the U.S. Census.

Manufactured homes are exempt from state and local energy codes, and older models are notoriously energy inefficient, with thin insulation, drafty windows and doors, and often outdated modes of heating and cooling. Those who live in manufactured homes also tend to have less income than those in site-built varieties, making these needlessly high energy costs even harder to handle.

“Utility costs can be in the several hundred dollars for folks in a manufactured house,” said Claire Williamson, senior energy policy advocate at the North Carolina Justice Center, which advocates for low-income families. She added that “$300, $400, even $500 a month in peak costs is not trivial.”

The prefabricated homes exacerbate energy insecurity in the Southeast, which is the most energy-burdened region in the country: One in three households in the region struggles to pay their utility bills, according to the Southeast Energy Efficiency Alliance.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development last updated standards for manufactured homes in 1994. In 2007, a bipartisan law directed the Department of Energy to issue more protective rules. In 2022, the Biden administration finally did so, but the new criteria were paused last summer by the Trump administration.

The Manufactured Housing Institute, the trade group for prefabricated home builders, has long fought against the stricter standards, which it argues are too costly, confusing, and bureaucratic.

The bipartisan bill that passed the House last week largely gives the builders what they want, restoring the 1994 standards and preventing the Department of Energy from ever issuing stronger rules.

The 2022 rules were expected to cost an average of $4,222 per double-wide home up front but pay for themselves in the form of lower energy bills in less than five years. For single-wide units, the additional up-front costs were pegged at $660, which households would recoup within one year.

“This is so clearly about the homebuilder special interests,” Williamson said, ​“and has nothing to do with ensuring better, more affordable housing for people.”

About half of all factory-made homes are already built to efficiency standards that are much stricter than those rescinded by the House, said Grant Beck, vice president of strategic partnerships at Next Step Network, a Kentucky-based nonprofit that supports ownership of prefab homes.

This fact shows that better-built manufactured homes can benefit the industry and consumers alike, say affordability advocates, far better than the bill that’s now before the Senate.

“We understand that we’re in an affordability crisis, particularly with relation to housing and first-time home buyers trying to enter the market,” Beck said. ​“However, the lower purchase price on a home for a family is eroded if they’re unable to make monthly payments due to high and rising energy costs.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Mobile-home-park-TX_GettyImages-539746440.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=f4c0e7c67f8bfe36bb0bcc978df18ff2,N,,2026-01-14 22:58:14.480322
