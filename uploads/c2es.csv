“The biggest thing right now, everybody — Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina — everyone’s chasing data centers. And particularly data centers to support AI,” said Neil Chatterjee, former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Data centers can provide a big boost to local tax revenue, but at the cost of higher power bills. They’re also one of the main reasons Duke Energy forecasts energy demand soaring at an unprecedented rate.

There’s still a lot of uncertainty when it comes to new data centers. Developers often place bids for the same project in multiple states, and local opposition to new data centers has halted progress on some.

“Load growth’s not a new phenomenon. You can look back from 1950 to the early 2000s, and that was the norm,” said David Neal, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, or SELC. “It’s also important to remember that we’re pretty bad at predicting the future.”

An SELC analysis of past Duke Energy resource plans showed that the utility consistently overestimated energy needs from 2008 to 2016 when forecasting load growth.

Wind energy trundles along in the Atlantic

President Trump has pumped the brakes on wind energy development in the U.S. But there’s still some hope for wind energy in the Atlantic — even if that’s not in North Carolina.

The federal government has stalled new wind turbines all along the East Coast. That includes two projects off the coast of Wilmington. However, Karly Brownfield with Carolinas Southeastern Wind Coalition said wind isn’t totally dead in the Atlantic waters.

“Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind has … as of last week … installed every single one of their 176 monopile foundations for that project,” Brownfield said.

Dominion’s wind farm off the coast of Virginia Beach is scheduled to come online early next year.

Despite conservative opposition at the federal level, Tom Shumaker, the state director for North Carolina Conservatives for Clean Energy, said there’s a lot for the right to like about wind energy.

“Those foundations create artificial reefs. This is tremendous marine wildlife habitat,” Shumaker said. “This is new opportunities for commercial fishermen, recreational fishermen, local tourism, just sitting there ready to go.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/68890c7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+113/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F15%2F84%2F7d5150584cec847d9bd452824f09%2Fdsc-0156-2.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 20:02:01.227105

Therefore, metros with an established presence in these sectors, or that have planned investments, should be most poised to benefit.

Reindustrialization efforts began with the previous administration’s passing of the CHIPS and Inflation Reduction Acts (IRA), which fueled new factory construction in these subsectors, particularly in Phoenix, Austin, Raleigh, Columbus, and Houston. While it will take time for construction to finish and jobs to materialize, we expect these—and Southern metros more broadly—to see the greatest benefits of the reindustrialization agenda.

Manufacturing-heavy metros, including those with large shares of jobs in these dynamic subsectors—Detroit (autos), San Jose (semiconductors and computers), Seattle (aerospace), Reading (batteries), and New York (pharmaceuticals)—saw healthy job growth through 2023. But many have since incurred declines over the last year as concerns stemming from tariffs, CHIPS and IRA funding, and lower immigration have clouded the outlook. These losses reinforce the need to maintain the momentum of building new capacity to support manufacturing job growth.

For planners looking to jumpstart more manufacturing, and who are considering criteria for selecting the best sites for new factories—available labor, density of skillsets, established supply chains, and broad-based infrastructure—we found that metros in Midwest states and central Pennsylvania score highest on these measures.

Holtec International described an “untenable path forward for used fuel storage in New Mexico” as it walked away from the proposal to temporarily hold spent fuel from commercial nuclear power plants across the nation. The New Jersey-based company confirmed its decision Thursday.

Holtec said the move would allow it to work with other states that are more amenable.

The New Mexico project was cast aside despite a favorable U.S. Supreme Court ruling in August that rebooted plans for temporary storage in Texas and New Mexico.

The U.S. is at an impasse over a permanent solution for storing spend nuclear fuel, as roughly 100,000 tons (90,000 metric tons) of spent fuel, some of it dating from the 1980s, pile up at current and former nuclear plant sites nationwide. The waste was meant to be kept there temporarily before being deposited deep underground.

U.S. nuclear regulators in 2023 licensed the proposed multibillion-dollar storage complex in New Mexico, while opposition persisted.

New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and the Legislature put up stiff resistance with legislation that threatened to withhold state permits at least until a permanent storage solution is in place.

“It’s inappropriate to call anything ‘interim’ when you don’t have a permanent repository” for spent nuclear fuel, said Sen. Jeff Steinborn of Las Cruces, lead sponsor of the bill.

He called Holtec’s decision to withdraw “a huge relief,” adding that “of course it’s still a national problem that needs to be solved.”

By contrast, Lujan Grisham’s Republican predecessor, Susana Martinez, had been supportive of the project. Holtec had argued the plan was safe and would be an economic boon for the region, without interfering with nearby oil development.

Critics of the project, including the Sierra Club, said Holtec’s decision highlights an enduring roadblock.

A decision on whether to accept the recent bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. is pending, and the lease cannot be issued until the Montana land plan is altered.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Congressional Republicans have voted to roll back restrictions on mining, drilling and other development in three Western states, advancing President Donald Trump's ambitions to expand energy production from public lands.

Senators voted 50-46 Thursday to repeal a land management plan for a large swath of Alaska that was adopted in the final weeks of Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration. Lawmakers voted to roll back similar plans for land in Montana and North Dakota earlier this week.

The timing of Biden's actions made the plans vulnerable to the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to terminate rules that are finalized near the end of a president’s term. The resolutions require a simple majority in each chamber and take effect upon the president's signature.

The House approved the repeals last month in votes largely along party lines. Trump is expected to sign the measures, which will boost a proposed 211-mile road through an Alaska wilderness to allow mining of copper, cobalt, gold and other minerals.

Trump ordered approval of the Ambler Road project earlier this week, saying it will unlock access to copper, cobalt and other critical minerals that the United States needs to compete with China on artificial intelligence and other resource development. Copper is used in the production of cars, electronics and even renewable energy technologies such as wind turbines.

The road was approved in Trump’s first term, but was later blocked by Biden after an analysis determined the project would threaten caribou and other wildlife and harm Alaska Native tribes that rely on hunting and fishing.

The Biden-era restrictions also included a block on new mining leases in the nation's most productive coal-producing region, the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming. On Monday, the Trump administration held the biggest coal sale in that area in more than a decade, drawing a single bid of $186,000 for 167.5 million tons of coal, or about a tenth of a penny per ton.

Trump has largely cast aside Biden's goal to reduce climate-warming emissions from the burning of coal and other fossil fuels extracted from federal land. Instead, he and congressional Republicans have moved to open more taxpayer-owned land to fossil fuel development, hoping to create more jobs and revenue. The Republican administration also has pushed to develop critical minerals, including copper, cobalt, gold and zinc.

A decision on whether to accept the recent bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. is pending, and the lease cannot be issued until the Montana land plan is altered. The dirt-cheap value reflects dampened industry interest in coal despite Trump's efforts. Many utilities have switched to cheaper natural gas or renewables such as wind and solar power.

Administration officials expressed disappointment that they did not receive “stronger participation” in the Montana sale. In a statement, Interior Department spokesperson Aubrie Spady blamed a “decades long war on coal” by Biden and former Democratic President Barack Obama.

Republican Sen. Tim Sheehy of Montana said the repeal of the land-management plan in his state was “putting an end to disastrous Biden-era regulations that put our resource economy on life support.”

Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska called the Biden-era plan for 13 million acres in the central Yukon region “a clear case of federal overreach that locks up Alaska’s lands, ignores Alaska Native voices ... and blocks access to critical energy, gravel & mineral resources.”

The GOP legislation “restores balance, strengthens U.S. energy & mineral security and upholds the law,” Sullivan said in a statement.

Democrats urged rejection of the repeals, arguing that Trump’s fossil fuel-friendly agenda is driving up energy prices because renewable sources are being sidelined even as the tech industry’s power demands soar for data centers and other projects.

“We are seeing dramatic increases in the price of energy for American consumers and businesses and the slashing of American jobs, so that Donald Trump can give an easy pass to the fossil fuel industry,” Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said Wednesday on the Senate floor.

Last week, the administration canceled almost $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states that Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris won in the 2024 election.

Ashley Nunes, public lands specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group, said Republicans were unleashing “a wholesale assault on America’s public lands.” Using the Congressional Review Act to erase land management plans “will sow chaos across the country and turn our most cherished places into playgrounds for coal barons and industry polluters,” she said.

The majority of data centres we are tracking that are under construction are being built in markets with regulated utilities.
Regulated utilities that provide data centres with certainty of power through grid access.
Existing power producers with spare capacity, including old coal plants set for retirement that suddenly have economic life left in them.","Visiting industry and finance customers in the US last week confirmed just how surging demand from hyperscalers is shaking up the US power industry, even beyond our initial take a year ago. WoodMac’s experts, Chris Seiple and Ben Hertz-Shargel, shared their latest thoughts.

How much power demand will data centres add?

Hyperscaler investment in data centres is accelerating rapidly. Spend for five of the biggest companies rose by a third in 2024 and is forecast to jump by 50% to over US$300 billion in 2025.

Our tracking shows US utilities have committed to add 116 GW of large loads to their networks, equivalent to approximately 20% of total US electricity demand in 2024. Vertical utilities are building all of the 16 GW under construction, while the rest is concentrated in two major power markets, PJM (the Mid-Atlantic region) and ERCOT (Texas). This is the tip of the iceberg, with an additional 32 GW that utilities are representing to investors as ‘high confidence’ of being built and a further 277 GW with an undisclosed commitment status.

Can the industry deliver sufficient supply to meet the demand?

That’s one of the big questions. There is plenty of political support, with the Trump administration determined that the US wins the battle with China for global AI leadership.

Ideally, large load customers want reliable, 24/7 low-carbon power. Renewables are the cheapest and most readily available resources, and variability can be mitigated when paired with energy storage. Nuclear and geothermal can contribute clean baseload power but are longer-term solutions.

The near-term focus, though, is on new-build gas-fired power plants to do the heavy lifting. The challenge here is a very tight supply chain, with gas turbines a critical bottleneck. GE Vernova has recently announced a 50% increase in turbine manufacturing capacity while Mitsubishi plans to double its capacity. But new orders still face at least a five-year wait for delivery.

Will power prices rise?

They’re already moving up. With supply chain constraints, including turbines, transformers and switchgear, demand growth looks certain to outstrip new supply in the next few years. There are also factors driving costs up that have nothing to do with data centres, including tariffs imposed on materials and components through the power value chain in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. We estimate the cost of new-build gas-fired plants has soared from US$1,400/kw four years ago to over US$2,400/kw today.

The wholesale power price in ERCOT, for example, needs to double to over US$100/MWh to incentivise the investment required for new-build combined-cycle gas turbine, even before any upside risk to Henry Hub gas prices is taken into account. The impact of rising wholesale prices on consumers will be compounded by higher transmission and distribution costs, including component inflation, as the network is strengthened to replace ageing components and for climate change-induced extreme weather. The price of pad mount single phase transformers, for example, has doubled since 2020.

How are power companies responding to higher demand?

It’s a challenge for a sector that’s just recently had a decade of no demand growth. The majority of data centres we are tracking that are under construction are being built in markets with regulated utilities. In the current power-scarce market, these one-stop shops that can build community support and provide power supply along with the grid connection are dominating new data centre capacity. Some data centre developers have pursued their own on-site generation to reduce their connection requests and speed time to power. This approach is still rare but will become more popular in the future and could include small nuclear and geothermal.

In the meantime, a bring-your-own-capacity movement has begun, calling for utilities to accelerate interconnection if the data centre company brings third-party generating capacity or demand-side resources, such as batteries and demand response. Google is promoting this model, alongside solution providers Cloverleaf Infrastructure, Voltus, Piclo and Camus Energy.

What are the risks to developers?

That they don’t recover the capital cost of their new capacity and are left with underused assets. The concern is that the current, bullish outlook for demand growth might prove a short-lived phenomenon if there’s a breakthrough on chip energy efficiency or less energy-intensive AI models or AI business models turn out to be not as profitable as anticipated. Utilities have started to insist on longer-duration contracts for large load buyers as a risk mitigation strategy. Contracts with large load buyers signed this year have typically been to supply power for 10 to 20 years, whereas in early 2024, few were longer than five years.

Will consumer bills increase?

Yes, and could become a political hot potato – “affordability” was the watchword among energy experts during New York Climate Week in September. A structural increase in wholesale prices will feed through into retail bills over time in deregulated retail markets and will come on top of record bill increases from the current heavy investment in strengthening the grid. State regulators approved US$29 billion in retail rate increases in H1 2025, more than double the same period in 2024.

The difficulty will be developing new utility cost recovery schemes that allocate exclusively to data centres the capital and operating costs that would normally be shared among all customers. One solution which many utilities are working on to protect retail customers’ bills are discrete tariffs for hyperscalers, which reflect the cost of dedicated generation and the associated transmission costs. While many utilities are moving in this direction, there’s a wide variety of approaches.

Who are the winners?

Regulated utilities that provide data centres with certainty of power through grid access. Existing power producers with spare capacity, including old coal plants set for retirement that suddenly have economic life left in them. And a large prize waits for the companies first able to develop cost effective solutions for off grid projects, which are currently proving too expensive and running into engineering challenges.","https://www.woodmac.com/siteassets/frontify_media_download/photography/environmental-social-and-governance/micro-esg/micro_esg_gettyimages-157366413.jpg?w=800&h=480&mode=crop&center=0.5,0.5",N,,2025-10-09 20:01:21.726764

The Biden-era restrictions also included a block on new mining leases in the nation's most productive coal-producing region, the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming. On Monday, the Trump administration held the biggest coal sale in that area in more than a decade, drawing a single bid of $186,000 for 167.5 million tons of coal, or about a tenth of a penny per ton.

Trump has largely cast aside Biden's goal to reduce climate-warming emissions from the burning of coal and other fossil fuels extracted from federal land. Instead, he and congressional Republicans have moved to open more taxpayer-owned land to fossil fuel development, hoping to create more jobs and revenue. The Republican administration also has pushed to develop critical minerals, including copper, cobalt, gold and zinc.

A decision on whether to accept the recent bid from the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. is pending, and the lease cannot be issued until the Montana land plan is altered. The dirt-cheap value reflects dampened industry interest in coal despite Trump's efforts. Many utilities have switched to cheaper natural gas or renewables such as wind and solar power.

Administration officials expressed disappointment that they did not receive “stronger participation” in the Montana sale. In a statement, Interior Department spokesperson Aubrie Spady blamed a “decades long war on coal” by Biden and former Democratic President Barack Obama.

Republican Sen. Tim Sheehy of Montana said the repeal of the land-management plan in his state was “putting an end to disastrous Biden-era regulations that put our resource economy on life support.”

Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska called the Biden-era plan for 13 million acres in the central Yukon region “a clear case of federal overreach that locks up Alaska’s lands, ignores Alaska Native voices ... and blocks access to critical energy, gravel & mineral resources.”

The GOP legislation “restores balance, strengthens U.S. energy & mineral security and upholds the law,” Sullivan said in a statement.

Democrats urged rejection of the repeals, arguing that Trump’s fossil fuel-friendly agenda is driving up energy prices because renewable sources are being sidelined even as the tech industry’s power demands soar for data centers and other projects.

“We are seeing dramatic increases in the price of energy for American consumers and businesses and the slashing of American jobs, so that Donald Trump can give an easy pass to the fossil fuel industry,” Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said Wednesday on the Senate floor.

Last week, the administration canceled almost $8 billion in grants for clean energy projects in 16 states that Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris won in the 2024 election.

Ashley Nunes, public lands specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group, said Republicans were unleashing “a wholesale assault on America’s public lands.” Using the Congressional Review Act to erase land management plans “will sow chaos across the country and turn our most cherished places into playgrounds for coal barons and industry polluters,” she said.

The Senate approved three resolutions this week that wipe out resource management plans enacted during the Biden administration in Alaska, Montana and North Dakota.
The resolutions came under the Congressional Review Act, which empowers Congress to nullify executive branch rules.
These plans had never before been considered rules, which is a requirement for eligibility under the Congressional Review Act.
“You see Congress potentially going down a path of micromanaging all the resource management plans in the country,” Hamby said.","Congress took the unprecedented step this week of repealing management plans for public lands in three states in an effort to expand access to fossil fuel mining and drilling.

Critics of the move warn it could inject a new level of uncertainty into management of these areas and open a wave of litigation over leasing for energy development, grazing and other uses.

The Senate approved three resolutions this week that wipe out resource management plans enacted during the Biden administration in Alaska, Montana and North Dakota. The resolutions came under the Congressional Review Act, which empowers Congress to nullify executive branch rules. Each resolution had previously passed the House of Representatives.

The Biden-era plans had ended coal leasing in the prolific Powder River Basin and limited access to oil and gas development across millions of acres of public lands compared to previous plans.

Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), who sponsored one of the resolutions, said in a Wednesday speech celebrating the vote that the Biden-era plan was enacted despite opposition from local communities and officials, and called it “an attack on Montana jobs” and “on Montana communities.”

Daines also rejected the notion that the resolution would cause chaos, arguing that it simply repealed the Biden administration’s latest amendment to the management plan while leaving the rest of the plan in place.

Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), a sponsor of the bill covering that state’s plan, said in a statement that the Bureau of Land Management had violated its obligation to balance multiple uses of the land by all but eliminating coal leasing.

Democrats voted against the measures, and conservation groups have said the repeal will threaten conservation gains made after years of painstaking work, including protections for caribou, Dall sheep and salmon in Alaska.

The Bureau of Land Management uses resource management plans to set parameters for how to balance multiple uses on public lands, including energy development, grazing, conservation and recreation. The plans are usually in place for years, and can take years to develop, incorporating input from numerous stakeholders, said Rachael Hamby, policy director at the Center for Western Priorities, a conservation group.

These plans had never before been considered rules, which is a requirement for eligibility under the Congressional Review Act. Now that lawmakers have taken this step, some legal experts have warned it could open up hundreds of plans for review.

Hamby warned that applying the Congressional Review Act would open what is normally a slow, deliberative process to the whims of Congress and partisan swings.

“You see Congress potentially going down a path of micromanaging all the resource management plans in the country,” Hamby said.

On Wednesday, lawmakers from Wyoming introduced a resolution to repeal a resource management plan for that state.

In a speech on the Senate floor, Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) warned that the resolutions could cast doubt on resource plans across the country. Because other existing management plans have not been submitted to Congress as rules, he said, it could now be possible to argue that all of the plans enacted since the Congressional Review Act was passed, in 1996, are technically not in effect.

“And if they never went into effect, then all of the leases, and permits and rights of way that flow from those plans may not be legally valid,” Heinrich said.

Because the Congressional Review Act prohibits agencies from adopting rules that are “substantially the same” as what has been repealed, it also injects uncertainty into how future management plans can be shaped, Hamby said.

A group of legal experts wrote to Congress last month warning that using the Congressional Review Act on the plans could open up an “endless cycle of litigation.”

The Western Energy Alliance, which represents oil and gas companies in Western states, praised the passage of the North Dakota resolution, which it said would have the most significant impact on its members. “The Senate resolution is a welcome step that will bring more certainty to energy development and other multiple uses on public lands managed by BLM,” said Melissa Simpson, the group’s president, in a written statement.

Aaron Johnson, the Western Energy Alliance’s vice president of public and legislative affairs, dismissed the concern that repealing the plans would cause legal chaos, saying it will simply revert them to the previous versions.

Hamby said the move could come back to harm some of the interests these resolutions were meant to support, by opening up any leases offered under the now-repealed plans to legal challenges.

“I would not be surprised if we see something like that soon,” Hamby said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2236770251-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 19:03:03.283151

The injection of investment will bolster construction of “more energy- and cost-efficient infrastructure” to meet surging electricity demand,” EEI said.
“As the economy electrifies and more electrons flow through the grid, capital expenditures will be distributed across a larger base, driving down costs for everyone,” it noted.
The report also suggests the industry’s capital allocation priorities have again shifted markedly toward power generation.
The approach reflects a comprehensive system upgrade required to accommodate both increased power flows and changing generation patterns.","America’s investor-owned electric companies are poised to deploy record-breaking investment to launch one of the most aggressive infrastructure modernization campaigns in industry history in a bid to confront unprecedented electricity demand growth and prepare for a fundamentally transformed energy landscape.

In total, over the next five years, the industry is poised to invest more than $1.1 trillion to enhance and expand the grid, according to the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), a trade group that represents all U.S. investor-owned electric companies. That represents an unprecedented accelerated investment pace. By comparison, industry deployed $1.3 trillion over the past 10 years, the research released on Oct. 7 says.

“EEI member companies are on pace to invest nearly $208 billion this year to make the energy grid smarter, stronger, more efficient, and more secure,” the analysis notes. The investment is a direct response to rising demand for energy. Last year, power generation in the U.S. jumped 3% to reach 4,304,038 GWh—marking the “largest annual jump in years,” it notes. By 2030, U.S. electricity generation could soar to more than 4,500,000 GWh and surpass 5,400,000 GWh by 2040, which would mark an average annual growth of 1.7%.

The injection of investment will bolster construction of “more energy- and cost-efficient infrastructure” to meet surging electricity demand,” EEI said. “As the economy electrifies and more electrons flow through the grid, capital expenditures will be distributed across a larger base, driving down costs for everyone,” it noted. EEI added that “these investments will ensure reliability and enable companies to provide electricity at the lowest-possible cost for customers.”

Investment Priorities May Be Shifting Back Toward Power Generation

The scale of planned system expansion also defies historical precedent. EEI suggests 91 GW of new generating capacity is currently under construction, and an additional 488 GW is planned or has been proposed for the next five years. “For comparison, the grid currently has approximately 1,250 GW of capacity,” the report notes. Combined, the 579-GW pipeline represents 46.3% of the nation’s existing grid capacity, and it potentially positions utilities to expand the power system by nearly half its current size within the next half-decade.

The report also suggests the industry’s capital allocation priorities have again shifted markedly toward power generation. While generation investments have represented a rising share of total capital expenditures for four consecutive years, the shift marks a definitive pivot from the previous decade’s emphasis on transmission and distribution modernization, as utilities confront the immediate need for new generating resources to meet exploding demand.

The data show generation spending has nearly doubled since 2020, rising from 24% to 30% of total capex, reflecting a decisive pivot to new power supply amid surging load growth from electrification, AI, and industrial expansion.

Distribution infrastructure, however, continues commanding the largest investment category within the projected $207.9 billion in functional capital expenditures for 2025, followed by transmission, generation, and gas-related infrastructure investments. The approach reflects a comprehensive system upgrade required to accommodate both increased power flows and changing generation patterns.

A Historic Infrastructure Pipeline Is Emerging

As a whole, total spending by investor-owned utilities is projected to reach $207.9 billion in 2025, up from $139.8 billion in 2020—a nearly 50% increase in five years. For now, distribution is set to remain the single largest spending category, accounting for about one-third ($66.5 billion) of this year’s total, while generation surges to 30% ($62.4 billion)—its highest share in more than a decade. Transmission, meanwhile, will make up roughly 18% ($37 billion), followed by gas-related infrastructure at 14% ($29 billion) and other investments at 6% ($12 billion).

EEI notes that while the gas-related infrastructure category covers natural gas delivery and pipeline infrastructure, it does not cover gas-fired electric generation. While gas infrastructure’s share has remained relatively stable over the past decade, total gas-related investment has grown by nearly 22% since 2020, likely to improve safety, resilience, and efficiency. But investment also likely supports the industry’s broader grid reliability goals, particularly given that many utilities rely on natural gas networks for winter peak supply and to balance intermittent renewable generation.

The historic surge in capital spending follows decades of incremental, maintenance-driven investment that plugged critical gaps without realigning the grid’s interconnected layers. As POWER reported in its detailed June 2025 feature (“Out of Sync: The Infrastructure Misalignment Undermining the U.S. Grid”), the U.S. power system has long relied on piecemeal upgrades—patching aging lines, retrofitting equipment, and adding local projects in isolation—while generation, transmission, and distribution evolved on disconnected timelines under fragmented regulation.

That reactive approach has left the grid misaligned. POWER found that without a coordinated, systemwide vision that synchronizes planning, permitting, and financing across all assets, investment—even if unprecedented—risks entrenching these structural mismatches rather than resolving them.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/eeiexenditures2015-2029.png,N,,2025-10-09 18:03:33.368217

The notices said EPA could no longer incur “further financial obligations” and “a number of EPA employees will be placed in a furlough status.”

How many EPA employees have been furloughed so far is not clear. The agency didn’t answer questions about the number of staffers being sent home or whether EPA had exhausted its available funds to stay open.

EPA spokesperson Brigit Hirsch said the agency was operating according to its shutdown or “lapse” plan. Under that plan, once carryover funds expire, EPA could furlough more than 13,000 employees until the shutdown ends.

Multiple EPA employees, who have been granted anonymity because they fear retaliation, said they’ve been told this is the first phase of furloughs at the agency. But details have been sparse, leaving employees in a new phase of limbo.

Since the shutdown began last week, EPA staffers have been reporting to work as usual. Exemption notices sent to many employees, potentially the entire staff, gave no timeline on when furloughs would start.

EPA’s largest union denounced staff being furloughed.

“Furloughing EPA employees is not just an attack on federal workers, but an attack on every American’s right to clean air, safe water, and uncontaminated soil,” said Justin Chen, president of American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, in a statement.

Chen added, “When the essential services that EPA workers provide stop, that means pollution monitoring, toxic cleanup, and other public health protections stall and communities suffer.”

The union leader also took issue with the White House questioning whether furloughed government workers would receive back pay once the funding lapse ends. EPA’s own guidance indicates they will be paid in accordance with a law President Donald Trump signed after the 2019 shutdown (see related story).

“Now President Trump is adding insult to injury by threatening to withhold guaranteed pay for furloughed employees, a move that is not only disgusting, but illegal,” Chen said.

EPA employees took note of the administration’s threats, including issuing a reduction in force, or RIF, during the shutdown. One agency staffer said they didn’t appreciate the president’s intent “to defy the law and deny us back pay or lay people off.”

“But I honestly think federal workers are so traumatized that the threats mostly just bounce off us at this point,” the EPA employee said.

DETROIT (Reuters) -Ford Motor is walking back a program that would have allowed dealers to offer a $7,500 tax credit on EV leases after the federal subsidy expired September 30, the company said on Thursday.

""Ford will not claim the EV tax credit but will maintain the competitive lease payments we have in the market today,"" a spokesperson said.

The decision follows a similar move from General Motors on Wednesday. While automakers including Hyundai and Stellantis have offered cash off incentives to bridge the gap for buyers, Ford and GM took a different approach.

The in-house lending arms at these two automakers planned to initiate the purchase of EVs in dealers’ inventory, and the companies would apply for the $7,500 credit on those cars and then roll that money into EV lease terms for customers.

For customers who want to purchase an electric vehicle, Ford Credit continues to offer 0 percent financing for 72 months and other incentives, a spokesperson said.

GM opted to kill the program after concerns were raised about it by Republican Senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio, a former car dealer who is active in auto policy, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters. It is unclear why Ford canceled its program.

Ford and GM developed their strategies after discussions with officials at the Internal Revenue Service, Reuters previously reported.

Some auto executives, including Ford CEO Jim Farley, have warned that EV sales will drop significantly in the absence of the credit. Other automotive leaders, such as the CEO of Hyundai Motor North America, have affirmed that the electric vehicle market is more resilient than that.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is losing $530 million in federal investment for electric vehicle factories in Illinois and Indiana.","On October 2nd, the Department of Energy announced that it cut 321 projects supporting American companies in advanced manufacturing, hydrogen production, grid reliability, and efficient industry, “saving” $7.56 billion - or $5.8 billion with a review of the actual data from USAspending. Unsurprisingly, Trump’s DOE targeted the cuts towards projects in districts held by Democrats - 4:1 by total dollar amount.

This week, it was revealed that the DOE is looking at another tranche of cuts - this time with Republican districts on the block. So what’s at stake here? The answer is $15.5 billion in federal government spending, another $13.3 billion in state matching funding, and an extraordinary amount of private investment that’s likely to get wiped out overnight.

We’ve pulled together the cancellations into a visualization that illustrates just how rough these cuts are going to be for nascent industries - and well established ones too. We took the reported list of awards, and pulled up their records (although as of this writing, the records from the first tranche of projects have already been expunged from USAspending).

The largest sets of cuts are from the offices of Clean Energy Demonstration ($4.44 billion) and Manufacturing Energy Supply Chain program ($4.03 billion). Clean Energy Demonstration is a program funded under the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), and has largely spurred major US industries to look for improvements in their manufacturing processes. Programs funded under the OCED included low emissions cement manufacture, clean steel, and advanced chemical manufacturing. The Manufacturing Energy Supply Chain program was spurred through the Inflation Reduction Act, and is largely geared towards improving the supply chain of critical minerals, battery production, and parts manufacturing for electric vehicles.

Also on the chopping block are key projects from the Grid Deployment Office ($3.29 billion), a BIL program meant to help both big utilities and state and local authorities buff up aging transmission systems through cutting edge technology improvements; and programs funded by the Office of Fossil Energy ($1.97 billion), the group in charge of the vaunted hydrogen hubs and carbon capture projects. Another $1.69 billion in cuts are being made to the office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, almost all of which are innovative projects by small and medium industries to make big steps forward in improving their own processes and reducing cost, or to state academic institutions for industrial research and development.

Some of the largest project cuts target electric vehicle manufacturers, battery producers, and critical minerals processing. General Motors in Michigan is losing $500 million in federal investment to spur new electric motor factories in Michigan, Kansas, and Kentucky. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is losing $530 million in federal investment for electric vehicle factories in Illinois and Indiana. Mercedes in South Carolina ($285 million), Volvo in North Carolina ($208 million), and even Harley Davidson in Pennsylvania ($89 million) are all being slashed.

But it’s not just electric vehicles. Batteries, used in cars, industries, houses, and consumer goods - as well as by utilities - are being cut with big losses for lithium processing in Nevada ($123 million), cathode production in Kentucky ($316 million), and graphite manufacturing in South Carolina ($150 million).

Some of the most innovative manufacturing processes are also being cut. A massive investment in clean steel is on the block in Louisiana (Vale, $283 million), a brand new advanced concrete production facility in Indiana (Heidelberg, $500 million), and a solar/storage facility that would have reduced the cost of gold mining in Nevada (Nevada Gold, $95 million) are now out the window as well.

These projects are critical not only to the communities and jobs that they serve, but are core to a robust supply chain to keep prices - and emissions - low for consumers and businesses. This kind of federal funding is the stuff that actually makes things work. Investments in our economy drive new industries, drive American innovation, and keep our economy competitive. Slashing these programs is a relatively small short-term gain for a huge long-term loss.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/files/styles/sierra_full_page_width/public/2025-10/screenshot-2025-10-09-at-4.17.19-pm.png.webp?itok=7d6j9pbT,N,,2025-10-09 19:03:37.910895

How to revive community solar growth A few factors could change the sector’s fortunes, however.","The future of community solar is dimming, hampered by federal attacks on clean energy and shifts in state markets.

Installations of the shared-solar approach took a nosedive in the first half of 2025, dropping by 36% from the same period last year, according to a new report by consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

Working in collaboration with the Coalition for Community Solar Access, an industry trade group, Wood Mackenzie forecasts that by the end of 2025, installations will fall by 29% from 2024’s record high of 1.7 gigawatts. According to the analysis, growth will likely contract by an average of about 12% annually through 2030.

“I’m dismayed by this report,” said John Farrell, co-director of the research and advocacy nonprofit Institute for Local Self-Reliance. ​“Of the places where we have policies [that drive community solar], it looks like things are slowing down.”

Why community solar is buckling despite its benefits

Community solar makes clean power accessible to those who can’t put solar panels on their roofs — be it because they rent, can’t afford them, or have other reasons. Households can subscribe to a share of an off-site array, which is typically 2 to 20 megawatts, per the report, to get credit for the power and save on their energy bills. Third-party developers usually build and own these installations — not utilities.

About 9.1 gigawatts of shared solar have been installed in the U.S. to date, according to the report’s authors. They expect community solar capacity to reach roughly 16 GWby 2030.

The megabill that Republicans passed in July is a major reason for the community solar market’s shake-up. The law set an early expiration date for a key tax credit worth 30% to 50% of the cost of a project. Developers once had until 2034 to claim it; now companies must either start construction by July 2026 and finish within four years or start producing power by the end of 2027.

Because of the law’s passage, Wood Mackenzie slashed its community solar figures through 2030 by about 8%, or 655 megawatts, from its prior forecast, said Caitlin Connelly, senior analyst at the firm and lead author of the report.

But factors at the state level are also contributing to the slowdown. In particular, New York and Maine are driving the steep decline.

Developers in New York, a mature market, are having trouble finding sites, paying higher permitting and land costs, and having to wait an average of nearly three years to get connected to the grid, making projects more expensive to develop, Connelly said.

Meanwhile, in Maine, two regulatory changes are at play. Last year saw record growth as developers sprinted to get projects done by the December phaseout of the state’s net metering program, leading to fewer in the pipeline now, Connelly noted. In June, legislators also passed a bill that retroactively overhauled compensation for community solar power and added fees for new and established projects. The industry has said these provisions will make the state a ​“pariah for investors.”

Some states, such as Virginia and New Mexico, also have caps on the size of their community solar programs that are limiting new developments, according to Connelly.

And more federal turbulence could be ahead.

The Trump administration is also trying to claw back funding that would’ve supported solar: the $7 billion Solar for All program and the $20 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, programs passed under the landmark Inflation Reduction Act.

“The impact of [losing] Solar for All is one that we are tracking closely,” Connelly said, as the move could stymie community solar in places where it’s just getting off the ground.

While this year is likely to be a rough one for community solar, Connelly sees growth returning in 2026 and 2027. This is in part due to rebounds in Massachusetts and New Jersey, both of which are transitioning into new iterations of existing programs.

Public advocate praises new net energy billing reform law that could save ratepayers money

Massachusetts will open up its Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target program, SMART3.0, to developers on October 15. And New Jersey recently eliminated a 150-megawatt annual cap and unlocked a whopping 3 gigawatts of community solar capacity.

But that growth is just a temporary reprieve. Over the longer term, the forecast shows community solar installations trending down.

How to revive community solar growth

A few factors could change the sector’s fortunes, however.

For one, if states were to start new community solar programs, as well as address interconnection bottlenecks, they could drive up to 1.3 gigawatts of additional capacity through 2030, according to the report. But ​“we don’t really see any new programs opening up, at least in the near term,” Connelly said. ​“Policymakers have made a lot of progress in some state markets over the last six months to a year, but the difficulty is getting that legislation over the finish line.”

In deep red Montana, for example, legislators approved a new community solar program, with 100 in favor and 50 opposed, underscoring the model’s growing appeal to Republicans. But Gov. Greg Gianforte (R) vetoed the bill, claiming that it could result in ​“unreasonable costs” being foisted on other energy customers.

Only 24 states plus Washington, D.C., have passed community solar legislation as of February, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, and Iowa are all considering shared-solar bills, said Jeff Cramer, president and CEO of the Coalition for Community Solar Access.

Other states could be tempted to authorize a flood of clean, cheap solar power. The grid is facing soaring demand from data centers, electric vehicles, buildings, and manufacturing, and distributed community solar is among the fastest options to deploy.

“If you want to build a new gas plant right now, you’re going to need five-plus years minimum to do it. You want to build a new utility-scale [solar or wind] facility — at least five years as well, and that’s pending the development of new transmission,” Cramer said.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/DSC_0370-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 18:03:18.495206

According to the company, the building is ""the first large-scale owner-occupied mass timber logistics facility in the United States"" and the project is aiming to achieve Living Future's Zero Carbon Certification.
Mallory says the company will track the performance of the building and implement successful features in other Amazon buildings.
The building joins others that Amazon has used mass timber to build, including its HQ2 buildings in Arlington, Virginia.","Amazon has completed a mass timber warehouse in Indiana, USA, which the company says will be used as a testbed for ""over 40 sustainability strategies"" to implement in existing and future buildings.

Located in Elkhart, the DII5 warehouse is primarily made of mass timber and was designed by design architect ZGF Architects with elements such as clerestory windows, circadian lighting, and EV charging stations as part of the company's goal of reaching net zero operations by 2024.

""By testing several sustainability initiatives under one roof, we're accelerating our progress toward achieving scalability and standardization of these initiatives across our building portfolio,"" Amazon vice president of global realty Daniel Mallory told Dezeen.

""At the same time, it serves as a 'test and learn' platform for Amazon and the broader industry to explore how buildings can become more adaptive, high-performing, and resilient in a changing climate. The lessons we learn here will guide the future design, construction, and operation of our spaces.""

According to the company, the building is ""the first large-scale owner-occupied mass timber logistics facility in the United States"" and the project is aiming to achieve Living Future's Zero Carbon Certification.

It encompasses one large delivery building surrounded by a site that includes elements such as permeable paving, ""lower carbon concrete"", high-efficiency outdoor lighting and a bio-rentention pond for stormwater management.

The building itself was made using Southern Yellow Pine CLT panels and glulam beams, as well as wood fibre insulation.

Its celestory windows, which line the delivery floor, ""bathe the interior in sunshine"", according to Amazon.

""From the moment you approach and enter Amazon's new delivery station you know you're somewhere special,"" said the company. ""This is indeed a new kind of delivery station.""

Mallory says the company will track the performance of the building and implement successful features in other Amazon buildings.

""We're tracking multiple metrics, including total embodied carbon reduction compared to conventional construction, operational energy efficiency, water conservation performance, impacts of biodiversity, etc,"" he said.

""We're also studying how the building performs in various weather conditions and monitoring construction and operational costs to assess the business case for scaling these approaches.""

The building joins others that Amazon has used mass timber to build, including its HQ2 buildings in Arlington, Virginia. The company notes several of its buildings have achieved Living Future's Zero Carbon Certification, including warehouses in Australia and one in the UK.

""While we view DII5 as a strategic investment in designing and implementing sustainability strategies in our future buildings design, it will also give us an opportunity to test which of these initiatives can be scaled across our existing buildings portfolio,"" said Mallory.

""If certain features don't perform as expected or cannot be implemented in certain existing facilities, that information will be valuable in refining our approach to our future sustainable building design.""

Some of the company's sustainability claims have received criticism in the past. Last year, the New York Times reported that despite claims it had reached its green energy goals, some groups raised concern over a reliance on renewable energy certificates, though Amazon disputed these criticisms.

Elsewhere in Indiana, concerns have been raised about the extensive energy usage of its AI processing facility. Some reports claim Amazon's greenhouse gas emissions rose by 6 per cent in 2024.

While the company recently completed phase one of its HQ2 project, the second phase of the project previously came under fire for its proposed, spiralled Helix building, which drew public comparisons to an ice-cream scoop and poop emoji. Construction on the second phase of the project is currently paused.

It also updated its logo earlier this year.

The Serentica investment represents a strategic move to expand this renewable energy portfolio and ensure long-term energy cost stability for the company's manufacturing operations.
MRF's renewable energy push follows similar moves by other major Indian tyre manufacturers.
JK Tyre has already achieved 53% renewable energy in its operations and targets 75% within five years.","India's leading tyre manufacturer MRF Limited has announced a strategic investment of ₹99 crores to acquire a 26% stake in Serentica Renewables India 26 Private Limited, marking the company's significant entry into renewable energy sector. This move represents MRF's commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and enhancing sustainable manufacturing practices as the automotive industry transitions toward cleaner energy solutions.

The Chennai-based tyre giant will invest ₹99 crores through cash consideration to acquire up to 26% equity stake in Serentica Renewables India 26 Private Limited, a company incorporated on May 5, 2025. The deal includes a power supply and consumption agreement for solar and wind power under the government's captive power policy, with completion expected by July 31, 2026.

Serentica Renewables India 26 Private Limited, headquartered in Gurugram, operates as a developer in build, own, operate, maintain and manage hydel, solar, wind, geothermal, energy storage and other alternate energy sources. Since the company was recently incorporated, it has not commenced commercial operations yet.

This renewable energy investment aligns with MRF's broader sustainability strategy as the company faces mounting pressure to reduce emissions across its 10 manufacturing facilities in India. The tyre manufacturer has already committed to achieving net-zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by FY2050, with an interim target of 25% reduction in emission intensity by FY2028.

Currently, renewable energy contributes 12% to MRF's overall electricity consumption through renewable power purchase agreements. The Serentica investment represents a strategic move to expand this renewable energy portfolio and ensure long-term energy cost stability for the company's manufacturing operations.

The captive power arrangement will provide MRF with direct access to clean energy under the group captive generation mechanism outlined in the Electricity Act, allowing the company to meet at least 51% of its power requirements from the jointly-owned renewable facility.

While carbon credits could provide additional revenue streams, MRF's investment appears driven by multiple strategic factors beyond carbon monetization. The primary motivation centres on energy security and cost management, as captive renewable power plants typically offer 20-25 years of predictable energy costs compared to volatile grid tariffs.

The investment also positions MRF to meet India's Renewable Purchase Obligations (RPOs) while supporting the country's net-zero emissions target by 2070. This regulatory compliance aspect has become increasingly important as environmental norms tighten across industrial sectors.

MRF's renewable energy push follows similar moves by other major Indian tyre manufacturers. Competitor JK Tyre became India's first tyre company to join the RE100 initiative, committing to 100% renewable electricity by 2050. JK Tyre has already achieved 53% renewable energy in its operations and targets 75% within five years.

Meanwhile, Bridgestone's Pune facility achieved carbon neutrality status through a combination of solar panels, biomass-based boilers and carbon offset credits.",https://acko-cms.ackoassets.com/MRF_87f6c15a81.webp,N,,2025-10-09 20:01:13.787662

As we seek to help lift people out of poverty by giving them access to better jobs, energy has become one of the critical levers for change.
We know that affordable and reliable electricity is key for firms seeking to scale operations more efficiently in the region.
In Senegal, the Energy Access and Scale-Up Project aims to bring electricity to 600 health clinics, 200 schools, 700 small and medium-sized enterprises, and 200,000 households.
This expansion is creating jobs through installation, maintenance, and electrification supply chains while improving productivity in education, health care, and small businesses.","Over the past 150 years, leaps in energy technology and availability around the world have made numerous jobs easier, faster, or even obsolete. Think of laundromats replacing laundresses, automation and robots taking the place of workers in assembly lines, and now artificial intelligence-assisted chatbots replacing customer service agents.

The same is true in Africa, but the shift is happening at a much slower pace. In a region where roughly 600 million people still lack access to electricity and many industries are being held back by unreliable or unaffordable electricity, access to energy holds the power to transform economies, increase incomes, and reshape the employment environment for the better.

That is good news for Africa, as the job landscape urgently needs to be disrupted. Across the region, informal and subsistence work still employs the majority of working-age Africans, leaving too many families vulnerable to poverty. Most earn a living through self-employment or micro-businesses, which offer limited scope for investment and growth. Only a small share of workers have access to formal, wage-paying jobs.

Many conditions are necessary for firms to grow and hire better skilled workers, from a conducive business environment to regulatory stability and access to large, attractive markets. But infrastructure, especially access to energy, is a strikingly important ingredient.

It’s no accident that the World Bank Group has made Mission 300, our initiative to provide electricity to 300 million people in Africa by 2030, so central to our work. As we seek to help lift people out of poverty by giving them access to better jobs, energy has become one of the critical levers for change.

We know that affordable and reliable electricity is key for firms seeking to scale operations more efficiently in the region. High electricity costs undermine the competitiveness of private sector firms, often forcing them to rely on manual processes instead of adopting high productivity technologies that require more energy. Unreliable power also remains a major challenge, with blackouts causing major disruptions to business activity and reducing employment rates by an estimated 5 to 14 percentage points.

Firms operating in sectors such as agribusiness, light manufacturing, mining, housing and construction, health care, and tourism could greatly boost productivity through more intensive energy use. (You can find deep dives into the job potential of each of these sectors in the October 2025 edition of Africa’s Pulse.) In health care, for instance, rapid advances in imaging and monitoring require reliable energy and skilled labor to use these technologies. Similarly, tourism depends heavily on modern amenities, including readily available phone charging, Wi-Fi access, and air conditioning. When it comes to temperature control, the largest projected economic impact from climate change on the region—even greater than flooding and droughts—is expected to come from heat stress on workers, making cooling systems essential for employers.

Given how critical energy access is to job creation in the region, the World Bank has committed to leveraging $30 billion in resources from our International Development Association (IDA) over the next five years in support of Mission 300. This represents roughly 20 percent of our current funding for the region.

This level of commitment is matched by governments themselves, who are driving reforms, setting bold targets, and creating the conditions needed to transform their energy sectors through National Energy Compacts. These compacts set ambitious, time-bound goals to expand energy infrastructure at competitive costs, harness the benefits of regional power integration, encourage greater private sector participation to unlock additional resources, and strengthen utilities.

In rural or remote settings, distributed renewable energy is filling critical infrastructure gaps by powering both households and small businesses. For example, in Sierra Leone, demand-driven mini-grids are proving that rural electrification can be commercially viable when linked directly to productive uses like milling, cold storage, and digital services.

On the grid side, we’re bringing electricity to schools, health centers, and other public services to help build a stronger, healthier, and more skilled future workforce. In Ethiopia, energy initiatives are creating jobs across sectors, providing sustainable incomes. One project has already connected more than 8 million people and over 19,000 schools, clinics, and government facilities across Ethiopia.

To date, Tanzania’s Rural Electrification Expansion Program has connected more than 16,000 rural businesses to the electricity grid, from food processing and fish farms to construction and mining, boosting their productivity and enabling growth. In Senegal, the Energy Access and Scale-Up Project aims to bring electricity to 600 health clinics, 200 schools, 700 small and medium-sized enterprises, and 200,000 households. This expansion is creating jobs through installation, maintenance, and electrification supply chains while improving productivity in education, health care, and small businesses.

These engagements reflect broader efforts across the region to transform the energy landscape, with a focus on practical solutions that do more than just turn on the lights—they also create jobs at scale.",https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/wbcollab/mission-300-africa-electricity-1140x500?qlt=90&hei=630&wid=1200&fit=hfit,N,,2025-10-09 17:02:25.182271

We told you so. For months, CleanTechnica has been chronicling the Republican war on offshore wind farms in the US. All of the threatened projects come under the umbrella of blue states with Democratic governors, which is not a shocker. Except, there is one exception, the massive 2.6-gigawatt Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Project. As CleanTechnica pointed out back April and several times since then (most recently on September 23), Virginia’s Republican Governor, Glenn Youngkin, is a big fan of CVOW and the project appears safe — for now, that is.

Virginia Is For (Offshore Wind) Lovers

Now that the general media is finally paying attention to the Glenn Youngkin connection, let’s take another look at CVOW. The offshore wind project has made regular appearances on the pages of CleanTechnica since the wind-friendly days of the Obama administration, which saw the Interior Department’s newly formed Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issue a series of leases for offshore wind development along the Atlantic coast including CVOW’s parcel of 112,799 acres off the coast of Virginia. BOEM issued the lease to the project developer, the leading US utility Dominion Energy, in 2013.

As with many other offshore wind projects, CVOW somehow managed to keep moving through the development pipeline on up to the last weeks of the first Trump administration. Dominion submitted construction plans to BOEM in December of 2020, which were ultimately approved in January 2024 during President Biden’s term in office.

CVOW & The Jones Act Connection

Despite the long years between 2013 and now, the timeline worked out in Dominion’s favor. Offshore turbine technology has improved over the past 12 years, and Dominion can now take advantage of the efficiencies provided by specialized offshore wind construction ships, too.

Special operations vessels (SOVs) were not available in the US during the early years of offshore wind development, due to a lack of ships compliant with a complex 1920s-era piece of US maritime law called the Jones Act, which is another thing that has been surfacing on the CleanTechnica radar.

Among other provisions, the Jones Act restricts foreign-built and owned ships from transporting goods and services from one US port of call to another. The main idea is to keep a lid on foreign interference with domestic shipping, especially in case of war breaking out.

Stakeholders in the offshore wind industry did manage to figure out some workarounds to set the wheels in motion, but a more effective solution would be for US shipyards to begin building the specialized SOVs (service operations vessels) needed to optimize the offshore workflow.

That finally began to happen in May of 2024, when the Louisiana ship builder Edison Chouest Offshore proudly introduced its new ECO Edison SOV (Service Operations Vessel), billed as the “first-ever American-built, owned, and crewed offshore wind service operations vessel.”

While Edison Chouest was celebrating, Dominion was also building a US-built, flagged, and crewed offshore wind ship, the Charybdis, at the Seatrium AmFELS shipyard in Brownsville, Texas. A key milestone occurred in April of 2024 when the ship reached the launch-into-water phase. In February of this year Dominion reported that Charybdis was 96% complete and undergoing sea trials in Texas. By late August the ship was on its way to Virginia, and by mid-September it was reportedly docked and ready for action at the Portsmouth Marine Terminal in Virginia, just in time to help speed completion of the CVOW project toward 2026, which is just around the corner.

Rocky Seas Ahead For US Offshore Wind Industry

As pointed out by Canary Media earlier today, Governor Youngkin is not the only Virginia Republican to champion the CVOW project. US Representative Jen Kiggans is also a fan, partly on account of the $500 million grid upgrade to be received by Naval Air Station Oceana.

So, much of the work already done and completion just months away, it looks like smooth sailing for the CVOW project — or not, as the case may be. Governor Youngkin is term-limited. Unless something extraordinary happens, the Democratic contender for the office, Abigail Spanberger is on track to prevail against the Republican candidate and current Lieutenant Governor, Winsome Earle-Sears on Election Day in November.

A Spanberger victory would put Virginia and CVOW squarely in the crosshairs of President Trump’s chopping block. Since the beginning of this year, the President has suspended new offshore lease activity, recalled permitted projects for additional review, and ordered construction to stop on projects already under way.

Without Youngkin’s support, CVOW will lose its special status. If Spanberger does win, though, perhaps she can take a page out of the book of New York Governor Kathy Hochul. When Trump stopped work on the Empire Wind project in New York state earlier this year, Governor Hochul reportedly negotiated a quid pro quo with Trump in person, and Empire was quickly back on track.

Spanberger better get her ducks in the water because it already looks like the Trump administration is already prepping for a Democrat to occupy the office of Virginia Governor after Election Day. At a conference in Italy last month, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum reportedly confirmed that his agency is reviewing five offshore wind projects already under construction, including the CVOW project.

In an interesting turn of events, Empire Wind is also on the list along with another New York project, Sunrise Wind. Governor Hochul may have to pull another card from her sleeve to keep both of those projects in motion.

Make America Lose Again

For the record, rounding Burgum’s hit list is Revolution Wind in Rhode Island and Vineyard Wind 1 in Massachusetts.

While all this is going on, the global offshore wind industry is already leveling up to the next phase of growth. Instead of relying on conventional monopile construction methods that apply to relatively shallow waters, the industry is gearing up for the widespread use of floating turbine platforms that can be tethered in deep water, opening up whole new areas for wind development.

Another offshore wind industry trend to keep an eye on is multi-use, in which offshore wind farms host floating solar arrays and wave energy converters. The aquaculture industry is also eyeballing opportunities to piggyback on offshore wind infrastructure, as well.

Too bad the US is missing out on all these new opportunities. What with the economy circling the drain and AI taking over the work that humans used to do, it sure would be nice to have more jobs for people available in construction, ship-building, manufacturing and the like.

The U.S. high-voltage transmission network is vast but aging. 70% of the U.S. transmission lines and transformers have been in service for more than 25 years, a legacy of the mid-20th-century grid buildout. Much of this infrastructure is now strained by new, bidirectional power flows and dynamic loads, unlike the one-way flows it was built for. Much of this infrastructure was originally designed for predictable, one-way power flows from centralized power plants to end users. Today, however, it faces an entirely new set of challenges. The grid must now accommodate dynamic, bidirectional flows from an increasing number of distributed energy resources (DERs), including rooftop solar, community energy projects, electric vehicles, and battery storage systems.

These changes are creating significant stress on a system designed for a different era. Transmission congestion, bottlenecks, and reliability concerns are becoming more common, with some regions experiencing severe delays in interconnecting new generation projects. According to U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) analysis, meeting near-term electricity demand and clean energy goals will require an estimated 60% increase in transmission capacity by 2030. Without major upgrades, the lack of adequate transmission infrastructure threatens to slow the clean energy transition and increase costs for consumers.

Similarly, ASCE’s 2025 Infrastructure Report Card gave the nation’s energy sector a D+, citing underinvestment and a growing mismatch between grid capability and needs. A surge in large-scale load growth, driven not only by industrial expansions but also by the rapid development of data centers, semiconductor fabrication plants, and hydrogen production facilities, has put tremendous pressure on transmission infrastructure. In short, the existing high-voltage (HV) network often lacks the capacity and modern controls needed to handle today’s explosive load growth without major upgrades.

Data centers: Gigawatt-scale loads

Data centers have become a new super-sized load on the grid. A single large data center can consume as much power as ~80,000 homes, and demand for such facilities is rising at a rate of roughly 10% per year.

In regions like Northern Virginia, the impact is dramatic. For example, the Virginia Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission recently reported that PJM’s forecast for the Dominion zone (Virginia) projects about 5.5% annual load growth through 2030, driven almost entirely by new data center load. Additionally, Northern Virginia’s “Data Center Alley” (located in Ashburn, VA) already hosts over 200 facilities and consumes roughly the same amount of electricity as the city of Boston.

AEP likewise projects that more than 13 GW of new data center load will come online by 2029, making these “AI-driven” centers the most significant component of its retail load growth. In short, individual data centers (or clusters) can impose loads comparable to those of mid-sized cities. This unprecedented growth, especially when situated in one region, far exceeds what the system was built to absorb without upgrades.

Interconnection queues and grid bottlenecks

Planners now face huge uncertainty on both ends of the system. On the generation side, nearly 2,600 GW of power and storage projects are stuck in U.S. interconnection queues, more than double the entire existing U.S. generation fleet. Most of these queued projects (solar, wind, batteries) face long study timelines and frequent withdrawals, underscoring a persistent bottleneck. Meanwhile, on the demand side, speculative “phantom” loads are flooding the queues. Data-center loads add another layer of uncertainty. In PJM, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has now recognized the “co-location” of data centers with generation (often gas plants co-owned by data center developers) as a novel issue requiring review. In 2025, FERC launched a proceeding noting that co-location entails “huge ramifications for grid reliability and consumer costs”. In practice, every speculative interconnection, whether a phantom data center or a stalled solar farm, ties up study resources and permits, slowing upgrades to both supply and network infrastructure.

This uncertainty has tangible consequences for reliability. In July 2024, a near-catastrophic incident in Virginia’s Data Center Alley illustrated the risk. A single surge protector failure on a 230 kV transmission line triggered dozens of data centers to disconnect and switch to backup generators. The sudden loss of load caused a significant voltage spike, forcing PJM and Dominion Energy to throttle their generation to avoid cascading outages. This event demonstrates that large loads can cause the system to trip. The traditional grid was built to handle predictable plant outages, not the abrupt, distributed shutdowns of gigawatt-scale data facilities. All this strain comes as new transmission capacity has lagged far behind the need. All this strain comes as new transmission capacity has lagged far behind need, and interconnection studies remain backlogged. Without reforms to streamline queues, coordinate load and supply planning, and invest in flexible grid infrastructure, the risks to grid stability and consumer affordability will only grow.

High-voltage GRID buildout trails need

Despite these stresses, new high-voltage transmission has barely kept up. According to the U.S. Department of Energy’s 2024 National Transmission Needs Study, approximately 5,000 miles of new high-capacity transmission must be added annually to support a high-renewables future. However, FERC data for 2024 shows that while over 5,000 circuit-miles of transmission were added, only around 22% of that total was at 230 kV or above, highlighting a continued focus on lower-voltage, local reliability upgrades rather than long-haul, high-voltage lines needed to connect remote renewable resources.

Even in Texas, one of the few regions aggressively expanding transmission, progress has been modest relative to demand. ERCOT recently approved its first 765 kV lines to accommodate extreme load growth in the Permian Basin and along the Gulf Coast. AEP Texas is currently constructing a 300-mile, 765 kV Solstice-to-Howard transmission line to move power from West Texas to San Antonio. Still, such examples remain the exception. Overall, the lack of high-voltage corridor expansion has left the grid vulnerable to overload from concentrated new loads (data centers, EV-charging parks, industrial complexes). Decades of deferred HV investment have created an under-built backbone just as demand is skyrocketing.

Planning reforms and solutions

DOE’s new Transmission Interconnection Roadmap explicitly calls for improving transparency and data in the queue process. For instance, “Solution 1.1” is to “improve the scope, accessibility, quality, and standardization of data on projects already in interconnection queues”, including project specifications, costs, and development status. Without such visibility, planners cannot distinguish firm projects from speculative ones. NERC has similarly emphasized that transmission planning must adapt to new loads. Its 2024 reliability assessment stresses the need to “expand the transmission network to deliver supplies from new resources and locations to serve changing loads”, specifically citing the influence of data centers (and EV/hydrogen) on future demand profiles.

Several policy ideas are on the table:

Robust regional planning – FERC’s Order 1000 requires multi-value, multi-region transmission planning. States and RTOs must coordinate long-term scenarios of both load growth, including big data centers and EV fleets, and clean generation. Enforcing these rules can identify the interregional corridors needed.

Cost-sharing across regions – New HV lines often cross states. Proposals include expanded cost-allocation mechanisms that allow benefits, such as reliability and access to renewables, to be shared among multiple beneficiaries.

Grid-enhancing technologies – Utilities are deploying GETs to boost capacity on existing lines. Examples include dynamic line ratings (adjusting limits in real time to weather conditions), STATCOMs/phase-shifting transformers (improving voltage control), and advanced conductor materials. These can increase throughput without the need to build new towers. Dominion Energy in Virginia has upgraded or reconductored over 800 miles of lines with advanced materials, boosting capacity by up to 50%. They are also piloting dynamic line ratings across Northern Virginia to accommodate fluctuating data center loads.

Stronger interconnection requirements – States are also beginning to push back on speculative DC builds. In Ohio, the Public Utilities Commission (PUCO) recently approved a new tariff under which large data center operators must pay for at least 85% of their contracted energy usage, regardless of actual consumption. Virginia has moved toward stricter interconnection studies and infrastructure upgrade requirements to prevent overload on local grids. Similarly, Texas has begun requiring larger deposits and staged commitments before interconnection approval, ensuring developers demonstrate financial seriousness. The goal is to make developers commit before clogging the queue.

Federal funding alignment – Infrastructure funds (IIJA, IRA) provide billions for transmission, but these should be targeted at the high-voltage backbone, not just local upgrades.

Bridging the gap

The U.S. faces an acute mismatch: soaring load growth from data centers, electrified transportation, and industrial decarbonization against an aging, underbuilt HV transmission network. The consequences are increasingly visible: higher market prices, strained reliability margins, and near-miss outage events. Solving this challenge will require a paradigm shift. Instead of reacting to load additions after they emerge, planners should forecast the emergence of gigawatt-scale data centers and electrified industrial clusters years in advance. High-voltage corridors at 345 kV, 500 kV, and 765 kV should be proactively planned and built well ahead of demand. The DOE’s annual 5,000-mile transmission target must become a baseline.

Simultaneously, utilities should maximize existing infrastructure by accelerating the deployment of GETs and reconductoring projects. Finally, transparency and data-sharing should become non-negotiable: developers and utilities should jointly provide project specifications, timelines, and load profiles so that system planners can properly prepare. Equally important, some of this information should be made publicly accessible, enabling communities, consumers, and local governments to understand emerging needs and champion solutions before crises occur. In most industries, sharing forward-looking developments with the public is standard practice. The power sector, financed largely by ratepayers, should also embrace this transparency if it hopes to foster lasting trust and build support for critical investments.

The U.S. grid is at a critical inflection point. Whether it evolves to meet the demands of the digital and decarbonized era will depend on bold action, sustained investment, and unprecedented collaboration across regulators, utilities, developers, and consumers.

This has led to widespread confusion without offering solutions to the energy affordability issues facing Maine families every day.

One favorite target for these false claims is offshore wind. The Gulf of Maine has some of the strongest and most consistent winds in the world, making it the most abundant and promising clean energy resource available to us.

In this blog, we won’t restate all the false claims being made by opponents of clean energy, but we will set the record straight on what you should know about offshore wind in Maine.

Offshore Wind Reduces Energy Prices Across New England

Offshore wind is expected to put downward pressure on wholesale market prices in New England, which will be passed through to Maine electricity customers. One way it does this is by replacing expensive oil-fueled power plants that are fired up during periods of high demand. A study released in September 2025 showed that offshore wind power would generate massive savings during high-demand periods, lowering New England electricity prices by 11% and delivering $400 million in wholesale market savings in just three winter months.

In fact, stalling progress on offshore wind will actually lead to higher electricity prices. For example, the State of Connecticut estimated that the Trump Administration’s plan to cancel Revolution Wind, which is already 80% completed, could cost electricity customers across New England, including Maine, $500 million per year in higher supply costs.

Offshore Wind Will Bring Enormous Economic Benefits to Maine

Responsibly developed offshore wind would be a big boost to Maine’s economy and local communities and aligns with Maine’s more than 400-year maritime and shipbuilding heritage.

An independent study released in 2025 showed that an offshore wind port in Maine would support more than 6,000 jobs during construction, an average of nearly 1,000 jobs annually through 2050, and deliver total economic benefits of $6.6 billion.

That’s why support for a new offshore wind industry spans from the Maine State Chamber of Commerce to Maine’s labor unions.

Offshore Wind Projects Can Be Sited to Avoid Conflict with Maine’s Fishing Industry

Everyone involved in advocating for offshore wind in the Gulf of Maine has made clear that understanding potential impacts to Maine’s fishing industry is essential, so any emerging impacts can be first avoided, then minimized or mitigated.

The best way to avoid impacts is by making sure turbines aren’t located in prime fishing grounds. That’s why NRCM and our partners worked to pass Maine’s 2023 offshore wind bill, which required that projects not be placed in federal Lobster Management Area 1 (LMA1), where nearly all of the Maine-based lobster fleet fish.

The provisions in the bill, plus bipartisan support from Maine’s Congressional delegation and the Mills Administration led to the federal government excluding LMA1 from commercial offshore wind leasing, a big step toward allowing both clean energy and a vibrant fishing industry to exist in the Gulf of Maine at the same time.

Offshore Wind Will Not Be Visible from the Mainland

Commercial offshore wind lease areas in the Gulf of Maine are more than 50 miles from the mainland at their nearest point, will not be visible from shore, and will have no impact on property values.

Offshore Wind Turbines Don’t Harm Whales

There is no scientific evidence linking offshore wind and whale deaths. In fact, the greatest risks whales face are vessel strikes, shifting food species due to climate change, and entanglement with fishing gear.

There is, however, clear evidence linking anti-offshore wind groups that frequently claim a connection between whale deaths and offshore wind to fossil fuel-funded think tanks.

The 2024 Federal Lease Sale was a Vote of Confidence in the Long-term Promise of Offshore Wind in the Gulf of Maine

In October 2024, four commercial floating offshore wind leases were sold in the Gulf of Maine. This exceeded expectations and served as a vote of confidence from developers in the long-term viability and promise of offshore wind in the Gulf of Maine, despite political uncertainty, as the lease sale took place days before the 2024 Presidential elections. The four leases make clear that industry is interested in investing in offshore wind if given the chance.

Fossil Fuel Power Generation Has Far Higher Emissions than Offshore Wind, Even Including Materials and Construction

Studies have shown that clean energy like solar and wind have substantially lower lifetime greenhouse gas emissions than other fossil fuels. Including materials, construction, fuel, and decommissioning, wind power (including offshore wind) emits 37 times less greenhouse gases per unit of power generated than natural gas, and 77 times less than coal.

All sources of energy have an impact. The question should be what sources have the lowest. The damaging impacts of our existing fossil fuel system on our health and climate are colossal compared to other clean energy sources that have much lower impacts.

Offshore Wind Can Be Responsibly Developed to Protect Wildlife

Climate change is the greatest threat facing the more than 3,000 marine species and birds in the Gulf of Maine. Replacing polluting fossil fuels with cleaner energy sources like wind is our best opportunity to protect wildlife.

Using the best data and scientific research available, offshore wind projects in the Gulf of Maine will be held to the highest standards for siting and operations to protect ocean wildlife and ecosystems. Developers will be required to include strong protections for wildlife and the ocean environment for both construction and operations.

It’s crucial that Mainers seek out information from trusted sources. Disinformation is easily spread via social media and should be treated skeptically. NRCM and our partner organizations will continue to educate our supporters and the public using the best information available from scientists and other experts.

We can’t keep relying on expensive fossil fuels to power our homes and businesses. Not only does it drive up electricity prices, it fuels climate change, which is making the storms and flooding harming our communities worse. Responsibly developing offshore wind will generate the large amounts of reliable domestic energy we need to power the future and help keep energy costs affordable.

Base Power, an Austin-based energy technology company, has secured $1 billion in Series C funding to accelerate the deployment of home battery systems across the United States. The round was led by Addition, with participation from leading investors including Trust Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, Thrive Capital, Lightspeed, Andreessen Horowitz, Altimeter, StepStone, Elad Gil, and several new backers such as Ribbit, CapitalG, Spark, BOND, Lowercarbon, Avenir, Glade Brook, Positive Sum, and 1789.

The company, co-founded and led by Zach Dell, is on a mission to modernise America’s ageing power grid through a decentralised network of smart batteries. These home-installed systems allow users to store energy, access backup power, and sell excess electricity back to the grid.

“The chance to reinvent our power system comes once in a generation,” said Dell. “The challenge ahead requires the best engineers and operators to solve it, and we’re scaling the team to make our abundant energy future a reality.”

This massive funding round positions Base Power as one of the most well-capitalised startups in the renewable energy and battery infrastructure space, signalling strong investor confidence in distributed energy solutions.

Base Power Funding Expands Domestic Energy Manufacturing

A major portion of the $1 billion raised will go toward domestic manufacturing and large-scale deployment of Base Power’s energy storage technology. The company is constructing its first energy storage and power electronics factory in downtown Austin, Texas, at the site of the former Austin American-Statesman printing press.

This facility will serve as the foundation for Base Power’s broader industrial expansion, with plans already in motion for a second U.S. manufacturing site.

“We’re building domestic manufacturing capacity for fixing the grid,” said Lopas, an executive at Base Power. “The only way to add capacity to the grid is by physically deploying hardware, and we need to make that here in the U.S., ourselves.”

Base Power’s model aligns with the broader reindustrialisation movement sweeping across the U.S., as companies bring high-tech manufacturing closer to home to strengthen supply chains and energy independence. The Austin plant represents a major step toward building a self-sustaining ecosystem for renewable energy hardware.

Base Power Funding Supports Grid Stability Through Distributed Storage

At the heart of Base Power’s model is its home battery leasing system, which offers affordable upfront and monthly costs to homeowners. Each installed battery provides backup power during outages and enables users to participate in local energy markets by selling excess electricity back to the grid.

By aggregating thousands of these batteries nationwide, Base Power creates a distributed energy network that can stabilise local grids, reduce peak demand, and prevent blackouts during extreme weather events.

The company recently qualified for Texas’s Aggregated Distributed Energy Resource (ADER) programme, which allows distributed batteries to sell electricity directly into the grid. This not only enhances grid reliability but also gives homeowners new revenue streams, creating an economic incentive to adopt clean energy technologies.

“The ADER qualification represents a breakthrough moment,” Dell added. “It’s proof that distributed energy can serve both households and the grid efficiently, sustainably, and profitably.”

How Base Power’s Funding Redefines Energy Distribution

Base Power’s $1 billion Series C comes amid a global push to decentralise energy production and build resilient grid systems capable of handling renewable integration. The company’s battery infrastructure effectively turns homes into micro power plants, creating a two-way energy flow between consumers and utilities.

This distributed model addresses a persistent challenge in the American energy system — the strain on ageing infrastructure. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, outages caused by grid instability have risen over the past decade due to increasing demand and severe weather events. Base Power’s technology offers a scalable path to reduce grid congestion and carbon emissions while empowering homeowners to control their own energy future.

By combining cutting-edge hardware with AI-driven energy management software, Base Power aims to optimise how electricity is stored, distributed, and consumed. This integrated approach represents a shift from centralised power generation to networked energy ecosystems, where communities collectively contribute to energy security.

Base Power’s Vision for a Reindustrialised and Renewable America

Beyond product innovation, Base Power’s strategy emphasises domestic manufacturing and workforce development. The company’s leadership views the construction of its Austin factory as part of a broader national effort to “reindustrialise America.” By revitalising high-tech production capacity within the country, it achieves its purpose.

Lopas explained that the company is not just producing batteries. It is building the infrastructure, systems, tools, and software needed to reinvent the U.S. energy grid from the ground up.

This holistic approach mirrors a growing consensus among policymakers and investors. One where renewable energy transformation requires physical deployment at scale, not just software innovation.

As Base Power expands production, it plans to collaborate with local governments, energy regulators, and technology partners. It seeks to ensure its distributed energy systems integrate seamlessly with regional utilities.

If successful, Base Power could become a cornerstone of America’s clean energy transition. This feat will demonstrate how venture-backed manufacturing and distributed storage can deliver tangible progress.

A New Era for Energy and Infrastructure

Base Power’s $1 billion funding round is not only a milestone for the company but also a sign of renewed confidence in hard-tech innovation and energy infrastructure startups. With leading venture firms betting on its mission, Base Power is positioned to shape the future of how electricity is produced, stored, and shared across the country.

The company’s upcoming Austin factory, growing team, and expanding grid partnerships all underscore its commitment to building a more resilient, decentralised, and sustainable power system for generations to come.",https://ventureburn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Create-a-futuristic-neon-lit-poster-for-an-artic…-20.png,N,,2025-10-09 18:04:06.764602

In a stunning policy reversal, the Conservative Party announced that, if elected, it will repeal net-zero climate policies—like the Climate Change Act 2008—to help lower energy bills. Shadow Energy Minister Claire Coutinho echoed her party’s embrace of energy abundance, promising it’ll lower bills by 20%. She added, “We will put cheap, reliable, abundant energy first. And we will do that unashamedly.”

Former Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined the chorus and now appears to regret going “far too fast” on net-zero—a policy he previously supported. Even former Labour PM Tony Blair conceded net-zero is “doomed to fail,” writing on his organization’s website back in spring:

Despite the past 15 years seeing an explosion in renewable energy and despite electric vehicles becoming the fastest-growing sector of the vehicle market, with China leading the way in both, production of fossil fuels and demand for them has risen, not fallen, and is set to rise further up to 2030.

Despite the current Labour Net-Zero Secretary, Ed Miliband, suggesting energy bills will decrease by £300 ($401 U.S. dollars) by 2030, energy bills have significantly spiked in the United Kingdom. In fact, residents of Great Britain pay the highest electricity prices of any developed country today. Residents blame Miliband’s net-zero agenda–especially green levies on subsidies for carbon capture technology and wind farms—for their nation’s current energy crisis.

Between 2019 and 2024, industrial UK electricity prices soared by 124%—four times greater than the U.S., which had a 21% increase, across the same period. The Telegraph also noted, “Britain is also the second-most expensive country in the world for household electricity, with billpayers paying twice as much as those in the U.S.”

It was also reported that household U.K. energy bills will increase by £100 ($134.02 U.S.) by April 2026. As of October 2025, the average British household pays £1,754 ($2,341.04 U.S.) annually—or £146 ($195.68 U.S.) monthly—for electricity and gas.

There is no transition to 100% renewables occurring in any developed nation—including Great Britain.

Various tools measuring Great Britain’s energy mix show fossil fuels still dominating. One chart shows at least 50% combined from natural gas, coal, and oil, while another shows natural gas being the top electricity-generating source at 40%.

As we’ve learned in the U.S., net-zero isn’t an economically or environmentally sustainable policy. It’ll cost $215 trillion to globally transition to a 100% renewables economy by 2400 at the earliest. And at what cost? Only to lower global emissions by 0.2 °C–not 1.5 °C—by 2100.

It’s encouraging to see our allies adopting an energy abundance posture.

Discussions covered energy governance, circular economy development, and the move away from coal, while SEI also welcomed new partners to the project.

SEI’s Executive Director, Måns Nilsson, joined a panel on Bosnia and Herzegovina’s (BiH) power sector, drawing on Sweden’s experience with carbon taxation. He explained that Sweden’s carbon tax in the 1990s was not a standalone climate measure, but part of a broader tax reform.

“The key was to design something simple and easy to implement, with exemptions that could be gradually phased out. Far from being a burden, this approach actually helped industry adapt – rapidly reducing fossil fuel use and accelerating the shift toward renewables,” Nilsson said.

SEI insights on recycling and just transition

SEI contributed lessons from research and practice to discussions on recycling and just transition. SEI Senior Expert Tomas Thernström spoke on waste management and circular economy, stressing that recycling must be simple if it is to succeed – though achieving simplicity often requires significant investment.

“Successful recycling cannot rest on the shoulders of a single actor: municipalities, state institutions, producer responsibility organizations, utility companies and property owners need to work together, as they all share responsibility in making recycling accessible and appealing,” Thernström underscored.

At a separate panel on achieving a just transition in coal regions, SEI Team Leader and BiH SuTra Project Manager Saša Solujić highlighted a broader perspective that goes beyond mine closures and decarbonization to include water management, agriculture, nature protection and biodiversity. Agriculture, in particular, emerged as a dynamic area, opening new opportunities and bringing people together.

Solujić stressed the importance of open dialogue with local communities to ensure people can express their concerns, hopes and ideas.

“If we include all relevant actors – especially young people – while keeping long-term community needs in focus, [this] fosters stronger support and deeper understanding of transition as an inclusive, collective process,” she noted.

Both panels demonstrated that cross-sectoral cooperation, local engagement, knowledge exchange and international support are vital for a fair and sustainable transition.

As more local partners are joining the BiH SuTra project, change is increasingly happening with the communities, not just to them. Many mayors and local representatives shared how BiH SuTra helped open their eyes to new opportunities, foster collaboration and demonstrate that “going green” does not mean losing jobs or lowering living standards.

“Breza is a mining community and closing the mine has been resented among the people, until BiH SuTra came and started the transition process. Thanks to the engagement with citizens, they now understand better that transition and sustainability mean a better future at all levels of the local life, and not necessarily that standards of life would be reduced and jobs lost. Only this is a key result,” said Vedad Jusić, Mayor of Breza Municipality.

“If there is any community interested in this type of project it is Kakanj, being one of the most polluted communities in BiH. We are in favour of the overall approach and very interested in finding new ways and new solutions, and we look forward to have our partners support us,” commented Mirnes Bajtarević, Mayor of Kakanj Municipality, one of three local self-government units to sign a memorandum of understanding with SEI at the event, along with Gacko Municipality and the City of Gradiška.

Iowa biofuels and corn experts are congratulating Nebraska for its first shipments of carbon dioxide on the Tallgrass Trailblazer pipeline, but say the development means Iowa is no longer king at turning corn into ethanol.

Monte Shaw, the executive director of Iowa Renewable Fuels Association and an advocate of CO2 pipelines, said now that Nebraska has a functioning one, ethanol plants in that state can take advantage of lucrative tax credits from the federal government and sell into the ultra-low carbon ethanol market.

“Iowa has worn the crown,” Shaw said at a news conference Wednesday, Oct. 8. “We have been the world’s best place to turn corn into ethanol, and we’ve held that crown for 25 years. Last week, we got knocked off.”

Tallgrass’ Trailblazer pipeline, which is slated to stretch several hundred miles and transport CO2 from ethanol plants in Nebraska, Colorado and Wyoming to an underground storage site in Wyoming, had its first CO2 shipment Oct. 3.

Ames-based Summit Carbon Solutions plans a similar pipeline for Iowa and surrounding states, but it has encountered significant opposition, including a continued push in Iowa to outlaw use of eminent domain to obtain land-use rights from reluctant property owners,

The Trailblazer pipeline formerly carried natural gas, but the company was able to convert the pipeline to instead carry liquified carbon dioxide to the Wyoming sequestration site.

By sequestering the carbon dioxide created in the process of turning corn into ethanol, the plants are able to lower the effective greenhouse gas emissions of the fuel below a certain level, set by the U.S. Department of Energy, that makes the fuel eligible for a per-gallon tax credit.

These credits, known as 45z, were initiated under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. While the IRA was mostly dismantled by the Trump administration, 45z credits were extended under the Republican-led One Big Beautiful Bill tax-cut law.

Shaw said the credits can add about 66 cents per gallon for producers of ethanol, which is a lot for an industry that “usually tries to make a penny or two.”

CO2 pipelines key to strong Iowa economy, renewable fuels director says

According to the IRFA, Iowa produces about 4.7 billion gallons of ethanol annually. Shaw said if each of those gallons could take advantage of the credits and add 66 cents per gallon, it would equate to more than $3 billion in added value to the industry annually.

“If Iowa wants to maintain low taxes, if we want to do further property tax reform and things of that nature, then the state needs a strong ag economy,” Shaw said. “Ethanol producers need access to the tools in this state to remain competitive with the plants around us that are moving forward.”

Steve Kuiper, vice president of Iowa Corn Growers Association, said the boost to Iowa ethanol would directly impact corn farmers by increasing demand and potential price for corn, but would also “trickle down” to the state’s economy.

Farmers have faced several years in a row of high interest rates, high input costs, and low market prices for their crops. Trade wars between the U.S. and the countries where it sells ag commodities and purchases inputs also have added stress to farmers. According to a September survey from the National Corn Growers Association, nearly 50% of U.S. farmers believe the nation is on the brink of a farm crisis.

“The Iowa agriculture economy is in tough shape,” Kuiper said. “Farmers are farming at a loss. Lenders are very, very anxious right now.”

Dave Miller, the chief economist with Decision Innovation Solutions, said that as corn yields continue to grow, farmers need a market that accounts for an extra 150 million bushels a year through 2050.

Miller said the low-carbon ethanol market facilitated by carbon sequestration could create the potential for an additional 12 million gallons of ethanol, which he said could be fulfilled by the current farming yield increases.

“The Nebraska plants that are on the pipeline, that door has now been opened,” Miller said. “So there’s a real competitive advantage that’s going to open up for Nebraska farmers compared to Iowa farmers.”

Seth Harder, CEO of two ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa, said he has seen the things in the industry that Iowa does “really great” but he also sees that the states he operates in are on the edge of a “paradigm shift.”

“As Nebraska sees this influx of funds, we hear plants are talking about not only expanding, but doubling,” Harder said.

He said the demand for ethanol appears to be on the rise with the recent decision from California allowing the sale of a higher blend of ethanol fuel, E-15, and the prospect of more states joining in on the trend.

Will the center of ethanol production shift to Nebraska?

Shaw said he believes Iowa is on the cusp of a “fairly substantial farm crisis.”

“Nothing will solve this problem until we grow demand or reduce production, and reducing production would be devastating to the economy of Iowa in the Midwest,” he said.

Carbon sequestration projects have faced challenges in Iowa, largely because of landowner opposition to CO2 pipeline projects, including the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline. Debate on the topic caused splits among GOP lawmakers during the legislative session and has continued to be a divisive issue in the party.

The Trailblazer pipeline had fewer roadblocks than those that have popped up in Iowa. This is in part because Nebraska does not require state approval for CO2 pipelines, and because much of the pipeline was already built as the natural gas line.

Landowners and environmental groups, including the Sierra Club Iowa Chapter, that are opposed to CO2 sequestration pipelines call the Summit project a “boondoggle.” Opponents worry about property values and the safety of carbon sequestration pipelines. They also have said sequestering carbon should not qualify as a public use, which a project must have in order to use eminent domain.

Shaw said it doesn’t matter what someone thinks about carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and why it should or shouldn’t be sequestered, because for renewable fuel members, this is a “business decision.”

The Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline is the most well-known carbon sequestration project in Iowa, but Shaw said there are other companies and facilities looking for places in Iowa to sequester carbon, or to otherwise build carbon sequestration pipelines.

On the nearest horizon, Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy, or SIRE, located near Council Bluffs, is slated to connect to the Trailblazer pipeline and potentially begin sequestering carbon at the plant in late 2026.

The Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline cannot begin construction in Iowa until it secures permits for storage in North Dakota and for passage through South Dakota, which has become challenging due to the enactment of a restrictive vlaw in South Dakota.

The company filed to change its permit with the Iowa Utilities Commission to remove the Dakota-specific language, in the event it is able to secure a “​​better solution” for storage and passage.

Shaw said the “economic consequences” of the development in Nebraska could be a “bump in the road” for Iowa if the state adapts and brings its own carbon sequestration practices online, or it could lead to “production and demand flow from places like Iowa to places like Nebraska.”

“We’re asking the Iowa Legislature to support President Trump’s energy leadership and to help avert what I personally feel is a pending farm crisis, and to help put Iowa’s economy back on stable ground,” Shaw said.","https://www.desmoinesregister.com/gcdn/presto/2021/03/31/PDEM/4d1b40d5-12b0-4bdc-b142-87fabd7896e5-0331-Renewable-Fuel-008.JPG?crop=2999,1687,x0,y0&width=2999&height=1687&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-09 17:03:07.076704

Either the effects of our pollution treatments were overwhelmed by high water temperatures driven by climate change or worse, climate change killed our whole experiment.
I am not drinking some liberal pro-environment ivory tower Kool-aid about climate change.","President Trump has said numerous times that climate change is a “hoax” and a “con job,” telling the United Nations last month that it was made up by “stupid people” despite a majority of credible scientists agreeing that it is real and causing massive issues in our world today.

Many climate change deniers claim that scientists only study climate change for grant dollars, yet many of us never intended to study it in the first place. When scientists like myself work in the real world, out in the elements, we cannot avoid climate change’s broad and deep reach.

I never wanted to study climate change. For 15 years I studied the effects of different kinds of pollution, from pesticides to personal care products to industrial fertilizers. I documented quantitative evidence that man-made pollutants could do bad things to sea life, and by proxy ourselves. My early work was also in a lab, far away from the realities and complexities of our natural environment. Nowhere in these studies was there a consideration for climate change.

It wasn’t until I started working on coral reefs in 2005 that I began to see, at an objectively scientific level, that climate change was always the primary driving force behind patterns in our data, even if we didn’t mean to study it. Without intention, then, my research, and the research of hundreds of other scientists, has found that the real issue is globally increasing temperatures driven by a less tangible pollutant. In truth, “climate change” is just a poorly marketed term for pollution of another variety — the carbon kind.

For two decades now, my devoted team and I have conducted short-term (hours to days) and long-term (months to years) experiments on the effects of pollution on the reefs of Hawaii, Florida, Australia and the South Pacific. Some of these experiments have run more than seven years.

We found that in many cases, pollution like fertilizer runoff can cause disease and death of corals, the animals that build the foundation of tropical reefs. And yet every result we have collected, in every one of these well intentioned and carefully designed experiments, was waylaid by the increasingly frequent and severe heat waves that have arisen in the last decades. Either the effects of our pollution treatments were overwhelmed by high water temperatures driven by climate change or worse, climate change killed our whole experiment.

There have been 11 recorded major coral bleaching events associated with marine heatwaves, or periods of time where sea surface temperatures are dramatically elevated compared to their typical seasonal means. Bleaching, when corals lose their primary symbionts and their critically provided food, can be followed by mass mortality events, or these heatwaves can cause direct immediate death where corals are literally cooked onsite due to dramatically high water temperatures outside coral’s normal tolerance.

I used to work on Florida Keys reefs, but our research there has been stalled indefinitely because there simply aren’t enough animals to work with since three back-to-back heatwaves that caused mass die off events, killing thousands of the already depleted wild corals and about 80 percent of the corals being raised for restoration.

Out of necessity, most of my research moved from Florida to the French South Pacific. But even there — almost 4,000 miles from the nearest continental coast — we can’t escape the heat. We have recorded four heat waves in the last 10 years that together have transformed these normally bountiful reefs from habitats where there was once 60 percent of the seafloor covered with healthy corals to barren plains with less than 1 percent live coral.

These numbers aren’t fictional “con jobs” — they are scientific facts you can see with your own eyes. These reefs are graveyards devoid of most life except algae. The situation is so dire that the French and local government has placed a ban on coral collections in these areas, even for restoration or scientific purposes.

It’s hard to do experiments on pollution when each reef you investigate is completely dead.

Sewage and other forms of pollution such as plastic waste are optically clear issues, visually and sometimes viscerally tangible. Images of clogged and slimy green waterways are easy for the public to connect with because they personally experience it themselves. But carbon pollution from carbon dioxide and methane emissions are invisible, abstract and notoriously controversial.

I am not drinking some liberal pro-environment ivory tower Kool-aid about climate change. Rather, my own experiments, which were never focused on climate change, told me repeatedly that the Earth’s biggest pollution problem is increased temperatures.

There is a concerted effort by the Trump administration to curtail, censor and even eliminate funding for climate change and environmental science research. Scientists need to remain steadfast and continue to conduct objective experiments, collect long-term data on climate effects and how they interact with other local factors, and write manuscripts that describe their results no matter if they disagree with this aministration’s false doctrine.

Scientists don’t necessarily want to be political. But when the facts we collect and repeatedly confirm are disregarded as a “con,” we have to set the facts straight.

CASTLE ROCK, CO, UNITED STATES, October 8, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Solar Side Up, a leading provider of solar energy solutions, is encouraging Castle Rock homeowners to consider installing solar systems before the federal solar tax credit expires at the end of 2025. The Residential Clean Energy Credit currently offers a 30% tax credit on the total cost of solar installations, but residential projects will no longer be eligible for this incentive starting January 1, 2026. This makes 2025 the final opportunity for homeowners to secure significant federal savings.

Colorado also provides a sales tax exemption on solar equipment, lowering the upfront investment, as well as a property tax exemption so that adding solar panels does not increase a home’s assessed value. Additionally, net metering programs enable homeowners to receive credit for excess electricity generated by their system, potentially reducing monthly energy bills.

The average cost of a 5 kW solar installation in Castle Rock is approximately $12,460 after applying the federal tax credit. This size system can save homeowners around $16,605 over 20 years, with an estimated payback period of about nine years. Installing solar in 2025 ensures that homeowners can capture all available incentives while reducing long-term energy costs and increasing property value. Solar Side Up works with residents to navigate the installation process, maximize available savings, and transition to clean, renewable energy with confidence.

Rising electricity rates in Colorado have made solar energy an increasingly attractive option for homeowners seeking to control energy costs. By producing their own electricity, residents can reduce reliance on traditional utilities and protect themselves against future rate increases. Solar energy also contributes to environmental sustainability, reducing carbon emissions and supporting the state’s renewable energy goals.

In addition to financial and environmental benefits, solar installations in Castle Rock can enhance property appeal. Homes equipped with solar systems are often more attractive to prospective buyers, adding to resale value and marketability. With a growing number of environmentally conscious homebuyers, solar energy is becoming a sought-after feature in Castle Rock and surrounding communities.

Acting before the end of 2025 allows homeowners to fully take advantage of current federal and state incentives while positioning themselves for long-term energy savings. Solar Side Up provides a full range of services, from system design and permitting to installation and ongoing support, helping residents transition to solar efficiently and with confidence.

This expansion further strengthens the transportation infrastructure and takeaway capacity out of the Uinta Basin and unlocks greater market access for FourPoint to meet the growing demand for this high-quality American crude.

The terminal expansion will feature a newly constructed continuous loop track to streamline rail logistics and a railcar load rack capable of loading 140,000 barrels of oil per day. Terminal enhancements will also include nine new rail loading arms, four additional truck offload lanes, and upgraded pump capacity to accelerate and improve truck offloading operations. The project will also add a new heated storage tank with approximately 140,000 barrels of shell capacity and two additional 6,000-foot storage unit tracks, significantly improving storage capacity at the terminal. ""With the expansion expected to be complete by the fourth quarter of 2026, subject to receipt of necessary third party and government approvals, FourPoint will secure capacity totaling 50,000 barrels of oil per day at the Price River Terminal,"" said Tripp Kerr, Vice President of Marketing at FourPoint. ""Energy Transfer is an exceptional midstream company and their commitment to this project and reliable flow assurance will be critical to our growth strategy in the basin.""

This expansion comes alongside the official launch and rebranding of the crude previously known as Uinta Wax or Yellow Wax. Going forward, FourPoint will market the crude as American Premium Uinta (APU) — a name that reflects the quality of this unique resource with one of the highest paraffinic contents among crude oil produced in the United States. APU is a premium, light grade, paraffinic crude oil with low impurities like sulfur and metals, making it a cleaner, more efficient feedstock for refiners. Its unique refining characteristics allow it to be processed more cost-effectively than many other crudes, while also producing high-grade base oil products for lubricants. ""We're focused on developing a robust and consistent production base in the Uinta Basin coupled with supporting logistics that enable us to move significant, reliable volumes of American Premium Uinta to both traditional markets in Salt Lake City and new markets beyond the basin,"" said George Solich, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of FourPoint. ""As volatility continues to disrupt foreign crude imports, APU offers American refineries a premium, domestic alternative. This terminal expansion strengthens our ability to deliver that product consistently and at scale – supporting energy independence and fueling the production of American-made goods with American crude.""

As the energy landscape continues to shift, the Uinta Basin has emerged as one of the few regions in the Lower 48 positioned for meaningful production growth. Unlike other major U.S. basins facing declining output, the Uinta Basin is a uniquely resource-rich region with a long runway of remaining tier-one drilling locations. Eric Eichler, Chief Operating Officer of FourPoint said, ""The Uinta Basin offers exceptional development potential, with strong well performance, multiple stacked horizontal targets, and competitive well costs – characteristics comparable to what we see in the Permian. With a deep, high-quality inventory base and expansion into new markets, the Uinta is primed for meaningful production growth."" The basin also holds significant potential for natural gas development, further enhancing its role as a strategic contributor to America's energy future.

This agreement between FourPoint and Energy Transfer represents a major strategic step forward in building the infrastructure needed to meet the increasing demand and emerging market opportunities for American Premium Uinta. By expanding terminal capacity and optimizing logistics across the supply chain, both companies are better positioned to serve refiners across the country and support the next phase of growth in the Uinta Basin.

Governor Gavin Newsom and Senator Alex Padilla condemned the decision, warning that it jeopardizes more than 220,000 projected clean energy jobs across the state. Read the full analysis at California Energy Transition and the official statement at Padilla Press Release. For sheet metal contractors, these hubs represented a pipeline of high-value, long-term work — now vanished overnight.

Union Reaction: “Dysfunction in Washington”

SMART General President Michael Coleman issued a stark warning in response to the cuts: “This week, Washington politicians chose political games over working people, cancelling good, high-paying American jobs. ... These cancellations undermine America’s energy and national security. Working people should not pay the price for dysfunction in Washington. Our industries and our nation cannot operate under this kind of chaos.”

Coleman’s words echo frustrations from the first wave of cancellations earlier this year, when sheet metal jobs tied to steel, semiconductor, and data center projects evaporated almost overnight. In the original Megaproject Meltdown story, we chronicled the effect of policy volatility on local unions, contractors, and the broader HVAC supply chain. This latest reversal only deepens the uncertainty — especially for workers who were counting on hydrogen infrastructure as a next-generation growth engine.

A Broader Pattern: Megaprojects in Retreat

These are not isolated incidents. Of the seven hydrogen hubs originally selected for federal funding, at least five now face full termination, with over $20 billion in clean energy awards on the chopping block across the country. See more at Hydrogen Insight. In total, more than 138,000 construction jobs — many under project labor agreements — were at stake with these hydrogen hubs alone. State and union leaders are calling for immediate congressional action to restore funding and stabilize policy, before more capacity is shuttered and workforce investments are lost. Full coverage at Washington State Standard and FuelCellsWorks.

States have responded with their own policy moves to protect advanced manufacturing jobs and clean energy investment, as covered in States Race to Protect EV Manufacturing as Political Winds Shift.

What’s Next for the Sheet Metal Industry?

For SMART members and contractors, the message is clear: volatile federal policy is now the number one threat to future megaproject work. Where once the American boom in clean tech and advanced manufacturing drove record demand for sheet metal, HVAC, and ductwork, the new reality is one of delays, layoffs, and uncertainty. The industry is again urging Congress and the administration to restore key tax credits and federal support for the projects that underpin America’s industrial future.

As the dust settles on this latest round of cancellations, one thing is certain: the fate of American megaprojects — and the union jobs they support — will hinge on what happens in Washington in the months ahead.",https://www.achrnews.com/ext/resources/2025/04-April/SMART-Rally-2-4-10-25.jpg?height=635&t=1760031464&width=1200,N,,2025-10-09 15:03:30.340507

Let's more uh let's dive more into this business with Base Power co-founder and CEO Zachary Dell. Uh Zachary, good to see you here. Uh congrats on your news this week. Very interesting business. For those not familiar with it, take us through what it is and and what you're hoping to achieve.

Yeah, thanks for having me on Brian. So Base is an energy technology company working to bring affordable and reliable power to America. So, if you've lived basically anywhere in the country over the last decade, your power has gotten more expensive and less reliable and we started the company to change that. So we install batteries on single family homes. When the grid's up and running, we use that battery to support the grid. When the grid goes down, the homeowner gets that battery to back up their home. and we're able to save our our customers on the order of 10 to 20% a month on their electricity bill. So our mission is to make your bill go down and your lights stay on.

That is a good mission. Uh for sure. all of our electric bills have gone through the roof. Where did you where did you get inspired to come up with a business like this?

Well, I was fortunate to spend a couple years in the investment world studying the energy infrastructure space and seeing all the progress being made in the battery space in particular. And really saw an opportunity to drive down the cost of electricity for consumers by developing battery storage technology, particularly in a way that's enabled by software to manage supply and demand and load on the grid and really drive down price. And, you know, we've gotten off to a great start over the last two years, but there's a lot of work to do to make our grid here in America more affordable and more reliable. So we're on off to the races and and working to really rebuild the future of American power.

What what type of pressures uh are we are you seeing on the grid because of this AI infrastructure roll out that look, I'm talking about every single day. Every day there's a new development. Open AI signing a new partnership for power. Uh it's it's just advancing at a at a really really fast pace.

Yeah, Brian, we're in an era of unprecedented electricity demand. We've really never seen demand growth like this in the category. And it's really a a supply demand problem. We have a ton of demand coming and we don't have enough supply. So we need better technology to bring more supply onto the system so that we can absorb all this new demand that's coming. And, you know, the electricity cost function plays a role in every new technology. As the cost of electricity goes down, we're able to build more, do more, innovate more. And so that's really the role that we're playing is bringing more supply online so we can continue to absorb that that increased demand and keep prices low.

Are you worried that like the grid just may frazzle out. I mean I can't think of a better word for it because of all the stress we're putting on it because of AI.

The grid is certainly under stress and we're we're here to help resolve some of that stress. And, you know, we need more technology, more capacity, more flexible capacity in the form of battery storage to make sure things like that don't happen.

So, how many folks or or households are using base power?

We've got thousands of members across Texas on the order of 5,000 and and and growing every day. We're doing, you know, roughly 30 40 of these installs a day. That's up from 20 installs a day, you know, only a couple months ago. So we've doubled the business in a short amount of time. and we plan to keep growing at a really fast clip. I I think, you know, it's been covered widely uh the the launch and the announcement of our first factory uh down in Austin. So we're going to be bringing supply uh to Texas and manufacturing these systems ourselves is is going to allow us to install much much more batteries, many more systems across the state of Texas and then we'll be announcing our expansion across the country soon entering some new states and bringing affordable reliable reliable power, hopefully to every household in America soon enough.",https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-10/4fa92d80-a51c-11f0-bbce-1e79f8cb997b,N,,2025-10-09 16:03:26.090969

— Office of Oregon Governor Tina Kotek","SALEM, Ore. — Governor Tina Kotek signed Executive Order 25-25 to accelerate the pace of renewable wind and solar project development in the state of Oregon before the clock runs out on critical federal clean energy tax credits.

The Order directs relevant state agencies, boards, and commissions to take all steps necessary and authorized by existing statutes to accelerate and prioritize siting and permitting reviews, approvals, and processes necessary to expedite the permitting and development of solar and wind energy projects in Oregon that seek to qualify for federal clean energy tax credits requiring construction to commence by July 4, 2026.

“With the elimination of promised incentives by the Trump Administration, states must step up as the last line of defense against climate catastrophe. We have to get renewable energy infrastructure built, and quickly,” Governor Kotek said. “We cannot afford to lose this critical window; every wind and solar project we help complete now directly fights the irreversible climate damage we’re racing to prevent.”

Many renewable energy developers face a critical July 4, 2026 deadline to begin construction on commercial projects to qualify for the Investment Tax Credit (ICT) and the Production Tax Credit (PTC), with recent guidance narrowing qualification requirements and requiring project completion within four years to capture the full federal incentive. Projects that fail to meet the July 4 construction deadline must enter into service by December 31, 2027 to qualify for federal tax credits.

“Oregonians are already feeling the strain of rising energy costs and worsening climate impacts, yet Congress and the Trump administration have launched an all-out assault on affordable clean energy and our safe climate future,” Nora Apter, Oregon Director for Climate Solution said. “By moving swiftly to get as many wind and solar projects across the finish line as possible before the loss of federal tax credits, Governor Kotek is defending Oregon families, family-wage jobs, and energy resilience against these senseless attacks. Today’s action will help ensure that renewable energy projects can capture critical federal incentives before they disappear – keeping Oregon competitive and able to power our state’s growing energy demands with clean, affordable electricity.”

The county commissioners, during a business meeting on Tuesday, discussed the idea of putting a moratorium in place until they get revised regulations in place and new regulations adopted and the fees revised. Logan County's Planning and Zoning Commission is already working on regulations for battery storage and while wind turbine and solar regulations were last adopted by the county in 2023, Commissioner Jim Santomaso suggested there are some changes that could be made to them and also asked that the county come up with regulations for data centers.

One of the things that would change in the wind and solar regulations is the amount of time between when the notice of the permit application is given to neighboring landowners and when the hearing date is set. This was discussed previously between the commissioners and County Planner Rob Quint and at the time Quint said he felt the current 14-day period is too short. At that same time, there was a discussion about increasing Logan County's permit fees to be more in line with neighboring counties and to cover the cost of having an outside third-party review the permits. There was also discussion about increasing fees for larger projects.

At Tuesday's meeting, Quint said wind and solar regulations and battery storage regulations should be completed quickly, but regulations for data centers may take more time because he hasn't found any Colorado regulations that address that. He plans to reach out to see if Laramie County has any regulations, as Cheyenne, Wyo., will be the site of one of the largest data center hubs in the future.

All regulations will go through the Planning and Zoning Commission, which will make recommendations to the Board of County Commissioners. The commissioners will then hold a public hearing before adopting the regulations. Planning and Zoning will also give input on fees.

Commissioner Mike Brownell asked Quint if he thought a three-month moratorium would be too long.

""I don't want to foul up a good chance of some economic development, but I also don't want to go into it not feeling like we've covered all our bases,"" he said.

Quint didn't think that would be too long; however, County Attorney Alan Samber suggested making it six months and if it takes less time than that to complete the regulations and fee revisions, the moratorium can be lifted sooner.

The commissioners directed Samber to put together a resolution declaring a moratorium to be approved at their next business meeting on Oct. 21.

During a work session, the commissioners heard from Andrew Frtizler, chairman of Sterling Urban Renewal Authority, and Trae Miller, executive director of the Logan County Economic Development Corporation and SURA board member, about SURA's plans for a new West Main Street Urban Renewal Area. The two also spoke at an RE-1 Valley School Board meeting on Monday and will be going to the Sterling City Council, Lower South Platte Water Conservancy District and Northern Water Conservancy District.

The primary mission of SURA is to encourage development in downtown blighted areas. They are able to do this by getting tax dollars incrementally and reinvesting them in their various districts.

Right now, there are three existing plan areas within the SURA district — Gateway, which includes Walgreens, Bank of Colorado and Family Food Market, Downtown, and the Excel, which is the area where Sterling Ethanol and Trinidad Benham are located, and all of their Tax Increment Financing (TIF) expires in the next five years.

""The Downtown is where we've been able to do a lot of work with some of the small property owners, small businesses and things and help get those improvements done in those buildings, which is extremely costly in those old structures, old infrastructures,"" Miller said.

They have also helped with sidewalk work.

Now, SURA is planning to add a new area, the West Main Street Urban Renewal Area, which stretches all the way down W. Main Street and a block north and south. Walmart is not included in the designated area, but the Pioneer Park softball fields are, due to conversations that have happened in the past about potential needs at that site.

""This one is so important for our ability to attract more retail development,"" Miller said.

Under state law, SURA must negotiate an intergovernmental agreement with the county, city, school district and water districts concerning the sharing of incremental property tax revenue and the impacts of the plan on those entities' services. The IGAs must be completed by Dec. 29.

In other business, Marilee Johnson, a member of Logan County's America 250 — Colorado 150 committee, brought a suggestion from the committee to paint a mural on part of the west side of the grandstands at the Logan County Fairgrounds to commemorate the occasion. The commissioners liked the idea but said they want to have final approval of the artwork.

Additionally, the commissioners approved an application for a subdivision exemption on behalf of Donald W. and Mary Jane Fritzler to create a 2.85-acre parcel from a 160-acre parcel in an Environmental Protection (EP) Zone district for use as a residence; an application for a subdivision exemption on behalf of John P. and Carol L. Lambrecht to create a 22.53-acre parcel from an 81-acre parcel in an Agriculture (A) Zone district for use as a residence; and a subdivision exemption on behalf of Kerry Michael Welch to create a 7.313-acre parcel from a 70.663-acre parcel in an Environmental Protection (EP) zone district for use as a residence. They also approved an agreement between Logan County and Pivot Energy Development, LLC, and issued a right of way permit for the use of the county right of way along Iris Drive for driveway access.

Governor Kathy Hochul today announced $10 million is now available to increase the adoption of advanced clean heating and cooling solutions in New York through the new statewide Clean Heat for All: Window Heat Pump Demonstration program. Starting today, manufacturers and vendors can now apply to qualify and demonstrate the performance of packaged window heat pumps (PWHPs) in multifamily buildings across the state, which aim to increase consumer confidence in this emerging heat pump technology. This new statewide program builds on the success and lessons learned from the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) Clean Heat for All Pilot and will make it more affordable for the industry to advance these cost-effective, plug-and-play retrofit solutions, which can improve comfort and temperature control for New York households without the need for extensive building infrastructure upgrades.

“Making clean energy more affordable is key to ensuring every New Yorker can benefit from our transition to a greener future,” Governor Hochul said. “Clean Heat for All demonstrates how strong partnerships and proven solutions can accelerate that transition, helping families save energy costs, improving comfort in their homes and reducing harmful emissions across the state.”

The statewide Window Heat Pump Demonstration program , administered by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), offers incentives to qualified manufacturers and vendors to install PWHPs for demonstration and performance monitoring in select multifamily buildings with more than five units.

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “The success of the Clean Heat for All program brought ground-breaking technology into the homes of New Yorkers to experience the benefits of clean, efficient heating and cooling. Through these demonstration projects, more residents and building owners will be able to experience greater comfort, control, and air quality from heat pump technology and feel confident in the switch to these low emission solutions.”

The open enrollment opportunity consists of two concurrent phases. Starting today, under Phase One, manufacturers and vendors of PWHPs that meet a rigorous set of technical and performance criteria can now apply to qualify their clean heating and cooling products through the program. Once qualified under Phase One, they will be eligible to apply to Phase Two incentives to install and demonstrate their performance of their PWHPs in multifamily buildings. Selected projects in market rate demonstration sites will receive incentives covering 50 percent of costs up to $1,500 per PWHP. Incentives for low- and moderate-income demonstration sites will cover 75 percent of costs up to $2,250 per PWHP.

An application for Phase One can be submitted via email to PWHPdemonstration@nyserda.ny.gov. Once NYSERDA reviews and accepts Phase One applications, applicants will become qualified participants and NYSERDA will grant access to a dedicated SharePoint site for Phase Two applications. The deadline to qualify PWHPs is January 30, 2026. The deadline to apply for incentives is June 30, 2027. More information about Phase One of the program can be found here and Phase Two can be found here .

From the Phase Two demonstrations, NYSERDA will collect PWHP performance data in order to provide metrics and actionable insights to building owners, operators, tenants, and utilities, both in New York State and other jurisdictions with significant multifamily housing stock and cold climates. This data will be used to assess the viability of PWHPs as a cost-effective, durable space heating electrification retrofit solution.

The Window Heat Pump Demonstration program joins NYSERDA's Clean Heat for All portfolio, alongside the Clean Heat for All: Packaged Terminal Heat Pump program, to bring efficient heating and cooling solutions to buildings across New York State. It also builds on the success and positive results of the NYCHA Clean Heat for All Pilot, a partnership between the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), New York Power Authority (NYPA), and NYSERDA to develop and test a cold-climate window heat pump that can better serve the heating and cooling needs of existing multifamily buildings. This new demonstration program aims to enable installation and monitoring of more PWHPs and provide additional performance data, which will complement data gleaned from the previous NYCHA Pilot.

New York Power Authority President and CEO Justin E. Driscoll said, “Through the Power Authority’s strategic partnership with NYCHA and NYSERDA, the Clean Heat for All program led to the development of energy-efficient heat pumps that can be easily installed in multifamily buildings. The continued investment in this innovative technology will make it more affordable to implement, improving comfort and climate control for New York residents.”

New York State Homes and Community Renewal Commissioner RuthAnne Visnauskas said, “Expanding access to clean, efficient heating and cooling is essential to improving the quality of life for residents across New York, including those who live in affordable multifamily developments. The $10 million Clean Heat for All Pilot program supports HCR’s mission to preserve and improve our existing housing stock, and ensure safe, sustainable, affordable homes for all New Yorkers. By embracing and funding innovative technologies like packaged window heat pumps, we’re helping to build a healthier, more resilient housing stock for the future.”

New York City Housing Authority Chief Executive Officer Lisa Bova-Hiatt said, “NYCHA is proud to have been the catalyst and proving ground for this innovative program. The success of the initial Clean Heat for All pilot, which was met with very positive feedback from NYCHA residents, demonstrates the viability of these window heat pumps as a key solution for providing reliable heating and cooling while improving energy efficiency. We are thrilled to be involved in driving a market transformation that will serve to benefit not only NYCHA residents, but New Yorkers statewide.”

Urban Green Council Chief Executive Officer John Mandyck said, “We applaud NYSERDA's new Window Heat Pump Demonstration program. It will expedite technologies that will fill important gaps in the industry and provide affordable electrification solutions for more New Yorkers.”

For more 50 years, NYSERDA has been a trusted and objective resource for New Yorkers, taking on the critical role of energy planning and policy analysis, along with making investments that drive New York toward a more sustainable future. Buildings are one of the most significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions in New York State. Through NYSERDA and utility programs, more than $5.6 billion has been invested to decarbonize buildings and support high-efficiency all-electric heating and cooling technologies. Room heat pumps, such as PWHPs, are an important tool in the transition to a clean energy economy and have the potential to enable rapid, affordable electrification of space heating in multifamily buildings.

This initiative is funded by the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.

New York State's Climate Agenda

New York State's climate agenda calls for an affordable and just transition to a clean energy economy that creates family-sustaining jobs, promotes economic growth through green investments, and directs a minimum of 35 percent of the benefits to disadvantaged communities. New York is advancing a suite of efforts to achieve an emissions-free economy by 2050, including in the energy, buildings, transportation, and waste sectors.",https://www.nyserda.ny.gov/Assets/Common/Images/favicons/nyserda/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-09 16:02:32.088076

Rather than trying to put oil companies out of business, Mr. Trump is going after clean energy, and Americans will face higher bills as a result.
Mr. Trump ran for president promising to reduce the cost of living and of energy prices in particular.
Yet the Trump energy policies are not helping — and will soon make matters worse.
Energy prices are likely to rise the most in states that have not prioritized clean energy, including Kentucky, Missouri and Oklahoma, experts say.","You do not have to care about climate change to believe that clean energy is an important and strategic resource. Solar and wind power are now cheaper than coal in many places and sometimes cheaper than oil and gas. Clean energy sources help both hold down costs for Americans and prevent the United States from having to import so much foreign oil from countries hostile to our interests.

These advantages help explain why the right energy policy for the United States is an all-of-the-above strategy. The country should continue using fossil fuels like natural gas while shifting toward cleaner energy that does less damage to the planet. The combination can help Americans struggling with slow-growing incomes while also addressing climate change.

President Trump, however, has rejected the all-of-the-above approach in his second term. He is instead waging a war on solar and wind power. It is a mirror image of the strategy that conservatives criticize the fringes of the environmental movement for favoring. Rather than trying to put oil companies out of business, Mr. Trump is going after clean energy, and Americans will face higher bills as a result.

Mr. Trump signed a law in July that repealed the clean energy tax credits enacted by former President Joe Biden, eliminating hundreds of billions of dollars of investment into wind, solar and electric vehicles. Mr. Trump has also directed his administration to enact new regulations on clean energy and start specious investigations into its use, including one looking into bird deaths caused by wind turbines. His administration is trying to cancel wind projects off the coasts of Massachusetts, Maryland and Rhode Island, which would provide enough electricity to power more than a million homes. “Windmills, we’re just not going to allow them,” Mr. Trump recently said. Even some oil executives have criticized these moves as shortsighted.

Mr. Trump ran for president promising to reduce the cost of living and of energy prices in particular. He has failed so far. Inflation remains near 3 percent a year even as economic growth and job growth have slowed. Electricity prices are almost 10 percent higher than they were a year earlier, according to the most recent numbers. The main reasons for the electricity price surge have little to do with Mr. Trump and instead involve demand from A.I. data centers and supply constraints from the war in Ukraine. Yet the Trump energy policies are not helping — and will soon make matters worse.

Energy prices are likely to rise the most in states that have not prioritized clean energy, including Kentucky, Missouri and Oklahoma, experts say. The repeal of the tax credits alone may push electricity prices almost 10 percent higher than they would be otherwise by 2029, according to National Economic Research Associates, a consulting firm. Gas prices will also increase over the next decade, according to Rhodium Group, a think tank, as consumers who would otherwise have driven electric cars continue using vehicles that burn fossil fuels.

Mr. Trump’s approach to wind and solar is part of a larger story. It is, along with his tariffs, extreme immigration policies and attempt to take over the Federal Reserve, one more example of prioritizing ideology over the interests of American families.

Mr. Trump’s energy policy also weakens America’s global standing by giving a competitive edge to the country’s chief geopolitical rival, China. For years China has meticulously grown its clean energy industry with government subsidies and other policies. Chinese companies now produce 60 percent of the world’s wind turbines and 80 percent of solar panels.

Mr. Biden’s clean energy tax credits were meant to counter China’s moves. He understood that wind and solar would play an important role in the economy of the future, and that the United States should not let China control the global market. Mr. Biden’s approach was working, creating incentives for the private sector to build big clean-energy projects, including Toyota’s E.V. battery production facility in Liberty, N.C., and a Qcells solar panel manufacturing facility in Cartersville, Ga.

Low energy prices are also good for economic growth. If prices are higher here than in other countries, companies will invest less in America. Consider artificial intelligence: Technology companies are building data centers to power their bots’ processing abilities. These data centers use a lot of electricity. If energy supply cannot keep up with demand, America’s A.I. build-out will lag — again to the benefit of China.

The Trump administration argues that wind and solar are not reliable, and that has some truth to it. If the wind is not blowing or the sun is not shining, power cannot be generated. But this objection is mostly a canard. Advances in battery technology will allow the country to use wind and solar energy during off-hours. Wind and solar also do not have to generate electricity at all times. We have other forms of energy — nuclear, hydro, geothermal and, yes, fossil fuels — to handle the moments that wind and solar cannot. When a country is pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy, varying sources of energy complement one another. They increase overall supply and hold down prices for everybody.

We understand why the political right has sometimes been frustrated by the left’s skepticism of energy abundance. In both Europe and the United States, environmentalists who are rightly worried about the costs and dangers of climate change have at times imagined that the transition could happen more quickly than is realistic. In truth, oil and gas will be necessary to keep prices low and power the economy for years to come. But the political left is not the problem today. The Democratic Party under Mr. Biden expanded domestic oil and gas production while making major investments in clean energy.

The Republican Party has long denied the severe risks that climate change presents and stood in the way of sensible policies to address the extreme storms, flooding and heat that are already happening.

But type of energy Trump is working to expand is nuclear, which emits no greenhouse gases.

Spectrum News recently visited the McGuire Nuclear Power Station in Huntersville, North Carolina, which has been around for four decades.

The sprawling campus outside Charlotte sits behind a thick wall of fencing, watch towers and other security measures.

""Before I came in the industry, pre-9/11, I don’t think we saw the security the same level we do now,"" said McGuire operations manager John Banse.

The plant can produce enough power for more than a million and a half homes.

Inside, nuclear fission of uranium creates heat that turns water into steam, driving the turbines and generators that produce electricity. The steam is cooled and reused by water from Lake Norman next door, flowing through metal tubes.

Nuclear power plants are a common sight in the region, generating 36% of the electricity in North Carolina and 60% in South Carolina.

And soon nuclear energy could be expanding its reach to more parts of the country.

In May, Trump signed executive orders aimed to spur the nuclear power industry by speeding up reactor testing and licensing, and using reactors for artificial intelligence data centers and military bases.

The president’s embrace of nuclear is in stark contrast to his opposition to other forms of clean energy like wind and solar.

“Nuclear energy is one subject that neither Democrats nor Republicans object to,” said George Washington University physics professor Andrei Alexandru.

Provisions of the bipartisan infrastructure law signed by Biden in 2021 also sought to increase nuclear power generation. And two years later the U.S. joined more than 20 other countries in pledging to triple global nuclear energy capacity by 2050.

With memories of nuclear accidents at Fukushima and Three Mile Island, safety is often the biggest concern around nuclear power and that could pose a hurdle for nuclear expansion in some states.

Duke Energy Vice President of New Nuclear Generation Rounette Nader said the plants are safe and the benefits are widespread.

“The plants run 95% of the time, it’s carbon-free generation, it’s affordable, reliable. So it ticks all the boxes,” Rounette said.

The expansion of nuclear energy continues in North Carolina, where Duke Energy hopes to transform a coal and natural gas plant called Belews Creek into nuclear energy.

“We’ve done some analysis to look at how the workforce at a coal station can be transitioned to a nuclear station and we think we can be very successful with that,” Nader said.

The previous high for both sources of energy was 18.6 terawatt-hours (TWh) in September 2024, per Ember Energy. In August 2025, Brazil's solar and wind power generated a combined 19 TWh of electricity, or 34% of Brazil's electricity. That is enough to power 119 million Brazilian homes for a month.

""Brazil shows how a rapidly growing economy can meet its rising need for electricity with solar and wind,"" said Raul Miranda, Ember's global program director, per the AP. ""Solar and wind are a perfect match for Brazil's hydropower resources, taking the pressure off in drought years. A diversified mix is a fundamental strategy for tackling risks related to climate change.""

The remaining electricity generated in Brazil in August included 48% from hydropower and just 14% from fossil fuels like natural gas, coal, and oil.

To put this into perspective, the U.S. Energy Information Administration stated that fossil fuels account for 60% of generated electricity in the U.S.

Wind and solar power are affordable and clean energy sources. They can help mitigate the harmful effects of fossil fuels, which contribute to air pollution, Earth's overheating, and increased natural disasters.

Improving air quality and creating good-paying jobs are two great benefits of increasing solar and wind energy sources. And as Ember Energy stated, wind and solar's prices fell by 55% and 85% respectively in the decade before 2020.

Solar and wind continue to grow in Brazil.

In 2024, those sources accounted for 24% of Brazil's electricity generated. According to Ember Energy, the increase in wind and solar energy outpaces the increase in electricity demand across the country. These clean and renewable energies helped decrease fossil fuel use by 45%.

""It is undoubtedly symbolic, and you see these sources contributing a significant fraction of electricity at a given moment and showing that they are important,"" said Ricardo Baitelo, project coordinator at Brazil's Institute for Energy and the Environment, per AP News. ""They are not alternative sources, they are already a well-represented part of Brazil's electricity mix.""

According to Brazil's Institute for Energy and the Environment, the country is the only G20 nation on track to meet its goal of increasing renewable sources by 2030.

""This is the big warning and a yellow light that could turn red,"" Baitelo said. ""And Brazil needs to take urgent measures to avoid losing this condition and this good example of wind and solar deployment.""

On Wednesday, the environment department submitted the rules to the independent Environmental Improvement Board.
Public comments have already been opened, and the state environment department will host a virtual public meeting on Oct. 22 to provide an overview of the rules and answer questions.
The environment department included two examples in a news release, but said neither are final.
“House Bill 212 represents an important step forward to protect New Mexicans from toxic PFAS chemicals,” state Sen. Jeff Steinborn (D-Las Cruces) said in a statement.","The state health department on Wednesday put forward proposed rules that will be used to implement a new law regulating the use of so-called “forever chemicals” in consumer productions.

House Bill 212—the PFAS Protection Act—passed by New Mexico lawmakers in the regular 2025 legislative session, institutes the gradual phasing out of intentionally added per-and-polyfluouroalkyl substances—PFAS— in everyday items.

“These rules will prevent toxic PFAS chemicals from unknowingly entering the places where we live, work and play,” Environment Secretary James Kenney said in a statement. “From cookware and food packaging, to furniture and cleaning supplies, to adult hygiene products and baby clothes and toys—these rules will protect the health of New Mexicans and our environment from toxic forever chemicals.”

New Mexico is the third state to enshrine a ban in state laws to address the use of PFAS in consumer products, joining Maine and Minnesota.

As detailed in a news release from the environment, the law phases out and then prohibits consumer products that contain intentionally added PFAS, which “can cause a range of adverse health issues including thyroid disease, liver or kidney damage, birth defects, certain types of cancers, and increase the risk of reproductive issues like decreased fertility, low birth weight, or developmental delays.”

Specifically, state law prohibits in 2027 the sale of certain products with intentionally added PFAS in items like cookware food packaging and juvenile products; cosmetics, furniture and carpets will be prohibited in 2028; and, in 2032, state law prohibits selling all non-exempt products —such as medical devices, pharmaceuticals, electronics and cars— with intentionally added PFAS in New Mexico.

On Wednesday, the environment department submitted the rules to the independent Environmental Improvement Board. If passed after the rulemaking process they will take effect in July of 2026. Public comments have already been opened, and the state environment department will host a virtual public meeting on Oct. 22 to provide an overview of the rules and answer questions.

“With the passage of House Bill 212, we had one clear objective – to safeguard New Mexicans from dangerous added toxins, PFAS, in everyday products,” State Rep. and Majority Whip Dayan Hochman-Vigil (D-Albuquerque) said in a statement. “Today’s Environmental Improvement Board filing brings us one critical step closer in removing harmful chemicals from our homes, and to provide peace of mind to our communities.”

The act also requires manufacturers to label products that include intentionally added PFAS. The environment department included two examples in a news release, but said neither are final.

“House Bill 212 represents an important step forward to protect New Mexicans from toxic PFAS chemicals,” state Sen. Jeff Steinborn (D-Las Cruces) said in a statement. “Data has shown that these dangerous cancer-causing chemicals persist in the human body and in the environment for a very long time, and we must do all we can to prevent New Mexican’s exposure to them.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-93/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/draft-pfas-label-2-1024x4451760030584.jpg?h=e0e716f0&itok=Vpa1S7mJ,N,,2025-10-09 15:05:40.672468

Clean energy has dethroned coal — a triumph of science over pollution.","For the first time in history, renewables have generated more electricity than coal globally. But as science powers this breakthrough, it’s come under attack — and in a twist few saw coming, the Vatican is defending it.

Clean energy has just made history — generating more electricity than coal for the first time ever. According to Ember’s Global Electricity Mid-Year Insights 2025, renewables supplied 34.3 percent of global electricity in the first half of 2025, overtaking coal’s 33.1 percent share — a moment that marks the beginning of the end for the fossil-fuel era.

But even as science achieves what once seemed impossible, political forces are moving to undermine it, waging a new war not on technology — but on truth itself. And in a twist few could have predicted, the Vatican has emerged as one of science’s strongest defenders — rallying global faith and moral authority behind the facts that denial seeks to erase.

A Historic Turning Point for Clean Power

The world has crossed a historic threshold;

Solar output jumped 31 percent (+306 TWh) in early 2025, meeting 83 percent of global demand growth.

Wind generation rose 7.7 percent (+97 TWh).

Fossil generation declined 0.3 percent, even as overall demand increased 2.6 percent.

China met its entire electricity demand growth with clean sources, cutting emissions 1.7 percent (–46 Mt CO₂). India’s surge in solar and wind reduced emissions 3.6 percent (–24 Mt CO₂).

In the European Union, renewables surpassed all fossil fuels combined for electricity generation last year — a world first. In the United States, an extraordinary 96 percent of new power capacity added in 2024 was fossil-free.

Meanwhile, clean technologies are scaling at eye-watering speed. According to the IEA, global EV sales were up 35% year-on-year in the first three months of 2025, marking another exponential leap toward a fossil-free transport system. Battery energy storage systems are also booming: in the U.S. alone, planned additions in 2024 could nearly double capacity, and global deployments grew 53 % over the prior year. Within a decade, many new vehicles and power grids may largely bypass fossil fuels — instead drawing directly from wind, solar, and storage.

“Clean power is now growing fast enough to meet the world’s appetite for electricity,... This marks the beginning of a structural transition.”

Małgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, lead analyst at Ember.

The Science Worked. The Backlash Began.

Yet as the data delivers hope, science itself is under assault.

The Union of Concerned Scientists report from July 2025 documented 402 attacks on science during the Trump administration’s first six months back in power — the fastest erosion of federal scientific capacity in U.S. history.

Within weeks, the administration launched an all-out assault on climate research: NASA’s CO₂-monitoring satellites were ordered by the White House to terminated, the Mauna Loa Observatory is under threat to be shut down, and the EPA’s endangerment finding — its legal basis for regulating emissions — is about to be revoked. NOAA’s climate division was dismantled, USDA climate data erased, 1,100 EPA scientist positions cut, and plans are underway to cancel the $7 billion Solar for All program.

“You can’t manage what you can’t measure,” one NASA scientist told Reuters. “Eliminating the data eliminates accountability.”

The Anti-Science Movement Goes Global

And it’s spreading.

In Sweden, Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson went on national television to claim that Sweden has “the world’s lowest carbon footprint.” Scientists quickly pointed out the opposite: while most EU nations are cutting emissions, Sweden’s are rising faster than any other. The European Commission has now referred Sweden to the EU Court of Justice for failing to implement new renewable-energy permitting rules — a breach that could trigger financial penalties. When governments ignore evidence, lie about the facts and delay clean-energy progress, it’s not just climate policy at risk — it’s science itself.

In Germany, the AfD — now polling as the country’s largest party — has pledged to tear down wind turbines and roll back clean-energy goals.

In the United Kingdom, the Conservative opposition is trying to win the election by scrapping the country’s science-based climate targets.

Globally, the five largest oil majors have spent over $1 billion since the Paris Agreement on lobbying and branding that undermine international climate goals.

Across continents, populist movements are reframing climate action as elitist ideology — the same playbook once used against vaccines and public health. Their goal is simple: protect fossil profits by eroding public trust in science.

But truth has a strange resilience — the harder it’s attacked, the stronger it often becomes.

Signs of Hope and Resilience

Even amid the backlash, progress continues to accelerate across the world. From California and New York to capitals across the European Union, governments are doubling down on 100 percent clean-power mandates. China and India are pouring record investments into solar, battery storage, and electric mobility — reshaping the world’s industrial backbone in real time. Corporate appetite is soaring too: companies signed more than 90 gigawatts of clean power purchase agreements in 2024, the highest ever recorded. And according to the International Energy Agency, global clean-energy investment will reach $2 trillion in 2025, outpacing fossil fuels by a factor of two to one.

For investors, this is not ideology — it’s market momentum. Renewables are outperforming the S&P 500, and clean-tech equities are driving a new industrial wave built on electrons, not oil.

When Faith Defended Science

As political attacks on science intensify, an unlikely defender has stepped forward: the Vatican.

In October, Pope Leo XIV—widely viewed as more conservative than his predecessor, Pope Francis—surprised the world by inviting scientists, activists, and political leaders to his private summer residence at Castel Gandolfo. I was there and his message was unmistakable: faith and science are not enemies, but allies in truth.

At the Raising Hope for Climate Justice gathering, the Pope called on global citizens to reject the manipulation of facts and to stand firm behind evidence and reason.

“Some have chosen to deride the increasingly evident signs of climate change, to ridicule those who speak of global warming, and even to blame the poor for the very thing that affects them the most,... There is no room for indifference or resignation.”

Pope Leo XIV

One of his first actions as the new Pope was to ensure that the Vatican becomes one of the world’s first states powered entirely by clean energy — expanding the solar transition begun under Francis with a vast new solar farm at Santa Maria Galeria, designed to meet all of the Holy See’s electricity needs.

Two headlines told the story of our divided times:

📰 Reuters: “Schwarzenegger at Vatican in mission to terminate fossil fuels.”

🗞️ Daily Mail: “Woke American Pope blesses a block of ice in bizarre climate change stunt.”

But inside Castel Gandolfo, the focus was clear: to defend the very foundation of truth. In an age when denial has become political currency, the Pope used his global platform to call for courage — to protect not just creation, but the credibility of knowledge itself.

And standing on the same stage was Arnold Schwarzenegger — a Republican, a lifelong conservative, and former governor of California — echoing the Pope’s message word for word.

“It’s time to say hasta la vista to the special interests standing in the way of climate action”

Arnold Schwarzenegger, former republican Governor of California

Together, they embodied what the world needs most: unity across old divisions — faith and reason, left and right — coming together to defend science itself.

With 1.3 billion members and 400,000 priests worldwide, the Catholic Church may now be the most powerful ally science has.

Below is a brief summary highlighting key moments from the Raising Hope for Climate Justice conference, which I attended and documented firsthand.

The Outlook: Clean Energy Is Unstoppable — But Delay Is Deadly

As the world moves toward COP30 in Belém, Brazil, one truth stands above the noise: the clean energy revolution rests on decades of public science, open data, and transparency. These institutions of truth are the quiet engines behind every solar breakthrough, every emissions target, every policy that works. If they erode, progress itself can still be undone.

Defending that infrastructure is no longer the job of scientists alone. It is an economic, moral, and civic imperative.

Leaders across business and government can help secure the transition by embracing science-based governance, channeling capital into climate solutions, and standing up for facts in the public sphere.

Clean energy has dethroned coal — a triumph of science over pollution.

That single milestone proves what once seemed impossible: the green transition is real, accelerating, and unstoppable.

But delay is deadly. Each year of hesitation locks in decades of damage — from melting ice sheets to collapsing ecosystems and rising human costs. The data shows hope, but the physics demands urgency. At COP30, world leaders hold the power to act — or the burden of failure.

In the third quarter of this year, demand for battery electric vehicles rose 29% compared to the same quarter in 2024, Urban Science found.
While they may now be scaling back that pace of investment, automakers aren’t going to abandon electric vehicles, Kondrat said.
To be sure, the Denver area has “the right demographics” for BEV sales, Kondrat said.
But the BEV market is definitely not falling off a cliff just because federal tax credits ended.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

Yes, the $7,500 federal tax credit for an electric vehicle purchase has ended and yes, EV sales are slowing. But demand won’t collapse, according to Urban Science.

Several pillars of support for the EV market aren’t going away, and those will create a floor to any sales slowdown, Tom Kondrat, global lead for advanced analytics at Urban Science, told Wards Auto. The five pillars Kondrat named include:

Current BEV owners like their vehicles and will continue to buy electric vehicles

More market entries at lower price points

Rising consideration of BEVs as consumers see more on the road

Continued manufacturer purchase incentives

Expanding public charging infrastructure

“We don’t see battery electric (vehicle) demand collapsing,” he said in an interview. “While the fourth quarter may be rocky, in the next 12 to 24 months we see stability in demand.”

Longer term, Urban Science projects demand for electric vehicles to grow gradually, Kondrat added.

In the third quarter of this year, demand for battery electric vehicles rose 29% compared to the same quarter in 2024, Urban Science found. BEV sales accounted for 11.7% of all retail sales.

That surge in demand was largely driven by the end of the $7,500 federal tax credit for a BEV purchase on Sept. 30, Kondrat said. “What we had in the third quarter was a ton of shopper hype,” he said. “The incentive going away pushed (sales) up.”

But over the next 12 months, Urban Science expects BEV sales to stabilize at between nine and 10 percent of the market, Kondrat said.

Dive deeper into the five factors continuing to support BEV demand, below.

1. BEV owners will buy another BEV

Experian found there were more than 4.69 million battery-electric vehicles on the road in the United States as of the second quarter of 2025, a spokesperson said in an email to WardsAuto.

And many are happy with their purchase, Kondrat said.

“A lot of people who drive and own an EV like that experience,” he said.

Many of those BEV drivers have also invested in home charging, Kondrat added, and they are likely to acquire another electrified vehicle. “That will maintain a certain pace” of BEV sales in the future, he said.

2. More affordable choices

Not so long ago, Tesla was the only real competitor in the BEV market and its most inexpensive model started at above $42,000. It recently announced two lower-priced, but deeply de-contented, models.

Meanwhile, many more models at similar or lower price points than Tesla’s are entering the market, Kondrat said. That will maintain BEV demand.

“Affordability is key,” he said.

Consider some of the options: the new Nissan Leaf starts at just under $30,000. Volkswagen, Chevrolet, Hyundai and Kia offer BEVs starting around $40,000 or less. And the Rivian R2 is set to arrive in 2026 with an entry-level price of around $45,000.

“If you look at the landscape, there is more movement in the middle market,” Kondrat said.

That will help build a floor under the demand slowdown, he said.

3. Familiarity with BEVs boosts consideration

As BEV adoption moves into the mainstream, more consumers will know a BEV owner, and have more experience with BEVs. As with any new technology, increased knowledge and experience with BEVs will boost demand, Kondrat said.

“Adoption is a social process,” he said.

And since the majority of BEVs sold are leased, “every year now we have more consumers being introduced to BEVs via the used market,” Kondrat said.

4. Manufacturer incentives will continue

Automakers have invested hundreds of millions to build electric vehicle production infrastructure. While they may now be scaling back that pace of investment, automakers aren’t going to abandon electric vehicles, Kondrat said.

They seek a return on that investment, which means manufacturer incentives will take the place of federal tax incentives, which will also help maintain BEV demand, he said.

“Many manufacturers are releasing their own incentives,” Kondrat said.

Ford and Hyundai, for example, are offering BEV purchase incentives to offset the loss of the federal tax credit.

Going forward, Kondrat expects manufacturers to reduce content on their BEV offerings to keep the price low, and to find other ways to align supply and demand for electric vehicles.

Meanwhile, the price of EV technology, including the battery, is already coming down, he said. That will increase EV consideration over time.

5. Charging infrastructure is expanding

According to the Joint Office of Energy and Transportation, the number of DC fast charging ports in the United States rose by more than 80% in the previous two years to more than 60,300 at the end of August.

Having more, and more visible, fast charging networks also fast charges EV adoption, Kondrat said. BEVs have over 35% of the market in Boulder, Colorado for example, and “the Denver area has a very robust charging infrastructure,” Kondrat said.

To be sure, the Denver area has “the right demographics” for BEV sales, Kondrat said. But areas that might not seem as obviously BEV friendly also are seeing healthy growth, he added.

BEV sales in Florida, for example, rose 52% compared to the same quarter in 2024, Kondrat said. “Florida has been above average in demand for BEVs on a market share basis.”

A 2024 study by The Harris Poll and Urban Science found that while only 26% of consumers would be ready for “EV only options” by 2025, that is expected to double to 50% by 2035.

To be sure, reaching that level will require targeted and sustained marketing by automakers and dealers as well as continued growth of charging infrastructure.

Patricia Zavala, the executive director of nonprofit PowerHouse Texas, also emphasized the importance of renewable energy sources.
Zavala cited data from the Texas Energy Poverty Research Institute, which found that low-income families spend about 12% of their income on electric bills.
""We want affordable bills, reliable power, and we want to keep our families safe.""","Energy experts speaking at a virtual Reliable Grid Project media briefing Wednesday said renewable power sources are needed to keep up with Texas’ growing demand for electricity.

Panelists also emphasized the importance of power storage using batteries.

""Renewables are absolutely bringing affordability to the grid in Texas, but they're also bringing reliability in a state that really needs it,"" said Matt Boms, the executive director for the Texas Advanced Energy Business Alliance.

Boms expressed optimism about the grid's reliability this winter, noting how power sources like wind and solar, along with energy storage, can help fulfill the state's demand.

""We are heading into the winter with more flexible, reliable power than ever before,” he said. “Clean energy is driving ERCOT's reliability.”

As more data centers come to Texas, the state will also have to contend with an increased demand for energy.

Stoic Energy Consulting founder Doug Lewin said increased electricity use can drive down costs, if managed correctly.

""That can be, with the right mix of policies around it, actually good for consumers, because you're actually spreading the cost of the system out among more use,"" he said.

Lewin said the state should create a demand response program for data centers to help avoid peaks in electricity use during extreme weather.

""To have a reliable grid, we need data centers to actually create funds to deal with this problem,"" he said.

Patricia Zavala, the executive director of nonprofit PowerHouse Texas, also emphasized the importance of renewable energy sources.

""The numbers really speak for themselves, and renewables and batteries are playing a really critical role in lowering costs,"" she said.

Zavala cited data from the Texas Energy Poverty Research Institute, which found that low-income families spend about 12% of their income on electric bills. Meanwhile, households with the highest incomes spend about 1% of their income on energy expenses.

""Texans really just want the same thing,"" Zavala said. ""We want affordable bills, reliable power, and we want to keep our families safe.""",https://cdn.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/11212609/solar5-1500x1125.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 15:04:13.751342

Cuts could also wipe out $50 million in funding for an investment by Mitsubishi Electric to repurpose a manufacturing plant in Maysville, and nearly $24 million for several energy-related projects under the University of Kentucky Research Foundation.

The list of potential cuts was reported by Semafor and numerous other news outlets this week. The Department of Energy was ""unable to verify"" the list, spokesperson Olivia Tinari said in an Oct. 7 email to The Courier Journal, and ""continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration.""

If enacted, the reported cuts could be a death blow to the Ascend Elements project, which previously involved plans to invest nearly $1 billion in battery recycling and production and create hundreds of jobs. The company already agreed to cancel $164 million in federal funding earlier this year, and was recently entangled in litigation over alleged refusal to pay contractors.

Ascend Elements did not respond to The Courier Journal's request for comment, nor did Mitsubishi Electric. As of Oct. 8, the University of Kentucky had not received notice of funding changes, according to spokesperson Whitney Siddiqi.

""Cutting promised funding for businesses and organizations is short-sighted and harmful ― not just for Kentucky, but for our entire country,"" said Scottie Ellis, a spokesperson for Gov. Andy Beshear's office, in a statement. As of Oct. 8, the governor's office had not heard confirmation of the cuts from the federal government, Ellis said, but was ""reaching out to the companies reportedly affected to learn more.""

The list circulating this week matches a pattern of funding cancelations to clean energy and decarbonization efforts. The Trump administration, at odds with decades of climate science, has questioned the merit of reducing carbon emissions and painted efforts to do so as a ""scam.""

Earlier this month, at the onset of a tense government shutdown, the Trump administration announced funding cancelations of more than $7 billion for 223 energy projects, which it said ""did not adequately advance the nation's energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.""

Most of that round of cuts targeted projects in blue states. Democrats lambasted those cuts as partisan, and said the decision would ""harm American jobs, drive private capital out of our country, weaken our power grid, and give China a strategic edge.""

In May, the Trump administration yanked federal funding from another tranche of projects, including two in Kentucky: $72 million for a carbon capture pilot project at LG&E's Cane Run power plant in Louisville, and up to $75 million to the international spirits company Diageo to decarbonize its operations in Shelbyville, Kentucky, and Plainfield, Illinois.

Notably, the new list of reported project cuts would acutely affect red states and red districts. Billions of dollars for regional hydrogen hubs, including one in Appalachia, would be slashed. Carbon capture projects along the Gulf Coast, which the fossil fuel industry has generally supported, would also take a hit.

In recent years, deep-red Kentucky has embraced a slew of economic development projects related to clean energy, and especially the electric vehicle supply chain, boosted by Biden-era subsidies. The Kentucky legislature approved state incentives for the projects ― some of which could now collapse under a reversal in federal support. Thousands of Kentucky jobs hang in the balance.

The Ascend Elements plant lies a few miles outside Hopkinsville, in Kentucky's 1st Congressional District. A spokesperson for U.S. Rep. James Comer did not respond to a request for comment on the potential cuts, nor did staff of the Christian County Chamber of Commerce.

Other major electric vehicle investments sited in Kentucky in recent years include the sprawling BlueOval SK plant in Hardin County and EV expansions by Ford Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Manufacturing.

In addition to slashed federal awards, the EV industry is facing whiplash in federal policy. The Trump administration has dismantled Biden-era policies meant to support the growing U.S. EV industry, including consumer-side tax credits for electric vehicle purchases, which ended Sept. 30. Industry analysts expect EV sales to slow as a result, which in turn could hinder growth in Kentucky's burgeoning battery sector.","https://www.courier-journal.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/09/PLOU/84122214007-apex-1-aerial-view-308012024-sm-31024-x-683.jpg?crop=1022,575,x0,y58&width=1022&height=575&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-09 14:04:12.285375

The nations of the world are embroiled in a constant state of finding balance in the energy sector. Indonesia has taken a step towards reaching the lofty ambitions that the world has set for the energy sector. The floating solar plant in West Java could accelerate the transition to the renewable energy sector.

Indonesia’s state-owned electricity company, PLN, has reported that construction has begun

The nation’s state-owned electricity utility, Perusahaan Listrik Negara, has reported that it has initiated construction on a huge 92-megawatt-peak floating solar power facility at the Saguling reservoir in West Java.

The state-owned operator reports that the site is hoping to come online by November 2026. Indonesia has big plans for its energy sector. The nation has stated that by 2034, it plans to add 42.6 GW (GigaWatt) of renewables to its grid, with solar contributing 17.1 GW of new capacity.

Aligning with that goal of adding a significant amount of energy to the grid from solar power, the country’s leaders have reported that the plant at the Saguling reservoir in West Java is expected to generate more than 130 GWh (GigaWatt-hour) annually, which would help Indonesia avoid roughly 104,000 tons of CO₂ emissions each year.

Indonesia is working with several key stakeholders to foster change in the energy sector

For any nation that aims to transition away from conventional energy generation processes in favor of the renewable energy sector, cooperation with relevant stakeholders who can accelerate the transition is vital to ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted transition.

While the exact cost of the massive 92 MW floating solar plant in West Java has not been revealed by Indonesia, the project can take solace in the fact that the nation’s state-owned energy utility is fostering cooperative relationships with relevant stakeholders in the energy sector.

The Saguling project, located roughly 111 miles away from the nation’s capital, Jakarta, has huge potential to fast-track the nation’s attempt to integrate large-scale solar projects into the grid. The project comes off the back of a cooperative project that was developed by PLN Nusantara, a division of Mubadala Investment Company, and the United Arab Emirates renewables energy company Masdar.

Solar power remains an untapped energy resource that the world has yet to fully explore, and several Asian nations have added new solar projects to the grid in recent years. Even the richest man in the world, Elon Musk, sees the untapped potential that solar power presents to the world.

“A utility can handle up to 20 per cent of production from solar and that helps the grid because it produces electricity when needed. Solar power peaks in the middle of the day and that’s also when air conditioning is running and businesses are operating, so power production matches usage.” – Elon Musk

Solar power capacity will become the most dominant energy generation process if the current trend continues",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1-Credits-GCN.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 15:04:08.210978

GM has canceled its program to provide a $7,500 incentive for EVs after the federal tax credit expired.

The program aimed to help dealers move 20,000 EVs but was halted due to regulatory concerns.

There are approximately 135,000–140,000 EVs still unsold nationwide, and demand is expected to drop sharply in the coming months.

General Motors is abandoning its plans to continue offering consumers a $7,500 incentive for EVs in place of the federal tax credit that expired on Sept. 30, according to an exclusive report from Reuters. The initiative was designed to mitigate the impact of the credit’s expiration and enable dealers to continue selling EV inventory.

At the end of September, GM planned to use its in-house financing arm to make a down payment on approximately 20,000 EVs in dealers’ inventories. The company would apply for the federal tax credit on those vehicles and roll it into leases for customers through the end of the year.

GM Financial began making down payments on the vehicles before Sept. 30. However, the plan was halted after Senator Bernie Moreno, a former car dealer, raised concerns about the program. GM confirmed to Reuters on Wednesday that the plan was scrapped, but declined to provide further insight into the decision.

The program aimed to help car dealers move EV inventory, a challenge made more difficult by the expiration of the federal tax credit. Currently, the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) estimates that approximately 135,000 to 140,000 electric vehicles remain unsold on dealer lots across the nation.

GM executives developed the program quickly, shortly before the subsidy expired. They were also tipped off that their rival, Ford, was planning a similar initiative.

Despite a surge of purchasing activity that drove record EV sales in September, industry experts and dealers expect a sharp decline in EV demand in the coming months.",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10092025-GM-Abandons-7500-EV-Program-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 15:03:24.821669

This September, Foley Hoag team members from across the United States participated in dozens of events at ClimateWeekNYC, Colorado Climate Week, and Houston Energy + Climate Startup Week. Our team left buzzing with energy and optimism. In New York, the momentum, collaboration, and shared purpose at the world’s largest annual climate gathering were truly inspiring. In Colorado and Texas, we saw the forefront of new technologies and new ideas about energy and climate that are impacting consumers, developers and policymakers across the country.

New York was rainy and humid, but our team trekked hundreds of miles across the city to engage in discussions across a wide range of topics. Gone is the frothiness of post-Inflation Reduction Act initiatives and we saw fewer pledges of ambitious decarbonization goals. Instead, many of the conversations focused on real-world immediate issues like load growth from data centers, strained grid systems, critical minerals supply, adaptation and resiliency, affordability of energy, and navigating a world with less federal support (or downright opposition).

In Colorado, our team facilitated discussions on the role of government relations and legal strategy in climatetech.

In Houston, we joined our friends at Greentown Labs and Activate in multiple days of demos and workshops focusing on new technologies for the energy transition.

Attorneys at Foley Hoag have been at the forefront of navigating the new climate landscape. As we head into another week of a government shut down, we’re working with private and public companies, nonprofits, and state and local agencies to work through new solutions to the problems of the day.

At this year’s New York Climate Week, our conversations focused on bringing people together to brainstorm practical solutions, and to connect the founders and funders that will build the energy infrastructure of the next several decades. Together with our colleagues and partners at Planeteer Capital, Earthshot Ventures, Activate, Molecule Group, Node Climate, Impact Capital Managers, Tailwind Futures, Resilience Company, Resilience Investments, Cleantech Leaders Climate Forum and the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition Institute, we dove into meaningful conversations on adaptation and resilience, clean fuels and corporate sustainability, FOAK technologies, and climate finance and investing—and even got an exciting preview of breakthrough green technologies poised to shape what’s next.",https://foleyhoag.com/getmedia/f2115ae7-c84f-4da1-aca8-9783f64f7359/Climate-Law-Matters_wind_insight_689x388.png?width=689&height=388&ext=.png,N,,2025-10-09 15:04:18.049955

Appropriations Showdown

The Federal government shutdown is continuing with no end in sight. The main sticking points are whether the funding bill should include the expiring increased tax credits for Affordable Care Act health insurance premiums enacted during Covid, reverse health policy changes enacted in the OBBBA, and prevent President Trump from using his statutory rescissions authority to eliminate spending previously agreed to under bipartisan spending deals.

The IRS announced on October 8 that the agency would begin an IRS-wide furlough for everyone except already-identified excepted and exempt employees. Bloomberg Tax reported that the IRS is furloughing nearly half of its workforce beginning Wednesday, October 8, 2025. The IRS is retaining employees working on the multi-trillion dollar tax law implementation, filing season, and IT.

In the days prior to the shutdown, Treasury and the IRS issued the 2025-2026 Priority Guidance Plan, and several pieces of tax guidance.

2025-2026 Priority Guidance Plan

On September 30, Treasury and the IRS issued the 2025-2026 Priority Guidance Plan. More specifically, the guidance was issued in a joint statement by Ken Kies, in his capacities as Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy and Acting IRS Chief Counsel, and Scott Bessent, in his capacity as Acting Commissioner of the IRS.

The plan lists 105 items, compared to the prior plan, which contained 231 items. As previewed by Deputy Assistant Secretary Kevn Salinger, the list is pared down to contain only items actually expected to be released this year, instead of the prior practice of including more aspirational items.

The plan is organized around Trump administration priorities: “OBBBA Implementation,” “Deregulation and Burden Reduction,” “Section 501(c)(3) Issues,” “Tribal Tax Issues,” “Digital Assets,” and “Secure 2.0 Act and Other Guidance.” Priority guidance plans under the Biden administration were organized by subject area, such as “Consolidated Returns,” “Corporations and Their Shareholders,” “Employee Benefits,” etc. During the first Trump administration, the plans contained both elements, with the opening sections organized around administration priorities, followed by a section called “General Guidance” organized by subject area.

“OBBBA Implementation” has 40 items: “Deregulation and Burden Reduction” contains 46 items. Of note, the two 501(c)(3) Issues are (1) “application of the fundamental public policy against racial discrimination, including consideration of recent caselaw, in determining the eligibility of private schools for recognition of tax-exempt status under §501(c)(3)” and (2) the Johnson Amendment. More details on the Johnson Amendment are provided in Sullivan & Cromwell’s memo “Revisiting the Johnson Amendment – ‘Electoral Politics Viewed Through the Lens of Religious Faith’.”

IRS Comments on Tips and Overtime

The IRS said employers that make a good faith effort to report tips and overtime pay for 2025 will not be subject to penalties even if the reporting is imperfect under guidance that the government is currently writing. This is according to Paul Ferrell, Senior Adviser to the IRS Director of National Public Liaison, speaking on a monthly call with the payroll industry on October 2. As noted in this S&C memo, the government released proposed regulations listing occupations that qualify for the OBBBA provision on qualified tips. The IRS previously announced that it would not update the W-2 for tax year 2025 to take into account OBBBA changes. Draft forms for tax year 2026 have contained changes to reflect the OBBBA. The two OBBBA provisions are included in the 2025-2026 Priority Guidance Plan released on September 30, 2025.

Spin-offs and Reorganizations

On September 29, 2025, Treasury and the IRS withdrew prior guidance on certain aspects of corporate spin-offs and other reorganizations. The September 29 withdrawal removed twosets of proposed regulations published on January 16, 2025. Relatedly, the same day the government also released Revenue Procedure 2025-30, which supersedes Rev. Proc. 2024-24, modifies Rev. Proc. 2025-1 and Rev. Proc. 2017-52, and revokes Notice 2024-38.

More details on the September 29 guidance are provided in Sullivan & Cromwell’s memo “IRS Withdraws Proposed Regulations on Spin-Off Transactions and Reorganizations.” The prior guidance was described in S&C’s memo, “IRS Issues Proposed Regulations on Spin-Off Transactions and Reorganizations.”

CAMT Guidance

On September 30, Treasury and the IRS issued Notice 2025-46 and Notice 2025-49, two pieces of guidance on the corporate alternative minimum book tax (“CAMT”) enacted as Section 10101 of the Inflation Reduction Act. A more detailed discussion on such guidance is provided in Sullivan & Cromwell’s memo, “IRS Issues Interim Guidance on Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax.”

Final Regulations on Interest Capitalization Rules

On October 2, Treasury and the IRS released final regulations on the interest capitalization rules.

The regulations remove the associated property rule and similar rules regarding the requirements for improvements that constitute designated property. The regulations also modify the definition of “improvement” and modify other rules to take into account the removal of the associated property rule.

The regulations largely adopt proposed regulations issued on May 15, 2025, with only minor, clarifying changes.

The regulations are effective October 2, 2025, the day they were published in the Federal Register.

Senate Finance Committee Hearing on Digital Assets

The Senate Finance Committee held a hearing, “Examining the Taxation of Digital Assets,” on October 1, 2025. The Committee hosted a panel of four witnesses: two industry representatives, Jason Somensatto, Director of Policy at Coin Center, and Lawrence Zlatkin, Vice President, Tax, of Coinbase; a tax lawyer, Andrea S. Kramer, Founding Member of ASKramer Law LLC; and a CPA, Annette Nellen, Chair, Digital Assets Tax Task Force, AICPA. The panel urged Congress to provide greater clarity on the tax treatment of digital assets, and generally focused on three issues.

First, whether there should be a de minimis exception from gain or loss recognition when using digital currency to make purchases. Proponents of a de minimis exception call this: “you shouldn’t need a tax accountant to buy a cup of coffee.” Under current rules, when the holder of a digital asset uses the asset to make a purchase, they are deemed to sell the asset, which triggers recognition of gain or loss. Treating small-dollar transactions as sales for tax purposes can be a considerable recordkeeping and reporting burden. For this reason, some of the witnesses generally endorsed a de minimis exception. However, Ms. Kramer noted that taxpayers would still have to track transactions to know whether they are below the de minimis level. The witnesses compared the de minimis exception to the existing exception under section 988(e), which addresses transactions in foreign currencies.

Second, the tax treatment of staking rewards (also called block rewards or mining awards). Some blockchain currencies rely on parties to stake (or lock up) some amount of cryptocurrency to validate transactions. This process helps prevent fraud and supports the decentralized nature of the blockchain. In exchange, “stakers” receive new crypto from each transaction validated, called a staking reward. The IRS has published guidance under Rev. Rul. 2023-14, which treats staking rewards as income upon receipt. Staking usually involves “locking up” some amount of cryptocurrency to validate transactions. Thus, stakers may not have the ability to sell their newly acquired asset. Critics of the IRS rule state that this creates “dry income” and might encourage stakers to move to more tax-friendly jurisdictions. Some witnesses called for the reversal of Rev. Rul. 2023-14 and capital gains treatment for block rewards, with gain recognition triggered only upon disposition of the asset. Ms. Kramer argued that the block rewards constitute compensation from a third party that should be treated as taxable income.

Third, the reporting requirements for digital asset transactions of more than $10,000 in value. The Infrastructure and Jobs Act of 2021 applied the section 6050I rule for reporting transactions of cash in excess of $10,000 to digital assets. Some witnesses argued that because cryptocurrency is a decentralized financial system where counterparties may have limited to no access to the identity of the payor, the reporting rules should not apply or at least should apply at a higher threshold.

There was a general bipartisan consensus at the hearing on the need to develop appropriate legislation for the taxation of digital assets, but disagreement as to what that means. Republican Senators generally agreed that new taxpayer-friendly tax legislation would lead to increased innovation, while Democratic Senators criticized these proposals as providing advantageous tax treatment and circumventing rules in place to detect money laundering.

Chairman Mike Crapo (R - ID) asked Mr. Zlatkin about parity of legal treatment between crypto and traditional finance. Mr. Zlatkin stated that crypto currency must be placed on an even playing field with traditional finance and the most durable way to accomplish that is through legislation, not agency guidance.

In response to a question from Senator Daines (R - MT), Mr. Somensatto said the tax treatment of staking rewards is the most problematic aspect of current law. Mr. Zlatkin stated that sourcing rules for staking rewards also encourage foreign investors to remain overseas. Senator Todd Young (R - IN) confirmed with Mr. Somensatto his position that the IRS should rescind the guidance in Rev. Rul. 2023-14. Senator Young also confirmed with Mr. Zlatkin his position that the retraction of Rev. Rul. 2023-14 would attract mining activity to the United States. Senator Bill Cassidy (R - LA) sought the witnesses’ opinions on addressing the usage of the blockchain to monetize patients’ health data.

Democratic Senators expressed skepticism about the changes proposed by the witnesses. Ranking Member Ron Wyden’s (D - OR) questions to Ms. Kramer indicated skepticism towards the de minimis exception and the character of staking rewards. De minimis exceptions, it seemed to him, would require the same amount of recordkeeping as the current regime requires to prove taxpayers complied with the exception. Ms. Kramer agreed.

Senator Elizabeth Warren (D - MA) criticized digital asset lobbyists for seeking special favorable tax treatment not applicable to other types of assets. Senator Warren stated that the de minimis exception proposal would cost the government $5.8 billion, and the staking reward proposal would cost $4.3 billion. Furthermore, she stated there is no good reason to exempt the digital assets industry from reporting requirements for transactions in excess of $10,000. Senators Maggie Hassan (D - NH) and Tina Smith (D - MN) echoed Senator Warren’s concerns. Senator Whitehouse (D - RI) criticized the digital asset industry for placing higher demands on energy grids, increasing energy costs for average Americans, expanding the use of fossil fuels, and supporting President Trump’s efforts to eliminate tax incentives for green energy. Senator Wyden associated himself with those remarks.

Some of the witnesses advocated on behalf of provisions in S. 2207 (introduced by Senator Cynthia Lummis (R - WY)), which would, amongst other provisions, create a $300 threshold under which any gain or loss from the sale of digital assets would be excluded from gross income up to an annual $5,000 cap, and also exclude staking rewards from income until sale or disposition.

On the House side, Rep. Max Miller (R - OH) is working on a bill addressing the taxation of digital assets, with highlights listed in this S&C memo. The Oversight Subcommittee of the Committee on Ways and Means held a hearing on “Making America the Crypto Capital of the World: Ensuring Digital Asset Policy Built for the 21st Century” on July 16.

The US government has withdrawn both domestically and globally from climate and clean energy engagement, marked by a dismantling of foreign development assistance, proposed rollbacks of the Inflation Reduction Act, and aggressive tariffs – all of which undermine the possibility of bilateral clean energy and climate collaboration with Southeast Asian nations.

Southeast Asian countries must now reassess external partnerships, as US policy reversals threaten climate financing and access to US markets, where previously Southeast Asian companies may have had easier access to pursue business opportunities in keeping with US’s climate and clean energy goals.

China’s historic climate-related finance in the region has far outpaced that of the US, particularly in infrastructure-heavy projects. Therefore, the loss of US climate finance may not be detrimental in the near-term but does undermine the region’s support of environmental governance, and civil society and institutional capacity to pursue its climate efforts.

Alternative avenues for cooperation are emerging, including potentially strengthened ties with the European Union, subnational partnerships, and private sector engagement – particularly from US tech giants whose rising data centre investments could drive demand for regional clean energy generation.

Despite US disengagement, the future of US-Southeast Asia climate cooperation may lie in non-traditional channels. The possibility for future collaboration between US and Southeast Asian counterparts is not completely dead, but will require more creative ways in order to find overlapping interests and avenues for financing.

INTRODUCTION

In the months since Trump’s inauguration, what began as a sharp departure from prior norms has settled into a broader realignment of US engagement with the world, and with Southeast Asia in particular. From the dismantling of USAID[1] to the imposition of sweeping tariffs[2] across the region, recent actions reflect a diminished US commitment to climate and clean energy cooperation, as well as to broader frameworks of international support. For countries in Southeast Asia, this moment calls for recalibration. While the long-term geopolitical consequences remain uncertain, one thing is increasingly clear: the United States can no longer be relied upon as a stable or sustained partner in advancing regional climate and clean energy goals.

At one point, prior to the 2024 US presidential election, there was cautious optimism that Southeast Asian clean energy and technology firms could serve as strategic partners in helping the United States meet its decarbonisation goals under its bipartisan Inflation Reduction Act and infrastructure legislation.[3] Southeast Asian firms were seen as potential middle-ground suppliers of clean technologies—positioned to profit from US consumer demand while supporting American decarbonisation targets under the IRA and infrastructure legislation. This prospect now looks increasingly tenuous, as the Trump administration has moved aggressively to dismantle federal climate initiatives, including clean energy tax credits[4] for wind, solar, battery storage and EVs.[5] The ripple effects are already being felt: Vietnamese automaker VinFast, once poised to capitalise on these policies and the implicit growth in US consumer demand for cheaper EVs, has postponed its North Carolina factory until 2028, citing uncertain demand among broader questions about the impacts of proposed tariffs on production costs.[6]

These dynamics underscore a broader shift already underway: Southeast Asia is being forced to reconsider the reliability and strategic value of its external partners in the clean energy transition. As the US swings back towards expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure and trade hostility, what is becoming clear is that the demand for foreign-produced clean energy technologies will inevitably shrink. Unfortunately, Southeast Asia’s clean energy firms are caught in this crossfire. Proposed US tariffs, for example those targeting solar equipment and photovoltaics manufactured in Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam, were proposed to be as high as 3,521% in some cases, based on allegations of Chinese firms circumventing trade restrictions by routing manufacturing through Southeast Asia.[7] The US-Vietnam trade deal signed in early July,[8] however, signals a willingness amongst some Southeast Asian countries to negotiate with the US to ease the burden of these high tariffs. The upshot, even with a 20% tariff for Vietnam exports to the US, could mean that Vietnam remains a cheaper import source for US clean energy technology needs, leaving the door open for future collaboration.

Beyond the immediate loss of economic opportunity, another consequence of Trump’s abrupt policy shifts is the loss of US foreign aid, which had served, albeit modestly, as a counterweight to China’s growing influence in Southeast Asia. The region must now reassess its broader architecture of climate finance and international cooperation, particularly considering that nearly all have declared a net-zero climate pledge[9] that will require the massive adoption of clean energy technologies and fossil-free power infrastructure. The Asian Development Bank estimates US$210 billion is needed annually through 2030 in climate investment and will require a mix of financing to meet, due to the insufficiency of government funding in the region.[10] In this Perspective, we examine how the landscape of climate investment in Southeast Asia is shifting, beginning with a comparison of US and Chinese financing flows. While the US national government may be retreating from international cooperation at the federal level, opportunities may exist for the private sector and subnational governments to potentially fill the void left by the US federal government. We examine these prospects and potential challenges for these collaborations as well.

US VS. CHINA CLIMATE INVESTMENTS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA

What kind of climate partnership have China and the United States actually offered Southeast Asia? A closer look at the patterns of climate-related financing reveals stark differences in both scale and focus. China has provided the lion’s share of climate finance in the region, far surpassing US contributions. According to the Lowy Institute’s Southeast Asia Aid Map,[11] China spent approximately US$11.62 billion in climate-related financing between 2008 and 2025 (Figure 1). Although this represents less than 20% of China’s total investment in the region, 97% of those climate-related funds were directed toward large-scale infrastructure projects, primarily hydropower and energy transmission. In contrast, US climate-related financing has been far smaller in volume (Figure 2) and has largely prioritised soft infrastructure: supporting governance reforms, institutional capacity, environmental safeguards, and civil society engagement.

Yet while China’s investments increasingly dominate the region’s hard infrastructure landscape, the US has historically played a critical, if less tangible role in supporting Southeast Asia’s institutional foundations for climate action. US climate financing spent between 2008-2025 has totalled less than US$1 billion (current USD), with spending on human development (19%) and infrastructure (25%). The remaining 60% of climate-related spending primarily went to support general environmental protection and government and civil society support. This focus on “soft infrastructure” aligns with broader US commitments to capacity building and governance support[12] – areas where the US had pledged or spent US$7.24 billion. Considering foreign assistance cuts alone, we identified a total of 2,121 ongoing 2025 fiscal year climate-related awards[13] for ASEAN countries that have already been eliminated or may be at risk, totalling more than US$124 million (Table 1). There are additional grants beyond fiscal year 2025, as well as areas of cooperation not covered here, that may also be at risk of cancellation. This could include multi-year initiatives such as the US–ASEAN Smart Cities Partnership (USASCP),[14] launched in 2018, among others.

Table 1. US foreign assistance of climate-related funding at risk of elimination

(Data source: USAspending.gov, 2025).[15]

The current US administration’s proposed FY2026 budget, which eliminates climate funding, would not only halt bilateral climate finance but also slash US contributions to multilateral development banks (MDBs) and mechanisms like the Green Climate Fund[16] and the coal-to-clean-energy Just Energy Transition Partnership[17] that included Indonesia and Vietnam (Table 2). These US funding withdrawals would immediately shrink the pool of grants, concessional loans, and risk-sharing tools, such as ADB’s Innovative Finance Facility for Climate (IF-CAP) mechanism, that ASEAN countries rely on to fund clean energy and infrastructure projects. It would also impact US influence within institutions like the World Bank, IMF, IFC, and ADB, where voting power is tied to financial contributions. As of December 2023, the US and Japan were the largest ADB shareholders. With the US pulling back, there is a growing risk that MDB priorities could shift[18] toward less climate-aligned agendas, compounding financing challenges for Southeast Asia’s energy transition.

CAN CHINA FILL THE DEVELOPMENT FINANCING GAP WITHOUT UNDERMINING REGIONAL AUTONOMY?

With the scaling back of US financing, China is rapidly positioning itself to fill the gap. China has steadily expanded its presence in Southeast Asia, not only through infrastructure investment but also through humanitarian aid and political signalling.[31] President Xi Jinping’s April 2025 Southeast Asia tour was accompanied by new agreements covering trade, infrastructure, digital economy and green development, among other largely symbolic areas of cooperation with Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia.[32] Even before these new agreements, the Lowy Institute showed that China was already surpassing the United States as the world’s largest bilateral development financier by commitment volume.[33] The number of countries where China’s Official Development Finance (ODF)[34] exceeds that of the US has nearly doubled, from 44 to 84, while America’s lead has shrunk from 98 to just 52 countries.

In this context, Southeast Asian governments are increasingly confronting what a long-term shift in aid and growing ties with China, given US withdrawal, might mean. As others have argued,[35] the loss of US aid is not necessarily insurmountable, but it raises critical questions about rising dependency on China. With the US no longer acting as a consistent or reliable partner, opinion has wavered between China and the US as the prevailing partner of choice.[36] Of particular salience is what a growing interdependence with China to meet climate and decarbonisation goals might mean, given that China committed approximately US$3 billion for renewable energy projects between 2019 and 2030, with much of the funding directed toward hydropower initiatives along the Mekong River in Laos and Vietnam, alongside significant investments in EV battery production in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand.[37]

While China could fill the gap in some of the green capacity-building aspects left by the US, providing Southeast Asia with much needed expertise[38] for building out renewable energy power systems, grid infrastructure, and public-private partnerships to grow financing for climate-related projects, this deepening reliance also carries strategic risks. Chief among them is the concern that Chinese dominance in clean tech sectors might crowd out the ability of Southeast Asian firms to build their own capacity and for governments to shape and implement their own green industrial strategies. This dynamic is already present in the EV sector, where Chinese firms like BYD have rapidly secured a strong foothold in Thailand and is expanding in Vietnam, raising concerns about the long-term viability of decarbonisation strategies focused on domestic green industrial policies throughout Southeast Asia.[39] This complexity and potential dependency is one reason—in addition to the fact that US foreign direct investment into ASEAN represented a sizeable percentage at 32.4% of the region’s total FDI flows in 2023[40]—why Southeast Asian countries have not yet closed the door to the US and are still seeking ways to continue to partner.

OPENING THE DOOR TO OTHER PARTNERSHIPS

Given the strategic risks of deepening dependence on China with respect to climate and clean energy cooperation,[41] where else could Southeast Asian countries explore alternative avenues for financing and collaboration? Certainly, America’s retreat has created an opportunity for the region to diversify its alliances, with the European Union (EU) emerging as a promising partner. Negotiations for bilateral free trade agreements between the EU and Southeast Asian countries, including Malaysia,[42] the Philippines, and Indonesia, which had stalled for nearly a decade, signal a renewed interest in strengthening economic ties. For the EU, the US’s retreat creates an opportunity to position itself as a more attractive partner for Southeast Asia. Malaysia has gained momentum as a regional leader in green hydrogen projects,[43] while Indonesia’s abundant reserves of nickel and other rare earth elements are essential for green technologies, including solar panels and electric vehicle batteries. Since Indonesia banned nickel exports in 2020,[44] any near-term EU “secure access” will likely depend on Chinese-built or partnered facilities, as Chinese firms currently control about 75% of Indonesia’s refining capacity.[45] In the longer term, however, the EU–Indonesia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA)—if implemented as announced—could strengthen critical-minerals supply chains based on “responsible supply” and “local value creation.”[46] Early corporate initiatives, such as the INA/Danantara–Eramet memorandum of understanding to develop upstream-to-downstream projects with financing and technical expertise, signal intent to support Indonesia’s downstream ambitions.[47] These opportunities give Indonesia leverage to negotiate a trade deal that enhances its domestic refining capacity.

Another promising avenue for cooperation lies at the subnational level. The UN Climate Secretariat has recorded more than 40,000 companies, private investors, and subnational governments pursuing their own climate efforts.[48] These actors and networks create subnational linkages that could birth new opportunities for collaboration, knowledge-sharing, and partnerships with Southeast Asian subnational counterparts. This decentralised approach offers a pathway for advancing clean energy and climate collaboration without the need to navigate challenging, broader geopolitics. The US’s experience with innovative financing models, such as municipal green bonds and state-level green banks, provides valuable frameworks that Southeast Asian cities could adapt to accelerate their own climate action. For instance, Connecticut’s pioneering green bank model demonstrates how public-private financing mechanisms can be localised to mobilise investment in clean energy and climate resilience across the region, particularly for small businesses.[49] In Southeast Asia, US subnational counterparts have much to learn, from Singapore’s urban heat management strategies to region-wide nature-based climate solutions like mangrove restoration, and ASEAN’s efforts to enhance renewable energy adoption through grid interconnectivity.[50]

But what is the appetite among US subnational actors to collaborate with Southeast Asian counterparts? The US-ASEAN Smart Cities Partnership offers a promising example. In October 2024, the initiative launched the Smart Cities Business Innovation Fund 2.0, which is aimed at supporting net-zero urban innovation projects and low-carbon solutions for SMEs across ASEAN countries. As of February 2025, the fund, totalling US$3 million, was still actively seeking proposals, signalling ongoing interest and potential for subnational engagement beyond federal-level diplomacy. Subnational governments in both the US and ASEAN face similar climate-related challenges, from urban heat to natural hazard risks to the need to identify nature-based solutions. With US subnational governments impacted by federal budget cuts, particularly through proposed cuts to the IRA, cities are searching far and wide for innovative and creative ways to advance and implement climate actions while juggling budget deficits and other competing priorities.

POTENTIAL EXPANDED ROLE FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR?

Outside of subnational governments, the next few years could see growing influence of private US companies playing a role in Southeast Asia’s clean energy sector and decarbonisation efforts. Tech giants including Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon, are all looking to expand operations in Southeast Asia as demand for data centres and cloud computing services increases with the rapid development and expansion of AI technologies. Thailand has already approved three data centre projects totalling US$2.7 billion in cost.[51] The surging energy demand to power these data centres is also driving new investments in clean power. From rooftop solar PPAs in Singapore[52] to a 210 MW solar deal in Indonesia,[53] these firms are seeking to offset the growth in electricity demand through investments in renewables. However, with ASEAN’s data centre capacity expected to nearly triple by 2030,[54] current corporate clean energy deals only cover about 15% of the 2.9 GW projected demand.[55] This gap highlights that, while there is certainly scope for private companies, particularly major technology firms, to play a new and growing role in Southeast Asia’s decarbonisation, significant expansion in clean energy procurement, grid modernisation, and enabling policy frameworks will be necessary to ensure that the region’s digital growth aligns with its climate goals.

MOVING FORWARD – IS THERE A SILVER LINING?

One silver lining of President Trump’s second term so far is the clarity it provides for Southeast Asia’s path forward: the once-competitive landscape now lacks half of the equation. While this shift represents a significant loss for the United States and a broader setback for global climate progress, especially given its disproportionate share of greenhouse gas emissions, it also removes some of the geopolitical ambiguity that has long complicated regional decision-making. In many ways, this moment merely formalises a reality that has existed for years: the US has never been a dominant clean energy or climate actor in Southeast Asia. Its engagement has historically been limited, fragmented, and highly dependent on shifting administrations.

Yet this does not mean that US-Southeast Asia collaboration is without a future. In fact, stepping outside the bilateral clean energy frame may reveal new opportunities. Subnational partnerships, technology co-development, nature-based climate solutions, digital infrastructure, and academic and private-sector innovation are all domains where shared interests remain strong. Collaboration in mutually-defined priorities, of which there are many when it comes to climate change and clean energy, can endure despite shifting political headwinds. In particular, Southeast Asia’s rapid digital transformation and the rise of data centre–driven energy demand present a unique opening for US companies, institutions, and cities to partner on decarbonisation, climate resilience, and sustainable urban development. In this new chapter of US-Southeast Asia relations, redefining climate cooperation around these adjacent spaces, rather than competing head-to-head with China, may prove more pragmatic, and ultimately, more productive.

From the September / October 2025 Issue

We’ve been proud to be named CNBC’s Top State for Business for three of the last four years, and one of the reasons for that is North Carolina’s strength in providing companies an educated and well-prepared workforce, thanks to our nationally recognized universities, community colleges, and workforce development programs. From reliable infrastructure to a politically stable business climate, North Carolina offers companies the practical advantages to compete and grow in the long haul.

BF: What are the leading industries in North Carolina?

Chung: North Carolina’s economy is anchored by a diverse mix of thriving industries, with significant momentum in several targeted growth sectors in 2025.

North Carolina’s life sciences sector continues to expand, powered by a strong research ecosystem, world-class universities, and a skilled workforce. Global companies like Genentech are deepening their presence, including a recent $700 million investment to build a new manufacturing plant. This facility reinforces the state’s reputation as a leader in biotechnology, precision medicine, and advanced manufacturing while creating significant jobs for the local community.

The aerospace industry is taking flight in North Carolina, fueled by its strategic location, deep manufacturing expertise, and robust supply chain. Pratt & Whitney’s advanced manufacturing operations exemplify the state’s competitive edge in producing next-generation jet engines and aerospace components. Notably, the company recently expanded its Asheville plant with a $285 million investment, creating new high-tech jobs and strengthening the region’s aerospace ecosystem.

Most recently, JetZero’s historic announcement of 14,000+ new jobs in the central part of the state, at the Piedmont Triad International Airport, cements Greensboro and the airport as a hub for aerospace innovation and advanced manufacturing.

With the global transition to sustainable power accelerating, North Carolina has emerged as a hub for clean energy innovation and manufacturing. Industry leaders such as Toyota are making major commitments, including a $13.9 billion investment in a battery manufacturing facility that will create more than 5,000 new jobs. These projects position North Carolina at the forefront of advanced battery production, electric vehicle technology, and renewable energy infrastructure.

Looking ahead, these industries will remain central to North Carolina’s economic development strategy, with continued focus on innovation, workforce development, and infrastructure investments to support growth.

While life sciences, aerospace, and clean energy are leading drivers, North Carolina’s portfolio continues to broaden. Financial services and fintech are expanding, with the city of Charlotte anchoring the sector as the nation’s second largest banking center. Citigroup Technology’s $16 million investment, creating more than 500 jobs, is a recent announcement that underscores the region’s importance as an office and headquarters hub post-pandemic.

By leveraging its talent and technology assets, and remaining adaptable to emerging trends, we hope to keep North Carolina well-positioned to attract more diverse investments, grow its economy, and create even more high-quality jobs for North Carolinians.

BF: What are recent developments site selection teams should know about when it comes to the business climate?

Chung: North Carolina’s business climate remains highly attractive, no matter the political or policy season. Since taking office in January, Governor Stein has announced business expansions and new projects totaling nearly $17 billion in capital investment, even in a year with major federal policy shifts and some uncertainty related to tariffs and FDI commitments. These initiatives are expected to create more than 20,000 well-paying jobs, underscoring the state’s strong economic momentum and pro-business environment. Site selection teams should note North Carolina’s competitive incentives, skilled workforce, and strategic location, all of which continue to draw major companies and drive sustained growth.

BF: What is a recent project relocation or expansion you’d like to share?

Chung: This past June JetZero, a California-based commercial aviation innovator, chose Greensboro, North Carolina, for its first U.S. manufacturing facility. The company is making a $4.7 billion investment at Piedmont Triad International Airport, creating over 14,000 jobs, the largest job announcement in the state’s history.

The facility will produce JetZero’s innovative Z4 aircraft, blended-wing commercial plane designed to be up to 50% more fuel-efficient than traditional jets. The groundbreaking is planned for the first half of 2026, with production slated to begin in the early 2030s.

This project underscores North Carolina’s growing prominence in advanced manufacturing, aerospace, and clean energy innovation, and serves as a perfect example of how North Carolina’s local, regional, and statewide economic development teams; university, community college and workforce development programs; and governmental officials, from the local level all the way to the state legislature and Governor’s office, work together to bring great jobs to the state.

BF: What is a quality of life highlight to be found in North Carolina?

Chung: North Carolina offers an exceptional quality of life, blending affordability, natural beauty, and vibrant communities. With a cost of living that is 5% below the national average and ranking as the nation’s #4 fastest-growing state, it’s easy to see why people are drawn here. Residents enjoy scenic mountains, bustling city skylines, and 300 miles of beautiful beaches.

Having personally relocated to North Carolina from the midwest nearly a decade ago, I’ve found North Carolina to be an outstanding place to raise a family, with so many opportunities to enjoy the outdoors, see historic sites, and (my favorite) spend time off in the beautiful Outer Banks.

BF: What does the future hold?

Chung: North Carolina’s future continues to be bright, with continued growth across diverse industries and emerging sectors anticipated. The state is one that consistently leads the pack in innovation and opportunity, and North Carolina’s skilled workforce, pro-business climate, and strategic location will continue to support new investments, job creation, and economic diversification. North Carolina has a strong track record of attracting overseas companies, with international projects consistently making up more than 40% of the state’s pipeline.

As North Carolina’s role in the global economy continues to grow, we remain equally committed to supporting the expansion of homegrown companies and fueling the entrepreneurial ventures drawn here by our strong economy and highly skilled workforce. This balanced approach ensures that North Carolina continues to thrive as both a global investment destination and a hub for local innovation.",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/nc-christopher-chung-headshot-web.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 13:09:12.463289

From September 12–14, 2025, we participated in the 2025 N.C. Plant Science Initiative (PSI) Hackathon at NC State University. The annual event gives undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral scholars the chance to demonstrate their skills in a competition to solve ag tech-related challenges. With the goal to accelerate agricultural research using data analytics, machine learning, and hardware fabrication, the Hackathon has multiple tracks and is inclusive to participants with various levels of experience.

Our project asked a straightforward question: Which crops are best suited for North Carolina when climate and soil are considered together? We set out to connect climate history, soil information, and crop records to produce practical, data-driven insights.

Our team was intentionally interdisciplinary: Titilayo and I are Ph.D. students in Geospatial Analytics, Kashish Grover is a Ph.D. student in Horticultural Science program, and Jerry Yu is a graduate student in Statistics. This mix shaped every decision we made throughout the Hackathon. While we focused on data integration, mapping, and spatial reasoning, Kashish grounded our choices in agronomic realities, and Jerry guided the extraction of soil metrics. We jointly make decisions about modelling, evaluation, and predictions while structuring our presentation to reflect the insights gained from the data, the challenges encountered, and what we would have done differently if given more time.

The work unfolded in three steps. First, we conducted careful exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns, gaps, and inconsistencies. Second, we built AI/ML baselines to relate climate and soil factors to crop yields, and we reviewed historical records to highlight major crop failure events. Finally, we used those relationships to forecast top candidate crops for North Carolina’s conditions. The goal was not just prediction, but clarity—what factors matter most, where, and why.

A key lesson for both of us was balance. In short time frames, it is tempting to favor modeling over understanding. We found the opposite is true: strong modeling depends on first knowing the data well, its scales, spatial context, quality, and missingness. Going forward, we plan to devote proportionally more time to EDA while reserving enough time for modeling.

The experience was also a bridge across fields. We each learned outside our comfort zones: we deepened our understanding of agricultural constraints, and our teammates engaged with geospatial structure and uncertainty. This exchange gave the project direction and helped us present results that could be useful to stakeholders, not just technically sound.

We participated in the Advanced Level track, “Grow Thy Crop.” Participants hacked climate data to identify the top five crops best suited for North Carolina. They developed AI/ML models to analyze crop yields using historical and current climate data, while also identifying major crop failure events in history.

We are grateful that our work was recognized with first place in the Advanced Track, but the most important outcomes were the skills we built and the connections we made. Thank you to the Plant Sciences Initiative (PSI) as well as all the funding organizations for creating an environment where collaboration across disciplines is possible and encouraged.

Carbon capture and storage is the process of capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from industrial sources and safely storing the CO2 deep underground in naturally occurring rock formations. Currently, companies seeking to build these projects must go through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for permits, a process that can take years and discourage investment.

On October 1, 2025, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) issued Order No. 913 (the “Order”) as a Direct Final Rule implementing Executive Order 14270, “Zero‑Based Regulatory Budgeting to Unleash American Energy.”

The Order targets 53 outdated, “seldomly used,” or duplicative regulations, inserting conditional sunset provisions that will phase them out one year after the rule’s effective date—unless FERC extends the deadline by up to five years after soliciting and considering public comments on the costs and benefits of the regulations. The Order takes effect 45 days after publication in the Federal Register.

Two changes in particular apply to (1) certain transmission service applicants and (2) entities seeking to self-certify their exempt wholesale generator (“EWG”) or foreign utility company (“FUCO”) status. These changes will not impact any substantive requirements for these entities but will slightly relax the filing process by eliminating language regarding providing a form of notice of such filings.

18 C.F.R. § 36.1(b)(1) – Transmission Service Application Notices

Section 36.1(b)(1) of FERC’s regulations currently requires an applicant seeking transmission service under Section 211 of the Federal Power Act to include with its application a form of notice of the application suitable for publication in the Federal Register in accordance with the requirements of Section 385.203(d) of FERC’s regulations. That section, in turn, requires a “draft notice in accordance with the form of notice specifications prescribed by the Secretary and posted on the Commission’s website under Filing Procedures.”

Change:

This subsection will automatically sunset one year after the effective date of the Order unless extended. Once sunsetted, applicants for Section 211 transmission services will no longer be bound by this notice requirement.

Impact:

Applications under Section 211 require a notice containing information about the transmission service requested and the facilities involved be provided to the parties potentially affected by the request, such as the transmission facilities owner, the relevant ISO/RTO, the interconnecting utility, and the state’s public utility commission. These requirements are set forth in Section 36.1(b)(2) of FERC’s regulations and are not changing. However, eliminating the form of notice requirement under Section 36.1(b)(1) will streamline the application process and relieve the filers from the requirement to follow an older notice format.

18 C.F.R. § 366.7 – EWG and FUCO Filings

Section 366.7 of FERC’s regulations outlines procedures for obtaining EWG or FUCO status. Similarly to Section 36.1(b), Sections 366.7(a) and (b) require entities seeking to obtain EWG or FUCO status – either through a notice of self-certification or a petition for a declaratory order – to include a form of notice suitable for publication in the Federal Register in accordance with the specifications of Section 385.203(d) of FERC’s regulations.

Change:

These mandatory Federal Register form of notice provisions in Sections 366.7(a) and (b) will automatically sunset one year after the effective date of the rule unless extended.

Impact:

This change has limited practical significance. FERC previously provided guidance that, at least in connection with a notice of self-certification of EWG or FUCO status, a form of notice is no longer required, stating that “[a]lthough the Commission’s regulations specify that a notice of self-certification should include a form of notice of the filing suitable for publication in the Federal Register, 18 C.F.R. § 366.7(a), it is no longer necessary to submit this form of notice.” However, removing this requirement from the regulations will align them with FERC’s current practice and will reduce confusion among filers.

Bottom Line:

A response to a broader deregulatory push by the current administration to reduce unnecessary compliance burdens, Order No. 913 provides a measure of “regulatory housekeeping,” removing certain obsolete or duplicative provisions and seeking to make the regulations more consistent with current FERC practice. With respect to Section 211 transmission service requests and EWG and FUCO filings, the Order does not change any of the substantive requirements for such filings, but removes the form of notice requirement from FERC’s regulations, thus simplifying and modernizing the regulations and, perhaps in some cases, streamlining the filing process.

Beyond Yale at Climate Week For Yale, Climate Week represented one integral element of a broader initiative focused on building scalable solutions to planetary challenges.
By bringing together expertise from across disciplines and professions, Yale is helping shape the collaborative frameworks that lasting climate solutions demand, said Sara Smiley Smith, the assistant provost for planetary solutions.","Hundreds of Yale scholars, students, and alumni joined policymakers, business leaders, artists, and researchers from around the country and world last month for Yale at Climate Week, the university’s second annual summit in New York City convening diverse voices to shape scalable solutions to climate challenges.

During a two-day event (Sept. 24-25), the Yale Club of New York City was transformed into a hub of action and collaboration during Climate Week NYC, the largest climate event of its kind. Over more than 20 sessions, Yale Planetary Solutions (YPS) – the university’s campuswide initiative uniting leaders across disciplines to catalyze solutions to the greatest threats facing people and planet – brought together changemakers from across the political spectrum and society to participate in events that spanned law, economics, engineering, medicine, public health, policy, and the humanities.

“For a few days every fall, thousands come from across the country and around the globe to discuss, debate, and drive real progress toward a sustainable future. And Yale is proud to be part of it,” Yale President Maurie McInnis said during her opening remarks. “We know the national climate conversation can feel divided. But even as conversations change, our shared goals remain the same: healthier communities; stronger economies; a better world for our children. That’s the common ground upon which we can build a sustainable future.”

A bipartisan commitment to progress

The call for common ground framed the conversation over the next two days. The summit’s opening night featured a bipartisan panel of current and former members of Congress on “Rebuilding Bipartisanship in the U.S. Environmental Movement.”

Anthony Leiserowitz, the JoshAni-TomKat Professor of Climate Communication at Yale School of the Environment and director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, led a conversation with U.S. Rep. Bruce Westerman ’01 M.F., an Arkansas Republican, former U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu, a Louisiana Democrat, and former U.S. representatives Carlos Curbelo (a Florida Republican) and Stephanie Murphy (a Florida Democrat), about the opportunity for bipartisan cooperation in enacting enduring climate policies.

Westerman, who chairs the House Committee on Natural Resources (and says he’s the only forester in the current Congress), discussed forest management as one such example.

“A healthy forest has benefits for everyone,” he said. “You can clean air; you can clean water; you get better wildlife habitat; you get better recreation opportunities. I often tell people there are no downsides to having a healthy forest.”

Building a bipartisan initiative to support healthy forests, he added, can serve as a model for cooperation in other critical areas.

Leiserowitz also noted data showing broad consensus among Americans on various climate solutions, including support for investing in clean energy research, helping farmers store carbon in soils, implementing a carbon-based tax on imports, and expanding tree planting initiatives. Panelists agreed that environmental challenges — from extreme weather to air and water pollution — are affecting communities nationwide, creating shared incentives for action.

“My hope is that representatives see that this isn’t a geographic issue. It’s happening within red states and blue states,” said Murphy. “My hope is that it lights a fire under us to actually do something about it because we feel it in local communities.”

Climate action, the panelists stressed, cannot be the domain of one party or one discipline — a consistent theme that other panelists, attendees, and members of the Yale community returned to over the course of the Yale Club events.

Turning research into real-world impact

From rethinking decarbonization strategies to examining how climate change affects human health and psychology, sessions showcased how Yale research is driving change across industries.

Led by the Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture (YCNCC), panelists described how Yale scientists are teaming up with companies that buy carbon credits to ensure the projects they support provide research-quality data that helps strengthen development across industries. Scientists can analyze insights from these real-world deployments to better understand what works and how to scale carbon removal projects, bridging a major gap between industry and research.

Another session highlighted Yale’s Map of Life platform, developed by the Yale Center for Biodiversity and Global Change and Yale Ventures, which translates complex biodiversity and climate data into actionable insights for industry leaders. In “Imagining a Healthier Planet,” artists and public health experts explored how creative outlets like visual art and music can improve physical and psychological well-being and inspire action in ways that policy alone cannot.

Confronting challenges, charting new paths

Panels also took an unflinching look at what’s working — and what isn’t — In today’s policies, practices, and emerging technologies, spotlighting both obstacles and opportunities for climate progress.

Another session, “The Bad Science Behind Biofuels — and How to Fix the Climate Food Crisis,” unpacked how biofuel policies have reshaped land use, food security, and emissions, and pointed to reforms for a more sustainable and equitable future. Down the hall, Daniel Esty, the Hillhouse Professor of Environmental Law and Policy and director of the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy, joined panelists representing industry, academia, energy systems, climate justice, and policy to debate how artificial intelligence can be leveraged to accelerate climate innovation, while addressing the risks it poses on local communities and sustainable development.

And at “Resilient Cities, Reimagining Health,” Yale researchers and partners across industry and government released a landmark report showing how rising temperatures and extreme weather patterns are changing public health needs and outlining practical steps cities can take to reduce costs, cut emissions, increase access to health care, and strengthen local economies.

Preparing the next generation

Much of the focus of the summit was on preparing the next generation to lead the climate transition. Students and alumni packed into career panels where industry leaders, policy professionals, and entrepreneurs offered candid advice on navigating their careers. In panels like “How can Industry and Academia Work Together to Solve Planetary Challenges?” Yale scholars and leaders from across sectors amplified the important collaboration between universities’ deep research enterprise and industry’s capacity to implement ambitious innovations.

“The conversations we convene at Climate Week move ideas faster — from lab to market, from imagination to action,” said Julie Zimmerman, vice provost for planetary solutions. “Yale Planetary Solutions is helping connect disciplines and partners so that the solutions we need most are developed, tested, and scaled in time to make a difference.”

During Climate Week NYC, Yale alumni and community members also made their mark beyond The Yale Club. Jinali Mody ’23 M.E.M. was named one of three entrepreneurs to win a 2025 Young Champions of the Earth award from the UN Environment Programme and American cleantech CEO Chris Kemper for her company Banofi Leather, which turns banana crop waste into a plant-based alternative to animal leather.

Award recipients will receive seed funding, mentoring, communications support, and a global platform to showcase and scale their solutions. Winners also received a $20,000 prize during Climate Week NYC and competed in the first-ever Planet A pitch competition for a business growth grant of $100,000 and a possible seed investment of $1 million committed to a future fundraising round. Kemper, founder and CEO of the U.S. climate tech company Palmetto, this year co-founded Planet A, a YouTube channel that drives environmental awareness and action.

In a private session during Climate Week, Yale experts also worked directly with the three winners, offering coaching from YPS, Tsai Center for Innovative Thinking at Yale (Tsai CITY) , the Yale Center for Business and the Environment, and Yale School of the Environment.

Beyond Yale at Climate Week

For Yale, Climate Week represented one integral element of a broader initiative focused on building scalable solutions to planetary challenges. Earlier this week, the university hosted an event celebrating the opening of the Living Village at Yale Divinity School, a residential complex designed to give more back to the environment than it takes. A five-year report on the impact of Yale Planetary Solutions will be released later this semester; efforts are underway to gather feedback to inform the next round of institutional climate and sustainability planning and goal-setting for the university; and members of the Yale community will play a role in November’s UN Climate Change Conference in Belém, Pará, Brazil.

By bringing together expertise from across disciplines and professions, Yale is helping shape the collaborative frameworks that lasting climate solutions demand, said Sara Smiley Smith, the assistant provost for planetary solutions.

“It’s inspiring to amplify and celebrate the great work taking place across Yale’s campus and to help provide pathways to move ideas into action ever faster,” Smiley Smith said. “Each year we have thought about what more we can do to use our ‘Yale at Climate Week’ events to drive impact, and I’m excited by this year’s efforts to lean into collaborations with many different partners.

“We can do so much more when we seek these synergies and remain open and curious about new potentials for action.”",https://news.yale.edu/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph_image/public/2025-10/2025_09_24_16-12-35_R5B_4714-YN.jpg?h=03155992&itok=qyHto4pf,N,,2025-10-09 13:08:36.519885

While this scenario is unlikely to occur, the latest IPCC report said rising temperatures are already having catastrophic effects.
Climate change ‘signal’ Pielke told E&E News that the IPCC has traditionally “played it pretty straight” when it comes to establishing links between climate change and extreme weather.
That approach refers to the influence of global warming on long-term, large-scale trends in weather or other climate impacts, rather than individual weather events.
Pielke has for years argued that climate activists exaggerate the IPCC’s findings on the links between climate change and long-term trends in extreme weather.","Critics of mainstream climate science and allies of the fossil fuel industry are taking aim at a prominent expert who’s helping coordinate the next United Nations review of global climate research, arguing that her work aims to bolster multibillion-dollar lawsuits against oil and gas companies.

In an August New York Post op-ed, Roger Pielke Jr., a political scientist at the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute, raised concerns about the appointment of Friederike Otto as a coordinating lead author for the seventh assessment report of the influential Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

The criticism is aimed at extreme weather attribution, a popular field of research that studies whether and to what degree human-caused global warming has made an extreme weather event, such as a heat wave or heavy rain, more severe or likely to occur. Otto co-founded World Weather Attribution, which develops analyses showing climate’s role in extreme weather events.

Attribution science has been cited in congressional hearings and included in legislation to highlight the links between extreme weather events and climate change. The findings have also been included in lawsuits that seek to hold fossil fuel producers liable for the costs of dealing with climate change — and have drawn the scrutiny of the Trump administration.

Pielke said that Otto’s inclusion in the IPCC report could harm the international scientific body’s reputation.

By putting Otto — a climate science professor at Imperial College London — and her “fellow travelers in charge of the IPCC’s chapter on extreme events,” he wrote, “the IPCC is signaling that media hits, climate litigation, and energy advocacy trump rigorous science.”

Energy in Depth (EID), the advocacy arm of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, amplified Pielke’s call last week, saying Otto’s involvement raises concern the IPCC’s “traditionally neutral assessments could be hijacked by climate litigation supporters.”

Otto said Pielke’s argument that event attribution was inspired by litigation against the oil industry drew on comments he’d taken out of context. She told POLITICO’s E&E News that Pielke was referring to a comment she made about a 2003 paper by Myles Allen, a climate expert at Oxford University, that raised the idea of suing polluters for damages related to global warming. But it “obviously doesn’t mean that everything subsequently has been done for litigation,” Otto said.

“As an author on IPCC, I will be assessing peer-reviewed science,” she added. “And there are many, many peer-reviewed studies that show how climate change has affected extreme weather events.”

The criticism comes as the Trump administration is working to discredit established climate science, in part by producing its own reports that mainstream climate researchers say cherry-pick studies to provide an incomplete picture of how the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities are warming the planet.

A task force whose members were selected by Energy Secretary Chris Wright took aim at the IPCC in a July report that has been criticized by climate scientists as disinformation. Some researchers said their work was misrepresented in the report.

The DOE report argued that the world is on track for less warming than the IPCC’s worst-case scenarios predicted and that its “studies have led the public to believe that climate change is more harmful than it actually is.”

The IPCC’s worst-case scenario assumes world leaders will take no additional steps to address climate change in the coming decade, leading to as much as 5 degrees Celsius (9 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming by the end of the century. While this scenario is unlikely to occur, the latest IPCC report said rising temperatures are already having catastrophic effects.

The IPCC publishes its report every five to seven years, providing a foundational assessment of the latest climate science by hundreds of experts who evaluate thousands of research papers.

Otto will co-coordinate the chapter on changes in regional climate and extreme weather.

Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director with the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental group that has supported climate litigation, called the criticism against Otto a “deliberate mischaracterization” of her research and the broader IPCC undertaking.

“This is not a process that individual scientists hijack and use for their own purposes,” Cleetus said.

The IPCC does not conduct new research. It relies on hundreds of scientists to synthesize thousands of peer-reviewed studies, and its work is based on consensus so that no single author controls the process. The IPCC also has no role in determining whether the science it assesses is used in lawsuits, Cleetus said.

“But it is a very, very important way in which the world, the public, policymakers, can understand what the latest state of the climate science is,” Cleetus said of the IPCC assessments. “And there’s a whole industry of people, many of them with fossil fuel ties, who are trying to deny those scientific realities.”

The fossil fuel industry and the Trump administration have recently escalated efforts to quash a raft of climate litigation that could leave oil companies on the hook for billions. Since 2017, more than three dozen lawsuits have been filed by cities, counties, states and tribes accusing the oil and gas industry of knowing about the dangers of burning fossil fuels — but failing to warn the public.

The Trump administration has taken two states to court in an effort to prevent them from filing climate liability lawsuits and has asked the Supreme Court for relief.

Otto’s extreme event attribution work has been cited in a number of the climate lawsuits against the oil industry, EID noted. That includes a $51 billion lawsuit filed by Multnomah County, Oregon, accusing Exxon Mobil, the American Petroleum Institute and hundreds of other defendants of contributing to a deadly 2021 heat wave.

“Placing an advocate of litigation-driven science at the helm of the IPCC’s extreme weather chapter risks turning the world’s most trusted climate referee into an arm of climate litigation,” EID wrote last week.

EID, which frequently critiques climate litigation efforts by governments and tracks groups that support those efforts, has long questioned attribution science as politically motivated, arguing that the authors of studies aren’t impartial scientists but climate activists who are biased against the fossil fuel industry.

‘Nothing to do with litigation’

Jakob Zscheischler, an earth system scientist at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Germany and an author of the upcoming chapter with Otto, said he had “absolutely no concerns” about her appointment as a coordinating lead author or the legitimacy of extreme event attribution.

“It helps us [disentangle] which aspects of specific types of extreme weather events are changed by anthropogenic climate change and which aspects are not, with a level of detail that was not possible before,” Zscheischler said in an email.

He and Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University, noted that the impact of a single author on the IPCC is limited by having other lead authors on the same chapter and several rounds of external reviews.

Dessler said there is a cadre of critics ready to dispute the connection between extreme events and climate change — even in a report that is still years away from release. The IPCC has not yet confirmed a timeline for the seventh assessment, but it’s expected to be completed around 2029.

The IPCC defended the author selection process, pointing to a fact sheet that says lead authors are nominated by experts, IPCC member governments and observer organizations.

A “balanced assessment of the full range of scientific views, protected from the influence of special interests, is supported through the method of author team selection, multiple rounds of review of each report” and the group’s conflict of interest policy, the IPCC added.

The IPCC reports are organized in three working groups, and each group has a series of chapters. Otto will serve as one of three coordinating lead authors for Chapter 3 of Working Group I on current climate impacts on a regional scale. That includes extreme weather events.

Otto said coordinating authors are expected to make sure the chapter is delivered according to the outline agreed to by global governments, adding that her work with the IPCC has “absolutely nothing to do with litigation.”

The correlation between individual weather events and rising temperatures has been used in some climate liability lawsuits, Otto noted. But she said her critics have sought to combine various statements she has made over the past 10 years and used them out of context.

Otto was previously an author on part of the IPCC’s sixth assessment report published in 2021 and the accompanying synthesis report published in 2023.

Climate change ‘signal’

Pielke told E&E News that the IPCC has traditionally “played it pretty straight” when it comes to establishing links between climate change and extreme weather. But he said extreme event attribution is a departure from the IPCC’s traditional framework for detection and attribution.

That approach refers to the influence of global warming on long-term, large-scale trends in weather or other climate impacts, rather than individual weather events. It’s a strategy that predates extreme weather event attribution and is separate from that field.

Pielke has for years argued that climate activists exaggerate the IPCC’s findings on the links between climate change and long-term trends in extreme weather. And in his recent op-ed, he argued that extreme event attribution is “a cottage industry of promotional studies” designed to replace the IPCC’s conventional methods.

But most climate scientists say extreme event attribution complements — and agrees with — long-term detection and attribution studies. In its most recent assessment report, the IPCC’s chapter on extreme events found that climate change has influenced a variety of weather events.

Pielke, alongside other researchers who are skeptical of mainstream climate science, has in the past sought to back up his claims with an IPCC chart that indicates many forms of extreme weather have no “emergence of a signal” linking them to climate change. It’s an argument the DOE’s climate report used as well.

Many climate scientists say that’s a misleading argument. They have noted that an emerging signal refers to a specific kind of statistical pattern in extreme weather — a trend that has grown so large that it has moved outside the range of being possible without climate change. The absence of this signal doesn’t mean that events aren’t worsening or that climate change isn’t influencing them, researchers say.

‘Fundamental science’

World Weather Attribution was founded to provide scientific evidence in the aftermath of an extreme weather event, Otto said, adding that the methodology it uses and many of its studies have been peer reviewed.

“The numbers have never changed through the peer-review process,” Otto said. “Everything we do is super transparent, so all the data is freely available. It is very fundamental science.”

World Weather Attribution publishes papers that show climate change does play a role in extreme weather events — but also that it sometimes does not play a role, or that the data isn’t conclusive, Otto said.

“The aim with World Weather Attribution is to understand how climate change impacts people today, and that is what we do,” she added.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/2f/f7/6ad58657419e9b24d97ca805b27c/4cb79544afec4b96b0574f2fca668c32.jpeg,N,,2025-10-09 15:04:28.247523

In September, the Trump administration released a memo that lays out its federal R&D priorities for fiscal year 2027. Although it will not directly influence federal spending, it outlines the administration’s science goals, which include boosting economic growth, strengthening national security, and promoting US leadership in key technology areas.

The memo is authored by Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Michael Kratsios, director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy. They criticize years of “unfocused Federal investments weighed down by woke ideology and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives”—a stark contrast to a memo, also with Vought as coauthor and published during the first Trump administration, that called for federal agencies to prioritize “activities that advance innovation in STEM education and increase diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM.”

Key R&D priorities outlined by Vought and Kratsios include advancing critical and emerging technologies, such as AI, quantum science, semiconductors, and advanced manufacturing. They emphasize achieving “American energy dominance” through support for fossil fuels, nuclear technologies, geothermal energy, and hydropower. They also call for increased private-sector involvement in later-stage energy R&D while maintaining federal support for foundational research infrastructure.

National and economic security are also central themes, for which Vought and Kratsios urge support for increased military capabilities, strengthened cybersecurity capabilities, and President Trump’s Golden Dome missile defense system. They also prioritize safeguarding US health and biotechnology by focusing on the most urgent health challenges, boosting biosafety, and building domestic biomanufacturing capabilities.

Maintaining global space leadership is another priority. The authors express support for crewed missions to the Moon and Mars and for basic and applied research into such areas as novel sensing modalities and radiation-belt remediation.

Vought and Kratsios urge agencies to “prioritize research and associated research infrastructure investments that enhance America’s ability to observe, understand, and predict the physical, biological, geologic, and socioeconomic processes and interacting systems of the Arctic to protect and advance American interests and ensure prosperity of America’s Arctic residents.”

Scientific societies protest grant-making executive order

More than 50 scientific and medical organizations are urging Congress to block key elements of the grant-making executive order (EO) that President Trump issued in August (see the October 2025 FYI science policy brief “Trump gives political appointees final say on grants”). The groups argue that the order will increase politicization of federally funded research and add inefficiencies to the grant-making process. “The EO does not advance the Administration’s goal of implementing Gold Standard Science,” reads their 24 September letter. (Several member societies of the American Institute of Physics, which publishes Physics Today, signed the letter.)

The EO requires agencies to launch new grant-review processes that are overseen by political appointees. In their letter, the groups say that such processes will slow down the awarding of grants and increase the administrative burden on researchers.

The signatories “urge Congress to ensure that independent peer review remains the cornerstone of the scientific grantmaking process, such that the most meritorious proposals are funded in this and all future administrations.” Trump’s order states that agencies may use peer-review methods for grant making on an advisory basis but places ultimate decision authority in the hands of political appointees. But, the organizations write, “shifting final authority to political appointees will significantly undermine the grant review and award system and could distort federal research priorities based on ideological or partisan agendas, stifle innovation, and erode public confidence in research.”

The organizations also ask Congress to reject the EO’s requirement that science agencies permit “termination for convenience” for all grants. The groups warn of a “chilling effect” on any research that could be perceived as controversial.

This week, I was honored to accept the Battery Innovation of the Year award on behalf of General Motors. This award, given at the 15th annual Battery Show North America in Detroit, recognizes groundbreaking advancement in battery technology. GM and LG Energy Solution were named this year’s winner in recognition of our pioneering work on lithium-manganese-rich battery cells, or LMR.

I’ve been in the battery business for more than 30 years. It’s remarkable to see how far we’ve come. What’s even more important, though, is the opportunity to innovate, to advance our technology and our industry into the next era.

At General Motors, we’re building state-of-the-art facilities, deep technical expertise, and world-class technology. GM’s vehicles aren’t just competitive in the EV landscape; they’re helping lead the way. We have some of the fastest-charging, longest-range EV trucks in the market – the 2026 Chevrolet Silverado EV Max Range Work Truck delivers an EPA-estimated 493 miles of range on a full charge1 – and the Chevy Equinox EV, the most affordable EV on the U.S. market with more than 315 miles of driving range2. We’re expanding our leadership in affordable EVs with the return of the Chevy Bolt in 2027, and in the luxury EV market, Cadillac was the number one brand by sales in Q3 of this year. GM is now number two in EV market share, doubling since last year, and nearly twice as big as our nearest competitor. Q3 was our best quarter ever for EV sales.

What’s Next

The global EV market is growing, and foreign countries and companies are investing heavily in this space. At the same time, the U.S. policy and regulatory environment is shifting. Amid all this change, GM remains focused on our North Star: Building a profitable EV future.

To get there, my team and I spend every day focused on three clear goals: Driving down battery costs, improving battery performance, and building an independent battery supply chain rooted in North America. These aren’t just technical goals – they’re strategic imperatives to position GM to lead in innovation, resilience, and competitiveness.

Innovation in Michigan

We’re building an electrification powerhouse at GM. We’ve got world-class R&D facilities and some of the best engineers in the business, all focused on our zero-emission vision.

It starts in Warren, Michigan, where we research, test, and prototype the future of battery technology. Right down the road, at our Wallace Battery Cell Innovation Center, we’re prototyping the next generation of battery cell and pushing the boundaries of energy density, performance, and manufacturability. Next door to Wallace, we’re building our new Battery Cell Development Center, where we’ll refine and validate new cell concepts, enabling our manufacturing partners to scale up production faster and deliver high-quality cells right here in the U.S.

Beyond our labs and prototyping facilities, GM has one of the most advanced computational and virtual engineering capabilities in the industry. We can model changes in battery chemistry and near-instantly understand the impact on safety, performance, and cost. What used to take months to validate, we can now accomplish in days. These AI tools allow us to accelerate material validation, confirm battery performance, and fast-track the development of a U.S.-based supplier network. All of this work is happening right here in our Michigan labs, where digital meets physical to drive real-world innovation.

Next-generation chemistry

Battery cell chemistry is a critical aspect of battery innovation, and GM is helping lead here, too. We’re adopting flexible chemistries to strike the right balance of range, performance, and affordability. That’s why I’m incredibly excited about our upcoming commercialization of LMR in partnership with LG Energy Solutions.

LMR is a game-changing chemistry, unlocking premium range and performance at a more affordable cost. We’ve been working on LMR for over a decade, and we aim to be the first automaker to deploy it in 2028. It’s a perfect example of how our battery strategy is coming to life: Lowering costs, improving performance, and localizing our supply chain. This isn’t just an incremental improvement – it’s the kind of chemistry innovation that makes electrification more accessible.

At GM, we launched our EV platform with flexibility and scale in mind. We use a common cell and module architecture across more than a dozen EVs, allowing us to achieve economies of scale that drive down battery costs. With high-nickel chemistries providing maximum performance and long-distance driving, LFP delivering affordability and durability at the entry-level, and LMR offering premium performance at a low cost, we can choose the right chemistry for the right vehicle, building an EV portfolio that meets the needs of every customer.

Batteries beyond EVs

Batteries can do incredible things far beyond EVs. GM battery packs help power the largest second-life battery development in the world, a microgrid built by Redwood Materials in Sparks, Nevada, supporting the AI infrastructure company Crusoe. And our EVs can help support the energy grid in real time. In California, we’re working with utilities like PG&E to pilot vehicle-to-grid technology, where energy stored in EV batteries can be sent to the grid during peak demand, reducing grid stress and stabilizing the system with distributed energy.

Competing globally in EVs means building more than just great vehicles. We need to build the industry infrastructure – securing the materials, technologies, and manufacturing capacity behind the battery systems that power every one of our EVs. That’s why we’re moving quickly to localize our battery supply chain, establishing U.S.-based manufacturing for battery cells. And we’re working to bring production of critical minerals like lithium, manganese, nickel and graphite, closer to home. By 2028, we aim to increase the North American content of our battery supply chain by a factor of eight.

In my career, I’ve learned that battery innovation rarely comes down to a single breakthrough. Rather, it’s the result of steady, deliberate progress across every aspect of the value chain. This week’s recognition of our decade-long work on LMR exemplifies this dynamic. By advancing our battery technology, driving innovation, and onshoring our supply chain, we’re building a stronger, more resilient U.S. battery industry.

Toward the end of last month, GM devised a plan to have its in-house lending arm initiate the purchase of EVs in its dealers’ inventory. The company planned to apply for the federal $7,500 credit on those cars and then roll that money into EV lease terms for customers through the end of the year.

GM opted to kill the program after concerns were raised about it by Republican Senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio, a former car dealer who is active in auto policy, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.

“After further consideration, we have decided not to claim the tax credit,” the company said in a statement to Reuters on Wednesday, declining to elaborate on the reason for its decision.

Moreno told Reuters in an interview he was happy with GM’s decision to scrap the EV tax-credit plan. “The EV subsidies ended September 30, and I’m happy that every car company” is going to abide by that. “I look forward to working with GM,” he said. “We’re putting a lot of policies in place to protect our domestic auto industry.”

The idea behind the program was to ease the impact of the expiration of the tax credit on dealers, who worried they would be stuck with EVs that would be tough to sell. GM had planned to apply for the credit on tens of thousands of EVs in dealer stocks, according to people familiar with the plan.

Ford rolled out a similar program ahead of the tax-credit expiration. It is unclear if Ford is continuing its program. A spokesperson declined to comment.

GM had planned to claim the credit on roughly 20,000 EVs that were on dealership lots or being shipped to stores, people familiar with the matter said. Its finance arm, GM Financial, began making down payments on those vehicles before the deadline to qualify for the subsidy on each of those cars, the sources said.

In its statement on Wednesday, the company said it would “fund the incentive lease terms” through the end of October.

The formula for determining the down payments that GM Financial paid to dealers on those EVs was 5 percent of the maximum price for each car. For example, GM Financial would have made a down payment of about $6,300 for two Chevrolet Blazer EVs, which top out in the mid-$60,000s, according to documents GM provided to dealers outlining the terms.

GM scrambled to put together the program just a few days before the Sept. 30 tax-credit expiration, and outlined the details on a call with dealers on Sept. 29, three sources said.

GM officials had caught wind of a similar program that Ford was putting in place for its dealers, the sources said.

Commonwealth LNG has requested a four-year extension to finish construction and bring into service an export facility in Cameron Parish, citing circumstances beyond its control that include regulatory delays during the Biden Administration and legal challenges by environmental groups, according to the company’s filing at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

In November 2022, the five-member commission voted unanimously to give final approval to Commonwealth to build and operate a 9.5 million-tons-per-year LNG export facility on the west side of the Calcasieu Ship Channel, the company said in the petition for an extension.

Although approved by FERC to operate the LNG export facility in 2022, Commonwealth said it experienced “historic, unprecedented delays” during the Biden presidency for Department of Energy approval that would allow it to sell gas to companies that do not have a free trade agreement with the United States. Commonwealth’s application to trade with countries with no free trade agreement remained pending with DOE for far longer than any other U.S. LNG terminal developer, the company said in the filing

In October 2019, Commonwealth received Department of Energy approval to trade with countries that have free trade agreements with the United States, the company said in the filing. It was not until February 2025 that the export facility received Department of Energy approval to trade with countries without free trade agreements with the United States.

“This conditional authorization from the Department of Energy is a major step toward restoring U.S. regulatory certainty and marks a return to regular order in LNG project approvals,” Charlie Riedl, executive director of the Center for LNG, said when the free trade agreement was approved.

Additionally, Commonwealth said its application was subsumed under DOE’s formal pause in reviewing export applications while it updated its economic and environmental analyses, the company said in the extension request.

Dominion Energy’s Virginia and North Carolina subsidiaries issued a request for proposals on Wednesday, seeking power purchase agreements for new solar, onshore wind and energy storage projects in both states.

Dominion said it’s interested in proposals for five categories of new resources: solar, solar co-located with storage, onshore wind, onshore wind co-located with storage and stand-alone energy storage.

The company is also looking to outright acquire projects in the same categories.

For acquisitions, Dominion said it is seeking “non-residential rooftop and carport solar projects, including mechanically complete projects, specifically on commercial, industrial, and government-owned structures. The company is particularly seeking rooftop and carport solar projects in Virginia’s urban centers to reduce the load on the electric grid.”

For PPAs, Dominion seeks “both utility-scale projects that are greater than 3 MW, as well as distributed projects that are 3 MW or less” which are located in Virginia or North Carolina. “For distributed projects that are 3 MW or less, the facilities must be located within [Dominion Energy Virginia or [Dominion Energy North Carolina] service territory where there are location grid benefits to Dominion Energy customers.”

“The company also encourages the submission of PPAs from solar, onshore wind and energy storage projects on previously developed sites, such as former landfills or industrial uses,” Dominion said.

Dominion spokesman Aaron Ruby said the company is seeking these PPAs as part of its “‘all of the above’ strategy to serve growing power demand in Virginia.”

“Our customers are using about 5% more power each year, and we’re serving that growth with a balanced mix of renewables, nuclear and natural gas,” Ruby said, noting the Virginia Clean Economy Act requires 35% of solar be procured through PPAs.

According to sources, the reversal follows concerns raised by Ohio's Republican Senator Bernie Moreno.

General Motors (GM) has reversed its decision to pursue a scheme that would have enabled its dealers to offer a $7,500 tax credit on leases of electric vehicles (EVs).

The move after the scheduled end of the federal subsidy on 30 September, reported Reuters, citing sources.

According to sources, the reversal follows concerns raised by Ohio's Republican Senator Bernie Moreno, who has a background in car dealership and is involved in automotive policy discussions.

GM initially proposed a plan in which its financing division, GM Financial, would purchase EVs from dealer inventories to qualify for the federal tax credit.

The credit would then be incorporated into lease agreements for customers until the end of the year.

However, aEURoeafter further consideration, we have decided not to claim the tax credit,aEUR GM told the news agency, without providing further details.

Senator Moreno expressed in an interview with Reuters that aEURoehe was happy with GM's decision to scrap the EV tax-credit plan.aEUR

Moreno said: aEURoeI look forward to working with GM. We're putting a lot of policies in place to protect our domestic auto industry.aEUR

The programme was designed to mitigate the impact of the tax credit's expiration on dealers, who feared difficulty in selling EVs without the incentive.

Sources said that GM had intended to claim the credit on approximately 20,000 EVs that were either in dealership lots or en route to stores.

GM Financial had even started making down payments on these vehicles prior to the deadline to secure the subsidy for each car, sourced added.

The news agency said that down payments made by GM Financial to dealers for the EVs were calculated at 5% of each vehicle's maximum price.

The plan was hastily assembled just days before the tax credit was set to expire, with GM outlining the details to dealers on a call on 29 September.

Last month, GM announced that it would be scaling back production at one of its key EV manufacturing plants, a move attributed to reduced federal support for EVs during the tenure of former US President Donald Trump.

The document, circulated on Capitol Hill, was first reported by The Detroit News and reportedly includes more than $800 million in Michigan projects. Other Michigan-based recipients on the list include Ford Motor Company and Dow Chemical Company.

The proposed cancellations come after Trump administration officials last week defended the decision to cancel federal projects in regions of the country that have voted for Democrats, insisting it was in an effort to reduce the size and scope of government during the ongoing shutdown of the federal government. Democrats, however, said the cancellations further eroded Congress’ constitutional authority over spending by unilaterally canceling funding that lawmakers approved on a bipartisan basis.

The U.S. Dept. of Energy said they are unable to verify the lists they’ve seen so far in the press.

“No determinations have been made other than what has been previously announced,” Press Secretary & Chief Spokesperson Ben Dietderich said in a statement emailed to Michigan Advance. “As Secretary Wright made clear last week, the Department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration. Rest assured, the Department is hard at work to deliver on President Trump’s promise to restore affordable, reliable, and secure energy to the American people.”

The GM grant in Lansing has become a political flashpoint in Michigan. The plant currently builds Cadillac CT4 and CT5 sedans and previously assembled the Chevrolet Camaro. In awarding the grant, the Biden administration said transitioning the plant to EV production would preserve 650 jobs and create 50 new positions.

U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte), whose district includes the plant, said he’s in contact with both GM and the administration.

“While no final decision has been made, my top priority will always be standing with the auto workers and ensuring tax dollars are spent effectively as we unwind the Biden EV mandates that tied the hands of our auto industry and stifled our manufacturing economy,” he said in a statement emailed to the Advance.

That sentiment is in line with other Republicans who have criticized the grants as benefiting foreign industries. At an October 2024 campaign event, then-vice presidential nominee JD Vance warned the money could help China’s auto sector.

“[W]hen we write massive checks on American taxpayer expense to these companies, a lot of times what we’re doing is selling American middle class jobs to the Communist Chinese, and we ought to be doing exactly the opposite,” Vance said.

GOP Senate candidate Mike Rogers also railed against the GM grant while campaigning last year against Democrat Elissa Slotkin.

“I think if the federal government’s going to spend money they ought to spend on something that builds, something that people want to buy,” Rogers said following a 2024 debate with Slotkin.

Slotkin, who defeated Rogers last November, slammed the proposal to cancel the grant.

“President Trump is now targeting Michigan workers,” Slotkin said in a statement to the Detroit News. “This $500 million investment would support union jobs and our manufacturing future.

Substantial numbers of these low-income workers and potential workers can be found in most regions of the United States.
Since 2000, US manufacturers have shed another 4.5 million jobs despite manufacturing employment growing worldwide by 71 million.","Introduction

The announcement of new tariffs this year has reignited the discussion of whether the United States can expand its manufacturing employment by millions of workers. Reversing decades of manufacturing job losses is one explicit goal of the new higher tariffs. This District Data Brief presents measures of employment and demographics as context around the current and potential employment in US manufacturing. Raising manufacturing employment by 4 to 6 million workers would constitute a large increase relative to current levels. However, an increase of this scale would not be large relative to the global growth of manufacturing employment in recent decades, the current US labor force size, or the number of US adults not engaged in high-paying work.

With different priorities and approaches, policymakers have spent much of the past decade addressing issues related to the loss or absence of manufacturing in the United States. For example, America’s dependence on imported manufactured goods was highlighted at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic as supply chain disruptions led to shortages of medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, microchips, and other products. The CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act featured tax breaks and subsidies to expand US manufacturing capacity for semiconductors, electric vehicles, and renewable energy equipment.

At the same time, economists have been documenting the loss of work opportunities and earning power by workers without college degrees as manufacturing employment has declined. In 2013, David Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon Hanson published a study that estimated the labor market impacts resulting from increased trade competition following China’s entrance into the World Trade Organization, an effect often referred to as the “China shock.” Dozens of studies have since used the regional variation in job and income losses caused by the China shock to measure the adverse impacts of job displacement on family structures, crime, health, and other social indicators. Some supporters of industrial subsidies and higher tariffs have expressed the hope that these dynamics can be put into reverse.

How Many Manufacturing Jobs Went Away and How Many Remain?

The discussion of whether reshoring is possible needs to begin with a basic question: How many workers would this include? In the United States today, approximately 12.8 million people work in manufacturing, representing 8.1 percent of all nonfarm payroll employment. As shown in Figure 1, manufacturing employment accounted for more than 30 percent of all nonfarm employment from 1939 until 1957, peaking at 38 percent during World War II. Manufacturing employment peaked in absolute numbers in 1979 at 19.4 million.

Figure 1. US Manufacturing Employment, 1939 to 2024

US manufacturing employment fluctuated around 17 million workers through the late 1990s and did not keep pace with population and labor force growth. Steep drops in factory jobs during the 2001 recession and the Great Recession were never fully reversed. From 1979 to 2025, employment in the United States grew by 68 million, while manufacturing employment fell by 6.6 million. During this period, manufacturing jobs for people without college degrees declined by roughly 7.9 million. However, these losses were partially offset by jobs created in the sector for workers with college degrees. These include workers at goods-producing firms that do engineering, design, marketing, and other professional work in the United States but contract out all their production overseas. Although roughly one-third of manufacturing jobs are currently filled by workers with college degrees, this District Data Brief focuses on workers without degrees because the production work that may be reshored holds much more opportunity for non-college graduates than for graduates.

A reindustrialization effort in the United States that added back all 6.6 million manufacturing jobs that were lost would represent a 52 percent increase over the current number of workers in the sector nationwide. In today’s much larger economy, manufacturing’s employment share would reach only 12.3 percent (compared to, for example, 22 percent in 1979) if all 6.6 million of these workers switched to manufacturing from other sectors. Getting manufacturing back up to its 1979 share of 22 percent would require increasing the sector’s employment to 34.7 million.

Is There Growth in Manufacturing Employment Globally?

A frequently cited challenge to substantively increasing manufacturing employment is that improved automation means that factories do not need as many people as they used to. However, it is also the case that population growth and economic development around the world have increased demand for manufactured products so that, on net, factory employment is up by 71 million globally since 2000. As shown in Figure 2, China has added just over 40 million people to its manufacturing workforce over this period, while India and Vietnam have added 9.2 million and 6.8 million, respectively. Currently, manufacturing employment in China is reported to be more than 85 million, six and a half times higher than that of the United States (see Figure A1). For context, the population of China is only four times higher than that of the United States.

Figure 2. Change in Manufacturing Employment, 2000 to 2022

When firms operate factories in high-wages countries, they have a financial incentive to invest in the best automation available to achieve enough production to cover the high wages of their workers. When factories are moved to low-wage countries, additional labor can be less expensive than additional machinery, so more workers are hired. In recent decades, firms have found it more profitable to either operate less-automated factories in low-wage countries or even combine automation with low-wage workers to realize additional cost savings. Governments can intervene through tariffs or subsidies to try to offset the cost advantages of low-wage production and motivate firms to place their factories in high-wage countries.

Since 2000, US manufacturing employment has declined by 4.5 million, equivalent to around 6 percent of net global growth of 71 million during the same period. However, if production had not been shifted away from the United States and other high-wage countries like the United Kingdom and Japan, global growth in manufacturing employment (represented by the green bars in Figure 2 and occurring almost entirely in low-wage countries) very likely would have been lower in this period. For example, manufacturing workers in the United States produce approximately three to four times as much per hour, measured by the value of the products when sold, as workers in low-wage countries. Assuming US manufacturing workers would have been assisted by additional productivity-enhancing equipment and produced as much as three or four of the low-wage workers, retaining 4.5 million workers in the United States during this period would have caused manufacturing employment growth to be 16 or 21 percent lower, respectively, in the rest of the world, though growth still would have been positive.

Where Are US Workers Facing Trade Competition?

Before identifying geographic regions within the United States where manufacturers might expand, we need to consider which types of products the United States is currently producing and which product markets are dominated by foreign producers. Linking trade data to regional employment data enables us to identify industry clusters that have more potential to expand employment by increasing their US market share. Table 1 shows the dollar value of imports and exports in the 30 product categories with the highest total flows (imports plus exports). In categories where imports are much higher than exports, such as apparel, foreign production has cost much less than US production for many years. On one hand, this means that US employment in that type of production is low and that regaining domestic markets would involve large increases in employment. On the other hand, growth opportunities in these subsectors are limited to domestic markets. It is unlikely that the United States would be able to export in these industries because tariffs would not close the gap in costs (especially labor costs) between US and foreign production. In categories where exports are much higher than imports, such as aircraft, US production is already competitive globally, and US producers already meet most domestic demand. Capturing additional domestic market share with tariffs in these industries would involve smaller proportional increases in employment relative to the US labor force that is presently supplying global markets.

Table 1. US Exports and Imports of Manufactured Goods, 2023

Table 2 presents estimated counts of manufacturing workers without college degrees, split by whether the United States is a net exporter or net importer in the product category. The counts are shown for major Fourth District metro areas and for metro areas across the nation with the highest populations of these workers. All other regions of the country are included in the aggregate categories. Not surprisingly, the metro areas with the largest populations, including Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, also have the largest number of workers without college degrees working in manufacturing and facing trade competition. As such, those metro areas stand to gain the most from expanded manufacturing employment. However, the large regions that still have high counts of workers in manufacturing tend to also have diversified economies, so manufacturing employment is usually a below-average (<6.5 percent) share of their total employment. This means any manufacturing gains would generally be less consequential in these regions than in smaller regions more reliant on the industry such as Cleveland and Cincinnati.

Longstanding economic literature has documented the countervailing forces of “agglomeration” and “dispersion” in manufacturing activity. The concept of agglomeration indicates that firms in a product category benefit from clustering in specific regions, using the same suppliers and infrastructure, and hiring skilled workers from competitors. On the other hand, the concept of dispersion indicates that there are cost savings from moving production out of congested areas to regions with inexpensive land and labor. The former suggests regions with existing production clusters would benefit more from manufacturing employment growth, while the latter suggests gains would be widely spread across low-cost regions. In Table 2, the number of production clusters is reported for each region, with a cluster defined as having 5,000 workers without college degrees in one product category. The specific clusters are listed by region and product category in Table A1. Because the major metro areas have larger scale, more of their factory categories have enough workers to be considered clusters. However, in the national aggregate, only 20 percent of manufacturing workers are in clusters, while most manufacturing production in the United States is dispersed.

Table 2. Locations of Manufacturing Workers Without College Degrees by Trade Competition and Clustering

Where Are Potential Factory Workers Geographically?

Having looked at where factory employment is located, and where it has expanded recently, we can turn attention to regional differences in the populations of potential factory workers, including the unemployed, workers with low earnings, and working-age adults not in the labor force. The US unemployment rate was near historical lows in the three years before the pandemic and has been near these lows in the three years since the pandemic ended. Considering only the approximately 7 million people currently unemployed, it would seem that manufacturers would have to hire a vast majority of them to reverse manufacturing’s declines. If manufacturers actually did hire most of the people looking for work, the labor market would tighten to an unsustainable degree. Alternatively, unemployed workers could be hired into factories in combination with new entrants to the labor force and workers hired away from other sectors. Which industries might experience declining employment shares—or absolute declines in employment—if manufacturers successfully attract workers to switch into their sector?

When workers are well compensated in other industries, this signals that they have in-demand skills, that they are adding value at least as high as their wages, and that manufacturers would need to outbid a high wage to recruit them. However, there are 10 million people across the United States who are employed but whose household income is still low (below 150 percent of the federal poverty line). Some portion of this population could be attracted into manufacturing positions if the wages offered were appreciably above their current wages and compensated them for any important differences in the work environment.

Additionally, there are 7.2 million working-age adults who are neither working nor looking for work, not in school, and whose household income is below 150 percent of the federal poverty line. With these low household incomes, it is unlikely that those working-age adults are out of the labor force because they are comfortably supported by a spouse or partner or by investment income. Rather, these are likely people who might be drawn into the labor market if new opportunities enable them to overcome barriers to employment such as affording reliable transportation and childcare.

Substantial numbers of these low-income workers and potential workers can be found in most regions of the United States. Table 4 lists estimates of the largest populations of these individuals nationally and in the Fourth District. The largest metro areas of the country by themselves have 4.7 million of these individuals, while there are another 1.1 million in the Fourth District and another 13.2 million in the remainder of the country. While some labor markets would tighten if a major expansion of manufacturing got underway, it appears that workers would likely be widely available in many areas. The location of establishments could be determined based on the nonlabor costs mentioned above (land, utilities, taxes, and regulation).

What Sectors Do Manufacturers Hire People Away From?

A large expansion of manufacturing employment would change the US economy along many dimensions, and it would be difficult to predict how wages would evolve in each sector. We can, however, observe the flows of people into and out of manufacturing in the recent past. Using the last five years of Current Population Survey data, I identify every worker without a college degree that reports entering or exiting the manufacturing sector. I then calculate the industry shares of those flows. Table 5 displays the flows by sector (flows by individual industry can be found in Table A1) along with the median wage of the workers when they are in the non-manufacturing positions. The largest flows are with the retail sector, particularly restaurants and bars, grocery stores, and department stores. The typical wages are substantially lower (approximately $17 per hour versus $20 in manufacturing), suggesting manufacturers should be able to draw workers out of the retail sector. Similarly, manufacturing may pull workers out of the agriculture and personal services sectors. By contrast, the construction and mining sectors appear to be paying wages that are as high or higher than wages in manufacturing. Construction provides the second-largest flow of people into manufacturing despite this frequently involving a step-down in wages. The red shading in Table 5 indicates that the median wages earned in the other industries were lower than the median wages earned in manufacturing by the transitioning workers.

Table 5. Worker Flows to and from Manufacturing by Sector

Where Do Young People Who Could Start Careers in Manufacturing Live?

The figures in the preceding sections reflect the population that could potentially join the manufacturing workforce at present, but investments in manufacturing facilities will likely be directed where firms can expect to hire workers over the next decade or longer. A recent update of the Autor, Dorn, and Hanson analysis showed that the transition away from manufacturing was fueled mostly by young people’s starting their careers in other sectors. Thus, reversing this trend by attracting recent high school graduates to manufacturing might be necessary to rebuild the manufacturing workforce. It is possible to observe where future workers—young people aged 10 to 18—live today, but some assumptions are needed to translate this into estimates of future worker numbers. Table 6 shows the counts of young people in various regions. In the third column, the count of young people without college degrees set to enter the labor force is calculated by multiplying the current youth counts by the ratio of non-degree-holding young workers (ages 20–28) in the region in 2023 to the count of young people (ages 10–18) in the region in 2013. This ratio reflects the share of these youth that remained in the region and did not complete college. To account for flows out of the labor force that occur along with inflows, the fourth column provides the count of non-degree-holding current workers aged 60 to 68, who are likely to retire in the next 10 years.

The major metro areas in which young workers without college degrees might outnumber retirees without college degrees in the next decade are mostly places that saw strong population growth in the early 2000s such as Seattle, Atlanta, Orlando, and Tampa. Although Fourth District metro areas including Cleveland, Dayton, Toledo, and Erie are seeing flat or declining populations, it still appears that the number of labor market entrants without college degrees will exceed the number of retirees without college degrees in these metro areas over the next decade.

Table 6. Estimates of Regional Changes in Non-Degree-Holding Workforce

Conclusion

Manufacturing employment in the United States fell by 2.1 million workers from 1979 to 2000. Since 2000, US manufacturers have shed another 4.5 million jobs despite manufacturing employment growing worldwide by 71 million. Given the current size of the US labor force, increasing manufacturing employment by 6.6 million would involve reallocating just under 4 percent of US workers.

Based on a combination of trade, employment, and demographic data, this District Data Brief uncovers a variety of patterns relevant to the evolution of the manufacturing sector. Most manufacturing employment is in categories where the United States imports more (by value) than it exports, so employment could grow if US producers gain domestic market share. Manufacturing production in the United States appears to be widely dispersed across many regions, but there are clusters of employment in the largest metro areas and in legacy manufacturing centers. Regions that have added manufacturing employment recently are mostly in the South and Mountain West. Metro areas that saw strong population growth 20 years ago, such as Atlanta and Las Vegas, have relatively large pools of young people who will be reaching working age soon. Alternatively, workers and working-age adults who are low-income and might be drawn to higher-paying opportunities in manufacturing are present in substantial numbers in most regions of the country. The relative importance of clustering versus finding the lowest-cost location—and having a growing labor force versus low labor costs—will determine which regions benefit most from any upcoming growth in manufacturing.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/-/media/project/clevelandfedtenant/clevelandfedsite/favicon/android-chrome-512x512.png?extension=webp,N,,2025-10-09 12:12:04.400516

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Oct. 3 withdrew its proposed extension of compliance deadlines for coke ovens — chambers where coal is heated and turned into coke, a form of coal that is a more efficient fuel.

These ovens typically operate in integrated steel mills, such as U.S. Steel’s Gary Works and Cleveland-Cliffs’ Burns Harbor in Northwest Indiana.

The EPA in July published an interim final rule allowing coke ovens to continue operating as is for another two years before they would be required to comply with standards set under former President Joe Biden’s administration. Those standards aimed to reduce the amount of harmful air pollutants reaching nearby residents.

The agency, in a federal filing, said in July it had “serious concerns” that facilities using coke ovens would not be able to quickly comply with the Biden-era rules. After hearing from industry groups, however, the agency reversed that stance, saying facilities would not “face significant immediate compliance challenges.”

Environmental advocates, including community organizations in Northwest Indiana, sued the EPA over its extension of deadlines. An attorney representing the groups called this new ruling good news.

“Communities living near these facilities waited many years for these rules to be finalized by the EPA in 2024 and putting them into action now is vital for reducing hazardous air pollution and protecting people living near these plants,” Haley Lewis, attorney for the Environmental Integrity Project, said in an Oct. 6 news release.

Northwest Indiana communities have endured decades of environmental injustice and racism, said Ashley Williams in a news release, executive director of community advocacy group Just Transition Northwest Indiana.

“We are tired of defending out fundamental right to breathe and live a health life in northwest Indiana,” Williams said. “(Just Transition) is relieved that EPA heard our rally cry and withdrew this dangerous proposal.”

The resolution was unlikely to ever become law, but came as a messaging tool for Democrats who oppose the Trump administration’s energy agenda, which has largely consisted of bolstering fossil fuels and nuclear energy while blocking renewable energy.

“President Trump told Big Oil donors that if they cut a $1 billion check to his campaign, he’d give them everything they want on day one of his presidency. Then, within hours of his inauguration, he declared a sham ‘energy emergency’ to put his thumb on the scale for those donors and hamstring other affordable energy sources,” said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) in a written statement, referring to Trump’s request that the industry give $1 billion to his campaign and a report that he told them it would be a “deal” to do so.

“It turns out Trump himself is the energy emergency — energy prices are through the roof and hundreds of thousands of good-paying clean energy jobs are in serious jeopardy because of federal funding he yanked,” he added.

The White House criticized the Democrats’ effort.

“President Trump is restoring American energy dominance to fuel economic prosperity and lower costs for all Americans. Only the radical Democrats could oppose this commonsense policy effort,” spokesperson Liz Huston said in an email.

On his first day in office, Trump declared a national emergency in regards to energy as part of an effort to unlock additional tools to jump-start energy production.

Since that time, he has sought to use emergency powers to approve more power stations for artificial intelligence, fast-track fossil fuels and mining on public lands and expedite hundreds of projects.

However, the administration has also taken steps to hamper renewable energy development.

It was originally supposed to be up and running by 2027 is expected to take until 2031 in order to be completed. The company behind the Commonwealth LNG Facility in Louisiana has warned in a request for an extension to its deadline.

Additionally, company blamed the temporary ban on new liquefied natural gas capacity that the the former US president Biden administration imposed. The administration imposed the ban on the industry in its final year. This followed a report that was drafted by an environmentalist that claimed LNG to more harmful than coal for the atmosphere.

Commonwealth LNG Facility in Louisiana Factsheet

Project owner: Commonwealth LNG

Location: West bank of the Calcasieu Ship Channel, near Cameron Parish, Louisiana, U.S. Gulf Coast.

Capacity: approximately 9.5 Million Tonnes Per Annum (MTPA) of LNG.

Estimated cost: Approximately $4 billion.

Key partners: Technip Energies (EPC Contractor), Baker Hughes (Refrigerant Compressors), Kimmeridge, Mubadala Energy (Equity Stake).

However, the Trump administration canceled the ban this year but that was not soon enough for Commonwealth LNG. The company said this in its letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Challenges the Project Faced

“These delays on the LNG project were beyond the control of Commonwealth. Also, they unavoidably affected Commonwealth’s ability to advance the Project on the schedule that was contemplated when its application was filed,” the company stated, as quoted by Reuters.

The Commonwealth LNG facility is located in Cameron Parish, Louisiana. Furthermore, it will have an annual capacity of 9.5 million tons of liquefied gas. The construction of the first phase of the project is expected to cost $11 billion. This is according to Commonwealth LNG and generate annual export revenues of approximately $3.5 billion.

However, the company has yet to make the final investment decision on the project. This was revealed by the company in September after it secured its export license from the Department of Energy.

Companies that will be Supplied with LNG from the Facility

Additionally, in September, Commonwealth LNG secured a long-term supply deal with EQT for 1 million tons of LNG from its future Louisiana plant. This brings the total volume committed to future deliveries to 5 million tons under deals with Japan’s JERA, Malaysian Petronas, and Glencore, in addition to EQT. Therefore, this leaves 4.5 million tons yet to be contracted to secure the viability of the project unless project developer Kimmeridge sticks to its commitment to offtake 2 million tons of LNG annually from the facility.

Key Points

The $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles may have ended, but automakers continue to offer strong incentives on EV leases.

Hyundai, Stellantis, GM and Ford have also discounted lease deals.

It’s not too late to get a good lease deal on select electric vehicles. Even though the $7,500 federal tax credit expired Sept. 30, automakers and dealers are still motivated to move EVs, especially the BMW iX and Honda Prologue SUVs. Below, we cover some of the best lease deals through the end of October. Not included on our list but worth checking out are unique EV lease deals from some automakers, including Ford, Stellantis, Hyundai and GM.

Introduction

The Trump administration has moved to cancel nearly $8 billion in clean-energy projects, a decision that overwhelmingly affects states that voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. The cuts (which span hydrogen hubs, solar deployments, and grid modernization efforts) were announced this week as part of a sweeping rollback of climate initiatives, and they fall almost entirely on blue states such as California, New York, and Minnesota. Critics have branded the move political retribution, arguing that the administration is punishing regions aligned with Trump’s former opponent while jeopardizing thousands of jobs and billions in private investment.

The cancellations were spearheaded by Trump budget chief Russ Vought, who framed the action as cutting “wasteful green subsidies.” But the numbers tell a different story: the bulk of the halted projects were already underway, and many had secured state and private-sector matching funds. Local officials warn that the sudden withdrawals will devastate clean-tech industries that have become economic anchors in their communities.

The decision has sparked immediate backlash. Governors in the affected states are threatening lawsuits, pointing to the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which limits a president’s power to withhold congressionally appropriated funds. Legal scholars say the selective targeting of opposition states raises serious constitutional questions. Meanwhile, energy companies and investors caution that the uncertainty will chill innovation and push America further behind global competitors in the race for renewable energy.

What emerges is not just a debate over energy policy, but a test of whether federal resources can be deployed as a political weapon and whether the courts will step in to draw the line.

The Facts and Numbers

The scope of the cuts is staggering. The Trump administration’s decision eliminated 223 clean-energy projects across 16 states, wiping out nearly $7.6 billion in federal support. In California alone, the ARCHES hydrogen hub lost $1.2 billion, money that had been earmarked to accelerate development of renewable hydrogen as a fuel source. Other projects, ranging from large-scale solar installations in Arizona to grid resilience upgrades in New York, were also abruptly halted.

While the cuts were justified by Trump budget chief Russ Vought as eliminating “non-viable” or “wasteful” spending, the pattern reveals a starkly partisan edge. All of the states hit hardest voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. The only exceptions were small crosscurrents: in California’s Republican-leaning Central Valley, some local communities will also lose projects tied to grid modernization, showing that even red enclaves inside blue states are caught in the crossfire.

In Connecticut, CT Insider detailed how 12 projects worth $52.9 million were suddenly cut, including work at the University of Connecticut and FuelCell Energy, both of which were deep into their research and deployment phases. “This is not just a line item; these are jobs and ongoing commitments,” one state official told the outlet.

The geographic selectivity of the cancellations has drawn particular scrutiny. Every major hydrogen hub in Harris-won states (California, New York, Minnesota, and Illinois) saw their federal funding pulled. In total, the administration’s cuts struck at some of the nation’s most ambitious clean-energy pipelines, from battery storage in New Jersey to offshore wind projects on the East Coast.

Even the private sector has taken note. Shell executives warned the cancellations of fully permitted offshore wind projects would undermine investor confidence, sending a chilling signal to companies weighing whether to continue backing U.S.-based clean-energy ventures.

“Petty Politics” or Governance Logic?

The timing and targeting of the cuts have left many observers skeptical that this was merely an exercise in fiscal prudence. On paper, the Trump administration claims the projects were eliminated because they lacked “economic viability” or failed to align with national priorities. As Russ Vought put it, these were simply examples of “green pork” that the federal government had no business funding.

But the political optics are unmistakable. Virtually every state that saw projects gutted was one carried by Kamala Harris in 2024. That alignment has prompted governors and lawmakers to call the move what they believe it is: retribution. Connecticut Attorney General William Tong called it “a blatant act of political punishment” that abandons communities striving for energy independence. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz warned that the cancellations were “targeting people not for what they’ve done but for how they voted.”

The consequences extend far beyond symbolism. These cuts threaten tens of thousands of jobs and billions in private-sector matching funds that had been committed under federal grant agreements. Several projects were already breaking ground, meaning workers and local governments had staked real resources on promises of federal support. For cities and rural communities alike, the rug has been pulled out from under them.

There’s also an irony in the impact. In California’s Central Valley, a Republican stronghold, local districts are set to lose out on grid modernization funds, even though they supported Trump at the ballot box. That collateral damage underscores the scattershot nature of using federal policy as a political cudgel: even Trump’s own voters may find themselves harmed when blue states are the target.

Yet defenders of the move insist that the outrage is overstated. Vought has cast the cuts as part of Trump’s broader promise to dismantle what he calls the “Green New Scam,” redirecting resources toward fossil fuels and nuclear power instead. Supporters argue that the federal government should not “pick winners” in energy markets, and that states or private investors should take the risk of developing unproven technologies.

Still, the unmistakable alignment between states hit hardest and the electoral map of 2024 has fueled accusations of pettiness and political spite. As one energy analyst told E&E News, “Even if the administration insists it’s about policy, the pattern looks like punishment.”

Legal Challenges and Constitutional Questions

The immediate question raised by Trump’s cuts is whether they are even legal. Under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, presidents are barred from unilaterally withholding or canceling funds that Congress has already appropriated, except under narrow conditions. That statute was written in response to Richard Nixon’s attempts to withhold federal money for programs he opposed. Legal scholars now argue that Trump’s action may fall into the same prohibited category. “Congress decides where the money goes, not the White House,” constitutional law professor Laurence Tribe told E&E News.

Several states are already gearing up for lawsuits. A coalition led by Democratic attorneys general is preparing to challenge the cancellations in federal court, asserting that the administration’s rationale is a thinly veiled excuse for political retaliation. The legal argument hinges on the claim that the administration cannot selectively target projects based on political geography while leaving similarly structured projects untouched in red states.

There is also the matter of contractual obligations. Many of the affected grants were already signed, with states and private partners investing millions based on federal commitments. In Connecticut, for example, FuelCell Energy and the University of Connecticut had already launched projects with the expectation of federal support. Canceling funds at this stage, legal experts say, could expose the administration to breach-of-contract claims.

Beyond statutory and contractual concerns, some argue the cuts may violate the Equal Protection Clause by punishing states for their electoral choices. That claim will be harder to prove, courts typically require evidence of discriminatory intent, not just disparate impact. Still, the near-perfect alignment between Harris-won states and canceled projects strengthens the perception that political motives drove the decision.

The Trump administration has already faced pushback in court for similar maneuvers. Earlier in 2025, a federal judge in Washington blocked efforts to freeze $14 billion in EPA climate grants, ruling the freeze was “arbitrary and capricious” under the Administrative Procedure Act. That precedent could prove pivotal as states and recipients seek to block the latest wave of cancellations.

Still, the administration has defenses. It may argue that the Impoundment Control Act doesn’t apply to grants still in negotiation or those contingent on performance benchmarks, and that agencies have discretion to terminate projects deemed out of compliance. Whether courts accept those arguments will determine not only the fate of these clean-energy projects but the scope of presidential power over federal spending.

Case Studies: States and Communities in the Crossfire

California: Hydrogen Dreams Deferred

No state took a bigger hit than California. The ARCHES hydrogen hub, a flagship initiative designed to create a renewable hydrogen economy, saw $1.2 billion in federal funding vanish overnight. State officials had already launched partnerships with universities, utilities, and international energy companies to scale the project. Now, that ambitious plan has been brought to a halt. “This isn’t just about California; this is about America’s place in the global clean-energy race,” Governor Gavin Newsom warned after the announcement. Even Trump-supporting counties in the Central Valley, slated to benefit from grid upgrades tied to the project, will now feel the economic pain.

Connecticut: Fuel Cells and Broken Promises

In Connecticut, the cancellations hit smaller but vital projects. 12 projects worth $52.9 million were eliminated, including work at the University of Connecticut on solar and energy storage, as well as contracts with FuelCell Energy, a company with decades of experience in renewable technologies. Company executives said they were blindsided by the decision, noting that jobs and research investments are now hanging by a thread. “The rules changed in the middle of the game,” one official said, underscoring the sense of betrayal among communities that had counted on federal support.

Minnesota: Rural Innovation Stalled

In Minnesota, clean-energy initiatives in small towns were gutted, undermining local economies that had been moving toward renewables as a source of both jobs and resilience. MPR News highlighted the case of Morris, a town investing heavily in renewable energy to power farms and municipal buildings.

Now, federal dollars that were supposed to sustain that transition have evaporated. Governor Tim Walz called the decision “reckless and punitive,” warning that rural communities, many of them in Republican districts, will be among the biggest losers.

Offshore Wind and Investor Confidence

The fallout isn’t confined to state budgets. The private sector is also spooked. Shell executives criticized the administration’s cancellation of fully permitted offshore wind projects, arguing that it sends a dangerous signal to investors. “When projects can be scrapped for political reasons, even after permits and contracts are in place, why would international firms bet on the U.S. market?” one executive asked. This chilling effect could ripple far beyond the canceled projects, slowing future investment in American clean energy.

Implications and Wider Context

Undermining U.S. Climate Goals

The clean-energy funding cuts strike at the core of America’s climate commitments. Many of the canceled projects were tied to targets set under the Inflation Reduction Act, including hydrogen production, grid modernization, and large-scale renewable deployment. Without those investments, experts warn the United States will fall behind in meeting emissions reduction goals, and potentially cede technological leadership to Europe and Asia, where governments are doubling down on green subsidies. The decision effectively pulls the plug on some of the most ambitious pipelines for renewable growth.

Investor Confidence and the Risk Premium

Perhaps the most immediate consequence is the blow to investor confidence. Clean-energy projects depend on a delicate balance of federal support, state backing, and private capital. When the federal side of that equation becomes unpredictable, the private sector recalibrates its risk. Reuters reported Shell’s warning that U.S. offshore wind investment could dry up if companies cannot trust federal commitments. That chilling effect could spill over into batteries, solar, and hydrogen, slowing the pace of innovation across the board.

Federalism and Political Retaliation

The selective nature of the cuts raises deeper concerns about federalism. By targeting states that supported Kamala Harris in 2024, the Trump administration has blurred the line between policy disagreement and political punishment. Governors have warned that if clean-energy grants can be revoked on partisan grounds, nothing stops future administrations from weaponizing other types of federal funding, from infrastructure to healthcare. This precedent risks transforming the federal purse into a partisan tool, destabilizing the cooperative balance between Washington and the states.

Political Fallout and Electoral Ramifications

Politically, the decision could cut both ways. Trump’s supporters may see the cuts as fulfilling his pledge to dismantle what he calls the “Green New Scam” and prioritize fossil fuel industries. But the backlash could be fierce in states where projects were already creating jobs and revenue, including pockets of Republican strongholds inadvertently caught in the fallout. Rural towns in Minnesota and California’s Central Valley, communities Trump counted on in 2024, now face the loss of anticipated economic lifelines. That contradiction could test the durability of his coalition in the midterms.

Global Standing and Competitiveness

Finally, the cuts send a message abroad: that the U.S. may not be a reliable partner in the clean-energy transition. While China and the EU are plowing billions into hydrogen, solar, and battery technologies, the United States appears to be retreating from the race. Analysts caution that this could have lasting effects on trade, innovation, and America’s ability to shape international climate agreements.

What to Watch: Open Questions Ahead

Will the Courts Step In?

The most immediate unknown is how quickly the courts will act on challenges from states and project developers. Federal judges have already shown a willingness to block similar attempts to freeze climate funds earlier this year, but whether they will enjoin these broader, more targeted cuts remains unclear. If lawsuits succeed, projects could be reinstated. If not, billions in potential development may remain stranded.

Congressional Oversight and Pushback

Lawmakers in both chambers are preparing oversight hearings. Democrats are framing the cancellations as an abuse of power, while some moderate Republicans, particularly those from districts where local projects were scrapped, may face pressure to break ranks. The big question is whether Congress will attempt to restore the funds through supplemental appropriations, or whether the partisan divide will freeze any legislative remedy.

How Will States and Cities Adapt?

Governors in California, Minnesota, New York, and Connecticut have already signaled they will explore state-level funding to salvage critical projects. But most lack the fiscal capacity to replace billions in lost federal support. Municipalities, too, may be forced to scale down or delay renewable initiatives, leading to ripple effects in local economies. Whether states can coordinate alternative funding coalitions, through regional compacts or partnerships with private investors, remains an open question.

Investor Behavior and the Market Signal

Energy companies are watching closely to see if the cancellations are a one-off or the beginning of a sustained rollback. If investors believe political instability is the “new normal” for federal climate policy, U.S. clean-energy financing could face a long-term contraction. That uncertainty may push capital toward Europe or Asia, where government backing is more consistent.

Expanding the Weaponization of Federal Funds

The precedent set here may not stop with clean energy. If courts allow it, future administrations could condition federal support for infrastructure, public health, or disaster relief on political alignment. That possibility has alarmed constitutional scholars, who warn of a future where funding decisions are wielded as tools of electoral punishment rather than national interest.

Electoral Fallout

Finally, the political gamble. Will Trump’s base applaud the move as another strike against “green elites,” or will disillusioned communities in Republican-leaning districts feel betrayed by the collateral damage? The answer may shape the dynamics of the 2026 midterms, when energy policy, local economies, and partisan divides will all be on the ballot.

Conclusion

The Trump administration’s decision to slash billions in clean-energy funding is more than a policy dispute; it is a stress test for the balance between politics, law, and governance. By targeting projects concentrated in states that voted for Kamala Harris, the cuts have exposed a volatile mix of partisanship and policymaking, one that critics warn weaponizes the federal purse in ways not seen since Nixon’s impoundments of the 1970s.

The consequences are immediate and tangible: shuttered hydrogen hubs in California, stalled research in Connecticut, small towns in Minnesota left scrambling, and multinational companies questioning whether the U.S. remains a reliable partner in the clean-energy race. Jobs have been put at risk, billions in private investment destabilized, and America’s credibility in climate leadership shaken.

Legally, the battle is just beginning. Courts will decide whether the administration has overstepped statutory and constitutional limits. Politically, the gamble is even larger: if voters in red districts feel betrayed by collateral damage, the retribution could backfire. If not, Trump may succeed in cementing his energy agenda as both fiscal conservatism and political dominance.

What is clear is that this fight is not just about solar panels, hydrogen hubs, or offshore wind. It is about whether federal resources can be manipulated as a partisan weapon, and whether institutions, from courts to Congress, will step in to stop it. The outcome will help define not only America’s energy future but also the limits of presidential power in a deeply divided nation.

Well, had. Just before it expired, General Motors announced that it managed to find a clever way to preserve the discounts to customers who lease EVs after Sept. 30: Put the cars into service by making a down payment to the dealerships themselves.

But it turns out some of America's elected officials don't take too kindly to workarounds, so now that plan is off the table.

Welcome back to Critical Materials, your daily roundup for all things electric and tech in the automotive space. Also on deck: Ford will pull back on Lightning production, and the federal government threatens to pull back over a billion dollars in EV manufacturing grants from GM and Stellantis. Let's jump in.

30%: Ford Expected To Idle F-150 Lightning Production

Photo by: Ford

The Rouge Electric Vehicle Center (REVC) will idle F-150 Lightning production for at least a week, according to a memo sent to workers shared with Reuters. And while demand for electric vehicles is expected to drop this week, it's not the reason Ford is scaling back production.

A late-night fire tore through part of the Novelis aluminum plant in Oswego, New York, last month. The damage was so extensive that a large portion of the plant is expected to remain out of commission into 2026, which means that many automakers—Ford included—are expected to face a supply crunch over the next few months. And because Ford makes its F-Series pickup bodies from aluminum (and because those pickups are one of America's best-selling vehicles), it must now choose what production to scale back in order to keep cranking out high-margin products at volume.

Unfortunately, the F-150 Lightning will fall victim to the supply crunch, at least until Ford can work out how to mitigate the problem.

The Wall Street Journal covered just how impactful the fire is expected to be for Ford:

Ford is the biggest user of the plant. Its F-150 pickup, the top-selling vehicle in the U.S. and the automaker’s main profit driver, is one of the industry’s biggest users of aluminum. The setback is severe enough that Ford will likely flag potential implications to investors when it discloses quarterly financial results later this month, according to people familiar with the matter.

Ford shares sank in morning trading by more than 7% on news of the potential disruption.

“This represents a serious question for the production of F-150 because that’s the aluminum that comes out of Oswego,” said Kaustubh Chandorkar, an aluminum-industry analyst. Ford switched the F-150’s exterior to aluminum from steel a decade ago.

Confirmation of Ford's production line shutdown next week was made by Reuters, which viewed a memo written by Dearborn Truck UAW Chairman Nick Kottalis. The memo stated that REVC will be off next week, related to the Novelis fire, but did not address the total anticipated impact on production.

Ford isn't alone in its reliance on the metal supplier. General Motors, Stellantis, Toyota, and more are all customers. In fact, Novelis supplies nearly half of all sheet metal used by U.S. car makers. However, industry analysts expect that Ford will be hit the hardest out of any automaker with a U.S. production line and is estimated to lose up to a whopping $1 billion from its bottom line.

“We believe this is largely a Ford issue,"" wrote Chris McNally, Head of Global Auto and Mobility Research at Evercore ISI, in a note on the matter. McNally went on to estimate that the firm expects Ford to take an earnings hit of between $500 million and $1 billion over the supply issue.

Admittedly, if Ford had to choose between cutting down on the F-150 Lightning and gas models, it makes sense to ramp down on the electric model. Ford's ICE truck has significantly more sales than its battery-powered variant, not to mention that the sale of EVs are expected to take a dip with the EV tax credit going away.

It's not clear if the shutdown will extend past a week, nor what Ford expects its total production impact to be. ""Novelis is one of several aluminum suppliers to Ford,"" said a Ford spokesperson in a statement to the Detroit Free Press. ""Since the fire [on Sept. 16th], Ford has been working closely with Novelis, and a full team is dedicated to addressing the situation and exploring all possible alternatives to minimize any potential disruptions.""

60%: GM Backtracks On EV Tax Credit Extension

GM has officially changed course on its EV tax credit leasing plan, according to a report from Reuters. The automaker will no longer make good on its plan to pass on the discount to consumers until the end of the year and will instead only foot the bill over the next few weeks.

U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno, a man who managed to build a luxury car dealership empire in Ohio, penned a letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent condemning ""certain car companies who wish to continue bilking the U.S. taxpayer."" Here's a snippet from the letter penned by Moreno:

The intent of [the Big Beautiful Bill] is clear—no credits allowed after September 30, 2025.

To implement this law, on August 21, 2025, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued guidance which provided clarification on the availability of the EV subsidies for taxpayers who enter into a written binding contract and make a downpayment on an eligible “clean vehicle.” This guidance, while well intentioned, is unfortunately being taken advantage of by certain car companies who wish to continue bilking the U.S. taxpayer.

It has come to our attention that certain car companies are gaming this guidance by instructing their captive financial entities to enter into written binding agreements with dealers for electric vehicles, paying a nominal downpayment, to secure the credits on vehicles that may not be leased to the end user for months.

Given this concerning information, we write to request your assistance to close this loophole and address the total violation of Congressional intent by these nefarious actors

In a statement to Reuters, GM confirmed that it would not claim the tax credit after all. Instead, it will self-fund the lease incentives until the end of the month. “GM worked on an extended offer for the benefit of our customers and dealers. After further consideration, we have decided not to claim the tax credit,” said GM. “GM will fund the incentive lease terms through the end of October.”

InsideEVs reached out to Ford to see if it would follow in GM's footsteps, but Ford did not respond to our request for comment.

While this, uh, creative measure technically aligned with federal guidance, it's clear that lawmakers weren't having any of it (politically-charged or otherwise). At least GM's heart was in the right place. The EV market is expected to slow significantly this quarter and the brand warned that consumers shouldn't expect ""irrational"" discounts after the tax credit ended. At least they can still score some decent lease discounts until the end of the month.

90%: U.S. Could Claw Back $1.1 Billion In EV Grants From GM and Stellantis

Photo by: Chevrolet

Nearly $1.1 billion in federal grant funding awarded to General Motors and Stellantis by the U.S. Department of Energy could soon be clawed back by the feds. Both automakers were set to use the funds as a means to retool their factories to support the production of electric vehicles. But now, that money could be ripped away as part of a game of political chess.

According to a report from Automotive News, the rescinding of the grant is part of a larger cancellation of Congressionally-mandated funding set aside for energy and manufacturing projects. In total, $12 billion in grants could be affected on top of an already-announced cancellation of $8 billion for various clean energy-related needs.

Automotive News explains:

The projects are among a list of $12 billion in awards that could be canceled as the partial government shutdown persists.

Among those grants: $500 million awarded to GM to convert Lansing Grand River Assembly in Michigan to build electric vehicles; $335 million for Stellantis to convert the shuttered Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois to make midsize electric pickups; and $250 million for Stellantis to convert its Indiana Transmission Plant in Kokomo to produce EV components.

The possible cancellations come a week after the Energy Department announced plans to cancel $7.56 billion in financing for hundreds of energy projects that it said would not provide sufficient returns to taxpayers.

For GM, that includes $500 million earmarked to be used at its Lansing Grand River plant. The funds were to be used as part of the factory's retooling to build EVs, something GM pledged a total of $1.25 billion to in 2024.

Then there's Stellantis. It planned to allocate $334.8 million to revive its idled Belvidere plant as part of a $1.5 billion cash infusion. Another $250 million was to be committed to an Indiana transmission plant that would be repurposed to build EV drivetrains.

No final decision has been made so far, but the money on the line threatens a combined estimated 2,900 direct jobs and supports more than 15,000 other workers across the U.S. auto industry.

100%: We've Got Some Cheap(ish) EVs Now. Which Are You Choosing?

With the release of the new Chevy Bolt, the lower-cost Nissan Leaf, and Tesla's Standard models, there are now a number of EVs creeping into what many see as ""affordable"" territory. If nothing else, at least well below the average transaction price of $49,088 for new cars (and $57,245 for EVs in mid-Q3, according to Cox Automotive.)

The 2026 Nissan Leaf starts at $29,990 with 303 miles of range, a base-trimmed Chevy Bolt LT was announced yesterday for $28,995 with 255 miles of range. Plus, Tesla's new Model 3 Standard is $36,990 and will offer 321 miles of range. Let's not forget some other already-established players like the Hyundai Kona (200 miles for $34,470), Chevy Equinox (319 miles for $34,995) and Toyota bZ (236 miles for $34,900).

My point is that our cups runneth over with EVs under $40,000—sure, that's not cheap, cheap. But it's a pretty darn different place than we were a decade ago.

He has also underscored the administration’s notion that expanding the coal industry is necessary to meet increasing electricity demand, mostly driven by artificial intelligence and other computational facilities.","Federal officials indefinitely postponed a Wyoming coal lease sale scheduled for Wednesday, apparently in response to what many observers consider a lowball bid on another federal coal lease on Monday in Montana.

Navajo Transitional Energy Company, the only bidder, stunned coal market watchers with an offer of $186,000 for 167 million tons of federal coal associated with its Spring Creek mine in southeast Montana — a fraction of a penny per ton and woefully low compared to past federal coal lease sales in the region. The last such major sale in the region, in 2012, netted $793 million for 721 million tons, or about $1.10 per ton, according to federal data.

Navajo Transitional was also in the queue to bid on the 441 million-ton West Antelope III federal coal lease associated with its Antelope coal mine spanning Campbell and Converse counties in Wyoming.

Bureau of Land Management and Interior Department officials are still reviewing the Spring Creek bid, and those close to the process expect that another date will be set for the West Antelope III coal lease sale.

“While we would have liked to see stronger participation, this sale reflects the lingering impact from Obama and Biden’s decades long war on coal which aggressively sought to end all domestic coal production and erode confidence in the U.S. coal industry,” the Interior wrote in an email responding to a WyoFile inquiry. “Fortunately, President [Donald] Trump and his administration are rebuilding trust between industry and government as part of our broader effort to restore American Energy Dominance.”

But others say market forces — including cheap natural gas and increasingly efficient wind and solar energy — are bigger factors.

Others note that the coal industry itself sees the writing on the wall. If a fraction-of-a-penny bid is any indication, some critics say, the thermal coal industry — which relies on U.S. coal-burning power plants — isn’t yet confident that Trump’s policies will turn around years of market decline.

“It tells you that there’s no competition for that coal in the ground, and it’s not worth very much money,” Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis Energy Data Analyst Seth Feaster told WyoFile on Wednesday. “It points to the fundamental, structural decline the coal industry is facing — for thermal coal — and that story hasn’t been reversed, despite all the things that they’re talking about.”

The postponement in Wyoming and lackluster offer in Montana come just days after the Trump administration touted sweeping regulatory rollbacks and $625 million in federal spending to revitalize “clean, beautiful coal.”

Navajo Transitional tried to set expectations regarding Powder River Basin coal’s market value back in September, urging the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to set its minimum bid requirement for the West Antelope III coal lease much lower than comparable leases in the past. Neighboring Powder River Basin coal operator, CORE Natural Resources, echoed that sentiment and told BLM officials, “the fair-market value of coal in the Powder River Basin will remain soft for the next number of years.”

Gov. Mark Gordon has said recently that Trump’s efforts to revive the coal industry will take some time to bear fruit. He has also underscored the administration’s notion that expanding the coal industry is necessary to meet increasing electricity demand, mostly driven by artificial intelligence and other computational facilities.

The Wyoming Mining Association declined to comment on Navajo Transitional’s Spring Creek coal lease bid, but acknowledged the industry still must reckon with 15 years of drastic market and policy shifts.

“As we’ve not seen a lease sale in over a decade, there may be a bit of a learning curve between the agency and industry to determine value given the current market conditions, projected demand and the shift in public policy,” Mining Association Executive Director Travis Deti said.

Regardless of what coal bidders and federal officials ultimately decide is the “fair market value” for Powder River Basin coal, Deti said, it’s vital to resume leasing new tracts of coal.

“If you don’t have the coal leased, you can’t mine it and you don’t have the jobs,” Deti said.

Conservation groups have noted that existing coal leases allow mining in the region to continue at pace through 2041.

There’s a danger in the Trump administration’s narrative around coal making a comeback, particularly for coal-reliant communities, according to Mijin Cha, who grew up in Laramie and studies energy transition and social justice strategies.

“It creates false hope and increased distrust between community members and government officials — you know, the folks that actually could help them,” said Cha, an assistant professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz. “It delays help for energy communities, and I think that what they’re doing [selling more federal coal] is so much more detrimental.”

Drawing on the outcomes of public participatory processes on climate change, and the reform to a new generation of nine subnational climate laws, as well as international experience, this report identifies opportunities to strengthen Mexico’s key national climate governance instrument: the General Law on Climate Change. The authors analyse the provisions against key ‘climate governance functions’ that need to be addressed to enable an effective response to the climate crisis.

The report also provides insights for other countries that are revising their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and looking to strengthen the domestic legal frameworks and institutions that deliver implementation. Conclusions from this study could be of particular interest to countries with a federal structure and those seeking to strengthen subnational leadership on climate change.

The authors find that Mexico’s General Law addresses the climate governance functions to some extent, but there are opportunities to strengthen design elements of the law across the functions. Detailed recommendations for policymakers are provided.

Key recommendations for Mexico include:

Introduce a legally-binding climate neutrality target and define intermediate targets compatible with this trajectory. Strategy planning processes could be aligned with five-year cycles of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and more explicitly integrated just transition considerations.

Require, and support, all public authorities to ensure that their decisions are consistent with national targets and strategies. The mandates of the Inter-Secretarial Commission on Climate Change (CICC) and the National Climate Change System (SINACC) could also be strengthened to improve coordination and integration.

Require government to consider independent advice at key stages of the policymaking process and introduce a requirement for government to respond to such advice.

Introduce a requirement for the Government to respond to stakeholder input and ensure that Indigenous knowledge and perspectives are integral to policy development. The CICC’s mandate could be expanded to include clear requirements to conduct inclusive public participatory processes.

Introduce a requirement to develop and regularly update a financial strategy and facilitate budgetary processes for sectoral Ministries and subnational governments. Consider additional provisions to facilitate climate-related lending and technical assistance from national and international programmes, to flow towards States and municipalities.

Establish regular reporting processes by sectoral Ministers to Congress, and consider introducing annual independent assessments of progress, with clear consequences in cases of non-compliance with the law.

,North Carolina Environment,2025-10-09 14:30:31+00:00,The State,Taxpayers spend $60 million to make up for environmental damage at Scout site - The State,"Sammy Fretwell, Joshua Boucher",,,,,https://www.thestate.com/news/local/environment/article312353421.html,"“The Scout mitigation effort is the largest mitigation effort S.C. Commerce has taken part in to date,’’ the department said in an email.
The nearly $60 million known to have been committed to pay wetlands mitigation has again brought attention to South Carolina’s financial stake in the Scout project.
(The agencies in 2023 had also expressed concern at how quickly the Scout project site was being cleared.)
The S.C. Department of Environmental Services fined Richland County, the Scout project site’s owner, $1 million earlier this year for violating laws to control storm water.
The service had tried to acquire the island before the Scout mitigation effort surfaced, a spokesman said.","South Carolina’s successful effort to lure Scout Motors to Blythewood will cost the public about $60 million to make up for the environmental damage left by the massive economic development project.

That’s believed to be a record amount of spending by the state Department of Commerce on what’s known as mitigation, the required practice of saving land or restoring wetlands in some places to offset the losses at construction sites in other places.

But the costs to the public could rise higher, as a result of the effort to compensate for wetlands and streams smothered by the work at Scout.

After a disagreement over how much land needed to be protected and how much restoration work was needed to offset Scout’s environmental impact, the Commerce Department beefed up a mitigation package as it raced to get a much-needed wetlands permit for the electric vehicle project, according to records reviewed by The State newspaper.

The more robust mitigation package, which involves fixing degraded creeks in a national forest, has added at least $18 million to the state’s mitigation costs, the newspaper found.

Expected costs of the entire creek restoration effort, however, have not been released and are expected to rise by millions of dollars, those familiar with the project said.

The creek restoration costs are in addition to $41 million the Commerce Department said it is spending on other pieces of the package to offset wetlands and stream losses from the Scout project in Blythewood, according to emails from the department.

That includes $27 million to purchase 5,000 acres in lower Richland County and more than $800,000 for an island in Fairfield County. In both cases, the land was bought for two to three times the value of the property listed in the Richland and Fairfield county assessor’s office records.

Overall, the nearly $60 million for wetlands mitigation exceeds the amount spent to compensate for wetlands losses at sites cleared for other high profile industrial development projects in the past 15 years.

Those include the Volvo automobile manufacturing plant in Berkeley County and the Boeing aircraft manufacturing plant expansion in Charleston County. Mitigation costs for each of those projects were under $20 million, according to public records, information from environmental groups and news accounts.

“The Scout mitigation effort is the largest mitigation effort S.C. Commerce has taken part in to date,’’ the department said in an email.

Another major mitigation package – which was not paid for by taxpayers – involved the Haile Gold Mine, a huge operation that has stripped the landscape in Lancaster County.

Offsetting the wetland and stream losses at Haile cost $27 million. But unlike Scout, the wetlands mitigation costs for the gold mine were paid by the mine’s owner, according to OceanaGold, which is digging up billions of dollars worth of the precious metal near the town of Kershaw. (OceanaGold separately agreed to pay cleanup costs for other environmental damage at the site.)

Boeing also paid for its mitigation costs, the company said.

The nearly $60 million known to have been committed to pay wetlands mitigation has again brought attention to South Carolina’s financial stake in the Scout project.

Legislators agreed in 2023 on a $1.3 billion financial package for Scout that includes money for multiple expenses, including compensation for wetlands and stream damage caused by clearing land at the project site.

The General Assembly overwhelmingly approved the package because Scout promises to create 4,000 jobs and invest billions of dollars in South Carolina. But a handful of lawmakers questioned whether the state had spent too much when the Legislature approved the $1.3 billion for Scout.

Now, records reviewed by The State newspaper detail the amount South Carolina is spending on the wetlands and stream mitigation part of the Scout financial package.

Information about the Scout mitigation costs comes from public documents and emails from the S.C. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Forest Service and the S.C. Department of Natural Resources, as well as interviews with sources familiar with the mitigation package. The State newspaper reviewed thousands of pages of documents obtained from government agencies under South Carolina’s open records law.

Scout supporter Dick Harpootlian, a former Democratic state senator, said he would like to have known about the wetlands mitigation costs at the time the Legislature discussed the project.

“If I would have known it was $60 million or more dollars for mitigation, I probably would have wanted to talk about that,’’ the Columbia lawyer said, noting that the mitigation cost “is not an insignificant expenditure.’’

Harpootlian urged legislators to look into the matter, possibly through a Legislative Audit Council review of the mitigation.

“This isn’t Scout’s fault,’’ he said. “This is the failure of somebody, whether it is at the Department of Commerce, or whether it’s some other state agency or entity.’’

In addition to mitigation costs, the $1.3 billion taxpayer-funded incentives package includes money for bridge and rail spur construction and water and sewer improvements.

State Rep. Bruce Bannister, who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee, said he’d rather not spend money on incentives, or on wetlands mitigation, but that was the price tag for bringing Scout to South Carolina.

“The economic returns we will get over the life of the Scout project are well worth it,’’ the Greenville Republican said, likening the Scout decision to German automaker BMW’s decision to locate in South Carolina more than 30 years ago.

Bannister indicated that the Commerce Department was under pressure to bring in Scout as it competed with other states, meaning it needed to get the mitigation dispute resolved so it could move on.

When the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state Department of Natural Resources pushed to add the national forest stream work to the original mitigation package, the state had little choice but to comply, he said. (The agencies in 2023 had also expressed concern at how quickly the Scout project site was being cleared.)

“At the end of the day, you were just kind of at the mercy of the EPA,’’ Bannister said. “We don’t need to scuttle the deal arguing over $10 million or $15 million in additional mitigation.’’

“We could challenge, but then still had to pay’’ the extra mitigation costs, he continued.

How successful the Scout project ultimately is will determine whether the expenditure was worthwhile, said Don Weaver, a Richland County councilman known for years as an outspoken taxpayer advocate.

The cost “is a little high, but I’m glad the project (is) in South Carolina,’’ instead of Georgia or North Carolina, Weaver said. “Sometimes you have to spend money to make money, and clearly that’s what we’re doing with the Scout plant.’’

Despite the expense, many agree that saving land and restoring the environment in other areas to compensate for the environmental damage at Scout is a good thing.

The property protected in Lower Richland is an example of how that benefits the public and the environment, according to one official with the Open Space Institute, a national non-profit group that protects land.

“South Carolina is getting thousands of acres that become open to the public,’’ said the institute’s Nate Berry, who helped negotiate the purchase of the property in Richland County.

The property in Richland County is near Congaree National Park and is home to lush stretches of a major creek that drains toward the federal preserve.

Among the features are land long-used by the Millaree Hunt Club, a prestigious private sportsmen’s retreat well known for its scenery and clean water. The creek at Millaree is enveloped by a canopy of hardwood trees.

Work to restore degraded streams and wetlands on other parts of the land is planned before it becomes a publicly accessible preserve. The state Forestry Commission will eventually become the owner and manager of the 5,000 acres.

Those who worked on acquiring the land say trees and wetlands on the part of the property that is being restored will one day rival those of nearby Congaree National Park.

Scout issued a statement saying it appreciates the efforts of officials at the state and county levels for supporting construction of a plant that will “strengthen the Midlands economy.’’ The mitigation package will preserve “thousands of acres of natural land and streams’’ in Richland County and the Sumter National Forest, Scout’s statement said.

Economic prosperity and environmental damage

Landing Scout has been touted as one of the biggest economic development successes in state history, rivaling BMW’s arrival in the early 1990s under then-Gov. Carroll Campbell.

A division of Volkswagen, Scout plans to make SUVs and trucks at an expansive manufacturing plant off Interstate 77 at Blythewood. The company has said it would produce as many as 4,000 jobs. Its investment in South Carolina is around $2 billion.

Republican Gov. Henry McMaster has been an enthusiastic supporter, even as President Donald Trump has led efforts to roll back federal support for the electric vehicle industry. Trump’s policies, including scaling back tax cuts for electric vehicles, are forecast to slow growth of the industry. Undeterred, Scout has moved ahead with its South Carolina plant.

Environmentalists have supported manufacturing electric vehicles in South Carolina because the automobiles don’t release pollution that worsens air quality and contributes to climate change.

But work at Scout has had a massive impact on the more than 1,000 acres being developed near Blythewood. The property has been scraped clean of trees and vegetation, creeks have been filled in and wetlands have been destroyed to make room for the manufacturing facilities.

All told, Scout’s work is affecting more than 70 acres of wetlands, 38 acres of ponds and about seven miles of streams, most notably Beasley Creek in Columbia’s Broad River watershed.

As a result of the expected impacts, state and local officials had to come up with a mitigation plan to offset those losses. That’s a requirement to obtain a federal wetlands permit, which a company needs so it can work on sites studded with bogs and swamps.

Those working on the Scout site have had trouble containing sediment and mud, causing creeks off of the industrial property to turn brown with silt.

The S.C. Department of Environmental Services fined Richland County, the Scout project site’s owner, $1 million earlier this year for violating laws to control storm water. The county could pay as much as $3 million if it doesn’t resolve certain problems in coming months.

Still, the environmental violations are a separate cost from the mitigation expenses at the site. The mitigation costs are the result of a plan developed to offset the wetlands and stream losses that project supporters knew were in the project’s path.

Specifically, the mitigation costs to offset the environmental impacts at Scout break down like this:

$27 million for 5,000 acres in lower Richland County adjacent to Congaree National Park. The undeveloped property, composed of two parcels, was collectively valued by the county assessor’s office at $7 million before the sale.

$825,000 for Shelton Island in the Broad River between Fairfield and Union counties. The undeveloped, forested island, which is about 150 acres, was valued at $378,800 by the Fairfield assessor’s office before the sale.

$11.7 million to Water and Land Solutions, a company that provided a variety of services, including development of the mitigation plan in Richland and Fairfield counties. The payment includes preparation of the Richland County land to become a future state forest. Those duties include restoring streams to natural conditions and planting hardwood trees.

$1.4 million to the Open Space Institute, a national non-profit organization. The payment is for the institute’s role in helping find land and to negotiate a sale for the Richland and Fairfield properties.

$11.6 million for the stream restoration project that will occur on the federally protected Sumter National Forest in Chester County. The first of four streams being restored in Chester County is costing $2.2 million for construction. Commerce would not say how much three other streams would cost to restore. But assuming they are the same as the first stream, the expense would increase from $11.6 million to $18.2 million.

Additionally, some of the wetlands offset requirements were met through a mitigation bank in Richland County, although details of that were not available.

Expensive stream restoration plan

Bob Perry, a senior permitting strategist with Water and Land Solutions, said his company worked with the Open Space Institute to find the Richland and Fairfield properties to offset Scout’s impacts in Blythewood.

Those lands were enough to meet federal requirements to obtain the wetlands permit Scout needed for the project, he said. But he said the cost of the project has been driven up by demands from the state DNR and the U.S. EPA to add the national forest stream restoration project to the Scout mitigation package.

Money that Commerce said it committed to pay for the national forest work is only part of what that effort may ultimately cost, Perry predicted.

While The State newspaper has been able to find $18 million in costs expected for the stream project, one Forest Service report from 2014 indicates the cost could be $24 million.

The U.S. Forest Service did not provide a breakdown of the $24 million when asked by The State. The Commerce Department also has refused to provide the full projected costs of the national forest stream work.

Companies involved in the Scout mitigation effort could have found other land to protect, instead of spending millions of dollars restoring streams on already preserved land owned by the federal government, critics say.

“All they had to do was say ‘We want a substantial stream mitigation project in the lower Broad River watershed,’ ’’ Perry said. “I guarantee you, within 30 days, (the Open Space Institute) could have had property under option and we could have had a conceptual mitigation plan written that could have fit right into the permit application.

“And millions of taxpayer dollars would have been saved.’’

A criticism of the national forest work is that it will be a difficult project to complete because the effort involves restoring creeks that have stood as they are for nearly 100 years. The streams and surrounding land eroded in the early to mid-1900s as a result of cotton farming.

But vegetation and forests have grown up around the streams and they blend in with the woodlands today. Getting into heavily forested areas with heavy equipment and smoothing out the landscape will take effort, Perry said.

Critics also question why South Carolina taxpayers are spending money on an environmental restoration project that they say should be a federal taxpayer responsibility.

In fact, the U.S. Forest Service in 2014 entertained the idea of the stream project as part of a wetlands offset package for a proposed nuclear plant south of Charlotte. The plant was never built and the stream project was not done, records show.

Records show that the DNR and EPA pushed for additional Scout mitigation because they said the original package, put together by Water and Land Solutions and others, was not adequate to meet federal standards.

The plan for Scout, as initially proposed, would “barely meet’’ the amount of mitigation needed in “the best-case scenario,’’ according to a July 21, 2023, letter from the S.C. Department of Natural Resources to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which considers permits to fill wetlands.

The type of mitigation proposed by the Commerce Department and Richland County – known as permittee responsible – was riskier than other types of mitigation that could be used, meaning more work was necessary in case something went wrong, the DNR said.

The EPA offered similar comments, saying “It is unclear if the compensatory mitigation plan will sufficiently’’ take care of the federal requirements.

Perry disputed that, saying the mitigation plan put forth initially is a federally accepted way of offsetting wetlands and stream losses.

Some of the disagreement between Perry’s company and the EPA and DNR centered on whether additional wetlands and streams needed to be protected in South Carolina’s Piedmont region because part of the Scout project is in the Piedmont.

The other part of the Scout project is in the sand hills/coastal plain, and most of the wetlands and stream offset work was originally going to occur in that area with the purchase of the 5,000 acres near Congaree National Park.

Federal law favors protecting land or restoring wetlands and creeks in nearby watersheds similar to the ones where development projects are destroying wetlands and streams.

The Southern Environmental Law Center noted this in a June 29, 2023, letter to the federal government. The letter said there was a “disagreement’’ over how much of the Scout property is in the Piedmont, and therefore how much mitigation needed to be done in the Piedmont.

Ultimately, the Commerce Department consented to the extra work, despite the dispute, because it needed to move ahead, those familiar with the issue said.

Congaree Riverkeeper Bill Stangler said restoring degraded creeks in a national forest could control mud from eroding downstream to the Broad River, a source of drinking water for Columbia. The river eventually connects with the lower Saluda to form the Congaree near downtown Columbia.

“I found it interesting just how excited some of the agency folks were to see that project actually getting moving forward, because they’ve been talking about it for a while,’’ said Stangler, who was not involved in detailed discussions about the national forest stream work.

The Sumter National Forest work, in a section of the preserve roughly between Columbia and the Gaffney-Charlotte area, has been of interest to the service for years. The work will reconnect streams to old flood plains, reduce sedimentation and stabilize stream banks, while helping wildlife, the Forest Service said in Aug. 11 email to The State. All told, more than 18 miles of streams would be improved.

Scores of species of crayfish, mussels, fish, frogs and ducks will benefit from the work, Forest Service spokesman Greg Cunningham’s email said.

The company chosen to oversee the stream work is EcoSystem Planning and Restoration, which has offices in Texas, Maryland, Tennessee and North Carolina. The company, commonly referred to as EPR, has become experienced at environmental restoration projects since it was founded in 2012, according to its website. The company revived the 2014 plan to offset the impacts of the proposed nuclear plant in South Carolina.

Records show that the DNR recommended taking a second look at the 2014 proposal to restore streams in the Sumter National Forest.

Officials with EPR and the Department of Natural resources said the project will be a good one because it will help reduce the flow of silt.

“Restoration of these streams will benefit the aquatic ecosystems not only in the Sumter National Forest, but downstream into the Broad River,’’ the DNR said in a written statement.

Congaree land and Shelton Island

The sizable cost of offsetting Scout’s impacts at Blythewood isn’t confined to the national forest work, records show.

South Carolina’s decision to protect the Congaree and Shelton Island tracts involves properties not known to be in immediate danger of being turned into subdivisions or other types of development. Yet buying them cost more than the county-assessed fair market value of the land, records show.

Records in the Fairfield County Assessor’s Office show the state is paying $825,000 for the Shelton Island property that is part of the Scout mitigation package.

That’s more than twice the fair market value of the land before it was sold, records show.

Russ Brown, whose father acquired Shelton Island about 20 years ago for $200,000, said his family agreed to sell the property after being approached by the Open Space Institute, a representative of the state.

Brown and Co. Landbrokers had been advertising the island for sale before the deal was struck, according to a listing on the company’s web site.

Brown, listed as a contact for the sale of Shelton Island, said it’s difficult to compare county property records to the ultimate sales price. County records are often a baseline, founded on mass property appraisals, rather than a specific appraisal done for individual property that is to be purchased, say some real estate experts.

But Brown said the state is getting a good deal for what he described as an ecologically important island.

“This property was loaded with hardwoods, walnuts, lots of different varieties of oak trees; it had just a real variety of wildlife and vegetation out there,’’ Brown said.

Also, in contrast to what county assessor’s office records show, Shelton Island’s owners had studies done before the sale – and the value was in line with the actual purchase price, Brown said.

Despite those assurances, the Open Space Institute, which will own the property until it is turned over to the U.S. Forest Service, declined to release an appraisal showing the presale value of Shelton Island.

Questions at one point surfaced about the price being paid for Shelton Island because the U.S. Forest Service may eventually have bought the land anyway. The service had tried to acquire the island before the Scout mitigation effort surfaced, a spokesman said.

Pointing out the remote location of Shelton Island, the Southern Environmental Law Center also said threats of development “appear to be only vague possibilities, rather than an actual threat to the property,’’ according to a 2023 letter the organization sent the Army Corps of Engineers.

Shelton Island is a densely wooded land formation in the middle of the Broad River between Fairfield and Union counties. There is almost no development nearby and no bridge connects it to the mainland. The island is virtually surrounded by the Sumter National Forest.

In Richland County, the land being saved for conservation near Congaree National Park was owned formerly by members of the Boardman and Beidler families, wealthy Midwest residents with extensive landholdings in South Carolina.

Broken down, the 5,000 acres sold for the Scout mitigation in Richland County showed significant gaps between the county appraised value and the actual sales prices.

One tract, a 2,966 acre parcel, sold for $17.8 million in October 2023, or about $6,000 per acre. It was previously valued by the Richland County Assessor’s Office at $4.5 million, or about $1,517 per acre.

The other tract, a 1,912-acre property, sold for $9.3 million in October 2023, or about $4,900 per acre. It was previously valued at $2.5 million by the county, or about $1,307 per acre.

Efforts to reach representatives of the Boardmans and Beidlers for comment were unsuccessful. The Beidlers provided the original land for Congaree National Park in Richland County and for the Beidler Forest in Dorchester County.

Some real estate experts say it’s not unusual for county values to be lower than actual sales prices because the county provides basic values for tax purposes. So they say it isn’t fair to compare assessed values to actual sales prices. A parcel of land sells for what the buyer is willing to pay, they say.

Even so, the amount spent for the two rural Congaree tracts in Richland County – $4,900 and $6,000 per acre – also exceeded the per-acre-price of some other rural land the state has protected for conservation in recent years.

One recent property of comparable size to the two Richland tracts, Snow’s Island in eastern South Carolina’s Florence County, was acquired through state and federal money for about $2,780 per acre, according to the state Conservation Bank, which specializes in protecting land from development. Snow’s Island is more than 5,000 acres.

The state bought some smaller tracts in Georgetown County and Aiken County for under $3,700 per acre, bank records show.

Those comparisons are not absolute because the value of land and the sales price sometimes depend on where the property is located and what the demand is for the property. Some land acquired by the state for conservation – in development pressured areas of the mountains and the coast – cost the public $8,700 to nearly $13,000 per acre, respectively, bank records show.

Factors Richland County used in establishing values for the 5,000 acres near the Congaree River were its relatively remote location and its proximity to the Westinghouse nuclear fuel plant on Bluff Road, Richland County Assessor Fred Descy said in an interview with The State.

Descy said his office determined that “the land is not going to be developed for quite some time.’’

The nuclear fuel plant property has extensive groundwater contamination from decades of making atomic fuel rods and is the subject of state cleanup efforts, although no contamination is known to have escaped the fuel factory site. The fuel plant is on Bluff Road near the 5,000 acres the state is acquiring.

Mitigation can be expensive

The Open Space Institute’s Berry said it’s not easy negotiating a bargain basement price on land that is needed to compensate for the loss of wetlands and streams at an industrial site.

If landowners know their property is being sought to offset the impacts of a development project, it can drive up the price, he and others agreed.

Commerce said the Richland and Fairfield property owners were approached by representatives of the state about buying their property. Real estate websites show the Brown land company had been marketing Shelton Island for sale.

“None of the properties were being actively listed, but instead were sought out due to their location (in relation to the Corps mitigation service area maps) and their respective mitigation values and general desirability as mitigation sites,’’ Commerce spokeswoman Kelly Coakley said in an email.

The Commerce Department said 13 other chunks of land were considered for protection to offset the Scout impacts, but were ultimately rejected.

Those properties included land in the Crane Creek section of Richland County, an area near the Scout site that would have likely met the goal of mitigation sites being in the same watersheds as industrial sites that destroy wetlands and streams.

Stream and wetlands restoration work in the Crane Creek watershed also could have helped mollify concerns that minority communities downstream from the project site might be flooded with runoff.

The Southern Environmental Law Center’s 2023 letter to the Corps said protecting land in Crane Creek’s watershed “would provide benefits to downstream environmental justice communities.’’

But Commerce said only 309 acres were identified in the Crane Creek area as possible mitigation properties.

Other tracts of land considered by the state included Goose Pond, an 1,184-acre area in lower Richland County near Congaree National Park; Big Wateree Creek, a 6,111-acre area in Fairfield County; and the 2,139-acre Little River area of Fairfield County.

Commerce said none of them generated enough mitigation credit to offset the Scout losses. The mitigation land was chosen after talking with environmental agencies, the email said.

“The Congaree and Shelton Island properties were selected due to their locations and ability to satisfy (in large, block quantities) a significant portion of the mitigation credit needs for the project,’’ Coakley’s email said.

Perry said the owners of the Richland and Fairfield tracts knew the land would be suitable as mitigation for industrial projects and realized the land was being sought specifically to offset Scout’s wetlands and stream impacts. That drove up the price, he said.

“The Congaree and Shelton properties were valued based on the mitigation value … not merely as raw land purchases,’’ according to a statement from Commerce.

In the case of the 5,000 acres, the state “got a fair deal,’’ the Open Space Institute’s Berry said.

“Did we get a big bargain, according to our appraisal? No,’’ Berry said. “But I will tell you that we didn’t grossly overpay, or meaningfully overpay.’’

WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service today announced the tax year 2026 annual inflation adjustments for more than 60 tax provisions, including the tax rate schedules and other tax changes. Revenue Procedure 2025-32 PDF provides details about these annual adjustments.

Notable changes under the One, Big, Beautiful Bill

The tax year 2026 adjustments described below generally apply to tax returns filed in 2027. The tax items for tax year 2026 of greatest interest to most taxpayers include the following dollar amounts:

Standard Deduction. For tax year 2026, the standard deduction increases to $32,200 for married couples filing jointly. For single taxpayers and married individuals filing separately, the standard deduction rises to $16,100 for tax year 2026, and for heads of households, the standard deduction will be $24,150.

(Additionally, for tax year 2025, the OBBB raises the standard deduction amount to $31,500 for married couples filing jointly. For single taxpayers and married individuals filing separately, the standard deduction for 2025 is $15,750, and for heads of households, the standard deduction is $23,625.)

Standard Deduction Single; Married Filing Separately Married Filing Jointly; Surviving Spouses Heads of Households TY 2025 Under OBBB $15,750 $31,500 $23,625 TY 2026 Under OBBB $16,100 $32,200 $24,150

Marginal Rates: For tax year 2026, the top tax rate remains 37% for individual single taxpayers with incomes greater than $640,600 ($768,700 for married couples filing jointly). The other rates are:

35% for incomes over $256,225 ($512,450 for married couples filing jointly);

32% for incomes over $201,775 ($403,550 for married couples filing jointly);

24% for incomes over $105,700 ($211,400 for married couples filing jointly);

22% for incomes over $50,400 ($100,800 for married couples filing jointly);

12% for incomes over $12,400 ($24,800 for married couples filing jointly).

The lowest rate is 10% for incomes of single individuals with incomes of $12,400 or less ($24,800 for married couples filing jointly).

Alternative Minimum Tax Exemption Amounts. For tax year 2026, the exemption amount for unmarried individuals is $90,100 and begins to phase out at $500,000 ($140,200 for married couples filing jointly for whom the exemption begins to phase out at $1,000,000).

Estate Tax Credits. Estates of decedents who die during 2026 have a basic exclusion amount of $15,000,000, up from a total of $13,990,000 for estates of decedents who died in 2025.

Adoption Credits. The maximum credit allowed for adoptions for tax year 2026 is the amount of qualified adoption expenses up to $17,670, up from $17,280 for 2025. For tax year 2026, the amount of credit that may be refundable is $5,120.

Employer-Provided Childcare Tax Credit. For tax year 2026, the OBBB significantly enhances an important credit for employers; it increases the maximum amount of employer-provided childcare tax credit from $150,000 to $500,000 ($600,000 if the employer is an eligible small business).

Other notable items affected by indexing

Earned Income Tax Credits. The tax year 2026 maximum Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) amount is $8,231 for qualifying taxpayers who have three or more qualifying children, up from $8,046 for tax year 2025. Revenue Procedure 2025-32 contains a table providing maximum EITC amount for other categories, income thresholds and phase-outs.

Qualified Transportation Fringe Benefit. For tax year 2026, the monthly limitation for the qualified transportation fringe benefit and the monthly limitation for qualified parking increases to $340, up $15 from 2025.

Health Flexible Spending Cafeteria Plans. For tax years beginning in 2026, the dollar limitation for voluntary employee salary reductions for contributions to health flexible spending arrangements increases to $3,400, up $100 from prior year. For cafeteria plans that permit the carryover of unused amounts, the maximum carryover amount is $680, an increase of $20 from tax years beginning in 2025.

Medical Savings Accounts. For tax year 2026, participants who have self-only coverage in a Medical Savings Account, the plan must have an annual deductible that is not less than $2,900, up $50 from tax year 2025 – but not more than $4,400, an increase of $100 from tax year 2025. For self-only coverage, the maximum out-of-pocket expense amount is $5,850, up $150 from 2025. For tax year 2026, for family coverage, the annual deductible is not less than $5,850, up from $5,700 for 2025; however, the deductible cannot be more than $8,750, up $200 from the limit for tax year 2025. For family coverage, the out-of-pocket expense limit is $10,700 for tax year 2026, an increase of $200 from tax year 2025.

Foreign Earned Income Exclusion. For tax year 2026, the foreign earned income exclusion is $132,900 up from $130,000 for tax year 2025.

Annual Exclusion for Gifts. For tax year 2026, the annual exclusion for gifts remains at $19,000. (However, the annual exclusion for gifts to a spouse who is not a citizen of the United States increases to $194,000 for calendar year 2026, up $4,000 from calendar year 2025.)

Items unaffected by indexing

By statute, certain items that were indexed for inflation in the past are currently not adjusted.

Personal Exemptions. For tax year 2026, personal exemptions remain at 0, as in tax year 2025. The elimination of the personal exemption was a provision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and was made permanent by OBBB. (The personal exemption described here does not include the senior deduction added by OBBB.)

Itemized Deductions. The limitation on itemized deductions was previously eliminated for tax years 2018 - 2025. The elimination of the limitation was made permanent by OBBB, although it imposes a limitation on the tax benefit from itemized deductions for those taxpayers in the highest tax bracket (37%).

Lifetime Learning Credits. The modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) amount used to phase out the Lifetime Learning Credit has not been adjusted for inflation for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2020. The Lifetime Learning Credit is phased out for taxpayers with MAGI between $80,000 and $90,000 ($160,000 and $180,000 for joint returns).",https://www.irs.gov/themes/custom/pup_base/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-09 11:05:54.305691

They were among 223 energy-related projects cut around the country. In San Joaquin County, the job training program went to the Housing Authority and the hydrogen plant was to operate in Lodi.

The job training program was aimed at those living in affordable housing and the disadvantaged. It would have offered skills, including certifications and degrees, needed for employment in the electric vehicle industry, Peter Ragsdale, executive director of the Housing Authority of San Joaquin County, told Stocktonia.

“Investing in living-wage employment opportunities has other significant benefits, including increased self-sufficiency and meaningful economic mobility,” Ragsdale said.

He expressed regret about the funding loss, the amount of which was not immediately available.

“I’m disappointed as the programs have made profound changes in participants’ employment trajectories,” Ragsdale said.

The Lodi Energy Center Hydrogen Project was envisioned as a chance to showcase the use of the clean fuel to produce electricity while powering vehicles, port operations and research.

“It’s outrageous that the Department of Energy is pulling the plug on this vital project. Valley families desperately need cheaper energy, better air quality, and good paying jobs. This project was a win-win-win,” said U.S. Rep. Josh Harder, D-Tracy, in a statement.

Harder, who had been a strong advocate for the plant, said he is calling on the DOE to reverse the decision, though the administration’s decision appeared to have strong political overtones.

Many of the projects canceled were in states that President Donald Trump lost in the November election. NOTUS reported the administration canceled billions in hydrogen project funding in California and the Pacific Northwest, but left similar projects in states that voted for Trump — Texas, Louisiana, West Virginia, Ohio, South Dakota, Pennsylvania and Indiana — alone. The same was also true for other types of energy projects.

The administration said many of the canceled projects were rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration and lacked adequate documentation.

“President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy. Today’s cancellation’s deliver on that commitment. Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright in a statement about the axing of projects.

In announcing it had secured federal funding in 2023, Lodi said the project would have used treated wastewater from the White Slough Pollution Control Facility to make it more sustainable. It would have added jobs and allowed a 300-watt power plant to operate with a blend of natural gas and hydrogen. In vehicles, hydrogen is emission free.

Harder said the project would not only have cut energy bills but helped clean up the air. Stockton and Sacramento, he said, have some of the worst air quality among metropolitan areas in the country.

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (EEHIC) and the Residential Clean Energy Credit (RCEC) apply to a range of home improvements, from replacing windows and air conditioners to installing solar panels and geothermal heat pumps.

Instituted under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, both tax breaks were expanded under the Biden Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, which pushed their expiration date to 2032. With the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, however, that cut-off was moved up to Jan. 1, 2026. (The OBBA also put an end to the $7,500 EV tax credit.)

There’s a lot of money to be saved: Households that claimed the EEHIC in 2023 were able to deduct an average of $880 from their federal returns. The average deduction for the Residential Clean Energy Credit was $5,000.

Some projects will take time to complete, however, especially since you’re in competition with other homeowners facing the same deadline.

With just a few months left, Loyola University environmental policy professor Gilbert Michaud says larger projects may be too ambitious.

“Homeowners may want to focus on the smaller projects that can still capture the tax credits and cut energy bills,” Michaud told CNBC Select, pointing to window replacements, insulation, new appliances and even heat pumps.

“These types of projects can be done in a matter of weeks,” he added, “and will deliver immediate energy savings.”

How much are the home energy tax credits worth?

Both credits are worth 30% of qualified expenses. You can write off a maximum of $3,200 with the EEHIC, including up to $1,200 for energy-efficient doors, windows, skylights, A/C, and insulation. A separate deduction of up to $2,000 is available if you buy and install a heat pump, water heater or biomass stove or boiler by year's end.

Category Maximum credit Home energy audit by certified auditor$150Energy Star-certified windows, doors, skylights, insulation$1,200 (combined)HVAC, heat pump, biomass stove or boiler$2,000Electrical upgradesGo towards $1,200 limit

Except for fuel cell property (which is capped at $500 per half-kilowatt of capacity), the Residential Clean Energy Credit has no dollar limit. Based on an average cost of $27,000, a homeowner who installs solar panels could enjoy tax savings of more than $8,100.

The credits are nonrefundable, so the amount you receive can't exceed your total tax debt.

These upgrades also have long-term implications for your household expenses. In a study by the University of California’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, three-quarters of homeowners who installed rooftop solar were able to lower their electricity bills. The median annual savings came to $691.

Energy-efficient enhancements can also be a boon when you’re ready to sell: According to Zillow, 86% of homebuyers said having at least one climate-resilient feature was an important factor in their buying decision.

Still, when these tax breaks sunset, Michaud predicts a big decline in energy-efficient home improvements.

“We know that financial incentives play a major role in adoption rates — without them, many homeowners will downsize, delay or cancel projects altogether,” he said. “While some affluent homeowners will still make investments, broader adoption is challenging without policy support.”

Bad credit? You can still get funding for major expenses.

(Reuters) -General Motors is scrapping a program aimed at allowing its dealers to continue offering for several months a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles following the Sept. 30 expiration of the federal subsidy, the company said Wednesday.

Toward the end of last month, GM devised a plan to have its in-house lending arm initiate the purchase of EVs in its dealers’ inventory. The company planned to apply for the federal $7,500 credit on those cars hours ahead of the deadline, and then roll that money into EV lease terms for customers.

The idea behind the program was to ease the impact of the expiration of the tax credit on dealers, who worried that they would be stuck with EVs that would be tough to sell. GM had planned to apply for the credit on tens of thousands of EVs in dealer stocks, according to people familiar with the plan.

“After further consideration, we have decided not to claim the tax credit,” the company said in a statement to Reuters Wednesday. The automaker didn’t elaborate on its decision.

Ford rolled out a similar program ahead of the tax-credit expiration. It’s unclear if Ford is continuing its program. A spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

""The primary takeaway is that developing adaptive supply chain strategies is fundamental for the U.S. to be able to weather supply chain disruptions,"" Dvorkin said.
""Diversifying supply sources, creating strategic material reserves, and implementing risk management strategies all offer benefits to help the country mitigate supply chain shocks and continue providing uninterrupted energy supply for consumers nationwide,"" he added.
The team's ultimate goal is to create resilient, adaptable energy systems that can withstand supply chain fluctuations and evolve alongside growing energy demands.","Under current supply chain conditions, the United States is on track to fall significantly short of surging demand for three clean energy sources—wind, solar, and battery—due to the scarcity of critical raw materials, according to a new study from Johns Hopkins University.

This drastic shortfall could potentially be exacerbated by escalating trade wars and tariffs, and compounded by the surging demand for energy being fueled by the exponential growth of artificial intelligence. Unmet surges in energy use have the potential to cause widespread power outages, equipment damage, and increases in electricity rates.

In a new study published in npj Clean Energy, Johns Hopkins University researchers offer insight on the critical dependencies and challenges inherent in U.S. energy supply chains, and suggest how policymakers, industry leaders, and researchers can approach energy production to meet growing demand.

The report is a collaborative effort by the Johns Hopkins Ralph O'Connor Sustainable Energy Institute, the NSF Global Center EPICS, Net Zero Policy Lab, the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, and the Johns Hopkins University Department of Political Science. The study finds that limited access to critical minerals and components threatens to stall the clean energy transition just as data centers fueled by AI push power demand to unprecedented levels, raising urgent concerns about climate targets and energy security.

""Even before the recent AI push, the U.S. was facing a rapidly growing demand for energy—particularly electricity—driven by an increase in electric vehicle and transportation systems, buildings, and data centers,"" said lead author Yury Dvorkin, an associate professor of civil and systems engineering. ""Our research highlights a pressing issue: While energy demand driven by AI growth and electrification is soaring, there's a stark gap between this demand and our supply capabilities.""

The researchers developed an optimization model to simulate supply chain conditions through 2050. Their analysis focuses on essential raw materials for wind, solar, and lithium-ion battery technologies, identifying bottlenecks that obstruct the nation from meeting its energy needs. The team's findings indicate that under current conditions, the country is on track to achieve just 65% of its energy goals, with several raw materials like nickel, aluminum, and silicon identified as fundamental to meeting energy demand.

""The primary takeaway is that developing adaptive supply chain strategies is fundamental for the U.S. to be able to weather supply chain disruptions.""

Yury Dvorkin

Associate professor, civil and systems engineering

The team's optimization model includes the ability to forecast material prices, estimate manufacturing capacities, and simulate geopolitical trade scenarios.

""All of these variables like pricing, regulatory constraints, material availability from either stable partners or autocratic regimes, and permitting timelines have the potential to prevent the U.S. from meeting escalating energy demands,"" Dvorkin said. ""Even when analyzing scenarios with unlimited raw materials, we found that other supply chain constraints would still prevent the country from fully meeting anticipated consumer demand.""

Despite the challenges, the researchers identified several options that could help close the gap between energy production and demand.

The team proposes enhancing domestic production and recycling capabilities for critical materials. This approach includes developing new mining projects, advancing recycling technologies, and establishing strong supply chains for secondary materials.

They suggest that policymakers consider supporting domestic material production through incentives like subsidies, tax breaks, and streamlined regulatory processes to reduce American dependence on imports.

The researchers also recommend promoting technological innovation to find alternatives for scarce materials, which could be realized through a combination of government funding and public-private partnerships as well as strengthening international collaboration to ensure a steady supply of critical materials. Strategic partnerships and trade agreements with stable and unstable trading partners could help secure more long-term access to essential resources.

""The primary takeaway is that developing adaptive supply chain strategies is fundamental for the U.S. to be able to weather supply chain disruptions,"" Dvorkin said.

""Diversifying supply sources, creating strategic material reserves, and implementing risk management strategies all offer benefits to help the country mitigate supply chain shocks and continue providing uninterrupted energy supply for consumers nationwide,"" he added.

In the near future, Dvorkin's team intends to build upon this work by exploring scenarios in which supply chains and grid capacities can be dynamically adjusted to maximize resource availability. The team's ultimate goal is to create resilient, adaptable energy systems that can withstand supply chain fluctuations and evolve alongside growing energy demands.",https://api.hub.jhu.edu/factory/sites/default/files/styles/soft_crop_1300/public/2025-10/wind-solar-battery-getty.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 11:04:28.212298

The week opened with the inauguration of the GIGA-SCALES project plant in Mortsel, Belgium — a new large-scale manufacturing facility for hydrogen components. At the ceremony, Matthias Langemeyer, Head of CINEA’s Green Research and Innovation Department, stood alongside the Belgian Prime Minister and Commissioner Hoekstra.

Backed by €11 million grant from the Innovation Fund, the GIGA-SCALES project is projected to avoid approximately 6.13 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent emissions over ten years, to make green hydrogen more affordable and competitive, and to generate up to 2,000 direct and indirect jobs per year.

The EU Hydrogen Innovation Forum

As in previous years, CINEA participated in the EU Hydrogen Innovation Forum, jointly organised by the European Commission and the Clean Hydrogen Partnership. The Forum is a flagship event within European Hydrogen Week, bringing together policymakers, industry leaders, researchers, investors and innovators from across Europe.

The 2025 edition, held under the theme “Driving Europe’s Competitiveness and Market Uptake with R&I in Clean Hydrogen Technologies”, addressed key topics such as scaling hydrogen start-ups, fostering funding synergies, and strengthening regional hydrogen ecosystems. Richard Ferrer, CINEA’s Head of Sector, participated as a panellist in the session “Funding Synergies: Combining funding for accelerating the development of local ecosystems and bridging the gap to overcome the valley of death”, where he emphasised CINEA’s role in bridging funding gaps and supporting hydrogen deployment across Europe.

The 2025 EU Hydrogen Week gathered more than 1 200 participants for its renewed, conference-only format. European hydrogen leaders from all corners of the continent took part in live discussions shaping the future of the sector. From high-level policy debates to B2B exchanges and innovation showcases, lawmakers, entrepreneurs and stakeholders across the hydrogen value chain came together to present solutions to shared challenges — including slow implementation, high costs and complex regulatory frameworks.

As electricity demand grows and rate pressures mount, nuclear energy is once again drawing attention in Annapolis. Long a steady source of carbon-free power, nuclear is increasingly viewed as a potential pillar of Maryland’s energy future. This deep dive reviews the state’s nuclear history, recent legislative developments, and what may lie ahead as new reactor technologies approach deployment.

A Brief History and Current Status of Nuclear Energy

Maryland’s nuclear experience centers on a single facility: the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant in Calvert County. Commissioned between 1975 and 1977, the two-reactor facility remains the state’s only nuclear station and one of its most reliable power producers. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, as of mid-2025 nuclear generation ranked second statewide at roughly 1.24 million megawatt-hours (MWh)—just behind natural gas at 1.5 million MWh. Hydroelectric (263,000 MWh) and coal (242,000 MWh) trailed far behind, underscoring nuclear’s outsize contribution.

Regionally, Maryland’s reliance on nuclear power exceeds that of most neighboring states. Virginia, with two nuclear plants, generated approximately 2.6 million MWh from nuclear power compared to 6 million MWh from natural gas, while Pennsylvania produced 6.3 million MWh of nuclear power and 13.5 million MWh from natural gas. Though those states produce more electricity overall, Maryland’s share of in-state generation from nuclear ranks among the highest in the Mid-Atlantic, a distinction driven entirely by Calvert Cliffs’ consistent performance.

The Next Generation Energy Act of 2025

The 2025 legislative session—dubbed Maryland’s “Session of Energy”—brought sweeping policy updates through the Next Generation Energy Act (HB 1035/SB 937). The Act codifies that it is now state policy to encourage nuclear power development as part of Maryland’s clean-energy strategy. It directs the Maryland Energy Administration (MEA), Public Service Commission (PSC), and Department of Natural Resources to pursue cooperative cost-sharing agreements with federal and regional partners for potential new nuclear generation.

A major procedural innovation in the Act is the creation of an expedited permitting track for “dispatchable energy” projects, explicitly including nuclear reactors. Qualifying projects can seek a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) decision in roughly nine to ten months—significantly shorter than the multiyear reviews typical for large power projects. The Act also empowers the PSC to oversee competitive application rounds and consider long-term pricing mechanisms, allowing Maryland to assess nuclear as one piece of a broader reliability and decarbonization framework.

Next Generation Energy Act Fiscal Note

Small Modular Reactors: What They Are and Maryland’s Outlook

Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are compact, factory-fabricated nuclear systems—typically under 300 megawatts—that can be assembled on-site and scaled to local demand. Their modularity promises lower construction risk, and many employ passive safety systems that automatically shut down and cool without external power. The Next Generation Energy Act tasks MEA with exploring SMR siting on or near federal properties, such as military installations, that could host reactors serving both base and grid needs.

Nationally, early SMR projects—such as those proposed by the Tennessee Valley Authority and in Ontario, Canada—remain in the licensing phase, with estimated costs near $6 billion for a 300 MW unit. Developers expect costs to decline as designs mature and supply chains scale. For Maryland, realizing an SMR project would likely require substantial investment and coordination with federal partners, but the state’s streamlined permitting and regional planning efforts have positioned it to move quickly when the technology becomes viable.

Conclusion

Nuclear power has quietly supplied Maryland with steady, carbon-free electricity for half a century, and state leaders are now revisiting its potential role in a diversified, resilient energy portfolio. Through the Next Generation Energy Act, Maryland has laid the groundwork to evaluate next-generation nuclear options—including SMRs—without committing to specific projects. While significant technical, financial, and regulatory hurdles remain, the state’s proactive policy framework ensures that, should nuclear innovation fulfill its promise, Maryland will be ready to capture its benefits for decades to come.",https://conduitstreet.mdcounties.org/wp-content/uploads/10.8.2025.png,N,,2025-10-09 11:04:33.658558

Michael Bennet and the administration of Gov. Jared Polis denounced the pending elimination of 34 federal energy grants to Colorado last week, charging the cuts are politically motivated.

The $500 million-plus in grants on the chopping block funded assorted projects and studies, many involving green energy, and are among more than 300 such energy grants, totaling nearly $8 billion, that will be canceled nationwide.

Polis’ energy office issued a statement accusing the Trump administration of using the cuts to target states like Colorado that went for Democratic presidential contender Kamala Harris last November. Bennet lashed out at U.S. Energy Secretary and fellow Coloradan Chris Wright — founder and former CEO of Denver-based Liberty Energy — charging he let Colorado down.

Bennet claimed Wright’s priority “is to serve the political agenda of President Trump, not the interests of our state or the American West.”

Strong words, no doubt calculated to strike a chord in a state where Trump baiting has become a ritual for elected Democrats, like Bennet and Polis, who wield all the levers of power.

Political rhetoric aside, however, Coloradans won’t lose much to these cuts — which grantees still can appeal — and U.S. taxpayers, including those in our state, will gain plenty.

Permit us to add some much-needed perspective.

For starters, as reported by our news affiliate Colorado Politics, a quarter of the awards, about $3 billion, were approved between the election in November and Trump’s inauguration last January. That suggests they were handed out in a rush by the outgoing Biden administration — probably as a political reward to the same states the Trump administration is accused of targeting. In other words, politics as usual.

“On day one, the Energy Department began the critical task of reviewing billions of dollars in financial awards, many rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard,” Wright said in a press statement.

As Colorado Politics also reported, some of the projects awarded to Colorado-based entities are actually in other places — including in “red” states, such as Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Wyoming and Kansas. (That’ll teach ‘em to vote for Trump!)

What really should raise eyebrows, though, are the specifics of some of the grants soon to be axed by Wright’s Energy Department. Like $50 million awarded in January, days before President Trump’s inauguration, to the Tribal Energy Consortium, a “clean” energy initiative for 20 tribes in seven states, including Colorado’s Southern Ute and Ute Mountain tribes.

According to our news affiliate in the nation’s capital, the Washington Examiner, the consortium is actually based in New Mexico, not Colorado, and the grant raised eyebrows given that the consortium’s total funding in the two previous years had never exceeded $50,000 annually.

The grant’s purpose? According to the project’s squishy description at the time the grant was awarded, it would “empower tribal communities to reduce methane emissions on tribal-owned-and-operated marginal conventional wells and at oil and gas facilities on tribal lands.”

Not all the studies and projects were so dubious, but as Wright’s Energy Department now maintains, all the canceled projects “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.” Expendable, in other words.

Sounds like Wright is serving not only the “interests of our state” but also in fact of every U.S. taxpayer — by paring a bloated federal behemoth and our nearly $38 trillion national debt.",https://gazette.com/wp-content/uploads/default-social-image.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 12:13:13.741571

The awards will draw from unobligated Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding, DOE said.
The notice of funding for coal projects draws directly from that July study to justify emergency funding for coal recommissioning and modernization, and points to the executive orders declaring a national energy emergency.
This comes as ever more coal plants announce plans to retire; U.S. power companies have announced the closure or gas conversion of more than nine gigawatts of coal-fired capacity in 2025 alone.
But crucially, these plants are closing down for economic reasons: In most contexts, coal power is simply more expensive and less efficient than fossil gas or renewables.","The Department of Energy has released additional details about how it plans to allocate the $625 million in coal investments it announced last week.

The vast majority of the funds — $525 million — will be distributed via 50% cost share awards, managed by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations. That office, which has been gutted over the last nine months and is now operating with a skeleton workforce, will issue up to ten awards.

Awards will target two of the topic areas outlined by DOE last week in its initial notice of the funding: projects seeking to recommission or modernize coal power plants, and coal projects providing “energy affordability, reliability, and resiliency” to rural communities.

The awards will draw from unobligated Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding, DOE said. That includes the Energy Improvements in Rural or Remote Areas Program, and two of OCED’s carbon capture programs. However, the notice explains that the awards won’t require “immediate CCUS installation.” Carbon management components can be phased in at later stages, it explains.

This is a move that the administration appears to have been preparing for over the course of the last several months. In April, President Trump signed several executive orders instructing Energy Secretary Chris Wright to create a framework for keeping retiring coal plants up and running — a move which, according to some studies, could cost ratepayers $6 billion annually.

In May, DOE issued a mandate to delay the retirement of Michigan’s Campbell coal plant, and in July the agency released a dubious grid reliability study claiming that retiring coal and gas-fired power stations will lead to blackouts.

The notice of funding for coal projects draws directly from that July study to justify emergency funding for coal recommissioning and modernization, and points to the executive orders declaring a national energy emergency.

Activities to be funded include restarting, repairing, and upgrading coal units, with a particular focus on efforts to serve “critical loads” including defense installations, semiconductor factories, hyperscale data centers, and critical mineral processing plants.

This comes as ever more coal plants announce plans to retire; U.S. power companies have announced the closure or gas conversion of more than nine gigawatts of coal-fired capacity in 2025 alone.

Coal comes with high emissions, contributing significantly to human-caused climate change. It accounted for roughly 55% of total carbon dioxide emissions from the U.S. power sector in 2022, as well as harmful gases like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides and other particulates, which cause health problems for those living near coal production.

But crucially, these plants are closing down for economic reasons: In most contexts, coal power is simply more expensive and less efficient than fossil gas or renewables. There are concerns that Trump administration efforts to keep them open would increase electricity rates without improving system reliability. Accordingly, an analysis by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis called these efforts “legally questionable.”

OCED on the chopping block

The coal generation funding notice follows news that DOE is terminating hundreds of awards issued during the Biden administration, including at least 61 OCED awards worth more than $12 billion.

As electricity demand grows, alongside wind and solar’s share in the U.S. energy mix, concerns about renewables’ reliability are being raised more frequently — including at the highest levels of the federal government.

“With the electricity grid, you have to match supply and demand in every moment in time,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said recently on Fox News. “With wind and solar, you don’t know when they’re going to be there, and you don’t know when they’re going to go away.”

Wright went on to say the development of renewables has led to an “extra distribution grid” that has raised energy prices.

But utility planners, grid operators and analysts say wind, solar and batteries are an important part of an evolving power system in which intermittent resources can be reliably scheduled and called upon using sophisticated software and other tools.

They also point to both the levelized cost of electricity for renewables and their competitiveness in automated energy markets that select the least cost units to run in each hour.

“System operators don’t decide whether resources bidding into the market are good or bad,” said Rob Gramlich, president of energy sector consultant Grid Strategies, in an interview.

“There is no central decision maker,” he said. “Markets don’t play favorites.”

With generators retiring, demand rising, and construction, financing, permitting and supply chain challenges growing, operators and analysts acknowledged concerns over the future of the U.S. power system. Many called for diversification of resources, including renewables and storage, to protect electricity reliability and affordability.

“The objective of planning is a portfolio of diverse resources at the least cost possible to avoid outsized impacts from any single one,” said Michael Eugenis, Arizona Public Service’s director of resource planning.

APS is pursuing renewables alongside more natural gas to maintain reliability in its territory, he said.

“That is not the same as a second set or a shadow set of resources,” he added.

Automated markets are selecting renewables

One of the major concerns cited by Wright and others is the intermittent nature of renewables and the impact of that on grid reliability.

One of the ways grid operators measure reliability is using a metric called effective load carrying capability, or ELCC.

Keep up with the story. Subscribe to the Utility Dive free daily newsletter

ELCC is a complex calculation based on comparing what portion of a resource’s nameplate capacity it produces on average in simulations of decades that include factors that cause it to vary, like performance, supply and demand. For fossil resources, variabilities are caused by things like maintenance outages and fuel supply issues. Weather variations impact wind and solar.

ELCCs vary by region and by each system’s portfolio makeup, but nuclear power generally has the highest ELCC, meaning on average over the years, it produces the closest percentage of its nameplate capacity.

In the PJM Interconnection, the country’s largest grid, nuclear was assigned an ELCC of 95% in its most recent auction,

Fixed-tilt solar had the lowest at 8%, and tracking solar was 11%. Onshore wind was 41%, offshore was 69%; storage was between 50% and 72%; gas was between 60% and 78%, and coal was 83%.

“System operators don’t decide whether resources bidding into the market are good or bad ... Markets don’t play favorites.”

But despite their relatively low ELCCs, automated markets are consistently choosing renewables over other resources because they are cheaper at the time the grid needs them.

“The automated market mechanisms use all the relevant variables that affect load to pick the cheapest resources,” said Richard Doying, Grid Strategies vice president and a former executive vice president for market and grid strategy for the former Midcontinent Independent System Operator.

Those resources are bid out, and “then the next cheapest resources, and so on,” Doying said.

“The markets are selecting wind and solar despite their low ELCCs and low capacity values because the return justifies the investment,” he added.

When they are both generating at the same time, renewables are often cheaper than fossil fuel power.

One reason for this is that the fuel and maintenance costs for fossil-based resources are significant, continuous and volatile. Natural gas prices, for example, have nearly doubled since 2024, but are still lower than they were in 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

The fuels for wind and solar are cost-free, maintenance outage costs are significantly less, and the capital expenditures to build projects are typically amortized over 20 years.

“If natural gas was the cheapest option to meet the peak, the markets would select it,” said Sean Kelly, co-founder and CEO of forecast provider Amperon and a former energy analyst.

When the sun’s not shining

Kelly said today’s advanced load and weather forecasting enhances the reliability of a resource portfolio with a high renewables penetration.

While good forecasting can alleviate much of the need for backup generation, he said, rising demand for power will likely require more firm generation to fill the gaps when there is no sun or wind.

The ability to choose the cheapest available power source in real time is why grid operators say renewables are an important part of the same, increasingly flexible power system — not a separate system.

“We don’t have different systems; we have a portfolio of resources and capabilities that meet the needs of the system,” said Mark Rothleder, senior vice president and COO for the California Independent System Operator, in an interview.

California has one of the highest renewables penetrations in the United States. California also has some of the highest electricity rates. Some observers link those to things to argue that renewables drive up energy costs.

But other states with high levels of renewable power have comparatively low rates compared to the national average.

In Iowa, for example, wind turbines generated 59% of the state’s electricity in 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Iowa was also in the 10 states with the lowest average electricity price that year.

While solar and wind are not always available locally when demand is high, storage penetrations are rising and some states are moving toward more regional energy markets where cheaply-produced energy from renewables can be more easily traded across state boundaries.

The New York Independent System Operator said in a recent report that although “duration-limited” generators like wind and solar require standby resources when the availability of the renewable fleet diminishes, “no generating type operates at full power, full time.”

Thinking of resources as either intermittent or backup oversimplifies the complexity of the grid, experts said.

“Wind and solar don’t have to produce 100% of the time because people aren’t consuming all available electricity 100% of the time,” said Beth Garza, a senior fellow at the R Street Institute think tank and former ERCOT market monitor CEO.

“It is easy to vilify solar and wind,” Garza said. But regardless of the resource mix, “the average electricity load is only about half the peak demand.”

When demand peaks

Power systems have long been required to have reserve margins over the highest expected peak demand, and the growth of wind and solar has not changed that, said Julia Matevosyan, an associate director and chief engineer with the Energy Systems Integration Group and a former ERCOT planning engineer.

But advancements in software and market shifts have democratized incentives for energy production, conservation and storage in ways that can smooth demand peaks and deploy resources as needed.

This flexibility can optimize wind, solar and batteries to deliver low cost electricity more reliably than “a more limited set of traditional resources,” Matevosyan said.

Over the summer, California deployed what some advocates have called the largest virtual power plant in the world when several aggregators discharged 539 MW of average output from more than 100,000 customer-sited batteries during peak demand between 7 and 9 p.m.

A Brattle Group study of the deployment commissioned by Sunrun and Tesla Energy, both of which participated in the VPP program, concluded that it could reduce the need for gas peaker plants and potentially save ratepayers $206 million between 2025 and 2028.

Ryan Hledik, one of the report’s authors, said the VPP makes better use of assets that have already been deployed.

“There are a growing number of examples of VPPs scaling faster and at a lower cost than conventional resources,” Hledik said.

Renewables continue to dominate new generation as demand rises

Demand is rising for the first time in two decades. Last year, the U.S. used more electricity than ever before, and the EIA projects demand to grow more than 2% per year until at least 2026. Farther out, the predictions vary widely and are highly dependent on the growth of data centers, electrification and manufacturing.

The vast majority of new generation resources coming online now are renewable, with solar in the lead, followed by wind. Thrugh July 2025. In the first seven months of 2025, solar accounted for over 16 GW of the 21.5 GW added to the U.S. power system. Wind accounted for almost 3.3 GW and natural gas for 2.2 GW, the September Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Infrastructure Update reported.

Federal tax credits and other incentives that are being phased out boosted renewable development. But experts say even without that support, the economics are also in renewables’ favor.

“Wind and solar don’t have to produce 100% of the time because people aren’t consuming all available electricity 100% of the time.”

Beth Garza

senior fellow at R Street Institute and former ERCOT market monitor CEO.

The levelized cost of electricity for utility-scale solar and onshore wind remain “the most cost-effective forms of new-build energy generation on an unsubsidized basis,” according to Lazard analysis. Calculating a technology’s LCOE involves its capital cost, fuel cost, capacity factor, and other values that vary by location and time.

Recently, renewable trade groups have warned of a slowdown in the solar industry. But alternative resources, like natural gas, face their own challenges, from lengthy planning and approval processes to rising fuel prices and years-long equipment backlogs.

“The newest, most efficient natural gas peaker plants are expensive to build and are likely to become more expensive to run because of competition for natural gas,” Garza said. “The market’s answer to load growth is still to build more wind, solar, and batteries because they are the cheaper and faster to build.”

Michelle Solomon, a manager of electricity policy at Energy Innovation, offered a similar observation.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/2ybX9YBjWhaTkH_xU5F1WrWLLF4vm3du9p82Og9VT94/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9jaHJpc193cmlnaHQuanBn.webp,N,,2025-10-09 11:06:04.796086

Even if the tax credits still existed, EVs in the US still have the same four challenges they always have had:

1) not enough charging stations across the country - clumped certain areas and non-existent in others.

2) range and range anxiety (related to #1)

3) battery costs, recycling, and environmental issues

4) high initial cost to acquire EVs (which is what the tax credits were meant to address)

It might be tempting for people to claim that the manufacturers were just pocketing the EV credit since, like the article suggests, Hyundai/Kia among others are offering reductions in price to offset the missing credit. I want to make sure everyone is aware that that 9800 dollar credit does not match the previous price reductions they offered with the credit. A lease on an Ioniq 5 SE while the credit was active could be had for 189/m 4000 down. That same deal now is 260/m. The best deal available on the website for the EV6 Light Long Range is 390/m with 4000 down, but this is more than I paid for my EV6 Wind, with nothing down.

The prices absolutely have gone up now, and it's really disappointing. EVs are the future and creating another generation of ICE vehicles will only make sure our manufacturers are completely non-competitive wards of the state into perpetuity.

The textbook excuses, what page of the oil industry guide book were they gleaned from?

1) not enough charging stations across the country - clumped certain areas and non-existent in others. This was being taken care of by Biden’s IRA Act, which has now been cut by the Trump administration. Care to direct the blame?

2) range and range anxiety (related to #1). Millions do it every day. Anxiety? See a shrink.

3) battery costs, recycling, and environmental issues. Every auto manufacturer has already Created a subsidiary or has gotten into a partnership to recycle their own batteries, thus creating a true circular economy, we’re less and less raw material will ever be needed, unlike oil. See Redwood Industries

4) high initial cost to acquire EVs (which is what the tax credits were meant to address). high initial cost for more vehicles these days. There certainly are cheap EVs out there, with more to come.

The idea that the government can’t/doesn’t pick and choose winners is one of the most cancerous things to take root in the west. If the populous thinks the government can’t help them ontologically, eventually they’ll give up on the government.

Last time this was brought up, someone threw out a proposal for blue states, encompassing the majority of car sales (that point is important) to tax ICE vehicles more to subsidize their citizen’s EVs. With the price of ICE vehicles substantially elevated, and car manufacturers sales threatened, possibly accelerating development and sales of EVs. The petroleum industry would begin the lose power as its sales began to fall. Remember, China is on the downward slope already for oil use in transportation and the EU should be there quite soon.

If I was Rivian, I'd be trying to find a way to shove a range extender under the the hood and cut down the battery, but I think they just got kneecapped. All the other US manufacturers have ICE vehicles and trucks they can fall back on, but I think Rivian just got kneecapped.

It's just so fucking stupid.

No, I think Rivian will be fine. They're the inheritors of the high end Tesla customers. They're not politically incendiary, they're professionally run, their vehicles fit the American market to a T, have great features and look futuristic. They'll fill the hole that Tesla's fiasco has opened up.

Tesla is in a very bad spot after Musk lost his Presidential friend.

Europe sales are shrinking in a growing market.

Chinese sales are down because of competition.

They're not even competitive in the US market, which bars the Chinese completely.

Forget about the consumer tax credits, it's bad but workable with good products.

More importantly, Tesla just lost their most important govt subsidies: green credit payments from other OEMs that were driving profits. They probably don't have years to get robotaxies profitable (they're currently behind), even if it pays off without first mover advantage or any unique advantage.

They needed a home run after the cybertruck fiasco.

1, 3, and 4 are solvable. 3, however, is more difficult

1) Companies are working on this, would help if the government installed them at rest stops along our highways. If we can install vending machines, then we can install chargers.

2) Solid State Batteries are almost here, give it 2-4 years and suddenly EVs will be pushing 500-600 miles per charge. Quantumscape just showed off their latest production assembly (Cobra Seperator) which scales up for mass production. They are already working with Volkswagen and just announced a deal with Corning. They dont plan on making SSBs themselves, but license out the technology.

3) The mass production of batteries will bring down the costs. Theres maybe a dozen factories being built in the USA specifically for this purpose. How much cheaper will batteries get? I dont know. Theres also a few companies that show promise in recycling old batteries. Microvast is another Solid State Battery company, and they have a battery that can handle 6,000 charge cycles, which would last the lifetime of the EV itself, so less recycling would be needed.

Environmental issues are difficult, but a problem for any manufacturing, including ICE vehicles.

4) If you live in a house and dont mind it taking 6-8 hours to fully charge your EV, then level 1 chargers are incredibly cheap and easy to install. Its the level 3 chargers that cost $15-30k and absolute require a professional install.

I am not one to tout the current charging networks as enough, Superchargers still have corridors to fill as well as the old ones needing updates for more power and support for other manufacturers charging port locations and the rest of the networks are too flaky. But even though I live in a pretty big charger hole (50 to 80 miles to the first Supercharger) and not all corridors are covered, I think the network is close enough for most road trips which means everyone that can charge at home. There is a long time to go before we need to worry about those that can’t charge at home, and there’s plenty of time to build out the charging networks. Tesla continues to do so.

This is precisely what we did. Even if one car needs to be ICE - preferably hybrid - there is no reason for the other not to be an EV. I drive an Ioniq5 I bought used for a tick over $30k and I'm fonder of it than any other car I've owned since my first one, an XJ Cherokee. It has impaired our ability to travel, commute, and go about our lives not at all.

And before anyone gets too shirty about ""but not everyone lives in a single family residence, how dare you forget about apartment dwellers"" the EV market could grow for years, maybe a decade, just by making inroads with single-family homeowners with garages.

Of note:

See How E.V. Road Trips Went From Impossible to Easy​

Sept. 29, 2025

The Upshot used charger location data from the Department of Energy to analyze more than 1,000 single-day trips connecting major U.S. cities. A decade ago, all but a handful of those routes had gaps of more than 100 miles between fast chargers. In many cases, those charging deserts stretched over 200 miles, making many routes effectively impassable for E.V.s.

By 2025, that had flipped. The vast majority of these routes now have a fast charger at least every 100 miles; most have far more than that.

Significant private investment continues to pour in. A group of major car manufacturers has started the Ionna network, which has committed to building 30,000 charging ports across the country. Ford and Rivian have each already built more than 100 fast-charging stations. Volkswagen funded the Electrify America network with $2 billion that it was required to set aside after cheating on diesel emission tests; the network now has around 1,000 fast-charging stations.

There are also major E.V. infrastructure companies building out their networks. In total, six big networks — Tesla, ChargePoint, EVgo, Electrify America, EV Connect and Blink — have built more than two-thirds of the country’s fast-charging stations. A number of smaller operators own the rest, including power companies like Hawaiian Electric, Florida Power and Light and Iowa’s MidAmerican, which have all become major fast-charger operators in their states.

And retailers and gas stations have joined the rush: Buc-ee’s, the supersize travel stop chain, is adding E.V. chargers to its stations, and Walmart has announced it will install thousands of fast chargers at its stores.

The investment isn't coming from one place, in other words. It's coming from everywhere, at an increasing rate.

It doesn't matter what administration is running things, billions are collected from gas taxes every year (federal, state, and sometimes local). If there's ever a significant percentage of electric cars on the road and not using gas then politicians are going to want to get that money somehow. New taxes are coming it's just a question of what form they are going to take.

Usually, range anxiety is expressed because ""I live a boring, constrained life but I aspire to be the kind of person who has cool adventures like long road trips and overland expeditions, and maintaining the largely theoretical capability to do those things without perceived limitation or friction maintains those aspirations in a way I am psychologically dependent on.""

I expect a tax credit soon for soot-powered, coal-burning cars. Or whatever is out there that might be even more environmentally destructive than gas (if anything). That's how a Trump administration rolls (coal).

2) Solid State Batteries are almost here, give it 2-4 years and suddenly EVs will be pushing 500-600 miles per charge. Quantumscape just showed off their latest production assembly (Cobra Seperator) which scales up for mass production. They are already working with Volkswagen and just announced a deal with Corning. They dont plan on making SSBs themselves, but license out the technology.

I'm still very skeptical, not of solid-state batteries, but that 400+ mile ranges are going to ever be a thing in high-volume EVs. Towing packages on pickups and SUVs? Sure. Luxury vehicles that want to use range as a bragging point? Quite possibly. Off-road focused SUVs that want to sell the idea of being able to go anywhere? Maybe. But unless batteries get much, much cheaper, then having more battery than almost anyone would use in one stop just doesn't seem like it makes sense to me. Especially with solid state batteries that live up to their promises (really fast charging, no problem going from 0-100%, more tolerant of extreme temperatures). So I guess I don't understand why no one's talking about using the tech to make smaller and lighter 300-400 mile range batteries, rather than everyone talking about 500+ mile ranges.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, challenges the EPA’s August decision to halt the Solar for All program.
Created under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the initiative was projected to help 900,000 households install rooftop or community solar.
Plaintiffs include the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, Solar United Neighbors, the Hopi Tribal Council, the Rhode Island Center for Justice, and solar installers in Georgia and Pennsylvania.
“EPA’s termination of the $7 billion Solar for All program is a betrayal,” Blanchard said.","A coalition of labor unions, nonprofits, solar companies, and homeowners filed suit Monday against the Environmental Protection Agency. The group alleges the agency unlawfully terminated $7 billion in federal grants intended to expand solar access in marginalized and low-income communities, including tribal nations.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, challenges the EPA’s August decision to halt the Solar for All program. Created under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the initiative was projected to help 900,000 households install rooftop or community solar. The program included more than $500 million in commitments to Indian Country.

Plaintiffs include the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, Solar United Neighbors, the Hopi Tribal Council, the Rhode Island Center for Justice, and solar installers in Georgia and Pennsylvania. The plaintiffs are asking the court to vacate EPA’s action and reinstate the program.

According to a press release from legal organization Lawyers for Good Government, which is part of a legal team representing the plaintiffs, the suit argues the EPA acted unlawfully by canceling grants that had already been awarded. The organization's executive vice president for Climate Change and Environmental Justice, Jillian Blanchard, said the agency’s claim that the funds were rescinded is “patently false and legally unsupportable” in a statement.

“EPA’s termination of the $7 billion Solar for All program is a betrayal,” Blanchard said. “This administration is sending a clear message: They will make Americans pay with their savings and their health in order to benefit the fossil fuel industry.”

According to reporting from the New York Times, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in August the agency no longer had authority to administer the program, citing Trump’s domestic policy bill, which he said eliminated “billions of green slush fund dollars.”

Tribal Business News previously reported that the termination cut more than $500 million in funding earmarked for tribal energy projects. Six tribal-focused organizations had received awards, including the Midwest Tribal Energy Resources Association, which said the loss would upend plans to deliver solar to 35 member tribes across the Great Lakes region. More money was coming in state programs, such as the Washington State Department of Commerce’s Solar for All plan.

The Solar for All termination was part of a wider rescission of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a $27 billion allocation under the Inflation Reduction Act that also aimed to improve access to energy financing for both Native-serving green banks and Native community development financial institutions.

The fund included the National Clean Investment Fund ($14 billion) and the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator ($6 billion), which also faced legal challenges after their terminations. Federal courts were initially sympathetic, but a 3-person panel of judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals later sided with the EPA by a 2-1 decision that the lower court lacked jurisdiction. The decision found that the suit should be brought in the Court of Federal Claims as a contract violation case, which could take years, according to legal experts. The plaintiffs in the suit have since filed for a rehearing, asking the full Circuit Court to hear the case.

The U.S. is the world’s top LNG exporter with total capacity expected to reach 115 million MTPA this year, according to the country’s Energy Information Administration.

The industry has enjoyed strong global demand and policy support from President Donald Trump, who returned to office in January promising to unleash U.S. energy. He also reversed a freeze on new export permits.

The pipelines, which will be constructed and operated by ARM, will have a total capacity of 2.5 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) and are expected to be completed in late 2028 or early 2029.

The 236-mile pipeline will include three segments – Mustang Mainline, Cougar lateral and the Golden triangle where the mainline will connect Katy Hub to Port Arthur.

The difference between one type of power line and another might seem to be just a technical issue, but it can have real-world impacts on consumers’ power bills.
America’s federal and state regulators have expressed strong support for these advanced technologies, at least partly because of their cost savings.
Delivering consumer savings for everyone and expanding the Commonwealth’s AI leadership through advanced power line solutions depends on leadership.
HPCs offer a clear path to an affordable, reliable, and growing power supply for all electricity customers.","Jeff Dennis is executive director of the Electricity Customers Alliance, a coalition that advocates for customer-centric solutions to grid modernization and energy affordability challenges.

A modern economy requires modern energy solutions to meet the growing energy demand created by reshored manufacturing, increased electrification of homes, businesses, and vehicles, and — of course — data centers.

Virginia and the Mid-Atlantic house the data center capital of the Western world, and the Commonwealth is positioned to lead America’s push to win the global artificial intelligence race. Data center growth can deliver many economic benefits to communities. However, this increased electricity demand requires smartly planned power infrastructure and a focus on short- and long-term solutions to address consumers’ concerns about their power bills.

Planning and building electricity infrastructure to meet rapidly growing demand while keeping electricity affordable for all consumers will take time. However, data centers and manufacturers need power now to win the AI race and capture new economic opportunities in manufacturing and the digital economy. Virginia must capitalize on short-term opportunities to expand and maximize the use of our existing grid assets to deliver more power while setting the foundation for smart, long-term buildout of our shared electricity grid.

To address this challenge, the General Assembly passed, and Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed, legislation to encourage deployment of advanced transmission technologies that maximize the amount of power that can be delivered from our existing lines. Beginning in 2026, the legislation requires the State Corporation Commission to consider the use of new power line technologies called “advanced conductors” when deciding how to bring more power supply onto the grid. Many other Mid-Atlantic states have followed Virginia’s lead in encouraging adoption of these technologies to help meet our needs today while establishing a foundation for an efficient future electricity system.

That’s great news for consumers — but it’s just the first step. Regulators at the SCC must now ensure the legislation succeeds by requiring Virginia’s utilities to pursue innovation in power line technologies, rather than simply reinvesting in the technologies of the past.

The difference between one type of power line and another might seem to be just a technical issue, but it can have real-world impacts on consumers’ power bills. Not all line technologies are truly “advanced” enough to deliver the cost savings that newer, more efficient, and lighter models known as high-performance conductors can. HPCs use carbon fiber composites in place of traditional steel for better performance. These are the same materials that have dramatically improved the performance of airplanes, cars and trucks, military technology, and myriad other products. They make HPCs lighter, stronger and — most importantly — able to carry much more electricity safely and reliably.

Using HPC technologies for power lines can double their ability to move electricity, reduce power loss due to heat by up to 30%, and improve the overall efficiency of the grid — all critical to ensuring a stable and growing power supply while our regional power regulator, the PJM Interconnection, finalizes its long-term transmission plans. That means less disruption for suburban and rural communities and shortened wait times for companies looking to connect to the grid, enabling faster economic growth for the region — and at a lower cost.

There are already hundreds of HPC lines in operation across the U.S. and thousands worldwide. America’s federal and state regulators have expressed strong support for these advanced technologies, at least partly because of their cost savings. A recent report estimated that deploying HPCs on just 25% of the aging power lines across the country would save American consumers at least $140 billion. Some of the largest new power users are directly investing in HPCs to drive these consumer savings. Google, for example, recently announced a partnership to accelerate HPC deployment to increase grid capacity.

Delivering consumer savings for everyone and expanding the Commonwealth’s AI leadership through advanced power line solutions depends on leadership. Given the acute challenges the AI revolution poses for our power system, all potential solutions need fair, transparent consideration.

HPCs offer a clear path to an affordable, reliable, and growing power supply for all electricity customers. By requiring power utilities to demonstrate that they have considered deploying HPCs in all new transmission projects, the Commonwealth’s electricity regulators can reduce pressure on the existing grid footprint, drive consumer prices down, and keep Virginia at the forefront of America’s digital economy.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/SJZUNag856FhamJM4AxnLiHWA6_930Dh5v2ts4incw4/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS8zNjYzNjU5ODIwXzBmYzY1MjA3YTNfay5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-10-09 13:08:17.333838

“While ancillary services-focused approaches delivered solid returns in ERCOT during 2023, and basic charge low/ discharge-high strategies worked effectively in CAISO, the rapid deployment of BESS assets has created intense competition, which demands sophisticated optimisation to capture excess returns beyond market benchmarks.”

“To remain competitive, battery storage operators must transition from basic arbitrage strategies to highly optimised, integrated solutions that capture returns that outperform the benchmark when adjusted for risk (what the financial world calls alpha).”

The funding cuts, carried out by the Trump administration through the U.S. Department of Energy, will strip resources from dozens of companies, universities, and nonprofit organizations across the state.

Hochul’s office estimates the ripple effect could climb as high as $650 million in lost economic activity.

“These cuts directly impact local businesses and major companies, putting workers out of jobs, shuttering factories, and slowing our state’s economic progress,” Hochul said. “Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Congress are playing politics with the government shutdown, and New York’s economy and hard-working families are paying the price.”

The Department of Energy’s decision affects more than two dozen companies and institutions, halting research, development, and infrastructure projects from Western New York to New York City.

-Plug Power Inc. in Rochester and the Capital Region will lose over $147 million.

-GE Vernova and GE are facing reductions totaling more than $62 million in the Capital Region.

-IBM is losing nearly $20 million in the Mid-Hudson area.

-The American Institute of Chemical Engineers will see over $79 million cut statewide.

-Urban Mining Industries and Urban Electric Power in the Mid-Hudson region will forfeit more than $43 million.

Additionally, major universities including Cornell, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and Columbia University are expected to be heavily impacted by the loss of federal support.

Empire State Development President Hope Knight condemned the move, saying the funding losses will “stifle New York’s clean energy economy while killing good-paying jobs.”

Doreen Harris, who heads the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), called the cuts “short-sighted,” noting they add “further uncertainty for organizations and businesses that need stability to plan, invest, and grow.”

The decision has drawn broad condemnation from Democratic lawmakers. Both Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand joined the governor in denouncing the move, along with nearly every Democratic member of New York’s congressional delegation.

Schumer labeled the cuts a “reckless campaign of chaos and revenge” and argued they would “raise families’ electric bills just to score petty political points.”

Hochul and state officials are now urging New York’s Republican representatives in Congress to intervene and pressure the administration to restore the funding.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a6ba08_a8fd9975174e42fe830cc2e0b346494c~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1000,h_667,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/a6ba08_a8fd9975174e42fe830cc2e0b346494c~mv2.png",N,,2025-10-09 12:11:02.431175

With more than 3.5 million workers, clean energy is the backbone of the U.S. energy sector.
Last year, 82 percent of all new energy jobs were clean energy jobs.

WASHINGTON (Oct. 9, 2025) – Last week, the Department of Energy (DOE) cancelled federal support for 321 major energy projects – including transmission grid upgrades, new hydrogen projects and methane reduction projects for the oil and gas industry – taking back more than $7.5 billion in funding that had previously been promised to American businesses. This week, the Trump Administration is considering plans to pull back an additional $12 billion in funding for projects designed to expand American-made energy.

The following is a statement from Sandra Purohit, federal advocacy director for the national nonpartisan business group E2:

“Dismantling clean energy projects across the country at a time when some Americans are seeing their electricity bills skyrocket, at twice the rate of inflation since 2020, simply makes no sense,” Purohit said. “The president has said we are facing an energy emergency. But adding obstacles to building the cheapest, fastest sources of energy, and stalling energy innovation is a confounding choice that’s antithetical to a free and open market.”

The slashing of investments in clean energy – even while solar, wind, and batteries remain the cheapest source of power we can build – also threatens to kill one of the fastest-growing employment sectors in America, according to E2.

In 2024, clean energy jobs grew more than three times faster than the rest of the U.S. economy, as detailed in E2’s annual Clean Jobs America report. With more than 3.5 million workers, clean energy is the backbone of the U.S. energy sector. Last year, 82 percent of all new energy jobs were clean energy jobs.

The administration’s attempts to stop the expansion of renewable energy in America have already caused businesses to cancel more than $22 billion in clean energy projects and more than 16,000 jobs in the first half of 2024, and the DOE’s latest actions will likely cause more cancellations, according to Purohit.

For more information regarding clean energy projects and related jobs, see E2’s Clean Economy Works database. Reporters wishing to get an embargoed copy of the latest forthcoming update to the database can contact Daniel Baker at dbaker@e2.org.

,Texas Environment,2025-10-09 12:48:09+00:00,The Conversation,"Refinery fires, other chemical disasters may no longer get safety investigations - The Conversation","Philip Steenstra, Rachel O’Brien, Stuart Batterman",,,,,https://theconversation.com/refinery-fires-other-chemical-disasters-may-no-longer-get-safety-investigations-265546,"As scholars of chemical disasters, we believe this absence – and the potential for the board to be eliminated entirely under the proposed 2026 federal budget – raises the risk of more, and more serious, chemical disasters, not just in the U.S. but around the world.
And the Texas fire was just one of several disasters the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board investigated that year.
Since its activation in 1998, the board has conducted in-depth investigations of 102 chemical disasters in the chemical and industrial sectors – an average of about four per year.
Creation and goals of the CSB The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board was created by Congress in a 1990 amendment to the Clean Air Act, in the wake of several high-profile chemical disasters around the world.
These recommendations can range from changes in procedure, the addition of safety devices or even overall facility design recommendations.","When fire erupted at the Intercontinental Terminals Co. bulk liquid petroleum storage terminal, large plumes of dark smoke billowed into the clear skies over Deer Park, Texas. Despite the efforts of site staff and local firefighters, more than 70 million gallons of petroleum products burned or were otherwise released into the environment over the following three days in March 2019.

Even while the fire was still burning, investigations began looking into what had happened and what was still happening. The Environmental Protection Agency tested air and water samples to determine how much pollution was being released – both to determine cleanup efforts and to assess fines. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration reviewed what had happened, but found that with no workers injured, there was no reason to investigate further or impose fines or other penalties on the company.

A third federal agency, the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, often known as the CSB, got to work figuring out what had gone wrong, without assigning legal or financial responsibility, but rather seeking to learn from this disaster how to prevent future accidents. It’s an approach much like the National Transportation Safety Board takes toward airplane crashes, train derailments and other transportation-related tragedies: document what happened and identify every opportunity to prevent or reduce the chances of it happening again.

That deep investigative process reportedly will not happen in the wake of the October 2025 explosion and fire at a Chevron refinery in El Segundo, California, because of the federal government shutdown and lack of funding for the organization.

As scholars of chemical disasters, we believe this absence – and the potential for the board to be eliminated entirely under the proposed 2026 federal budget – raises the risk of more, and more serious, chemical disasters, not just in the U.S. but around the world.

Many serious incidents

The CSB investigation of that 2019 fire that burned 15 petroleum tanks at the Intercontinental Terminals Co., near the Port of Houston, yielded key recommendations to the company, OSHA and the EPA. They included necessary updates to safety management systems, the need for flammable-gas detectors to identify leaks, and remotely operated emergency shutoff valves so workers could close tanks containing hazardous material without exposing themselves to danger. The company has addressed the first recommendation and is reportedly working on the next two.

The board also recommended to the petroleum industry that storage tanks be spaced farther apart so they would be less likely to catch each other on fire – a recommendation that is still under review.

And the Texas fire was just one of several disasters the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board investigated that year. Since its activation in 1998, the board has conducted in-depth investigations of 102 chemical disasters in the chemical and industrial sectors – an average of about four per year. And its reports are regularly used worldwide, including in France, South Korea and China.

Creation and goals of the CSB

The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board was created by Congress in a 1990 amendment to the Clean Air Act, in the wake of several high-profile chemical disasters around the world.

Those included the 1976 dioxin release in Seveso, Italy, which caused skin lesions on over 600 people and contaminated nearly 7 square miles of land; the deaths of thousands in Bhopal, India, from the 1984 release of methyl isocyanate from a Union Carbide pesticide plant; and the Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster in 1986 in what was then the Soviet Union. The goal was to prevent similar accidents from occurring on U.S. soil by investigating the causes of incidents and providing recommendations for improvement.

Specifically designed to be independent of other organizations and political influence, the CSB cannot be forced to modify its findings by other agencies, branches or political parties, ensuring its impartiality.

It has no power to issue regulations, nor any authority to impose fines or other punishments for wrongdoing. Rather, it is a fact-finding, investigative body designed to learn from past disasters and issue voluntary recommendations so chemical companies can improve their equipment and processes to prevent future tragedies. The vast majority of its recommendations are adopted by the industries affected, usually by the investigated company, though sometimes recommendations become industry standards. These recommendations can range from changes in procedure, the addition of safety devices or even overall facility design recommendations.

What does the board do?

There are several kinds of events companies must report to the federal government, including deaths and releases of particular chemicals, such as chlorine, naphthalene and vinyl chloride.

The board reviews those reports and decides on its own which to investigate. When an inquiry is opened, a group of experts who work for the board travel to the incident site to gather evidence to understand not only what happened in the big picture but a detailed view of how events unfolded.

After the investigation, the board issues a report detailing what it found and recommending specific changes to the company to reduce the risk of that sequence of events happening again. The board also delivers its information to other federal agencies, such as the EPA and OSHA, which can determine whether changes would be appropriate to federal regulations that apply to all companies in an industry.

The board’s value

The board had a US$14 million annual budget for 2025, which is a tiny part of the more than $6 trillion the U.S. government spends each year.

The current administration’s justification for eliminating the CSB is that its capabilities are duplicated by agencies such as the EPA and OSHA. But the EPA focuses specifically on environmental violations and potential threats to human life. OSHA investigates regulatory violations leading to personal injury.

In fact, the CSB has helped the EPA and OSHA evaluate and improve regulations, such as for the open burning of waste explosives, and improved methods of investigating accidental chemical releases and implementing new emergency response rules.

The CSB is the only organization that looks into improving processes to prevent future accidents instead of punishing past acts. It’s the difference between investigating who robbed a bank to hold the robbers accountable and improving bank security so another robbery can’t occur.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/694944/original/file-20251007-56-d601ug.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C324%2C5272%2C2636&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-09 09:04:00.623428

In September, Orsted cut its full-year guidance, citing lower-than-normal offshore wind speeds across its offshore portfolio.
Orsted currently employs around 8,000 people worldwide, and said it would reduce its headcount by 500 before the end of this year, culminating in a total of 2,000 reductions.
""At the same time, we want to create a more efficient and flexible organisation and a more competitive Ørsted, ready to bid on new value-accretive offshore wind projects.""","Beleaguered wind farm operator Orsted announced Thursday that it intends to reduce its workforce by a quarter toward the end of 2027, in a bid to become more competitive and refocus its efforts on Europe.

Shares were 0.7% higher in European trade on Thursday. The stock came under pressure earlier this year amid concerted efforts from the White House to reduce renewable energy generation in the United States.

On his first day in office, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order suspending new or renewed onshore and offshore wind leases. He also told reporters earlier this year that during his presidency, America was ""not going to do the wind thing.""

Over the summer, the Trump administration ordered Orsted to halt construction on its Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island — which was 80% complete and set to power more than 350,000 homes. A U.S. court overturned that order last month.

In September, Orsted cut its full-year guidance, citing lower-than-normal offshore wind speeds across its offshore portfolio.

""Today, we've told our employees that from now and until the end of 2027, we'll be saying goodbye to many skilled and valued colleagues who've contributed greatly to Ørsted,"" Rasmus Errboe, the company's CEO, said in a statement on Thursday.

Orsted currently employs around 8,000 people worldwide, and said it would reduce its headcount by 500 before the end of this year, culminating in a total of 2,000 reductions. The firm will trim employee numbers through natural attrition, cutting positions, divestment, outsourcing, and layoffs, it said.

The annual savings for Orsted are expected to amount to 2 billion Danish krona ($311 million) from 2028.

""This is a necessary consequence of our decision to focus our business and the fact that we'll be finalising our large construction portfolio in the coming years – which is why we'll need fewer employees,"" Errboe added on Thursday.

The incident that shook Chevron’s El Segundo refinery last week once would have prompted a federal investigation. Not anymore.

As the Trump administration moves to weaken the U.S. Chemical Safety Board, California still hasn’t said whether any agency, department or authority will take charge of a comprehensive investigation when a refinery erupts — something that’s happened twice this year.

Separately, in response to fears over higher gas prices, Gov. Gavin Newsom and state lawmakers have opened the door to more drilling, and state agencies have delayed, or moved to loosen, new oversight measures.

“It does raise the issue of who’s watching the refineries,” said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog. “They’re the most dangerous manufacturing facilities we have in our communities.”

Scholars and engineers as well as local agencies and fenceline communities have seen the now-inactive chemical safety board as a vital source of information into the causes of major incidents at refineries. The independent federal agency “was the gold standard for investigations of these kinds of incidents,” said Greg Karras, an environmental advocate and independent consultant.

But the Trump administration has argued that the board “duplicates substantial responsibilities” of other agencies. In President Donald Trump’s first term, the White House proposed eliminating the board; in this second term, executive branch officials have again proposed to zero out its budget.

The California Environmental Protection Agency is not leading a broad, multi-regulatory investigation after the Oct. 2 explosion. Instead, says CalEPA spokesperson Diana Ibrahim, the agency is “ready to support” the El Segundo Fire Department, which will lead a safety review.

Other state, regional and local agencies are investigating for their own purposes — a specialized unit of the California Department of Industrial Relations for worker hazards, the South Coast Air Quality Management District for pollution and the California Energy Commission for fuel supply — while Chevron runs its own internal review.

“It’s quite siloed,” said Earthjustice attorney Oscar Espino-Padron. “It’s often difficult to point to one body that’s really helping to coordinate and compile all of the necessary information.”

Earlier this year, an explosion at the Martinez Refinery, owned by PBF Energy, injured six workers and caused a shelter-in-place order. The Martinez and El Segundo incidents are the latest in a string of nearly a dozen major refinery explosions and fires in California over the past decade.

Some lawmakers and advocates are frustrated that the state has yet to get ahead of the problem.

“A fire in El Segundo has to happen for us to … wake up?” said state Sen. Lena Gonzalez, a Democrat from Long Beach whose bill to create a statewide standard for refinery air-quality monitoring was vetoed by Newsom last year. “It’s just so ridiculous.”

Watchdogs said to struggle reining in refineries

State and local agencies that launched investigations after last week’s fire have struggled to enforce refinery rules in the past, according to observers.

In the five years leading up to the explosion, the South Coast Air Quality Management District’s inspectors issued 46 notices of violation to Chevron in El Segundo. The most recent, issued July 30, alleged that the refinery failed to properly control the burning of excess gases at a piece of equipment related to its Isomax unit, which uses hydrogen, heat and pressure to break down heavier oils into lighter fuels like jet fuel. That’s the same part of the refinery that caught fire last week.

That notice is not yet finalized, a process that can take months or years. Espino-Padron, the Earthjustice attorney, said the air district’s oversight is often opaque, with residents having no easy way to tell when or how a notice of violation is resolved. Penalties also tend to be minimal, he said.

“The reality is there isn’t enough personnel to really provide adequate oversight of these operations,” he said. “What you see is not significant, robust enforcement.”

Rainbow Yeung, a spokesperson for the South Coast air district, rejected criticisms of the district’s inspection practices, enforcement and transparency. Yeung said the district is coordinating with other agencies on possible enforcement actions “with an eye toward protecting the public going forward.”

At the Chevron facility over the last decade, CalOSHA opened 18 accident and complaint inspections, eventually issuing nearly two dozen violations. The most recent CalOSHA investigation began on Sept. 11.

Garrett Brown, a retired employee of the agency, said that the inspection teams are short staffed. The agency’s ability to investigate is “compromised,” he said, in part because of recent turnover.

Denisse Gomez, from the Department of Industrial Relations, says that Cal/OSHA “has consistently carried out its duties” in responding to refinery incidents and “continues to strengthen its specialized workforce through active recruitment and training to protect workers and uphold California’s nation-leading refinery safety program.”

Safety standards face rollbacks

California has some of the nation’s toughest refinery safety rules because of two earlier explosions – one in 2012 at Chevron’s Richmond refinery, and another in 2015 at ExxonMobil in Torrance. The rules are built around the concept of process safety, which requires refineries to identify and fix hazards before accidents occur and to involve workers directly in investigations when they do. The system is designed to prevent the kind of cascading failures that have caused refinery explosions in the past.

But after the Western States Petroleum Association sued to block the rules, calling them burdensome, CalEPA and other state agencies quietly settled the suit. Unions and advocates say revisions to two regulations prompted by that settlement could weaken key safeguards.

The agency is updating the accidental release program rule for refineries and has yet to finalize those revisions. A companion rule at the state’s workplace safety agency is unchanged, for now; regulators are proposing to update the rule next year.

WSPA spokesman Jim Stanley did not comment on the settlement or process safety regulations specifically, but he argued that California refineries follow some of the industry’s strictest rules.

“From CalOSHA to local air districts to the California EPA, refiners work closely with regulators at all levels of government and our partners in labor to minimize the risk of accidents, keep workers and communities safe, and comply with environmental standards,” he said.

But Mike Smith, chair of the United Steelworkers National Oil Bargaining Program, said that the heart of refinery safety is having experts on site who can fully understand what’s happening inside the plant.

“Obviously, any weakening of safety regulations in the refining sector is not good,” he said.

Smith said that the rules have been under threat after the union was excluded from settlement negotiations between industry and the state over those protocols.

“The foundation really is employee participation,” Smith said. “The experts in the plants playing a role.”

The debate over those revisions comes as California’s political priorities shift—from tightening refinery oversight to keeping fuel flowing.

California eases up on oil

In an effort to lower gas prices and keep up with growing energy needs, California’s Democratic leaders have softened their stance toward the oil industry this year. For years, Newsom blasted refiners for high gas prices and promised to phase out drilling. Faced with the threat of refineries closing, potentially imperiling supply and pushing up prices, he too has changed course.

In 2024, two days after signing a measure aimed at pricing and maintenance schedules, Phillips 66 announced it would shut its Los Angeles refinery by the end of 2025, citing doubts about the sustainability of California’s market. In April, Valero said it would close its Benicia refinery next year, blaming a challenging regulatory environment.

Last month Newsom signed a bill that opened the way for new wells in Kern County. At the same time, the Energy Commission slowed implementation on many of the measures Newsom had previously pushed, such as ones on fuel inventories, resupply after outages, refinery maintenance and a long-promised price-gouging penalty.

Critics argue those moves have left the state more exposed to price spikes in the wake of the El Segundo fire and without strong tools to steady supply or hold refiners accountable. That’s “very dangerous in moments like this,” said Court of Consumer Watchdog.

Stanley, the spokesman for WSPA, said the refinery rules and other measures were impractical.

Following the fire, Chevron made adjustments to its operations to ensure fuel supply to Southern California, Reuters reported. Chevron spokesman Sean Comey told CalMatters that the refinery paused the flow of outbound product pipelines from the refinery the night of the incident, but restarted them after three hours.

The Energy Commission has said it is focused on keeping fuel supplies steady and prices down. But in a key report published this summer, commissioners warned that years of under-investment and deferred maintenance have created “safety and reliability challenges” at aging refineries. The report urged the state to stabilize fuel supplies through a mix of legislative and regulatory steps — including the postponing of rules to stave off further closures.

Niki Woodard, a spokesperson for the California Energy Commission, said the El Segundo fire is expected to hit jet-fuel supplies harder than gasoline, with jet-fuel prices jumping about 30 cents Friday and and negligible changes at the pump in the wake of the incident.

Though prices at the pump have barely moved, some experts warn that the state’s effort to keep fuel affordable may be coming at the expense of safety. Environmental consultant Karras said the state should view refinery safety as an economic issue.

“The state’s refining fleet has gotten to the point where it just can’t keep blowing itself up without starting to have to import gasoline,” he said.

With the federal government furloughed and Trump’s newly passed budget moving to permanently wind down the U.S. Chemical Safety Board, Karras said state leaders could still assemble a strong independent investigation into the El Segundo fire by hiring furloughed or former chemical safety board experts.

“There’s a tremendous amount of experience and expertise to do an investigation if state leadership had the political will,” he said.",https://calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/100225_Chevron-Refinery-Fire_Reuters_CM_01.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 12:11:32.241342

Many of those same people support ending subsidies for oil and gas companies doing business on public lands.","The environmental case for America’s shift away from oil and gas is clear. Less obvious but perhaps more immediately tangible, however, are the economic benefits. Simply put, continued reliance on oil and gas is extraordinarily expensive, and the American people are footing the bill while wealthy corporations make billions. Resourcing groups to hold the industry squarely accountable for its activities will boost American prosperity by limiting damage to communities and the environment, protecting taxpayers and consumers, and paving the way for the clean energy technologies of the future.

America’s Money Pit

For more than 100 years, the federal government has provided massive subsidies to oil and gas. The 2022 budget proposal sent to Congress sought to reduce some of these subsidies, but following the recently passed “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” federal subsidies have increased from more than $5 billion to more than $12 billion per year. Some analysts estimate the total is even higher, as much as $15 billion to almost $30 billion per year.

Such preferential treatment might have made sense more than a century ago, when the oil and gas industry was a fledgling upstart and a jobs creator. Today, tax subsidies only serve to prop up—and further entrench America’s reliance on—an industry that is struggling to compete. Not surprisingly, the fossil fuel industry has spent more than $1 billion over the last 20 years lobbying for tax credits. Around half of oil and gas production in the United States is estimated to be dependent on subsidies in order to be profitable. And while the industry used to be an engine of employment growth, that is not true anymore. In the first half of 2025, US oil and gas production jobs fell by 4,700. Looking ahead, some of the nation’s biggest oil corporations are to cut up to a quarter of their workforce, leaving thousands of hardworking people in the lurch.

Oil and gas corporations also receive significant explicit subsidies at the state level. Recent analysis from Alaska’s Department of Revenue concluded that the Willow Project—one of the largest oil drilling projects ever proposed on public land—will net its operator, ConocoPhillips, more in state tax credits than it generates in state tax revenue. Even in places like Texas, where oil and gas is produced mostly on privately owned land, the industry receives massive handouts. In the Lone Star State, the tally for 2023 was at least $1.4 billion. And that is not to mention the many tax breaks from counties, towns, and other local jurisdictions.

Organizations focused on lifting up the values that unite all Americans—values deeply associated with our national public lands—are sorely needed at this moment in time.

Beyond these explicit subsidies, there are many other less obvious ways that the public pays to prop up the oil and gas industry. Take, for example, the industry’s stranglehold on national public lands, which cover hundreds of millions of acres across the country, particularly in western states. While we are all owners and the intended beneficiaries of any development on these vast and uniquely American landscapes, the current financial terms underpinning the public lands oil and gas program don’t fully reflect this reality. In fact, wealthy oil and gas corporations often lease public lands at below-market rates, giving taxpayers less than a fair rate of return. Additionally, even though the United States is actually producing a record amount of oil, Congress just lowered the royalty rate, the amount private companies pay the public for extracting oil and gas from public lands, to the same level it was in 1920. States like New Mexico and Wyoming, whose royalty rates for drilling on state lands are significantly higher than the current federal royalty rate, stand to lose billions in revenue because of this change. Developers can also sit on these leased public lands for years without drilling, hoping for market prices to rise. This waiting game discourages investment in those lands for other uses like renewable energy development, outdoor recreation, or hunting and fishing. Taken together, these policies translate to billions of dollars for private corporations drilling for oil and gas on national public lands.

Better enforcement, and in some cases, stronger rules, are also needed to ensure that the industry—not taxpayers—pays to clean-up when drilling is finished. There are approximately 3.5 million abandoned wells across the country—those that have been left behind without being cleaned-up—that can leak toxins that pollute the air, water, and land. Even according to oil and gas regulators, many of these are actually orphaned, meaning wells where the owner has gone bankrupt or cannot be identified. When this happens, taxpayers often end up footing the bill, and the cost to safely plug and prevent these wells from causing further harm to the environment and communities is enormous. In fact, in 2021, Congress created a $4.7 billion program to clean-up orphaned wells across the country. Yet even this amount is far short of the estimated $250 billion that is actually needed to clean-up all of America’s old wells. In Texas alone, the estimated cost to plug inactive wells—those that aren’t producing, haven’t been plugged, and have an active operator–is some $16 billion, and Texas statutes allow operators to delay plugging almost indefinitely. In other words, whether it’s at the national or state level, the policy framework has created an inherent subsidy for oil and gas corporations. This is a crisis, and immediate attention is required to protect taxpayers, landowners, and people who live near the old wells.

The American consumer also pays indirectly to support oil and gas corporations through higher energy costs. For example, consumers are paying the price for the industry’s decision to maximize profits by exporting oil and gas for higher prices abroad. Just this June, the Energy Information Administration said that “higher natural gas prices in 2025 and 2026 are the result of strong export growth that persistently outpaces US natural gas production.” This government agency reiterated this expectation in September, concluding that domestic gas prices will likely increase by 50 percent over the next year, due to “relatively flat natural gas production amid an increase in US liquefied natural gas exports.” Consumers’ energy bills are also expected to increase because the Trump administration is forcing utilities to keep open aging and expensive coal and gas plants that were slated for retirement, likely adding $3 billion per year to our nation’s electricity bills. The administration is simultaneously attempting to crush renewables, which are usually the cheapest source of new electricity.

That’s still not the end of costly preferences given to the industry. For example, gas and electricity ratepayers in Texas will spend the next 30 years paying down almost $7 billion plus interest in “extraordinary costs” charged by power plants and pipeline companies during 2021’s Winter Storm Uri. Gas infrastructure froze because Texas’s oil and gas regulator ignored federal recommendations to weatherize the state’s supply chain. Consumers face numerous other real costs of dealing with the effects of climate change: higher home insurance, rising public health costs, crop damage, productivity losses due to extreme heat—the list goes on and on.

Bringing About Change

It’s hard to overstate how much the oil and gas industry is holding back America’s potential for true prosperity. International calls to end subsidies for oil and gas are growing louder, but our national politics are stuck, not only prolonging direct and indirect subsidies but piling on new ones. Funders can help move the needle by investing in the many groups that are working on all angles of this problem, partnering with people of differing political persuasions at all levels of government who share a common-sense position that the oil and gas industry should have to compete on a level playing field and not be able to rig the system for their own profit at the public’s expense.

People across the political spectrum care immensely about maintaining access to public lands and ensuring there are places to hunt, fish, camp, and simply enjoy, as demonstrated by the recent failed attempt to sell off public lands in western states. Many of those same people support ending subsidies for oil and gas companies doing business on public lands. Organizations focused on lifting up the values that unite all Americans—values deeply associated with our national public lands—are sorely needed at this moment in time.

Other groups are working to inject local values into economic development decisions. In Texas, for example, Commission Shift is showing Texans they deserve better oversight from the state oil and gas agency, and that speaking out can lead to policy changes that reduce emissions and protect groundwater. The South Texas Environmental Justice Network has successfully pushed back against gas export buildout in Brownsville, not only by harnessing economic arguments, but also by reconnecting local residents to native habitats of wildlife and plants, and advocating with the Carrizo Comecrudo Nation of Texas to protect sacred lands and sites.

Finally, there are organizations like Public Citizen working to protect consumers from high electricity bills by challenging Trump’s abuse of emergency powers that force ratepayers to overpay for old and inefficient fossil fuel power plants, intervening at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to challenge market rules that expose households to unnecessary price increases, and opposing LNG export applications at the US Department of Energy because of their impact on raising prices for American families.

The economic accountability work of all of these groups complements the efforts of climate organizations focused on developing and promoting clean technologies. Investing in economic values-setting at the community and federal levels that focuses on people—especially exposing how Americans’ pocketbooks are shrinking while oil and gas industry subsidies grow—and the places they love could be a significant antidote to the climate crisis.

Innovations in wet coating Dürr has also further optimized its technologies in terms of performance and energy efficiency in the classic wet coating process.
Dürr’s calenders are used for both wet coating and dry coating to compress the film.","Less space and energy requirements, but better performance and the highest battery cell quality – that is the approach taken by engineering companies Dürr and GROB for their new concept factory for lithium-ion battery cells. At this year’s “The Battery Show North America” trade fair in Detroit, the two partners will be showcasing the technical innovations that make this possible. Key technologies include dry coating of the electrodes, which does not require a drying process, and powerful Z-folder technology for cell assembly with integrated notching.

The two global companies Dürr and GROB have been cooperating in the field of production technology for lithium-ion batteries since 2022. The aim is to jointly establish themselves as system suppliers of battery production equipment in Europe and North America. “With our expanded portfolio of highly available machines and systems, we jointly cover almost the entire value chain for battery cell production with our own technologies,” says German Wankmiller, CEO of the GROB Group.

In addition to a classic production layout with wet coating, the partners have developed a concept factory with dry coating and the new Z-folder technology that represents the next generation of battery cell production. Thanks to powerful and innovative technologies, production requires 50 percent less space and 70 percent less energy, resulting in significantly higher space efficiency and lower operating costs.

Efficient and sustainable dry coating

Dürr’s dry coating system X.Cellify DC product family implements the so called “Activated Dry Electrode®“ process from LiCAP Technologies. Dürr has been cooperating with the U.S. coating expert specifically in the field of dry coating since 2023. The Dürr machine uses a dry-mixed active material instead of conventional slurry. This powder mixture is pressed into a free-standing film using calender machines, which is then laminated onto both sides of the collector foil. Compared to wet coating, this eliminates the drying process as well as the recovery and treatment of solvents – saving space, energy, and costs. The free-standing film also offers advantages in terms of material efficiency, as excess film material can be completely returned to the production process before lamination onto the collector foil.

The recently achieved successful proof of concept demonstrates that the Dürr machine is capable of performing the dry coating process with consistently high quality. It can be scaled up, and Dürr is actively seeking pilot partners in the industry.

High-speed cell assembly

With the new generation of Z-folders, which integrate the notching process, GROB achieves higher performance with less space. For particularly stable and reliable system technology, the separator is guided over a few deflection rollers with very even and low web tension. Thanks to a high-quality magazine buffer system for the electrodes, the system achieves 95 percent availability.

Precise electrolyte filling with high pressure

A process developed by Dürr enables battery cells to be filled in a single step without residual gas. Unlike the conventional process, the electrolyte is filled directly into the cells at up to 30 bar. The filling pressure is thus two to three times higher than the current industry standard. The process design enables precise dosing and shortens both the filling process and the subsequent penetration of the electrolyte into the active material.

Free-standing film reduces scrap

The proof-of-concept plant is located in Chassieu in southern France, in a dry room environment at Ingecal, a Dürr Group company specializing in calender technology. Calenders are machines with rollers that compress materials into an even layer. Dry coating starts with film formation: A horizontal calender forms the dry powder into a film. It is referred to as “free-standing” because it runs through the machine without a carrier foil. In the second step, additional calenders compress the film to the desired layer thickness, density, and porosity. Finally, one film is laminated onto the collector foil from each side – thus producing the electrode. “Since we don’t need a carrier foil until the final step, we can return the film to the process in its entirety if it does not meet the desired specifications. Thanks to the closed loop, no valuable active material is lost and we significantly reduce waste – an important point in battery production,” explains Bruhn.

Improved further processing

The special characteristic of X.Cellify DC lies in its web guidance: the system transports the free-standing film in a self-supporting manner and compresses the film before it is applied to the current collector. The subsequent lamination onto the current collector requires less force than calendering in the wet coating process, which means that the foil does not deform – improving its processability for the downstream process steps of notching and stacking.

Combined strengths

The new approach to dry coating combines Dürr’s expertise in electrode manufacturing and system integration, Dürr Ingecal’s high-precision calenders, and LiCAP’s patented Activated Dry Electrode® technology. “To take the next step, we are actively seeking pilot partners in the industry for gigawatt-scale projects. This will enable us to bring the technology into real production environments – whether for electric cars, stationary storage or other applications,” says Bernhard Bruhn. Dürr is thus ready to partner in the next generation of battery production – with solutions for wet and dry coating.

End-to-end digitalization

The equipment technology from Dürr and GROB is complemented by end-to-end digital mapping of the production process. Even in the planning phase before production starts, a digital twin enables simulation of the entire factory and speeds up implementation on site. The data from the simulation flows into the MES/MOM software of Dürr’s subsidiary iTAC, which can be used to control and plan all production steps in battery manufacturing. Important functions here are traceability and quality analysis to avoid errors in production. This results in high overall equipment effectiveness.

Innovations in wet coating

Dürr has also further optimized its technologies in terms of performance and energy efficiency in the classic wet coating process. One example is the automation of the coating station and the slot dies, which form a closed control loop for the layer thickness – resulting in faster production start-up and reduced scrap rate. “Adding automated slot die profile control provides our customers with the ability to not only reduce the machine startup time, but it also ensures quality throughout the production process by maintaining the coating uniformity.” explains Adam Shambeau, Senior Director of Dürr Lithium-Ion Batteries Americas, “Scrap reduction and machine up-time are critical to our customer’s success, so enhancing our products through automation or innovating our offerings with dual-side coating technology to reduce the total cost of ownership are two great examples where our products bring value to our customers.”

In the subsequent drying process, battery manufacturers can use laser dryers to achieve a 50 percent faster web speed and particularly energy-efficient drying. After drying, the electrode coating is densified using calendering machines. The machines from Dürr work with particular precision using “Dynamic Gap Control”: two sensors measure the distance between the two rollers with an accuracy of 0.5 µm. This results in a very uniform layer thickness, with no more force being applied than necessary. Dürr’s calenders are used for both wet coating and dry coating to compress the film.

At the Battery Show North America 2025 from October 6 to 9, Dürr and GROB will be presenting their concept factory as a physical 3D model at their joint booth 3822 at Detroit’s Huntington Place Convention Center.

Dürr will be introducing a new naming concept. The company is bringing together its products for electrode coating and electrolyte filling under the new name “X.Cellify.”",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/PV_Ad_Press_2.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 10:00:54.890899

According to the report, electric and gas bills for a typical Virginia household could go up by $1,115 annually above inflation within the next 15 years.
Of the $1,115 increase for consumers, lead author Jeremy Symons said $295 comes from a decrease in renewable energy incentives, $440 comes from the increase in energy demand by data centers, and $380 comes from the cost increase for natural gas.
The report links the natural gas cost increase to an increase in the amount of U.S.-produced gas shipped overseas as liquified natural gas.
Federal policy is also having cost impacts on energy bills, the report concludes.","Virginians could pay upwards of $1,100 more on energy bills each year by 2040, according to a new report from the Center for Energy & Environmental Analysis.

Researchers from the center, a nonpartisan think tank based in Virginia, used public energy forecasts and data to calculate the costs. According to the report, electric and gas bills for a typical Virginia household could go up by $1,115 annually above inflation within the next 15 years.

Researchers said the spike can be attributed to a number of factors. Of the $1,115 increase for consumers, lead author Jeremy Symons said $295 comes from a decrease in renewable energy incentives, $440 comes from the increase in energy demand by data centers, and $380 comes from the cost increase for natural gas. The report links the natural gas cost increase to an increase in the amount of U.S.-produced gas shipped overseas as liquified natural gas.

Virginia is at an “energy crossroads,” Symons said. He said Virginia leaders can choose to invest in renewable energy like solar and wind to bring costs down, or they can continue to depend on gas.

“Electricity bills are skyrocketing because Virginia has tripled its reliance on natural gas in the past decade,” said Symons, who is also president for the center. “Big oil, gas and tech companies have set their sights on Virginia in search of big profits, and that means higher energy bills for everyone from the Blue Ridge Mountains to the Chesapeake waters.”

Virginia Natural Gas has been working to make upgrades to their pipelines through the Steps to Advance Virginia’s Energy initiative, the company’s effort to meet growing energy demands. Earlier this year, VNG proposed a rate hike amid that growth, and a spokesperson told The Virginia Mercury the requested rate increase is driven by the substantial investments needed to improve the operations, safety, reliability and resiliency of its system.

On the electricity side, Dominion Energy’s Integrated Resource Plan outlines the provider’s plans to meet demands, which takes an “all-of-the-above” approach. This includes the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Project, a large-scale offshore wind project off the coast of Virginia Beach. The plan also details plans for more solar power, about 12,000 megawatts, and “small modular nuclear reactors” in the 2030s. About 20% of the plan’s incremental power generation will come from natural gas.

Federal policy is also having cost impacts on energy bills, the report concludes. The Trump administration has made moves to end several renewable energy tax credits. The clean vehicle tax credit worth $7,500 for new electric vehicles and up to $4,000 for used electric vehicles expired Sept. 30. Other clean energy credits, such as credits that prioritize rooftop solar and other home energy improvements, expire at the end of the year.

“Virginia can make energy more affordable by avoiding over-reliance on oil and gas and instead building abundant energy resources like solar, wind and batteries in Virginia that aren’t controlled by global oil and gas companies,” the report states. “Virginia also needs to manage data center growth and ensure the demand load from new development diversifies Virginia’s energy supply, protects consumers and doesn’t add to air pollution burdens for Commonwealth communities.”

Some Virginia communities struggle more than others with unaffordable energy bills and there are a variety of assistance programs available to help residents afford utilities.

But in the near future, electricity could cost more. The State Corporation Commission is also currently reviewing a rate increase request by Dominion Energy that could raise customers’ bills by $21 a month over the next two years. In its application for the rate hike, Dominion cited rising inflation and costs of equipment and fuel, as well as the highest levels of demand growth in decades.

Many households remain disconnected, not only from fast internet, but in turn from full participation in modern education, healthcare, and economic opportunity. While some public funding exists, private funding from firms like American Infrastructure Partners is needed to fill the gap.

Economic, Educational, and Health Costs of Poor Connectivity

The American Society of Civil Engineers gave broadband infrastructure a “C+” grade in their 2025 Infrastructure Report Card, noting that despite $2.2 trillion in private sector investment since 1996, 10% of households remain disconnected from the digital economy. Research by Telecom Advisory Services estimates that if broadband adoption and speeds had stayed at 2010 levels, the U.S. economy would have lost $1.3 trillion in growth through 2020.

Rural counties where broadband adoption exceeds 80% show 18% higher per capita income growth, 10% higher self-employment growth, and 44% higher GDP growth compared to underserved regions, according to Center on Rural Innovation research. Meanwhile, a Purdue University study of broadband investment in the state of Indiana found that each dollar invested returned four dollars to local economies.

There are also real educational consequences of inferior internet access, with modern education increasingly relying on online homework assignments and supplemental activities.

Health impacts compound the problem. Telehealth has been a source of measurable positive mental and physical health outcomes, providing access for those with limited mobility or ease of access to in-person treatment. But it’s usefulness depends on reliable internet access, with video appointments requiring high-quality broadband service.

American Infrastructure Partners’ Broadband Funding Model

Some have argued that federal responses have not kept pace with need. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act committed $65 billion for broadband expansion (including $42 billion through the BEAD program), but this funding is spread across states and over several years, amounting to more modest annual allocations per state.

American Infrastructure Partners, a firm that uses private funding to partner with communities on infrastructure development, is offering another approach.

By deploying a hybrid wireless model through its local2u platform, American Infrastructure Partners can potentially reach underserved rural households more quickly and with lower capital burden than pure fiber builds. The company’s “airfiber” service in West Virginia is listed at about $45/month, with download speeds up to 2 Gbps and upload speeds up to 100 Mbps. Because it can lean on line-of-sight links, CBRS, and other wireless technologies, local2u can avoid some of the cost and delay of trenching fiber across remote terrain.

Infrastructure as Social and Educational Foundation

Bob Hellman, CEO of American Infrastructure Partners, often highlights that infrastructure deficits go far beyond roads and bridges. In a recent op-ed, he observes:

“Collapsing bridges and impassable highways are unfortunately only the beginning of the country’s infrastructure problem. A far less visible but equally urgent investment gap looms in social infrastructure—facilities like school and hospital buildings, affordable housing units, and community centers that sustain the American economy and workforce.”

Too many classrooms suffer from inadequate ventilation, unreliable internet connectivity … which impairs student concentration and learning,” he wrote.

Hellman estimates there is a $2.6 trillion investment shortfall in modernizing essential social infrastructure facilities in the next decade.

While AIP’s model demonstrates what is possible at smaller scale, scaling remains difficult. Many financing structures default to large projects, leaving mid-sized or local efforts without attractive capital. Regulatory requirements—such as mandating fiber even when wireless alternatives are viable—create cost and timing burdens.

To close the digital divide, policy reforms may be necessary including more streamlined permitting and better alignment of federal support with locally feasible deployment models.

The broadband “C+” grade reveals a certain level of systemic neglect of rural America’s digital and social infrastructure. But lower-cost technologies combined with creative public-private financing have the potential to deliver results quickly.

Ensuring that leadership is accountable, efficient, and focused on communities will determine whether rural America remains on the wrong side of the digital divide, or whether it finally starts to catch up.",https://aijourn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-09-at-12.25.08.png,N,,2025-10-09 13:09:31.759245

The renewable energy industry is a “defining opportunity” for African countries to leverage its vast resources to re-industrialise, create dignified employment opportunities for youth and power a new wave of skills development.

This according to Deputy Minister of Electricity and Energy, Samantha Graham-Maré, who was speaking at a side event of the G20 4th Energy Transitions Working Group (ETWG) meetings. “For Africa, this is the defining challenge and the defining opportunity of our century. Our continent holds 60% of the world’s best solar resources, vast wind potential, and many of the critical minerals that underpin the global clean energy economy. But our greatest asset is our people. Young, innovative, and ready to build. “This combination gives Africa the chance to leapfrog into a new era of re-industrialisation, one that connects renewable energy to manufacturing, beneficiation, and regional value chain development,” she said. Pressing further, the Deputy Minister explained how the continent’s vast resources can be turned from resources to sources of economic growth. “It means using our solar and wind energy to manufacture green steel, electric mobility components, hydrogen derivatives and the equipment needed for the energy transition itself. “It also means designing this growth to be inclusive, creating dignified jobs for our youth, supporting small businesses and ensuring community sharing the benefits,” Graham-Maré said. She cited the Atlantis Special Economic Zone (SEZ) near Cape Town and the Coega Industrial Development Zone (IDZ), in the Eastern Cape, as models of this transformation. The Atlantis SEZ is a hub for local manufacturing of renewable energy components while Coega IDZ is positioned as a hydrogen export hub.

“These hubs represent more than clusters of factories. They are ecosystems of innovation. They bring together clean energy supply, industrial activities, research institutions, and communities in a single integration level. When done right, they can transform regional economies and demonstrate how industrial policy, energy policy, and social policy intersect.

“But we are still in the very early stage of this journey. Scaling such efforts will require coordinated investment, enabling policy frameworks, and above all, strong partnerships.

“Building green industrialisation hubs is not something any single sector can do on its own. It is about systems working together. It starts with policy coherence, aligning industrial, energy, and trade policies, so that clean energy doesn’t just power homes, it powers factories,” she said.

Co-development of technology, de-risking investment capital and public-private partnerships are also key to Africa’s renewable energy re-industrialisation. “This is how we build an industrial transition that is coordinated, inclusive and sustainable. Each of these levers, policy, skills, technology, finance, forms part of a wider system, that would determine whether Africa can industrialise sustainably and competitively. “This is where the G20 leadership is vital. G20 economies hold the policy tools, capital and markets that can help unlock a just and inclusive industrial transition in the global South. “True G20 leadership means recognising that sustainable industrialisation in Africa, is not peripheral to the global energy transition. It is central to it. It means viewing Africa not as a recipient of technology, but as a partner. We need predictable climate finance frameworks, open and fair trade for low carbon goods and platforms for…co-investment,” the Deputy Minister said. She highlighted that South Africa’s G20 Presidency is committed to creating platforms for collaboration – bringing together governments, industry and international partners to “connect clean energy, manufacturing and innovation so that each strengthens the other”.

“These efforts are part of a broader movement to build capacity, share data, and accelerate sustainable industrialisation across the global south,” she noted.

The Deputy Minister acknowledged that as the energy transition gains momentum, South Africa “will not leave behind” those industries and communities tied to coal intensive sectors. “We will bring them with us, turning former coal regions into new green industrial hubs, and giving proud workers new opportunities for the future. Colleagues, Africa’s industrial future will not be imported. It will be built with our energy, our ideas, and our partnerships. “If we get this right, Africa will not only power its own development, it will help power the world’s transition to sustainability. This is not just about out energy or industry. It’s about dignity, opportunity and agency. It’s about insurance that the transition, we are all part of, delivers prosperity for all. “Together, we can build a future where Africa’s green industrialisation is not a distant aspiration, but a living reality. One which is African in origin, global in impact and sustainable by design,” Graham-Maré concluded.

It seemed to them like the once rural towns on the outskirts of Greenville were raising more houses than beef cattle in the five years they’d been operating, so the couple asked the landowner to sell the roughly 200 acres to them instead.

They turned to a decades-old state grant program aimed at preserving archeological and natural resources in the state.

New SC law aims to preserve dwindling farmland

While perhaps better known for its protection of undeveloped forests, wetlands and historical properties, South Carolina’s Conservation Bank can and has preserved farmland. The agency has safeguarded upwards of 39,000 agricultural acres since it was established 23 years ago, according to budget and program analyst Adair Roark.

But in the last couple years, farmers have been considering it with greater frequency as the cost of farming has risen and development, driven by a growing population, has moved in.

South Carolina has lost about 1,900 farms over the past two decades, according to the latest U.S. Department of Agriculture data.

Forestry and farmland lost to development from 2001 to 2016 totaled more than 280,000 acres, according to a 2022 report by American Farmland Trust titled “Farms Under Threat,” which gave South Carolina the nation’s eighth-worst threat ranking.

‘Exceeded expectations’

These trends prompted the South Carolina Farm Bureau to form a working agriculture focused land trust, which leverages federal, state and local tax credits and dollars to pay farmers to put their land into protective easements, said Executive Director Gary Spires. Under the agreements, the farmers retain ownership of the land and can continue to farm but must limit all future use to agriculture.

In the past two years, the SC Farm Bureau Land Trust has closed on 24 easements statewide, awarding upwards of $9 million for the preservation of 7,400 acres. The organization has four more easements nearing completion and another 20 in consideration, Spires said.

“When we went into this, we started it from scratch,” he said. “It has exceeded expectations.”

In addition, the General Assembly passed legislation to form the Working Farmland Protection Fund, which Gov. Henry McMaster signed into law in March 2024.

The fund, which sits within the state Conservation Bank, sets aside additional money specifically to preserve agricultural land. Legislators put $12 million — $4 million annually plus $8 million in one time funds — in the current budget for the program. That’s up from $3 million in the previous year’s budget year.

To qualify, a landowner must generate at least 50% of their income from agriculture. The land also must be under threat of development, have value as a natural resource, and be located in or selling agriculture to poor, rural and minority communities.

In the last budget cycle, the program funded five easements covering about 1,770 acres across six counties. And the bank had more eligible applicants than it had available funds, said Executive Director Raleigh West. In those cases, the bank’s governing board still has the option to pull from general Conservation Bank funds.

Now, the more than 2,000-acre Lone Star Plantation near St. Matthews is in line to be the sixth to fall under the program, according to documents filed with a legislative financial oversight panel. The Conservation Bank plans to offer Larry Doyle and his family a $2 million easement.

Part of a former hunting preserve, the Doyles use a majority of the property to grow corn, soybeans, cotton and peanuts. The remainder is timber land and wildlife habitat, including 93 acres of ponds, wetlands and creeks that flow into the Congaree River and attract waterfowl, bobwhites and white-tailed deer.

Doyle retired from the Farm Credit industry four years ago and began farming full time.

“Had we not had this (Working Farmland Protection Fund) we probably could not have done this deal,” said Michael McShane, chairman of the Conservation Bank Board.

These are properties that could easily be turned into a field full of solar panels or an Amazon distribution center, McShane added.

“It would be a real loss to our state to see these lands converted over to other uses like that,” he said.

‘Able to make a living’

Spires thinks that farmers’ familiarity with the state Farm Bureau has led more people who hadn’t considered an easement before to look into it. That includes the Moores, who are in line for $1.5 million easement.

Platt Moore had experience with a conservation easement on a piece of hunting property he co-owned near the Congaree swamp, which he said came with a lot of restrictions. So when his real estate agent mentioned an agriculture easement, he was apprehensive at first.

But in working with farmers, the program allows them to carve out parts of their property in case they need it for a barn, grain bin, shop or other use in the future. That was important to the Moores, who said they may eventually add a horseback riding program or other ag-related tourism to their existing grass-fed beef and butchering operations.

Between bad weather and trade policy with China, farmers and ranchers face tight margins, Spires said.

SC Ports rallies to help soybean farmers, but future remains uncertain

“The last two growing seasons prices started tumbling while costs skyrocketed,” he said. “Now the tariff situation is making things even worse.”

“These are often multi-generational properties and people who want to farm but they have got to be able to make a living,” Spires added.

Tax deductions that conservation easements bring are important, he said, but even more so is the cash associated with these deals. Those who participate often pour that money back into their businesses.

‘Tougher every day’

Moore grew up on a 1,500 acre farm in Williamsburg County. He said back when he turned 17 he left the farm to go work in the environmental industry with no plans to return to agriculture.

Now, at age 58, he wants his four children to be able to grow up in a rural setting, prompting him and his wife to buy their small farm in the Upstate.

Moore thinks the conservation easement program is a good option for anyone in agriculture theses days and has started recommending it to his neighbors.

“Land prices are so expensive these days,” he said. “The barriers to entry are getting tougher every day.”

The family the Moores acquired their additional acres from had long moved away and leased it to a man who used it to graze cattle. Knowing they wouldn’t return to farming themselves, the family chose to sell so they’d have money to pass own to their own children and grandchildren.

The man who had been leasing the land was able to combine his herd with that of his son, who has a large cattle ranch in the Upstate.

“And we were able to expand our operations,” Moore said.

Not only do to Moores support themselves through raising cattle, they also own multiple retail stores that support 70 other local vendors, who sell items including free range chicken, pork, elderberry jam and honey.

This marks an exciting milestone for Humboldt County’s local electricity provider.

Speakers at the ribbon cutting event included RCEA Executive Director Beth Burks, Ardi Arian, Renewable America President and CEO, and Jocelyn Gwynn, RCEA Senior Power Resources Manager. Attendees included community members, local leaders, project partners, and representatives from the Arcata Chamber of Commerce, who assisted with the ribbon-cutting ceremony.

Foster Clean Power is the first new-build, utility-scale solar and storage project under a power purchase agreement with RCEA to be completed in RCEA’s Humboldt County service area. Combining 7 megawatts of solar generation with a 2.5 megawatt/10 megawatt-hour battery system, the facility will provide enough renewable power for approximately 3,000 homes.

“Foster Clean Power represents a milestone for our community,” Beth Burks, RCEA Executive Director, said. “By combining solar and battery storage, we’re not only producing more clean energy locally but also ensuring that power is available when our community needs it most. This project is proof that renewable energy, environmental stewardship, and community benefit can go hand in hand.”

The project was developed and built by Renewable America. The long-term owner of the facility is Radial Power, an American distributed energy investment company.

“Renewable America is proud to partner with the Redwood Coast Energy Authority on the Foster Clean Power project,” said Ardi Arian, Renewable America President & CEO. “The project integrates solar photovoltaics with one of the safest battery technologies available—lithium iron phosphate—providing a successful clean energy project for the community.”

In addition to its clean energy benefits, Foster Clean Power features pollinator habitat to maintain agricultural value and enhance biodiversity on land formerly owned by Sun Valley Floral Farms. The project was constructed with minimal land disturbance and contributes directly to Humboldt County’s transition to clean, locally sourced power.

The project strengthens RCEA’s Community Choice Energy program portfolio, advancing long-term goals to maximize local renewable energy resources, minimize greenhouse gas emissions, and increase grid reliability.

“RCEA is really excited to have this project come online and add to our local clean power portfolio,” Richard Engel, RCEA’s Director of Power Resources, said. “People I talk to in the community are happy to know more of their power is being generated here in Humboldt County in such a low-impact way.”

The move after the scheduled end of the federal subsidy on 30 September, reported Reuters, citing sources.

According to sources, the reversal follows concerns raised by Ohio's Republican Senator Bernie Moreno, who has a background in car dealership and is involved in automotive policy discussions.

GM initially proposed a plan in which its financing division, GM Financial, would purchase EVs from dealer inventories to qualify for the federal tax credit.

The credit would then be incorporated into lease agreements for customers until the end of the year.

Moreno said: “I look forward to working with GM. We're putting a lot of policies in place to protect our domestic auto industry.”

The programme was designed to mitigate the impact of the tax credit's expiration on dealers, who feared difficulty in selling EVs without the incentive.

Sources said that GM had intended to claim the credit on approximately 20,000 EVs that were either in dealership lots or en route to stores.

GM Financial had even started making down payments on these vehicles prior to the deadline to secure the subsidy for each car, sourced added.

The news agency said that down payments made by GM Financial to dealers for the EVs were calculated at 5% of each vehicle's maximum price.

The plan was hastily assembled just days before the tax credit was set to expire, with GM outlining the details to dealers on a call on 29 September.

Last month, GM announced that it would be scaling back production at one of its key EV manufacturing plants, a move attributed to reduced federal support for EVs during the tenure of former US President Donald Trump.

The company invested more than €7 million in the project to ensure continued reliability and operational efficiency of the two plants, which together have an installed capacity of 600MW – equivalent to around 3% of Colombia’s annual energy demand.

“As one of the country’s largest generating companies, Enel Colombia reaffirms its commitment to the electricity system. Therefore, this year we are committed to updating and improving these two hydroelectric plants, which are highly important for the eastern region, to ensure their proper operation. This is achieved through a substantial investment in major maintenance work, which is performed on average every 15 years and which, given the growing energy demand, is now necessary,” said Juan Carlos Grosso, Deputy Manager of Operations and Maintenance for Enel Colombia and Central America.

The month-long shutdown required coordination across the Paraíso and La Guaca plants and the El Muña reservoir. Approximately 600 workers participated in the project, with more than 35% from nearby municipalities including El Colegio, San Antonio del Tequendama, Sibaté, and Soacha. The planned outage was managed without affecting the national grid; the Colombian electrical system met demand through the existing generation fleet.

At the Paraíso Power Plant, Enel, in coordination with Enlaza (a subsidiary of the Bogotá Energy Group), upgraded the GIS substation that connects generating units to the National Interconnected System. The upgrade makes it the most modern GIS substation in Colombia.

“Central Colombia is facing difficulties in meeting the growing demand for energy due to the challenges in executing electrical transmission projects at the expected pace, owing to opposition from a few stakeholders in some territories. Therefore, it was crucial to modernize this asset and thus contribute to the reliability of the system,” said Fredy Zuleta, General Manager of Enlaza.

Additional work at Paraíso included maintenance on the ball valves and comprehensive inspection of the odor control system associated with the Bogotá River. This system includes the stilling tank, extraction system, biofilter, and ecofilter.

At the La Guaca Power Plant, maintenance was also performed on the ball valves, while the disconnectors that synchronise the units with the National Interconnected System were replaced. The rotor winding, responsible for generating the magnetic field that induces voltage, was also replaced.

In the tunnels and conduits, internal and external inspections were carried out, and a section of the penstock feeding the La Guaca plant was cleaned and repainted. Work also took place at El Muña Reservoir, where maintenance was performed on the “Granada Tower,” a submerged structure equipped with screens to prevent sediment from entering the generation system.

“At Enel, we have taken all the necessary measures to guarantee the stability of the plants’ infrastructure, the safety of the communities surrounding the hydroelectric plants, and the people who worked on these maintenance projects,” Grosso concluded.",https://www.waterpowermagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/1757362845569.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 11:05:09.257850

On a separate issue, a question from a member of the audience asked how water leaders will address the shortage of water system operators.","Texas’ ever-growing economy and population mean it needs more water, but the current water supply wouldn’t meet the state’s needs in a severe drought.

That means more water has to come from somewhere. But where? And who will pay for it?

Those are some of the big questions Texas water leaders debated Wednesday during a panel discussion at the Longview Community Center hosted by the Texas Tribune, a nonprofit news outlet based in Austin.

The Tribune held the event, “Running Out: Texas’ Water Crisis and the Path Forward,” as part of its extensive series of stories on the state’s water supply issues. That the meeting took place in Longview – the heart of water-rich East Texas, where debates about reservoir construction have become heated – was intentional, too.

Weak water infrastructure, such as leaky pipes and aging water treatment facilities, are becoming less reliable to deliver water to homes and businesses throughout East Texas and the state. Meanwhile, population growth in drier parts of Texas have sent water development leaders looking to draw water from East Texas, potentially through construction of a reservoir and other controversial projects.

The discussion comes one month before Texas voters will head to the polls to decide whether the state should spend $1 billion annually to improve water supplies. That measure, Proposition 4, is one of 17 constitutional amendments that will be on the Nov. 4 ballot. The measure is not a tax increase.

Numerous East Texas water rights activists, state and local elected officials and everyday residents attended the hour-long talk and learned that solving the state’s water crisis won’t be fast, easy or cheap. But it is necessary, and progress to that end has been made.

Aging infrastructure

It’s a statewide problem: Decades-old water pipes that supply water to people’s homes and businesses are leaking, rusting and breaking. But in East Texas, it’s worse.

Throughout East Texas, 76% of public water systems – city water systems and rural water systems alike – have issued one or more boil water notices in the past month, a higher rate than elsewhere in Texas, according to data from the Environmental Policy Innovation Center. Boil water notices are issued when water becomes unsafe to drink, often because of a leak that can cause water to be contaminated, said Jeremy Mazur, director of infrastructure and natural resources policy for Texas 2036, a public policy think-tank.

A little ways south of Longview in the Neches River Valley, roughly 80 or 90 water delivery systems are in some state of failure, said Kelley Holcomb, general manager of the Angelina & Neches River Authority. That figure amounts to roughly 20% of the water supply systems in his district, meaning people’s water supply is at risk.

The state’s water struggles garnered considerable legislative attention this year, and lawmakers passed a bill that will put Proposition 4 on the ballot in November.

Texas Tribune environmental reporter Alejandra Martinez posed the question to Holcomb: Will the amount of money the proposition raises, if passed, be enough?

“I could use the first half a billion myself, just in East Texas alone … to deal with the infrastructure side, not water supply, for East Texas, for the Neches River Basin,” Holcomb said. “The problem is, if you gave me a half a billion dollars today, it’d take me 25 years to fix it all.”

Mazur said his organization estimates Texas needs to invest at least $154 billion within the next 50 years to expand water supplies and fix dilapidated water systems. This year, Texas lawmakers appropriated $2.5 billion toward water infrastructure, and if passed, Proposition 4 would allocate $1 billion per year to that cause.

“It’s a noble start, and I think the Legislature deserves commendation for setting up this dedicated funding stream,” Mazur said. “Will it cover $154 billion over the next 50 years? Probably not, but it’s going to make a mighty dent in what’s been a growing problem.”

Water shortages

The Tribune’s reporting has chronicled another growing problem: If Texas faced a record-setting drought, its existing water supplies – lakes, groundwater and more – wouldn’t be able to provide enough water.

Various solutions have been proposed to provide new water sources for the state, ranging from the construction of large water reservoirs and recycling wastewater to desalination of saltwater and drilling for more groundwater.

Many of the solutions proposed for solving water shortages in other parts of Texas are relying on water-wealthy East Texas.

Janice Bezanson, senior policy director for the Texas Conservation Alliance, noted that water development leaders in the Dallas area have proposed building the 66,000-acre Marvin Nichols Reservoir in Northeast Texas, a project that is widely unpopular among area residents. The proposal would use eminent domain to requisition land for the reservoir in Titus, Franklin and Red River counties. An estimated 200,000 acres also would be requisitioned to provide new wildlife habitats as part of federal regulation.

Bezanson noted that Dallas-area water development leaders have discussed drawing water from Lake O’ the Pines, a water source for the city of Longview and additional cities, and other lakes in the area. She also referred to a proposal by investor Kyle Bass to draw massive amounts of water out of the Carrizo-Wilcox Aquifer in East Texas.

All of those proposals would have an “enormous” impact on East Texas, Bezanson said. Not only could the use of large amounts of groundwater deplete the Carrizo-Wilcox Aquifer, but the proposal to build Marvin Nichols would decrease farmland and harm the timber industry.

“This is creating a huge controversy and a huge rift between the demands of urban areas,” Bezanson said. “All the resources for urban areas are coming from rural areas that have no choice in the matter.”

Texas legislators debated legislation to stop Bass’ project and the Marvin Nichols project this year, but those measures failed. Urban legislators, who outnumber rural legislators, largely voted to allow those projects to proceed.

Bezanson said water conservation measures in the Dallas area are lacking, as the region has a higher per-capita, per-day water usage rate than other Texas cities.

Holcomb said he’s opposed to moving large amounts of groundwater out of the region because the impact of such an endeavor won’t be known until it’s too late.

Mazur said he expects more legislative debate and action regarding groundwater.

“There’s this tension that’s been building for several years,” he said. “I think it’s coming to a head right now.”

Permitting problems

Holcomb said he believes Texas leaders need to look at every possible option for increasing the state’s water supply.

Bezanson disagreed, saying some water projects aren’t properly vetted before being approved by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Projects should be assessed for their necessity, their environmental and economic impacts and how they’ll disrupt people’s lives. Bezanson referenced a May 2024 decision by the agency to award a permit for a reservoir project in Wichita Falls, though an administrative law judge months earlier recommended the agency not do so.

Mazur said state leaders shouldn’t build their plans for future water supplies on projects that aren’t likely to happen.

“We need to really look at this planning process so we can identify what projects can be delivered when and on time and how much water will actually be delivered,” Mazur said.

On a separate issue, a question from a member of the audience asked how water leaders will address the shortage of water system operators. By 2027, 70% of water system operators will be “aging out” of the system, Holcomb said. The only solution is to offer better pay.

“It means that y’all’s water bill is going up,” he said. “There’s no way around it, and I know nobody wants to hear it.”

Getting involved

State Rep. Daniel Alders, R-Tyler, attended Wednesday’s panel discussion and said he hopes more East Texans get engaged in the state’s water issues.

“It’s important that we preserve the water we have and, I think, have a responsible conversation about what part we play in helping water move west,” he said.

Among state lawmakers, “there is a collegial understanding that we need to resolve this, rather than just the urban cities take from the rural,” he said. “We need to make sure we have better science. We need to make sure that we’re not putting East Texas in a bind by taking too much water.”

Holcomb said the state’s water future will be up to young people who choose to get involved. On Wednesday, he got part of his wish. Four students from White Oak High School attended the meeting to get extra-credit points for their dual-enrollment course in government at Kilgore College. But after attending, they said they’re more likely to stay apprised of water-related issues.

“It’s super interesting, and it’s way more important than I thought it was,” said Kaleb Glenn. “And honestly, I’m probably going to start messaging senators already and congressmen about it, because this is a very big, important issue.”",https://marshallnewsmessenger.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2025/10/100925-WATER1-e1759981142346.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 12:12:17.959532

Introduction

Fast-rising electricity prices are frequently making news headlines and have become a topic of political contention at the national and state levels. Democrats and Republicans are now pointing fingers at each other to explain the increases in the utility bills. Some criticize President Trump and the One Big Beautiful Bill’s repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy subsidies. Others blame Democrats’ disfavoring of fossil fuels.

Are electricity prices truly dictated by high-level political events, however? Or is the answer to the rise in utility bills much more nuanced, driven by supply, demand, and other large-scale factors?

While U.S. national retail electricity prices saw a fast increase in the first half of 2025 at a 10-percent nominal growth rate, they have grown at a more moderate pace over the past decade. Nominal prices were relatively flat at a 0.7-percent growth rate from 2013–2020, 5.5 percent from 2020–2022 and are projected to grow at 4.5 percent from 2022–2026.

Various factors affect electricity prices, including the costs associated with utilities’ generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity on the supply side of the electric system; the projection of future power demand from different end customers, weather conditions, and related regulations.

Although commercial and industrial sector’s electricity demand is expected to outpace the residential sector’s due to the power demand from artificial intelligence (AI) data centers and increasing manufacturing activities, residential electricity prices continue to be relatively higher and grow at a faster pace. This trend is determined by the residential sector’s smaller volume of power demand, less predictability of power usage, and the high cost of relying on the local distribution system.

This insight provides an overview of U.S. electricity prices’ recent and historical trends at the national and state levels and across different customer sectors. It also analyzes the main factors that drive electricity price changes.

Electricity Price Trends

There are three major sectors of end customers in the U.S. electricity market: residential, commercial, and industrial. In 2023, electricity consumption in the residential sector accounted for about 38 percent of the total electricity consumption, followed by the commercial sector (36 percent) and the industrial sector (27 percent). The transportation sector accounted for less than 1 percent of the total electricity consumption.

National-level price trends

The recent discussion of fast-rising U.S. electricity prices has been focused on the changes in the first half of 2025. Indeed, the increase in electricity prices so far this year has been striking. As shown in Figure 1, all-sector average electricity retail prices increased from 13.11 cents/kWh in January to 14.38 cents/kWh in July at a 10-percent nominal growth rate, much faster than inflation during this seven-month period, which hovered around 2 percent. This dramatic increase stands in contrast to the nominal growth rates of U.S. all-sector electricity prices over the same period in 2023 and 2024: 3 percent and 8 percent, respectively. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projected that electricity prices will continue to outpace inflation through 2026.

This significant growth trend is muted when considering year-over-year electricity prices data, however. Figure 2 depicts electricity prices from 2013 to 2026. (The average monthly data from January to July 2025 is used as a proxy for the 2025 annual average electricity price; 2026 data is EIA’s forecast.) U.S. nominal all-sector average retail prices are expected to increase from 10.07 cents/kWh in 2013 to 13.79 cents/kWh in 2026 at an average annual growth rate of 2.5 percent. Nominal prices stayed relatively flat at a 0.7-percent growth rate from 2013 to 2020, 5.5 percent between 2020 and 2022, and 4.5 percent between 2022 and 2026. In real terms, as shown in Figure 2, the growth of electricity prices has been steady from 2013 to 2024 and is expected to have a slight uptick from 2024 to 2026.

As shown in Figure 3, overall U.S. electricity price trends across residential, commercial, and industrial customer sectors align with the all-sector price trends: Nominal prices of all three sectors started growing in 2020 and are expected to continue growing at a lower rate from 2022 to 2026.

U.S. residential electricity nominal prices tracked inflation closely from 2015 to 2021 but have outpaced inflation since 2022. The residential sector stands out with its higher prices (projected to be close to 18 cents/kWh in 2026) and a more elevated nominal growth rate from 2023 to 2026. The commercial and industrial sectors will continue to see lower electricity prices (projected to be 13.5 cents/kWh and 8.54 cents/kWh, respectively, in 2026) compared to the residential sector.

State-level price trends

Changes in electricity prices varied significantly across states over the past year. From July 2024 to July 2025, some states saw bigger increases in nominal retail electricity prices compared to the national average of a 5-percent increase. For example, the District of Columbia, Maine, and New Jersey saw the largest percent increases of 24.5 percent, 22.9 percent, and 21.6 percent, respectively. Some states, such as Hawaii and Nevada, saw a decrease of 7.8 percent and 7.3 percent, respectively, in their residential electricity prices.

Over the past five years, from 2020–2025, residential electricity prices also saw varying percentage changes, albeit in smaller magnitude. As shown on the map below, in nominal prices, the residential electricity prices in Maine had the highest average nominal annual growth rate at 11.5 percent, followed by the District of Columbia (10.7 percent), and California (9.7 percent). In contrast, Iowa had the lowest average nominal annual growth rate of 1.7 percent, followed by South Dakota at 1.9 percent.

In real terms, residential electricity prices at the state level grew as fast as 6.6 percent annually on average from 2020–2025 in Maine and as slow as -2.5 percent in Iowa. (A negative real growth rate in Iowa means that the residential electricity prices in the state were growing slower than inflation.) About 40 percent of the states saw their residential electricity prices growing slower than inflation on average.

Factors That Drive Increases in Electricity Prices

Supply and demand

The supply and demand market principle applies to the electricity market. High demand for electricity during a peak period (e.g., hot weather) or sharply reduced supply (e.g., an unexpected shutdown of a major power plant) would drive up retail prices of electricity.

As shown in Figure 5, U.S. demand for electricity started to rise drastically from 2023, driven by demand in the commercial and industrial sectors. The commercial sector is estimated to have a 3.2-percent increase in consumption of electricity from 2020 to 2026, mostly due to the enormous amount of power demand from AI data centers. EIA estimates that the industrial sector will see a 2.2-percent increase in electricity consumption over the same period as a result of more manufacturing activities.

Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration

Total electricity supply is estimated to increase from 4,202.2 billion kWhs in 2023 to 4,544.6 billion kWhs in 2026, a steep increase compared to the past decade (Figure 6). Of the new electric generating capacity that will be added to the grid in 2025, EIA estimated that more than half will come from solar energy. Other major sources for new generation capacity are battery storage and wind power. The One Big Beautiful Bill’s (OBBB) rollback of the tax subsidies for clean energy and the administration’s disfavoring of solar and wind energy will eventually reduce the new capacity to be added to the grid, which would reduce the total supply of electricity. Nevertheless, the recent electricity prices increase is not driven by the overhaul of the energy subsidies in the OBBB, as some have claimed: Many of these energy tax credits will not phase out until after 2027.v

Generation, transmission, and distribution, weather conditions, and regulations

There are three major cost components of electricity prices: generation, transmission, and distribution. These variables influence the supply side of the electricity market – the costs utilities incur to produce and deliver electricity to customers. Generation refers to electricity production from various energy sources such as natural gas or solar power. Transmission is the process of transferring electricity from generation sites to local substations via long-distance, high-voltage power lines. Distribution is the final step of delivering electricity to residential customers from local substations via a low-voltage power line network. It’s much cheaper and more efficient to transfer electricity through high-voltage transmission lines than through low-voltage power lines in the local distribution system.

Costs associated with generating electricity include fuel prices (such as natural gas and petroleum fuels) and power plants’ financing, construction, and operating costs. Transmission- and distribution-related costs include construction, operation, maintenance, repairs, and upgrade of transmission and distribution power lines.

Additionally, weather conditions affect the costs associated with generation, transmission, and distribution. For example, extremely hot or cold weather would drive up electricity demand for air conditioning or heating. Abundant sun or wind can help bring more power to the grid, which could lower electricity prices.

Regulations also play an important role in determining a region’s electricity prices. The electricity industry, and in particular the electricity rate, is heavily regulated through a complex process. A utility is required to propose electricity rates based on its costs and profits considerations and get approval from the state’s utility regulator. There are also many other regulations that can affect electricity prices – for example, state-level regulations such as the renewable portfolio standard that mandate a state’s utilities to generate a certain amount of electricity from renewable energy sources. The costs the utilities incur to meet these standards are passed on to customers as part of the electricity bill.

Generation costs make up about 60 percent of average electricity prices nationwide, with the remaining 40 percent of costs coming from transmission and distribution. As shown in Figure 8, U.S. average nominal prices of electricity generation, transmission, and distribution have been increasing since 2021. In real terms, both generation and transmission costs started to trend upward from early 2023, while distribution costs of retail electricity sales have stayed relatively flat. Utilities’ rising spending on transmission and distribution is driven by the capital investment requirement to upgrade the aging U.S. transmission and distribution infrastructure.

Differences between residential, commercial, and industrial sectors

Although the commercial and industrial sectors’ electricity demand is expected to outpace the demand from the residential sector (Figure 6), residential electricity prices have been historically much higher than the prices for the commercial and industrial sectors (Figure 3). This is mostly due to how the electricity market works and the different volumes of electricity these sectors consume.

The key to a functional electric system is to match demand for electricity and generation and delivery of electricity in real time. As a result, the volume of power demand, predictability of power usage, and cost of delivering the electricity to customers generally dictate that residential electricity prices are much higher than prices for the commercial and industrial sectors. Compared to the residential sector, the commercial and industrial sectors use significantly more power at a much more predictable schedule and pattern. Additionally, commercial and industrial sectors can connect to high-voltage transmission lines to receive electricity, whereas residential customers rely exclusively on the local distribution system, which is costly to maintain and upgrade.

Residential electricity prices are also increasing faster than the prices for the commercial and industrial sectors (Figure 3). This is mainly driven by the ballooning costs of repairing, maintaining, and upgrading the local distribution systems. Major utilities’ spending on local distribution systems has increased from $4.2 billion in 2013 to $6.4 billion in 2023 (Figure 8). While generation accounts for the majority of utilities’ expenditures, its associated costs are allocated across all sectors. In contrast, the residential sector bears most of the costs of the local distribution system, which explains the higher growth rate in residential electricity prices.

As a major producer of domestic energy, Pennsylvania companies should not be stymied by burdensome, outdated laws and frivolous litigation that prevent us from building. That’s why it’s critical for our Representatives in Congress to take decisive action on permitting reform to secure our American energy future and avoid yielding to adversaries.

As a result of arcane and restrictive laws and regulations that stifle energy projects, U.S. power generation has stagnated for over a decade – holding back energy production at the worst possible time. By 2030, U.S. energy demand is projected to rise 25 percent as AI and advanced industries expand. At the same time, China now possesses more than double the generation capacity of the U.S., having increased its capacity by 600 percent since 2000. When we can’t build, Americans pay the price beyond just higher utility bills. Lagging behind China and others presents an immense national security threat, especially in the ever-expanding race to power AI superiority.

As Chair of the Pennsylvania Artificial Intelligence Opportunity Task Force and having introduced a package of legislation that would allow Pennsylvania to flourish as a leader in AI by reducing overregulation and barriers to innovation, I’m committed to addressing the national security risks of AI dependence on adversaries. Congress must share that same passion, as these converging forces are a recipe for disaster without permitting reform.

Perpetual delays in the permitting system and roadblocks at every step of review are restricting investment in new projects, restricting new job growth, and restricting new energy production. Much of the issue lies in well-intentioned legislation that is too outdated to adequately meet the unprecedented energy demands of today, too vague to prevent abusive lawsuits and stall tactics, or both.

The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is a prime example of this. Enacted more than five decades ago, its vague language has led to more lawsuits than any other environmental law. While intended to ensure that environmental factors of major federal projects were properly considered, in practice, the law has been weaponized beyond its original intent, resulting in slow reviews and prolonged litigation by third-parties who often don’t even live in the state where these projects are developed. To curb that problem, Congress must enact reforms that bring commonsense to agency reviews and end the lawfare that delays and kills critical energy and infrastructure projects.

Congress should also clarify the meaning of the Clean Air Act (CWA) by simplifying its scope and requiring enforceable certification timelines for energy projects. Currently, the CWA can be exploited through a narrow section of the law that allows states to certify that federally licensed projects comply with state water quality standards. States have been known to weaponize the process by denying certification not out of concern for actual water standards, but instead over unrelated ideological differences, infusing partisan politics into a process meant to protect water.

Decades-old laws and bureaucratic red tape have gone unaddressed for too long. Amending these laws and regulations through permitting reform to better allow for timely and necessary energy production need not come at the environment’s expense. Eliminating inefficiencies and partisan abuse while maintaining essential environmental protections would pave the way for American energy dominance and in turn an economic boom for working-class Americans.

Fixing the federal permitting process must be a bipartisan priority. The current system is broken, with outdated laws exposing Pennsylvania to costly litigation and red tape. Durable congressional action from our delegation from Pennsylvania is necessary to provide clarity and stability for developers and federal agencies alike. Doing so would result in a safer, more affordable, and energy-secure Commonwealth, all without compromising environmental protections.

Two sites are available for lease, including a 95-acre parcel and up to 150 acres at the East Tennessee Technology Park.

Companies must also propose how they will power the energy-intensive data centers, either by building a new power plant or partnering with one.

This initiative is part of the Trump administration's goal to accelerate the development of data center infrastructure on federal land.

Private companies can now compete to build AI data centers and power plants on federal land in Oak Ridge.

The U.S. Department of Energy announced earlier this year that Oak Ridge was one of four sites selected to move forward with AI data centers, which offer storage for networked computer servers that process and manage massive amounts of information.

The energy department is now asking companies to get specific, and began requesting proposals Sept. 30, allowing interested parties to share their ideas for data centers − and for how they would be powered. The project also might support a core goal of President Donald Trump’s administration: “unleashing American energy.”

Trump has issued a series of executive orders in his second term intended to make the United States a leader in the construction of data centers for artificial intelligence. A July order specifically aimed to speed up the review of permits for data centers planned on federal land while reducing the regulations needed to build them.

What could companies do with data centers in Oak Ridge?

Whichever company – or companies – the government selects will lease land for the projects from the federal government. The lease terms would be negotiable, a Department of Energy spokesperson told Knox News via email.

Companies have until Dec. 1 to tell the energy department about their plans for two pieces of land. One covers about 95 acres in Oak Ridge − north of the intersection of Bethel Valley Road and Tennessee Highway 95 − and the other spans up to 150 acres in the East Tennessee Technology Park that housed Manhattan Project sites.

The Department of Energy's request lists options for each piece of land. The 95-acre site should accomodate a data center, while the Heritage Center could be used for another center, a power plant to support the center or both.

Data centers need a lot of power. The industry’s yearly energy use amounted to about 4.4% of the total energy used in the United States in 2024, according to a report from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The energy department is asking companies to offer plans that show some way of meeting that demand, either through building a new power producer or through partnering with a separate, new energy-generating venture in the region.

The Oak Ridge area’s proximity to the Tennessee Valley Authority’s grid is listed in the request as a regional strength for East Tennessee.

The National Nuclear Security Administration also published a request for proposals for its Savannah River Site in South Carolina on Sept. 30. Like Oak Ridge, the Savannah River Reservation houses a national lab. It also produces tritium, a key component of nuclear weapons.

How long will it take to build the data center?

Knox News reported earlier this year the Trump administration hopes some data centers on federal property could start operating in 2027.

The timeframe the Department of Energy outlined in the request it published in September asks companies to show they can spend up to 18 months with site development and up to two years building facilities.

And if a company wants to build its own power producer, it should prove the technology behind whatever’s generating electricity will be usable and available by the time the data center starts working, energy department staffers said in their request.

Companies will be judged to determine whether their proposals are financially and technologically feasible, according to a Department of Energy news release. The government also wants to know how any interested parties plan to handle regulations and permitting.","https://www.knoxnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/04/PKNS/82886154007-ornl-wright-sy-0969.jpg?crop=6052,3404,x0,y315&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-09 05:57:54.215839

EV prices and sales after tax credit expiration

The sudden surge in EV purchases, as customers rushed to take advantage of the incentives before they expired, has pushed up the prices of used EVs, and they’re starting to creep closer to the prices of ICE vehicles. Despite this, they’re still a more affordable buy, as EVs typically depreciate by roughly 30% in the first year, significantly more than gas vehicles.

New vehicle sales are hovering around a SAAR of 16 million, with battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) representing roughly 8% of that total year-to-date. About half of that share is Tesla. With the federal incentives now gone, EV sales could be cut roughly in half.

Hybrids are easing the customer transition to electric

Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) have effectively helped customers transition to electric. The $7,500 incentive often persuaded customers to lease a PHEV, and many returned to the store satisfied with their vehicle. Approximately half of those customers stick with EVs for their next lease or purchase.

The federal tax incentive made it easier to sell EVs. However, with it now being gone, salespeople need to start getting more hands-on experience with the vehicles. Sellers who drive an EV as their personal vehicle often have an easier time selling them. Dealership staff who invest time in learning more about EVs and feel confident discussing their benefits and features will find it easier to sell their inventory in the future.

Impact of tariffs on affordability and ownership trends

Early pent-up demand in response to President Donald Trump’s auto tariffs temporarily accelerates sales. However, the full impact on 2025 vehicles was muted with no significant price increases. For the 2026 model year, prices have risen about 3% on average and could increase up to 15%. This increase will impact manufacturers, dealers and consumers alike.

Affordability remains a significant concern, with new vehicle prices averaging around $50,000. The pressure is pushing the average ownership cycle to 13 years, impacting new-vehicle sales, used-vehicle inventory and fleet turnover.

What’s next for the EV market?

As EV technology improves to provide extended range and the nation’s public charging infrastructure expands, Aiosa believes that consumers will adopt EVs more readily. While it will take longer than initially expected, the future for EVs remains promising.",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10.09.25-Jeff-Aiosa-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 05:57:50.119998

“Lowering costs is one of the levers that Tesla can pull in order to stimulate growth in vehicle sales, particularly amid the backdrop of the company’s poor performance so far this year,” Sammy Chan, manager of automotive sales forecasts at GlobalData, told Rest of World. “Each region has its own dynamics at play, but what is clear is that Tesla is not keeping up with the overall growth in the BEV market for passenger vehicle sales.”

Long-time Tesla investor Ross Gerber said another price drop is imminent, and suggested opting for a used Tesla in the meantime.

BYD, which started off as a battery maker three decades ago, now sells in more than 80 countries. It aims to almost double its international sales to 800,000 units from 417,204 last year.

Last year, Tesla dropped its goal of delivering 20 million EVs by 2030 from public purview. The company’s Model Y, however, remains the best-selling electric car in the world. The lower price point is likely to make it even more attractive.

“Elon and investors are looking at the share price and know that to keep [it] that high, they have to show some results along with their promises of an autonomous and robotic future,” Tu Le, founder and managing director of Detroit-based Sino Auto Insights, told Rest of World.

Winning on price alone, if Tesla can pull it off at all, will prove short-lived as China controls the global EV supply chain, industry experts said.

“Chinese EV manufacturers not only frequently release a variety of new models but also employ a sub-brand strategy, targeting distinct consumer segments with greater specificity,” Dmitriy Pozdnyakov, analyst at Freedom Capital Markets, told Rest of World.

Besides pricing, Tesla is trying to innovate and compete on design. In August, it introduced a China-exclusive six-seater Model Y L, which became an instant hit despite being priced 30% higher than Model Y. Given that affordability is the biggest concern for potential buyers, these pricier vehicles won’t crack mass adoption.

Musk scrapped plans for an all-new $25,000 EV in early 2024 and turned to budget-friendly variants for existing models.

“We’ll be running with the more affordable models available for everyone in Q4,” Musk said during Tesla’s July 2025 earnings call.

While the stripped-down models may attract some buyers, the gains will be modest, Vivek Vaidya, a partner covering mobility at consultancy Frost & Sullivan, told Rest of World.

About NGIS NGIS is a global leading Geospatial company.","Drax is a producer, user and seller of biomass pellets. It owns and operates Drax Power Station, which is the UK’s largest single source of renewable power. In 2024, the site generated over 5% of the country’s electricity using biomass pellets primarily sourced from North America.

The new agreement highlights the progress Drax is making on the commitments the company set in its Sustainability Framework, including delivering evidence on forest carbon stocks in all its principal biomass feedstock sourcing areas by the end of 2026.

Miguel Veiga-Pestana, Drax Group Chief Sustainability Officer, said: “We are proud to launch this new partnership with NGIS. This agreement will help us deliver on the commitments we set in our Sustainability Framework including taking action, with our supply chain, to being deforestation, degradation and conversion free.

“We hope this new data of the carbon stock of our sourcing areas can help increase global confidence in biomass as a sustainable resource. It will help inform our work with our suppliers and help us to deliver on our sustainable biomass commitments.

“Sustainable biomass is a secure renewable energy source that can be used to generate electricity for millions of people. Drax sources from forests that are managed for the high-grade lumber used in a range of applications, from construction materials to furniture-making. Processing of trees in forests and at sawmills generates a huge volume of residual wood with few other commercial uses such as defective logs, branches, sawdust, chips and bark. We process these into biomass pellets which we then use to help the UK keep the lights on.”

NGIS is a Google Premier Partner that specialises in Geospatial solutions that use satellite imagery to monitor global supply chains. Under the new partnership, NGIS will use a range of Earth Observation data, combined with Google AI and machine-learning tools to model and monitor the carbon sequestered in forests that Drax sources from. It will also track other indicators of forest health, including tree cover and condition.

The information is presented to Drax on an accessible digital platform through which users can, for example, see satellite imagery with overlays of historical images of where trees have been harvested on one date and then on another later date where regrowth and reforestation have started.

Nathan Eaton, NGIS Executive Director said: “This partnership is a great showcase for the use of innovative Geospatial capability to address Drax’s significant commitments to help meet the world’s increasing demand for secure energy, sustainably.”

Drax is already using the new data in discussions with its supply chain to help tailor initiatives that support forest health, biodiversity and assessing the impact of events such as floods, diseases, fires and hurricanes on forests too.

The project would have helped Connecticut towns switch to solar energy and battery storage during power outages caused by extreme weather.
The project is one of more than 200 affected by the federal funding cuts, with many of the funding clawbacks happening in Democrat-leaning states.
But on Oct. 2, the university received formal notification from the Department of Energy, canceling the grant.
“There will be funds that are withdrawn from constituencies that the administration is not terribly inclined to.","The University of Connecticut is confirming it lost funding for a green energy project, as part of a recent $7.56 billion funding rollback by the Trump administration.

The project would have helped Connecticut towns switch to solar energy and battery storage during power outages caused by extreme weather.

“Through the program, a more affluent town like West Hartford, with considerable amounts of solar and energy storage systems, could provide a surplus of power to a neighboring municipality, such as Hartford,” Jumbo Zhao, the project’s director, told UConn Today back in 2022.

The project is one of more than 200 affected by the federal funding cuts, with many of the funding clawbacks happening in Democrat-leaning states.

The Department of Energy, in a press release announcing the grant cancellations, wrote “DOE determined that these projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.”

UConn received just over half of the $2.2 million grant, which was expected to be paid in installments between 2023 and 2027, according to a UConn spokesperson. But on Oct. 2, the university received formal notification from the Department of Energy, canceling the grant. The spokesperson could not confirm whether the university would appeal the termination.

The program at UConn was part of a partnership with the utility Eversource. A spokesperson for Eversource wrote, “while the DOE grant termination affects federal funding associated with specific research endeavors, Eversource remains actively involved and financially committed to the center’s overarching mission and projects.”

The UConn project is one of 12 in Connecticut affected by the federal cuts, totaling more than $52 million in cancelled grants.

""The federal government’s decision to slash energy investments at this scale is short-sighted and dangerous,” said Mayor Roberto Alves of Danbury, where federal records show two projects were cut – one headed by FuelCell, the other by Linde – totaling $12.5 million in canceled grants.

“At a time when communities are working to build a clean energy future and create good-paying jobs, pulling millions from a major project here in Danbury doesn’t just threaten innovation, it undermines economic growth and local workers. We need leadership that doubles down on climate solutions, not backs away from them,” Alves, who also serves as the state Democratic chair, said in a statement.

Connecticut’s Attorney General did not confirm whether his office would take legal action over the cuts.

“Once again, Trump is unlawfully seizing federal funds to exact political revenge, and taxpayers are left to suffer,” said Attorney General William Tong in a statement. “We are watching this issue closely and will not hesitate to defend Connecticut’s interest and funding.”

Jack Greenberg, a political science professor at Trinity College, said he expects to see the Trump administration continue to cut funding along political lines.

“I think there will be a continued effort on the part of this administration to, where it sees expenditures it doesn't like, it's going to refuse to distribute them, or it's going to distribute them in highly politically-targeted ways,” Greenberg said.

“There will be funds that are withdrawn from constituencies that the administration is not terribly inclined to. It could be the case that if an individual member of Congress frustrates the administration, at some point they will see projects withheld from them.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/21ea921/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+342/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F87%2F54%2F80c3117942808a97f71451c78599%2F240111-uconnquantum-0225.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 07:05:44.362981

It's part of a bigger attack - WVPE",Julia Simon,,,,,https://www.wvpe.org/npr-news/2025-10-08/after-spains-blackout-critics-blamed-renewable-energy-its-part-of-a-bigger-attack,"In the hours after the outage The Daily Mail published the headline ""Could renewable energy be to blame for huge Spain blackout?""
Newell says the immediate accusations against renewable energy didn't surprise many people who study attacks on climate solutions.
Renewable critics said blackout was caused by lack of ""inertia"" - it wasn't When critics of renewable energy pointed the finger at solar or wind for causing the blackout, many used one word: inertia.
But critics of renewable energy blamed solar and wind, says Timmons Roberts, professor of environmental studies and sociology at Brown University.
""In 2021, again, there was uncertainty on what caused it, but immediately there were attacks on renewable energy,"" Roberts says. ""","Last spring, tens of millions of people lost electricity across Spain, Portugal and part of France. Trains stopped in their tracks, and people were stuck in elevators, as southwestern Europe went without power for — in some cases — more than ten hours.

Immediately, the finger-pointing began. Many people blamed solar and wind energy. Spain, one of Europe's front runners in renewable energy, gets about 46% of its power from solar and wind, according to the think tank Ember— sometimes more than 70%.

In the hours after the outage The Daily Mail published the headline ""Could renewable energy be to blame for huge Spain blackout?""

And on the day of the outage U.S. energy secretary and former fracking executive Chris Wright went on CNBC to talk about the outage and criticized solar and wind. ""When you hitch your wagon to the weather,"" Wright said, ""it's just a risky endeavor.""

The idea that solar and wind are inherently risky and unreliable is a common talking point for critics of renewable energy, often repeated by groups with ties to the fossil fuel industry. It's false. When renewable energy is paired with large batteries or other forms of grid management, it's proven to be reliable.

Now a new report from an expert panel of European grid operators details what happened. The report finds that for the first time in Europe, a voltage surge caused the massive outage. Voltage needs to remain within limits for an electrical grid to work. While many things went wrong, the problem was not a power grid with too much wind or solar, says Chris Rosslowe, a senior energy analyst at Ember who was not involved in drafting the report.

""It contradicts the numerous claims that we've seen that an overreliance on renewables was the cause,"" Rosslowe says. ""That is clearly not true.""

But the misinformation about solar and wind energy causing the outage has had an impact. A new survey found that a majority of Spanish respondents believe at least one false narrative about the blackout, and the most common was that too much reliance on renewable energy was to blame.

Countries around the world are using renewable energy to move away from polluting fossil fuels. That's why it's so important to counter false narratives about solar and wind, says Philip Newell, communications co-chair of the Climate Action Against Disinformation, a coalition of nonprofits.

""This content makes it seem more normal and feel more normal to hate on renewables,"" Newell says. ""Even though they're a solution to climate change.""

What did happen before the outage

The new report from the European grid operators' expert panel found multiple triggers shortly before the blackout.

First, oscillations, or sudden swings in power flow, hit the grid. It's still unclear what caused them. Spain's main grid operator took steps to control the oscillations, including sending less power to France. While these actions helped dampen the oscillations, they caused the voltage to surge upwards.

Voltage is like pressure in a water system. Just like it's key to have a certain amount of pressure for water to flow, there needs to be a certain amount of voltage to push electrons through a circuit. But voltage can't be too high, or it can cause short circuits or even fires.

When the voltage surged, transformers and power plants shut down. Antonio Gómez-Expósito, electrical engineering professor at University of Seville, says the outage shows that Spain needs more regulations around controlling voltage.

The expert panel report, like other recent analyses from Spain's government and main grid operator, does not indicate that reliance on solar or wind power led to the outage. The panel will issue a final report next year.

Newell says the immediate accusations against renewable energy didn't surprise many people who study attacks on climate solutions. ""We've known this has been a recurring issue,"" Newell says. ""The big frame is that 'renewables are bad and we can't trust them'.""

Renewable critics said blackout was caused by lack of ""inertia"" - it wasn't

When critics of renewable energy pointed the finger at solar or wind for causing the blackout, many used one word: inertia.

Michael Shellenberger, a longtime critic of renewable energy and proponent of nuclear power with 1.4 million followers on X, said in a post the day of the blackout, ""Renewables don't risk blackouts, said the media. But they did and they do… it's clear that too little 'inertia' due to excess solar resulted in system collapse.""

Inertia is important to the electrical grid because it can help stabilize sudden fluctuations in a grid's frequency. Power plants that run on gas, coal or nuclear use large spinning turbines that create electricity and have inertia. More modern power resources, like wind, solar, and batteries, don't involve inertia, because they are digitally controlled. ""Wind and solar plants either have no inertia or very little,"" Gómez-Expósito says, ""but in return, they have infinitely greater response speeds.""

There is no indication that a lack of inertia was the cause of the outage, Gómez-Expósito says. Spain's main grid operator, Red Eléctrica, released a report about the outage this summer. ""The incident was not caused by an inertia problem,"" it said in a press release.

Renewable misinformation has an impact

False claims that too much reliance on solar and wind caused the blackout in Spain and Portugal fit into broader attacks on renewable energy.

In winter 2021, a massive power outage hit Texas. Investigations ultimately found that the outage's cause was gas and coal plants that were forced offline because of freezing temperatures. But critics of renewable energy blamed solar and wind, says Timmons Roberts, professor of environmental studies and sociology at Brown University.

""In 2021, again, there was uncertainty on what caused it, but immediately there were attacks on renewable energy,"" Roberts says. "" Sort of exploiting, taking advantage of a crisis to make unfounded accusations.""

Shortly after the power went out in Spain, Newell and his team from the Climate Action Against Disinformation Coalition decided to do a survey about false narratives in the blackout's wake. They surveyed 1,200 people in Spain and 1,200 in the United Kingdom – because many in the U.K. were also paying attention to the outage.

They found seven in ten in Spain and six in ten in the U.K. fell for at least one false narrative about the blackout causes. The most commonly believed false narrative was that the reliance on renewables was at fault.

Newell says while most of the survey respondents acknowledge the reality of climate change, misinformation led many to question the reliability of renewable energy.

Renewable energy plus batteries proving to be reliable in warming world

Solar and wind resources are already proving to be part of a reliable grid, says Elliot Mainzer, chief executive of the California Independent System Operator, which assures the reliability of California's grid. California was powered by two-thirds clean energy in 2023, the latest year for which data is available.

Mainzer says the key is pairing solar and wind energy with massive batteries. Batteries are especially important with solar, as they absorb excess solar energy during the day, and send it back into the grid after the sun sets and evening demand stays high, Mainzer says.

Mainzer says older power sources have their own problems. California faces a loss of hydropower during droughts. And Mainzer says, gas power plants have some reliability challenges, too.

"" During the kind of heat waves we've seen in recent years, the natural gas plants can come under some significant strain,"" Mainzer says. ""They have to run harder, they mechanically get challenged, and we tend to see a higher outage rate amongst the gas fleet when the temperatures are really, really hot.""

Mainzer says the use of solar plus batteries helped prevent blackouts in California in 2022 when there was a heatwave hitting much of the state and gas plants were under performing. Texas' main grid operator, ERCOT, has also said that an increase in solar and battery storage has helped the state avoid power outages — especially as the state sees unexpected outages with coal plants.

As the planet sees longer and more intense heat waves with global warming, primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels, Mainzer says solar combined with batteries, both of which perform well in the heat, will be important to keep the lights on.

Brighton Supervisor William Moehle said losing nearly $5 million in research funding threatens innovation in clean energy.
Schenectady Mayor Gary McCarthy said the cuts could derail clean energy progress at GE Vernova.","Governor Kathy Hochul is sounding the alarm after the federal government slashed nearly $500 million in clean energy funding for dozens of New York businesses and institutions — a move she says puts more than 1,000 jobs at risk and threatens the state’s growing clean energy economy.

The sweeping cuts, initiated by the Trump administration through the U.S. Department of Energy, target approved grants supporting projects across the state, from Buffalo to Brooklyn. Hochul says the fallout could total a $650 million blow to New York’s economy.

“These cuts directly impact local businesses and major companies, putting workers out of jobs, shuttering factories, and slowing our state’s economic progress,” Hochul said. “Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Congress are playing politics with the government shutdown, and New York’s economy and hard-working families are paying the price.”

Who’s impacted?

More than two dozen organizations and companies were listed among the affected, including:

Plug Power Inc. (Rochester and Capital Region) — over $147 million cut

GE Vernova and GE — more than $62 million cut in the Capital Region

IBM — nearly $20 million cut in the Mid-Hudson region

American Institute of Chemical Engineers — more than $79 million cut statewide

Urban Mining Industries and Urban Electric Power — over $43 million cut in the Mid-Hudson region

Universities and research institutions like Cornell, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and Columbia University are also impacted.

Local leaders react

Empire State Development President Hope Knight said the cuts will “stifle New York’s clean energy economy while killing good-paying jobs.”

Doreen Harris, head of NYSERDA, called the move “short-sighted,” adding that it creates “further uncertainty for organizations and businesses that need stability to plan, invest, and grow.”

Political fallout

A wave of elected officials joined Hochul in condemning the decision — including Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand and nearly every Democratic member of New York’s congressional delegation.

Senator Schumer called it a “reckless campaign of chaos and revenge” that will “raise families’ electric bills just to score petty political points.”

Locally, town supervisors and mayors say the damage is personal.

Henrietta Supervisor Steve Schultz warned that local companies like Plug Power will suffer.

Brighton Supervisor William Moehle said losing nearly $5 million in research funding threatens innovation in clean energy.

Schenectady Mayor Gary McCarthy said the cuts could derail clean energy progress at GE Vernova.

What’s next?

Governor Hochul and state leaders are calling on New York’s Republican members of Congress to pressure the Trump administration to reverse the cuts.

“These aren’t Democratic or Republican projects,” said Rep. Paul Tonko. “These are cutting-edge programs working to drive innovation and bring energy costs down for everyone.”

The N.C. Utilities Commission will hold hearings on Duke's plan next year before issuing an order before the end of 2026.
But, Neal said, earlier versions of Duke's resource plan would already come close to violating those rules if enacted.
Curry, of the Sierra Club, mentioned pollution as a cost of Duke Energy's decision to delay coal plant retirements.
Instead of holding onto coal, Curry suggested that Duke turn to more emissions-free technologies to help those communities.","Proposed Environmental Protection Agency regulatory rollbacks are key to Duke Energy's plan to delay the retirement of three power plants that partially run on coal.

The Biden Administration's EPA proposed a stringent emissions rule that would have effectively required coal plants planning to remain online after 2032 to co-fire with at least 40% natural gas by 2030. That rule also said plants operating after 2038 would need to capture and sequester at least 90% of their carbon dioxide.

Earlier this year, the Trump Administration EPA proposed rolling back that rule entirely, arguing it would save customers nationwide more than $1 billion annually.

In a resource plan filed last week, Duke officials pointed to that rollback and other Trump Administration coal-friendly policies as key to its decision to keep three North Carolina coal plants online longer than previously intended.

""Stringent environmental regulations on air emissions and wastewater discharges have put significant pressure on the viability of aging coal units to remain both cost-effective and compliant over time. However, policies related to coal-fired generation are shifting under the current federal administration,"" Duke Energy wrote in an appendix to its recent Carolinas Resource Plan.

Duke Energy also warned that future administrations could shift policies again to re-enact more stringent policies.

Critics of Duke's intention to delay coal plant retirements contend that it means the utility will be keeping a dirty, outdated fuel source online at a time when carbon-free resources are widely available. Mikaela Curry, a campaign manager for the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign,

""Coal is not the most economic choice, and it's expensive,"" Curry said.

In its filing, Duke Energy acknowledges that declining demand for coal could mean rising costs as the coal mining industry consolidates over the coming decade or so. The decreased demand for coal could also, the company said, shrink the mining workforce and make it difficult for remaining producers to ramp up supply when necessary.

Curry expressed specific concern about the longest delay, at Duke's Belews Creek plant, where a co-fired coal and natural gas plant will be allowed to stay online through 2039 to allow more time for the development of a small modular nuclear facility that Duke is proposing for the site.

""They're being delayed because of Duke's insistence to pursue unproven technology that's not available, and to see that happening at the same time that we're seeing Duke fail to bring on proven available technology like solar and battery storage at the pace and scale that we need, it's really frustrating,"" Curry said.

What is Duke's plan?

For years, Duke Energy has said that it intended to retire all of its North Carolina coal-fired power plants by 2035.

That is changing, though, with demand for electricity rising and Duke scrambling to meet demand for new manufacturing facilities, data centers and residents across the Carolinas.

The three plants where Duke is considering delaying retirements are all capable of burning a combination of coal and natural gas. They include:

Belews Creek Steam Station in Stokes County, which could run as late as Jan. 1, 2040. The plant was originally set to retire at the end of 2035. By delaying the retirement through 2039, Duke officials said they could replace it with small modular nuclear reactors that are not yet commercially available. It is important for the company's grid, Duke said, that a significant electric generator remain online at that specific point in the system.

Cliffside Unit 5 in Cleveland and Rutherford Counties, which could operate through 2032 instead of the 2030 data proposed in Duke's previous resource plan.

Marshall Units 3 and 4 in Catawba County, which could operate through 2033 instead of 2031 as proposed in previous plans.

""This limited extension of retirement dates for these units allows the system more time to integrate incremental new resources by providing additional capacity for a limited period of time while taking on some incremental risk to reliability from the continued operations of these coal units in the interest of supporting the incremental economic development growth assumed by the Advancing Development Load Forecast,"" Duke Energy wrote in its resource plan.

Basically, delaying coal retirements will give Duke more time to develop nuclear plants, add battery storage and build solar panels. Duke officials believe that will let them meet growing electricity demand for electricity, even if maintaining fuel lines and keeping aging power plants operating adds some different risks.

""These plants are run usually during just periods of very high demand and (for) a limited number of hours throughout the year, but having that flexibility to defer just a couple of the units helps ensure near-term reliability,"" Glen Snider, Duke Energy's managing director of integrated resource planning, said in an interview.

The N.C. Utilities Commission will hold hearings on Duke's plan next year before issuing an order before the end of 2026. Typically, those orders have directed Duke Energy to take a number of actions over the coming two years based on the direction the utility wants to head in, leaving open the possibility for changes in regulations or technology.

Critiques of Duke's plan

Even if the EPA moves forward with its plan to roll back the Clean Air Act rules, there will likely be lengthy lawsuits around it, David Neal, a Southern Environmental Law Center senior attorney, said in an interview.

The N.C. Utilities Commission finalized Duke's most recent resource plan before the Biden-era EPA finalized the Clean Air Act rules. But, Neal said, earlier versions of Duke's resource plan would already come close to violating those rules if enacted.

""The prior coal retirement schedule in the last approved Carbon Plan was already butting up against some of those 111 rule requirements, but what Duke's put forward now would completely violate those rules,"" Neal said.

Neal also expressed concern that the delay in retiring coal coincides with Duke Energy's intention to also delay the development of both onshore and offshore wind, as well as the construction of a new hydro pumped storage station.

Put together, he said, that inaction in both directions could mean Duke Energy's state-mandated net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 are already in peril.

""Duke isn't deploying the fuel-free, carbon-free resources it needs to be on track,"" Neal said.

Other EPA rollbacks

Under Administrator Lee Zeldin, the EPA has also proposed a repeal of the agency's Biden-era Mercury and Air Toxic Standards for power plants fired by coal and oil.

The proposal would rescind changes made in 2024. Changes would return the rule to previously allowed higher levels of particulate matter emissions, rescinding a requirement that power plants continuously monitor for emissions.

In a news release announcing the rollback, the EPA pointed to North Carolina as one of a dozen states whose coal plants were impacted by the Biden-era rule. EPA officials have said they intend to finalize the new rule by December.

Curry, of the Sierra Club, mentioned pollution as a cost of Duke Energy's decision to delay coal plant retirements.

""There's the cost of these communities and the people who live next to these plants and who are breathing the air or dealing with contaminated water,"" Curry said.

Instead of holding onto coal, Curry suggested that Duke turn to more emissions-free technologies to help those communities.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3b75537/2147483647/strip/true/crop/460x242+0+19/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F20%2Ffd%2Fa83aa761481abd9af0b69d2f61eb%2Fbelewscreekaerialduke.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 10:01:18.537169

States are working to solve energy resource adequacy considerations as demand increases; but in many states, supply is being reduced either by policy developments or market considerations.

Legislatures in multiple states are considering or enacting mandates that require data centers to source a significant portion — or even all — of their electricity from renewable sources.

There is a growing trend towards clean-firm technologies — including enhanced geothermal, long-duration storage technologies and next-generation nuclear technologies such as small modular reactors. Data centers are also exploring unique arrangements, collocating natural-gas turbines, solar and storage technologies to diversify their energy supply and enhance reliability.

Successful advocacy in this context involves early outreach to municipal leaders, residents and regional planning agencies, along with transparent communication about energy sourcing, sustainability measures and community benefits. Building coalitions with organized labor, business interests and advocacy organizations is essential.

Reliable, scalable and sustainable energy is the lifeblood of the data center industry. With the rapid growth of cloud adoption, artificial intelligence and next-generation connectivity, data centers are driving unprecedented demand for electricity. This surge in demand has elevated power supply and energy policy as top priorities for developers, operators and state policymakers. Recent activity at public utility commissions (PUCs) and state legislatures is reshaping the energy landscape, creating both challenges and opportunities for industry stakeholders.

Data Centers’ Growing Energy Needs

Data centers now account for some of the largest electricity loads in many regions, leading utilities and PUCs to review and update large-load tariff structures. In several states, utilities are exploring new grid interconnection frameworks to accommodate the rapid expansion of data center campuses. Investments in transmission upgrades and grid modernization are underway, as utilities seek to balance reliable service with cost control and ensure that new data center loads do not strain existing infrastructure. States are working to solve for resource adequacy considerations as demand increases; but in many states, supply is being reduced either by policy developments or market considerations. These developments require careful legal review and advocacy to ensure that data center projects are not delayed by regulatory barriers or insufficient grid capacity.

Trends Towards Renewable Power

Environmental concerns and corporate commitments to ESG goals are also driving a shift toward renewable energy procurement in the data center sector. According to S&P Global, the technology and web services industry was responsible for 84% of the tracked U.S. clean energy procurement from February 2025 through July 2025. In 2024, data centers accounted for roughly half of the clean energy procurements nationally. Legislatures in multiple states are considering or enacting mandates that require data centers to source a significant portion — or even all — of their electricity from renewable sources. Utilities are responding by developing green and large-load tariffs and programs that allow direct access to wind, solar and battery storage projects. Data center operators are increasingly entering into power purchase agreements for renewable energy, navigating the complexities of interconnection queues and grid balancing. Public utility commissions are actively crafting policies to facilitate these transitions, with new regulations designed to encourage both sustainability and grid reliability, while ensuring continued economic development opportunities.

The energy generation and transmission issues faced by the data center industry varies considerably between states that have established ambitious clean energy goals compared to states that have not. For example, in Illinois, renewable energy and nuclear power have garnered more attention given the planned fossil fuel plant retirements as established under the Illinois Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, whereas natural gas continues to be a key generation source in states that have not established such ambitious clean energy targets.

Trends Towards Nuclear Power

At the same time, the data center industry is leaning into nuclear power generation as evidenced by a number of power purchase agreements between data center companies and nuclear energy generators. Nuclear power generates nearly 20% of U.S. electricity, over 50% of Illinois’ power and nearly 55% of America’s emissions-free power generation — more than all other clean energy sources combined. Data center companies are adding nuclear to their energy portfolios because it’s carbon-free, scalable, safe and provides reliable baseload power.

For example, in June 2025, Meta and Constellation announced a 20-year power purchase agreement whereby Meta will purchase the clean energy attributes of Constellation’s 1,092-megawatt Clinton Clean Energy Center in central Illinois. This agreement supports the relicensing of over one gigawatt of carbon-free power and an additional 30 megawatts of power at the Clinton Clean Energy Center, enabling continued operation of the facility without increasing costs to ratepayers. Other hyperscalers have taken similar actions. Increasingly, agreements with existing nuclear facilities include efforts to uprate their capacity, extend their operating life and provide more financial stability, contributing to both sustainability and grid reliability.

Trends Towards Reliable, Diverse & Clean-Firm Power

Alongside these developments, there is a growing trend towards clean-firm technologies — including enhanced geothermal, long-duration storage technologies and next-generation nuclear technologies such as small modular reactors (SMRs). Data centers are also exploring unique arrangements, collocating natural-gas turbines, solar and storage technologies to diversify their energy supply and enhance reliability.

Regulatory Advocacy & Coalition-Building

Evolving state and local energy regulations present both hurdles and opportunities for strategic engagement. Data center stakeholders are actively lobbying for streamlined permitting for new grid connections and substations, as well as incentives for on-site generation, microgrids and energy storage solutions. The legal landscape is dynamic, requiring skills in securing regulatory approvals and structuring compliant development agreements. Stakeholders and their counsel need to anticipate regulatory shifts, advocate for favorable policies and unlock new opportunities as the industry continues to grow.

Large energy projects face heightened scrutiny from local governments, environmental groups and community stakeholders. Successful advocacy in this context involves early outreach to municipal leaders, residents and regional planning agencies, along with transparent communication about energy sourcing, sustainability measures and community benefits. Building coalitions with organized labor, business interests and advocacy organizations is essential to support legislative and regulatory priorities and to help ensure that data center projects receive broad-based support.

Looking Ahead

As power and energy issues take center stage in data center development, proactive legal and advocacy strategies are increasingly critical to help anticipate regulatory changes, shape policy outcomes and achieve goals in a rapidly evolving environment.

Previous comments from Energy Minister David Janetzki suggest that the plan may promote polluting and expensive coal-fired power for longer, weakening efforts to roll out renewable power and cut climate pollution.

This briefing paper outlines the context behind the energy roadmap, and what this means for Queenslanders and Australia.

What’s the Energy Roadmap?

The Energy Roadmap is intended to provide a five-year plan for Queensland’s energy sector. The plan is expected to reflect previous announcements, including a pledge to scrap Queensland’s legislated renewable power targets, the cancellation of renewable power and storage developments, and delays to the closure of coal-fired power stations. The roadmap is also expected to outline new, smaller pumped hydro projects to replace the cancelled Pioneer-Burdekin project.

Coal and gas fired power stations pollute – and that harms all Australians

Extending or expanding coal and gas power stations will lock in more harmful climate pollution for longer, driving more frequent and extreme weather events.

Queensland is already bearing the brunt of more frequent and severe storms, fires and heatwaves, and the Great Barrier Reef has been severely damaged by a series of marine heatwaves; experiencing six mass bleaching events in the last decade.

If polluting coal power is relied upon for longer, it’s not clear how the Crisafulli Government can meet its election commitment to retain Queensland’s legislated 2035 climate pollution target, of a 75% cut on 2005 levels.

Queensland’s coal-fired power stations are breaking down, and need to be replaced

Like most Australian states, Queensland is facing the need to replace its ageing and increasingly unreliable coal-fired power stations. While some of Queensland’s coal plants are younger than others in Australia, this does not overcome the significant commercial, environmental or engineering challenges the state is facing:

About two-thirds of Queensland’s coal-fired power capacity is at least 30 years old.

Almost half (47%) of Queensland’s coal capacity can be expected to close in the next six years, based on the average closure age for previous Australian coal-fired power stations (42 years).

Even Queensland’s younger stations are struggling to keep up. For example, this summer, Millmeran’s coal units broke down a collective seven times, and one unit faced a week-long unplanned outage.

The Australian Energy Market Operator’s (AEMO) most recent system plan expects all of Queensland’s coal-fired power stations to close within the next decade, because these costly generators can not compete with cheaper renewable power and storage – like the rooftop solar on more than half of Queensland’s houses. This is already playing out on the ground, with the coal-fired Gladstone Power Station bringing its potential closure date forward six years to 2029.

How might delaying coal closures impact Queensland?

Slowing the development of renewable power and storage and delaying coal-fired power station closures would only hold Queensland back from a more reliable, affordable and clean electricity system. Relying on coal-fired power for longer means:

Higher costs and power bills

Modelling commissioned by the Clean Energy Council shows that if we delay the expected roll out of renewables and continue our reliance on coal and gas nationally, power bills could increase by $449 a year for households, and $877 for a small business this decade. In QLD, this is also costing taxpayers, with the Queensland Government having to invest $1.6 billion in simply maintaining existing coal power stations.

Australia’s independent science agency, CSIRO, has found that building solar and wind power backed by storage is the lowest-cost way to meet our electricity needs. Meanwhile, unplanned outages at ageing coal plants have contributed to four of Australia’s most severe price spikes in the last seven years.

Lost jobs and investment

By sticking with outdated coal infrastructure instead of scaling up renewables and storage, Queensland risks losing out on billions in clean energy investment and thousands of regional jobs, which would be more likely to flow to other states with clear plans to switch to cleaner, cheaper energy.

Modelling undertaken under the previous Queensland Government indicated that achieving a 70% renewable power target by 2032 could create 64,000 jobs and unlock $25.7 billion in economic growth, while reducing power prices. In contrast, continuing to fund ageing coal-fired power stations is not likely to be an effective use of taxpayer funds that could be better spent elsewhere to benefit Queenslanders.

Less reliable power

Australia’s coal-fired power is increasingly unreliable, and is prone to unplanned outages, especially during extreme weather. Therefore, extending dependence on coal can make the power system more unstable. A modern, flexible system that runs on renewables, storage and limited peaking capacity is reliable, and does not rely on only a handful of large generators to keep the lights on.

Analysis of the grid over recent years has revealed that both planned and unplanned coal outages have been a primary driver of power outage risk. The majority of recent power outage risk conditions have occurred in New South Wales and Queensland – the states most dependent on coal generators. During periods with the highest power outage risk, coal availability has been 10-20% lower than is typical.

The Crisafulli Government has cancelled three major renewable energy and storage projects

Since coming to power in October 2024, the Crisafulli Government has taken the unusual step of blocking two previously approved wind farms – Forest Wind Farm and Moonlight Range Wind Farm – citing community opposition. These projects could have powered up to 750,000 homes. In addition, the nationally significant Pioneer-Burdekin pumped hydro project was cancelled.

Renewables backed by storage is the best option for the sunshine state

All around Australia, the data shows that more renewable power in the grid puts downward pressure on power prices. In Queensland, wholesale prices dropped 40% in 2023-24, with increased solar and wind energy in the grid playing a key role.

From the September / October 2025 Issue

The biotech and pharmaceutical sectors stand at the brink of innovation and strategic transformation. Market momentum continues to build, with the global biotechnology market valued at around $2 trillion in 2024, projected to surge to $6 trillion by 2032 with the forecasted compound annual growth rate of nearly 15%, according to a report from SkyQuest Technology Consulting.

The significant theme for 2025 has been the extraordinary integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into drug discovery, R&D, and manufacturing. Industry reports indicate that nearly 93% of life sciences executives intend to increase investments in AI and digital strategies in 2025, recognizing AI’s potential to contribute up to $410 billion in annual value and boost revenue by as much as 11%.

Regulatory shifts also shaped strategic priorities in 2025. In April, a bipartisan effort resulted in the introduction of the National Biotechnology Initiative Act, establishing a new coordination office in the White House to streamline biotech regulation and bolster U.S. competitiveness. The act has been brought to introduction and is awaiting being passed by the House and Senate. This builds on recommendations from the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology, which called for $15 billion in federal investment over five years to safeguard American leadership in biotech.

According to Investopedia, the biotech market is expected to grow from $1.74 trillion in 2025 to $5.04 trillion by 2034, with an annual growth rate of 12.5%. A “biotech boom” has started to take place due to the rapid scientific innovation, surging capital inflows, and growing demand for medical and agricultural breakthroughs.

There have been breakthroughs in gene editing, mRNA vaccines, and AI-driven drug discovery accelerating biotech innovation. Venture capital and public market investments in biotech have surged, with global funding exceeding $48 billion in the past few years.

Regulatory shifts, including faster drug approvals and global policy harmonization, enable faster biotech product commercialization. The expansion of the biotech industry has created jobs, lowered long-term health care costs, and influenced other sectors like manufacturing and energy.

Franklin County, North Carolina: The New Bio-Industrial Nexus

Located just north of Raleigh, Franklin County, North Carolina is quickly establishing itself as a premier bio-industrial hub within the Research Triangle Region. With a population of more than 80,000 and direct access to both the Research Triangle Park (RTP) and the Raleigh-Durham International Airport (RDU), Franklin County offers a powerful combination of competitive business operating costs, expedited permitting and inspections, a skilled workforce, and an exceptional quality of life.

Franklin County already benefits from strong industry anchors in the bio-solutions and bio tech industry sectors.

Novonesis North America, a global leader in bio industrial enzymes manufacturing with over 700 employees has called Franklin County home since 1979; the recent arrival of TerraSafe Materials, a leader in the manufacturing of fully edible dissolving pods and film, and completely PVA Free Detergent sheets, along with the PRTI, a company with several patents that recycles 100% of the material in used tires into multiple other products, continues to highlight the county’s momentum in the bio-economy industry sector. They join other long-established companies such as CaptiveAire, KFlex, Palziv, Southwire, Sirchie, and Robling Medical, all contributing to Franklin County’s diverse and expanding manufacturing base.

This success is further accelerated by the Taylors Creek Mega Site, a newly designated property strategically positioned along the U.S. 1 North Corridor at the northern end of Franklin County. Spanning nearly 1,000 acres, the site is ideally suited for large-scale advanced manufacturing, bio-industrial operations, and supply chain operations.

Integrated into Franklin County’s long-range infrastructure and workforce development strategy, the Mega Site offers abundant utilities, scalable water and wastewater capacity, and access to two electric service providers and high-speed fiber. Its location also provides seamless connection to regional education and training pipelines, ensuring a reliable and skilled talent pool for future employers.

The project, known as the Chula Vista Energy Center 2, will be developed by Wellhead Electric Company on a parcel that already hosts a natural gas power generation facility built in 2000. The new installation will use containerized lithium-ion batteries to store excess renewable electricity and discharge it during peak hours or grid emergencies.

Mayor John McCann said the city took extra precautions in reviewing the proposal, noting lessons learned from older battery facilities that experienced fires in Otay Mesa and Escondido.

“We did our due diligence, and the technology that they’re using is far superior and up to date and new,” McCann said Wednesday. “They also are outdoors and not in a warehouse. So I think we did our due diligence in making sure that these battery systems would be as safe as possible.”

The project site at 3497 Main St. lies between Del Monte Avenue and Reed Court in a limited industrial zone, buffered from nearby residential areas by existing landscaping and fencing. The facility will occupy the northern section of the property, operating independently from the gas plant on the southern portion.

The system will consist of 56 temperature-controlled containers housing lithium-ion batteries, supported by transformers, electrical cabinets and substation improvements. A second phase of the project will add additional containers over time to offset gradual battery capacity loss, maintaining the site’s total capacity of 50 megawatts.

The project cleared city safety reviews — including from the Chula Vista Fire Department and the Engineering and Capital Projects Department — and will follow state and federal codes under third-party fire engineer supervision.

“It’s great because this project is going to generate millions of dollars in taxes and economic development that together will bring real value to Chula Vista and the local economy,” he said.

Wellhead Electric President Harold Dittmer said the project will cost around $75 million and will feature “purpose-built containers that are tested and engineered like crazy,” using Tesla Megapack 2 technology and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery chemistry, which he described as safer and more stable than earlier versions.

“We had to work with the fire department and make sure that all of the codes are met and the spacing is far enough apart so that if one does happen to catch on fire, it doesn’t start the neighbor,” Dittmer said Wednesday. “The last thing in the world we want to do as long-term owners of these things is build something unsafe.”

McCann said the city did not contribute any public funds toward the project as Wellhead Electric owns the property and is financing construction privately.

“There was already an existing facility there,” McCann said. “Wellhead actually owns the property, and was just expanding on the property that they owned.”

He said the project represents private investment in local clean-energy infrastructure and will benefit the community through job creation and new revenue.",https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SUT-L-ENERSMART-BATTERIES-0609-01.jpg?w=1024&h=813,N,,2025-10-09 01:59:17.404220

GM cancels EV lease tax credit program after concerns from Senator Moreno

Program aimed to ease impact of tax credit expiration on dealers

Ford’s similar program status unclear, spokesperson declined to comment

(Reuters) – General Motors is scrapping a program aimed at allowing its dealers to continue offering a $7,500 tax credit for several months on electric-vehicle leases following the September 30 expiration of the federal subsidy, the company said on Wednesday.

Toward the end of last month, GM devised a plan to have its in-house lending arm initiate the purchase of EVs in its dealers’ inventory. The company planned to apply for the federal $7,500 credit on those cars and then roll that money into EV lease terms for customers through the end of the year.

GM opted to kill the program after concerns were raised about it by Republican Senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio, a former car dealer who is active in auto policy, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.

“After further consideration, we have decided not to claim the tax credit,” the company said in a statement to Reuters on Wednesday, declining to elaborate on the reason for its decision.

Moreno told Reuters in an interview he was happy with GM’s decision to scrap the EV tax-credit plan. “The EV subsidies ended September 30 and I’m happy that every car company” is going to abide by that. “I look forward to working with GM,” he said. “We’re putting a lot of policies in place to protect our domestic auto industry.”

The idea behind the program was to ease the impact of the expiration of the tax credit on dealers, who worried they would be stuck with EVs that would be tough to sell. GM had planned to apply for the credit on tens of thousands of EVs in dealer stocks, according to people familiar with the plan.

Ford rolled out a similar program ahead of the tax-credit expiration. It is unclear if Ford is continuing its program. A spokesperson declined to comment.

GM had planned to claim the credit on roughly 20,000 EVs that were on dealership lots or being shipped to stores, people familiar with the matter said. Its finance arm, GM Financial, began making down payments on those vehicles before the deadline to qualify for the subsidy on each of those cars, the sources said.

In its statement on Wednesday, the company said it would “fund the incentive lease terms” through the end of October.

The formula for determining the down payments that GM Financial paid to dealers on those EVs was 5% of the maximum price for each car. For example, GM Financial would have made a down payment of about $6,300 for two Chevrolet Blazer EVs, which top out in the mid-$60,000s, according to documents GM provided to dealers outlining the terms.

GM scrambled to put together the program just a few days before the September 30 tax-credit expiration, and outlined the details on a call with dealers on September 29, three sources said. GM officials had caught wind of a similar program that Ford was putting in place for its dealers, the sources said.

Auto executives, dealers and analysts have said they expect EV sales to plummet in the wake of the tax credit’s disappearance. A consumer rush to take advantage of the subsidy helped drive record electric-car sales in September.

So it’s hardly shocking that many former EV owners say they’d consider returning to battery power only if a generous incentive were back on the table, according to a recent study from The Harris Poll.

Read: Expiring EV Tax Credit Sent Tesla Sales Into Overdrive But Its Flagships Crashed

The survey, conducted between September 23 and 25, included responses from 2,095 adults across the United States. Of these, 1,675 participants, or about 80 percent, said they plan to buy or lease a new or used vehicle in the future. Within that group, 485 respondents, roughly 29 percent, said they were extremely or somewhat likely to choose an EV.

What Would It Take?

Among respondents who had previously owned or driven an electric vehicle but later switched away, 60 percent said they would need an incentive of at least $5,000 to consider returning to an EV.

A further 30 percent said they would need an incentive of between $2,500 and $4,999 to reconsider, while 11 percent said they would be willing to accept an incentive of less than $2,500.

Senior consultant at The Harris Poll, Greg Paratore, acknowledged that affordability remains the top concern for 64 percent of EV buyers.

Automakers Step In

While the removal of the new and used EV tax credit will impact demand for electric cars, Paratore noted that automakers could use the removal of the credit to build extra trust with consumers by helping to share the added cost burden.

For example, Hyundai recently announced it’s cutting prices of the 2026 Ioniq 5 by a significant $9,800 in the wake of the tax credit’s removal. Additionally, Hyundai is offering a $7,500 cash incentive on the remaining 2025 Ioniq 5s that it has in its inventory.

Meanwhile, Ford chief executive Jim Farley warned that EV demand in the U.S. could tumble by as much as half due to the tax credit’s removal. If that happens, electric vehicles could see their market share shrink to around 5 percent, a figure last recorded in 2022.",https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Tesla-Home-Chargeraa-copy.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 03:59:40.303722

Acknowledging the need for load flexibility, they pitched the idea that data centers cut back on power usage just 24 to 100 hours per year, and only on a voluntary basis.
PJM has signaled interest in adjusting its load forecasting, including giving state regulators the chance to review and provide feedback before the grid operator finalizes load forecasts.
Once that blended proposal is public, stakeholders will have time to comment before PJM holds a final vote on what goes to FERC.
In New Jersey, meanwhile, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Mikie Sherrill has campaigned heavily on cracking down on the PJM if elected next month.","In August, the PJM Interconnection put out a “conceptual proposal” outlining potential new rules that would clear space on the nation’s largest grid by forcing large power users — namely, giant data centers — to cut back on electricity consumption during shortages. Hyperscalers had just begun endorsing the idea, popularized in a landmark Duke University paper, that occasionally dialing down data centers could help make the most of the existing grid — and potentially allow more server farms to come online before new power plants can be built.

However, in their public comments the big tech companies balked at the pitch, repeatedly accusing PJM of “exceeding” its authority. And last week, six of the biggest power users that would be subject to the rules — the tech giants Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, and the utilities Calpine, Constellation, and Talen — proposed an alternative.

Acknowledging the need for load flexibility, they pitched the idea that data centers cut back on power usage just 24 to 100 hours per year, and only on a voluntary basis. Aniruddh Mohan, an energy associate at the consultancy The Brattle Group, said that could be sufficient, though it’s no guarantee.

“If sufficient large loads volunteered to provide demand response, it is possible that 24 to 100 hours per year of demand response could be sufficient for reliability under many conditions,” Mohan told Latitude Media via email. “If it turns out we still need more supply, it’s unclear how much more additional generation and storage can be brought online within the next five years.”

PJM issued a forecast last month calling for at least five gigawatts of load flexibility by 2030. While flexibility “conceptually is a good thing,” former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission member Allison Clements explained on a recent Latitude Dispatch about PJM, it’s essentially a stop-gap measure for a grid plagued by bottlenecks and delays, and “not ideal from an efficiency or an economic perspective.”

As a secondary measure, the companies called on PJM to establish a new procedure that would trigger data centers to go off-grid and switch to on-site back-up generators. The proposal also calls for setting up a new procurement process that would lock in today’s current high prices for seven years, giving developers an extra incentive to invest in new clean, firm power plants to meet surging demand.

But they also acknowledged that the system may ultimately need less new generation than the hype today suggests.

Grid operators’ load-growth forecasts tend to come from transmission owners. In Texas, the ERCOT receives those estimates but modifies the forecasts based on factors such as how successfully large power users, like data centers, managed to come online. The PJM currently does not have that same kind of check on its forecasts.

The hyperscalers’ pitch called for implementing corrections based on a range of factors, including those that have nothing to do with generation, such as the availability of the microchips needed over the next five years to actually construct proposed data centers. ERCOT, for example, reduces all new data center demand by about half, based on the average number of proposed new server farms that entered into service between 2022 and 2024.

PJM has signaled interest in adjusting its load forecasting, including giving state regulators the chance to review and provide feedback before the grid operator finalizes load forecasts. “As the load forecast is driving these reliability considerations, this is definitely worth examining closely,” Mohan said.

But revising estimates’ enough to bend the curve on how much power is needed on the grid “is somewhat wishful thinking,” said Daniel King, a research fellow at the right-leaning Foundation for American Innovation.

“Even if, frankly, load forecasts do improve, it won’t be by the nearly double-digit gigawatt amounts that will really tip the scales or change the fact that we’re in the situation of pretty great resource inadequacy,” King told Latitude Media.

One thing the proposal’s nine-page slidedeck does not include: an idea for how PJM should speed up interconnections, a key consideration for bringing new power sources onto the grid.

But other pitches submitted to PJM do mention the interconnection queue. The grid operator has set a deadline of December for submitting a final proposal to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

In the meantime, different parties have until October 14 to submit counter proposals. Then the PJM will negotiate a deal that draws from the range of solutions put forward. Once that blended proposal is public, stakeholders will have time to comment before PJM holds a final vote on what goes to FERC.

The talks come amid mounting political pressure on PJM to curb soaring electricity prices. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro held a 13-state summit two weeks ago to convene governments from every state in the PJM system and discuss ways to pressure the grid operator to bring new generation online faster and at lower rates. If that fails, the Democrat said, Pennsylvania may consider exiting the grid operator altogether and forming its own statewide market like those in New York and California.

PETERSBURG — Arevon Energy, Inc. has announced that operations are underway at its Ratts 1 and Heirloom Solar projects in Pike County, Indiana. Together, the projects add 264 megawatts of new domestic solar power to the grid and are the company’s first owned and operational utility-scale projects in the Hoosier State.

A ribbon-cutting ceremony was hosted to commemorate the start of operations at Ratts 1 and Heirloom. Speaking at the ribbon-cutting were Kevin Smith, Chief Executive Officer at Arevon; Jill Hyneman, Executive Director at Pike County Chamber of Commerce; and Aaron Meyer Principal at Winslow Elementary School.

“Ratts 1 and Heirloom are about more than megawatts — they are tangible illustrations of the positive and real impact renewable energy can bring to local communities,” said Smith. “These facilities will produce American-made power for decades, while also supporting Pike County’s economy and quality of life. Arevon is proud to be a long-term partner here, as we continue to invest in Indiana’s future.”

Ratts 1 and Heirloom represent an investment of nearly $400 million and will disburse more than $86 million to local governments over their lifespans, supporting schools, infrastructure, and other essential public services. The two facilities employed more than 200 full-time equivalent personnel to build the projects and also brought about an increase in spending at local stores, hotels, and restaurants. Ratts 1 Solar is under a long-term power purchase agreement with Indiana Municipal Power Agency, and Meta is the offtaker for Heirloom Solar.

“The Ratts 1 project is a great addition to IMPA’s power supply portfolio,” said Senior Vice President, Market Operations and Planning at IMPA Kyle Brouillette. “This solar site helps us further diversify our resources, assisting in our mission to provide low-cost, reliable, and environmentally responsible power. We’re glad to be a part of Arevon’s project and celebrate this milestone in energy production.”

To date, Arevon has partnered with and supported the following local organizations and initiatives: the Pike County Affordable Housing Program, Jefferson Township Volunteer Fire Department, Elmer Buchta Technology Center, Pike County Chamber of Commerce, Pike County 4-H Fair, Pike County High School Career Fair, among others.

“Pike County is an energy community, and renewable energy sources are a piece of our diversified energy strategy. We are grateful for Arevon’s investment in our area,” said Ashley Willis, MPA, EDFP, executive director at the Pike County Economic Development Corporation. “Solar power is a wonderful asset for rural communities, like Pike County, to increase assessed value and has had a positive impact on our tax revenue for our taxing districts.”

Arevon is actively growing its portfolio in the Midwest region of the United States. Besides Ratts 1 and Heirloom, the company is currently constructing the two-phase 430 MWdc Kelso Solar Project in Missouri. In addition, Arevon developed and managed construction of the 251 MWdc Gibson Solar Project in Indiana on behalf of Northern Indiana Public Service Company, or NIPSCO, and the 228 MWdc Posey Solar Project in Indiana on behalf of Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company. Arevon is also actively advancing development on other proposed renewable energy facilities in the region.

“Our county’s legacy in energy production is strong, and now we’re building on that foundation,” said Executive Director at Pike County Chamber of Commerce Jill Hyneman. “By welcoming solar investment, Pike County is showing that honoring our past and investing in our future can go hand-in-hand in strengthening our economy, our schools, and our community for generations to come.”",https://www.inkfreenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Arevon-Pike-County-Solar-Power-Project-Ribbon-Cutting-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 01:59:22.204003

Here’s our convenient, easy-to-follow election guide for the November 2025 Constitutional Amendment elections. After you read this, pass it on!

Important election deadlines:

The deadline to register to vote was Monday, Oct. 6

The early voting period runs from Monday, Oct. 20 to Friday, Oct. 31

Vote by mail applications are due on Friday, Oct. 24

Election day is Monday, Nov. 4

What’s on the ballot?

If the Texas Constitution had a graded report card, it would read “needs improvement.” Much of this stems from a, you guessed it, post-Reconstruction response to limit governmental powers and citizen involvement. Many of America’s problems stem back to the Civil War and the failure to respond to white supremacist backlash of the Reconstruction Era. This document, our Constitution, that simultaneously holds and protects our most precious rights, is no exception with components that are built strictly to make our government inefficient at delivering public goods. That’s why it’s been amended more than 530 times, and why our legislature is one of less than five states that only meets biannually (instead of every year). It sucks, but we’re stuck with it.

This November, 17 amendments have been proposed by our legislature (under attack for its similar efforts to kick you out of your own government through racial redistricting) to continue in this strong tradition of taking away opportunity for civic engagement. Don’t let them, and learn what’s on the ballot next month ahead of time (totaling to more than $50 billion in property tax cuts). Fund your public services, and fight back by getting informed on what other unsatisfactory things are going to be added to this work-in-progress document.

Here’s our 2025 Texas voter guide to help you navigate the issues and elections on the ballot this year.

Proposition 1 (SJR 59): yes 🏫

Creates an endowment for the Texas State Technical Colleges, used to purchase loans and buildings.

A “Yes” vote means voting for a TSTC endowment. Would support a skilled workforce and broader career choices in our college system.

A “No” vote means voting against a TSTC endowment. Does not support dedicating reliable funding to TSTC, to be dedicated elsewhere.

Proposition 2 (SJR 18): no ❌

Prohibits the establishment of a capital gains tax (tax on assets like real estate, investments, and personal property).

A “Yes” vote means voting for a ban on a capital gains tax. This protects wealthy Texans and potential for state economic growth. Of note: no such tax was considered by the legislature, this would prohibit future action to propose a capital gains tax.

A “No” vote means voting against a ban on a capital gains tax. A future capital gains tax could shift the tax burden from those more impacted by sales taxes to wealthier Texans.

Proposition 3 (SJR 5): no ❌

Requires the denial of bail for individuals accused of violent offenses punishable as a felony.

A “Yes” vote means voting to support the denial of bail for high risk individuals. This introduces a financial barrier only put on poorer Texans, as denying bail usually requires a trial, increasing risk of imprisonment to overcrowded jails.

A “No” vote means voting against additional bail reform. Judges already have tools at their disposal to keep accused individuals under state supervision.

Proposition 4 (HJR 7): yes 🌊

Dedicates the first $1 billion per fiscal year of sales tax revenue exceeding $46.5 billion to the Texas water fund until 2047.

A “Yes” vote means voting to support funding from sales tax revenue to the Texas water fund. Texas is in a water crisis, facing increased demand and aging infrastructure. Long-term funding would help address these and farmers’ needs, as well as our economic growth.

A “No” vote means voting against additional revenue for the Texas water fund.This transfers authority to the governor-appointed Texas Water Development Board from the legislature.

Proposition 5 (HJR 99): yes 🐔

Exempts individuals from taxes on animal feed.

A “Yes” vote means voting for a tax exemption for those selling animal feed. This could help farmers and ranchers, already dealing with rising costs. Animal feed is already tax exempt when harvested or purchased.

A “No” vote means voting against a tax exemption to sell animal feed.This could benefit large businesses selling feed.

Proposition 6 (HJR 4): no ❌

Bans new taxes on securities transactions, and financial market operators (aimed at those who work in the stock market today, or will work in the Texas Stock Trade).

A “Yes” vote means voting for a ban on stock trade taxes. This would cement protection for those invested in the market, and for the new Texas Stock Trade (TXSE) in Dallas.

A “No” vote means voting against a ban on stock trade taxes. This would only impact the most wealthy Texans, and future reforms and regulations could bring forward budget measures to return revenue to working class Texans, who face the brunt of sales and property tax hikes.

Proposition 7 (HJR 133): yes ✅

Provides a property tax exemption for deceased veterans’ spouses.

A “Yes” vote means voting for tax breaks for veteran widow/widowers. This would provide tax breaks for the un-remarried spouses of veterans who died in the line of duty.

A “No” vote means voting against tax breaks for veteran widows/widowers.This could reduce property tax revenue, impacting local school districts. Expected to impact 3,000 Texans.

Proposition 8 (HJR 2): no ❌

Bans taxes on estate and inheritance.

A “Yes” vote means voting for a ban on inheritance taxes. Our state does not have estate taxes, and a ban would prevent future regulations that could level the playing field to shift the tax burden from working families to wealthy Texans.

A “No” vote means voting against a ban on inheritance taxes. A ban would only benefit a handful of Texans, making others pay higher property taxes.

Proposition 9 (HJR 1): toss up 🤷

Introduces a tax exemption for up to $125,000 worth of business inventory or equipment.

A “Yes” vote means voting for a tax exemption for business inventory or equipment. This could help relieve small businesses of large financial costs to produce income derived from expensive equipment or inventory.

A “No” vote means voting against a tax exemption for business inventory or equipment.This tax exemption could be exploited by big businesses, and could reduce income for school districts from property taxes—though the state will pay for that loss with general revenue.

Proposition 10 (SJR 84): yes 🏠

Introduces a temporary tax exemption for homeowners whose properties were destroyed by fire.

A “Yes” vote means voting for tax breaks for victims of house fires. While most individuals might have home insurance, this exemption could be an extra support.

A “No” vote means voting against a tax break for house fire victims.This exemption only applies to those whose houses are completely destroyed.

Proposition 11 (SJR 85): yes 👵🏾

Increases school property tax exemptions from $10,000 to $60,000 for elderly and disabled homeowners.

A “Yes” vote means voting for a tax exemption for elderly and disabled homeowners. The state will pay for losses, and this amendment provides extra support for an expected 2 million homeowners—who are more likely to be in fixed income households.

A “No” vote means voting against a tax exemption for elderly and disabled homeowners.This would mean school districts have to find funding elsewhere than property taxes derived from these individuals.

Proposition 12 (SJR 27): no ❌

Expands the State Commission on Judicial Conduct (investigates judicial misconduct and reviews termination of judgeships).

A “Yes” vote means voting for the expansion of the SCJC. This new membership would be outweighed by Governor-appointed citizens, and could politicize the judicial process. While proponents claim this could help promote accountability, critics claim that this could be used against progressive judges.

A “No” vote means voting against the expansion of the SCJC. Currently, membership includes six judges or justices, two attorneys, and five citizens appointed by different bodies. Voting against this amendment prevents the executive branch from undermining the review of judicial conduct by keeping membership numbers from increasing.

Proposition 13 (SJR 2): yes 🏠

Increases school property tax exemption for all homeowners, from $100,000 to $140,000.

A “Yes” vote means voting for the increase of homestead exemptions. If this was implemented last year, it would have helped homeowners save $490, on average. The state will pay for losses in revenue for school districts (an estimated $2.7 billion for 2026-2027).

A “No” vote means voting against the increase of homestead exemptions.This does not benefit renters, and leaves less revenue from property taxes to pay for school districts.

Proposition 14 (SJR 3): yes ✅

Establish the Dementia Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (DPRIT).

A “Yes” vote means voting to fund (DPRIT). Provides $3 billion in funding for dementia research and prevention to study brain related conditions (dementia, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, etc…) This could establish Texas as a national leader in dementia research.

A “No” vote means voting against dedicating funding to DPRIT. One might vote against this if they believe medical research should be left to the private sector.

Proposition 15 (SJR 34): no ❌

Codifies “parental rights” language in the Constitution.

A “Yes” vote means voting to codify parental rights language. This could weaponize the Constitution to propagate right-wing culture wars involving LGBTQ+ families, book bans, and what’s taught in public schools.

A “No” vote means voting against the codification of parental rights language. Parental rights are already outlined in federal case law, and voting against this language being codified would protect against attacks on LGBTQ+ families, book bans, and what’s taught in our public schools.

Proposition 16 (SJR 37): no ❌

Adds citizenship requirements to the Constitution.

A “Yes” vote means voting to add citizenship requirements to the Constitution. This is a redundant amendment as U.S. citizenship is already a requirement to register to vote in Texas. This is an inflammatory response aligned with anti-immigration policies and stokes fear about non-citizen voting (an extremely rare phenomenon).

A “No” vote means voting against additional citizenship requirements in the Constitution. This would protect against the Constitution being wielded to propagate xenophobic rhetoric and policies.

Proposition 17 (HJR 34): no ❌

Provides tax exemption for property involved with border security infrastructure

A “Yes” vote means voting for border security efforts and exemptions for property around the Texas-Mexico border. This could incentivize support for border security infrastructure, and shift the tax burden onto other property owners. This could be used to bring forward measures to militarize the border.

A “No” vote means voting against property tax exemptions for border security infrastructure. This amendment could be used to flame xenophobic rhetoric, and bolster support for border security infrastructure.

As electric vehicles generally cost more than their gas-powered counterparts, government incentives were crucial in encouraging people to buy cleaner cars.
However, Searcy said, many Californians have already bought electric vehicles and access to buying them has only increased.
“The tax credits did what they needed to do, which was a financial priming of the pump in order to impact consumer behavior in order to get people to adopt EVs,” Searcy said.
While public favorability when it comes to Musk is low, people shouldn’t lump the future of EVs and Musk together, he said.","Despite efforts at the federal level to curb California’s clean-air vehicle initiatives, including the phase out of gas-powered vehicles, optimism remains on the future of electric vehicles in the state.

Yan Searcy, dean of California State University, Northridge’s College of Social and Behavioral Sciences, home of both CSUN’s Institute for Sustainability and its master’s degree in Sustainability Program, said the positive outlook comes despite federal government challenges related to environmental policies, including Pres. Donald Trump’s signing of congressional bill overturning California’s 2035 gasoline-powered car ban.

While Searcy said the state’s 2035 gasoline-powered car ban was always “an ambitious goal,” he remains optimistic as the infrastructure that has been built over the past decade in support of EVs and consumer buy-in that has followed.

“The state has always been the site of innovation when it comes to transportation and that’s going to continue in spite of what is going on in Washington,” Searcy said. “The EV industry is thriving, and I expect more people to buy-in when it comes to zero-emission vehicles in California.”

The positive outlook comes as federal tax credits for zero-emission vehicles — up to $7,500 for car buyers — is set to expire on Sept. 30 after Trump signed his legislative bill in July.

As electric vehicles generally cost more than their gas-powered counterparts, government incentives were crucial in encouraging people to buy cleaner cars. However, Searcy said, many Californians have already bought electric vehicles and access to buying them has only increased.

“The tax credits did what they needed to do, which was a financial priming of the pump in order to impact consumer behavior in order to get people to adopt EVs,” Searcy said. “We had to make it financially attractive for people to take a chance on what at the time was this new technology.

“It seems in California specifically, every third car appears to be a Tesla,” he continued. “You go to shopping malls and there used to be one or two spaces for EVs, now there’s entire sections for vehicle charging, and that can be attributed to having buy-in from people over a number of years.”

That momentum won’t stop anytime soon, Searcy said, despite controversy earlier this year when it came to Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his political activity. While public favorability when it comes to Musk is low, people shouldn’t lump the future of EVs and Musk together, he said.

“It was never about electric cars, people might have had second thoughts when it came to buying an Elon Musk product, but they don’t regret buying the electric car,” Searcy said.

There are also more options than a decade ago when it comes to electric vehicles, Searcy noted, pointing out that car brands like Lucid and Rivian have also broken into the EV car market. Rideshare companies like Waymo, which utilizes driverless EVs and have also sprung up in major cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles, are attracting younger audiences in the process.

All of this, Searcy said, makes him confident Californians will continue their support of EVs and their positive impact on the environment.

“We’re raising a generation that is keen on sustainability and we’re not going back,” Searcy said. “There has also been a change in less than one generation in other ways when it comes to being sustainable; everybody now has their own water bottle and that’s just water. At least we can say Southern California was able to do that in less than one generation and I think we will look at EVs the same way in the years to come.”",https://sanfernandosun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Charging_City_Hall_04_2015_SFO_2649-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-10-08 23:58:31.862687

""In 2021, again, there was uncertainty on what caused it, but immediately there were attacks on renewable energy,"" Roberts says. ""","Last spring, tens of millions of people lost electricity across Spain, Portugal and part of France. Trains stopped in their tracks, and people were stuck in elevators, as southwestern Europe went without power for — in some cases — more than ten hours.

Immediately the finger-point began. Many people blamed solar and wind energy. Spain, one of Europe's front runners in renewable energy, gets about 46% of its power from solar and wind, according to the think tank Ember— sometimes more than 70%.

In the hours after the outage The Daily Mail published the headline ""Could renewable energy be to blame for huge Spain blackout?""

And on the day of the outage U.S. energy secretary and former fracking executive Chris Wright went on CNBC to talk about the outage and criticized solar and wind. ""When you hitch your wagon to the weather,"" Wright said, ""it's just a risky endeavor.""

The idea that solar and wind are inherently risky and unreliable is a common talking point for critics of renewable energy, often repeated by groups with ties to the fossil fuel industry. It's false. When renewable energy is paired with large batteries or other forms of grid management, it's proven to be reliable.

Now a new report from an expert panel of European grid operators details what happened. The report finds that for the first time in Europe, a voltage surge caused the massive outage. Voltage needs to remain within limits for an electrical grid to work. While many things went wrong, the problem was not a power grid with too much wind or solar, says Chris Rosslowe, a senior energy analyst at Ember who was not involved in drafting the report.

""It contradicts the numerous claims that we've seen that an overreliance on renewables was the cause,"" Rosslowe says. ""That is clearly not true.""

But the misinformation about solar and wind energy causing the outage has had an impact. A new survey found that a majority of Spanish respondents believe at least one false narrative about the blackout, and the most common was that too much reliance on renewable energy was to blame.

Countries around the world are using renewable energy to move away from polluting fossil fuels. That's why it's so important to counter false narratives about solar and wind, says Philip Newell, communications co-chair of the Climate Action Against Disinformation, a coalition of nonprofits.

""This content makes it seem more normal and feel more normal to hate on renewables,"" Newell says. ""Even though they're a solution to climate change.""

What did happen before the outage

The new report from the European grid operators' expert panel found multiple triggers shortly before the blackout.

First, oscillations, or sudden swings in power flow, hit the grid. It's still unclear what caused them. Spain's main grid operator took steps to control the oscillations, including sending less power to France. While these actions helped dampen the oscillations, they caused the voltage to surge upwards.

Voltage is like pressure in a water system. Just like it's key to have a certain amount of pressure for water to flow, there needs to be a certain amount of voltage to push electrons through a circuit. But voltage can't be too high, or it can cause short circuits or even fires.

When the voltage surged, transformers and power plants shut down. Antonio Gómez-Expósito, electrical engineering professor at University of Seville, says the outage shows that Spain needs more regulations around controlling voltage.

The expert panel report, like other recent analyses from Spain's government and main grid operator, does not indicate that reliance on solar or wind power led to the outage. The panel will issue a final report next year.

Newell says the immediate accusations against renewable energy didn't surprise many people who study attacks on climate solutions. ""We've known this has been a recurring issue,"" Newell says. ""The big frame is that 'renewables are bad and we can't trust them'.""

Renewable critics said blackout was caused by lack of ""inertia"" - it wasn't

When critics of renewable energy pointed the finger at solar or wind for causing the blackout, many used one word: inertia.

Michael Shellenberger, a longtime critic of renewable energy and proponent of nuclear power with 1.4 million followers on X, said in a post the day of the blackout, ""Renewables don't risk blackouts, said the media. But they did and they do… it's clear that too little 'inertia' due to excess solar resulted in system collapse.""

Inertia is important to the electrical grid because it can help stabilize sudden fluctuations in a grid's frequency. Power plants that run on gas, coal or nuclear use large spinning turbines that create electricity and have inertia. More modern power resources, like wind, solar, and batteries, don't involve inertia, because they are digitally controlled. ""Wind and solar plants either have no inertia or very little,"" Gómez-Expósito says, ""but in return, they have infinitely greater response speeds.""

There is no indication that a lack of inertia was the cause of the outage, Gómez-Expósito says. Spain's main grid operator, Red Eléctrica, released a report about the outage this summer. ""The incident was not caused by an inertia problem,"" it said in a press release.

Renewable misinformation has an impact

False claims that too much reliance on solar and wind caused the blackout in Spain and Portugal fit into broader attacks on renewable energy.

In winter 2021, a massive power outage hit Texas. Investigations ultimately found that the outage's cause was gas and coal plants that were forced offline because of freezing temperatures. But critics of renewable energy blamed solar and wind, says Timmons Roberts, professor of environmental studies and sociology at Brown University.

""In 2021, again, there was uncertainty on what caused it, but immediately there were attacks on renewable energy,"" Roberts says. "" Sort of exploiting, taking advantage of a crisis to make unfounded accusations.""

Shortly after the power went out in Spain, Newell and his team from the Climate Action Against Disinformation Coalition decided to do a survey about false narratives in the blackout's wake. They surveyed 1,200 people in Spain and 1,200 in the United Kingdom – because many in the U.K. were also paying attention to the outage.

They found seven in ten in Spain and six in ten in the U.K. fell for at least one false narrative about the blackout causes. The most commonly believed false narrative was that the reliance on renewables was at fault.

Newell says while most of the survey respondents acknowledge the reality of climate change, misinformation led many to question the reliability of renewable energy.

Renewable energy plus batteries proving to be reliable in warming world

Solar and wind resources are already proving to be part of a reliable grid, says Elliot Mainzer, chief executive of the California Independent System Operator, which assures the reliability of California's grid. California was powered by two-thirds clean energy in 2023, the latest year for which data is available.

Mainzer says the key is pairing solar and wind energy with massive batteries. Batteries are especially important with solar, as they absorb excess solar energy during the day, and send it back into the grid after the sun sets and evening demand stays high, Mainzer says.

Mainzer says older power sources have their own problems. California faces a loss of hydropower during droughts. And Mainzer says, gas power plants have some reliability challenges, too.

"" During the kind of heat waves we've seen in recent years, the natural gas plants can come under some significant strain,"" Mainzer says. ""They have to run harder, they mechanically get challenged, and we tend to see a higher outage rate amongst the gas fleet when the temperatures are really, really hot.""

Mainzer says the use of solar plus batteries helped prevent blackouts in California in 2022 when there was a heatwave hitting much of the state and gas plants were under performing. Texas' main grid operator, ERCOT, has also said that an increase in solar and battery storage has helped the state avoid power outages — especially as the state sees unexpected outages with coal plants.

As the planet sees longer and more intense heat waves with global warming, primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels, Mainzer says solar combined with batteries, both of which perform well in the heat, will be important to keep the lights on.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5568x3132+0+580/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F69%2F27%2Ffcd62c2446ce8689ab81442b1d93%2Fgettyimages-2211918663.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 23:58:44.862253

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:

When a massive power outage hit Spain and Portugal last spring, there were all kinds of rumors about the cause. Now the findings of an expert panel are out, and the report contradicts one big line of misinformation, as NPR's Julia Simon reports.

JULIA SIMON, BYLINE: In the hours and days after the outage, there was a lot of finger-pointing - it was a cyberattack. It was Russia.

CHRIS ROSSLOWE: Well, almost immediately, theories started circulating.

SIMON: Chris Rosslowe is an energy analyst with the think tank Ember.

ROSSLOWE: It wasn't a good time for getting to the truth.

SIMON: For many people, there was one prime suspect - solar and wind power. Spain, a leader in renewable energy, gets about 46% of its power from solar and wind, according to Ember. Sometimes more than 70%. On the day of the blackout, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright went on CNBC and criticized renewables.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CHRIS WRIGHT: You know, when you hitch your wagon to the weather, it's just a risky endeavor.

SIMON: But a new report from an expert panel of European grid operators does not implicate renewables. It finds a surge in voltage caused the massive outage. Voltage needs to be within limits for an electrical grid to work. While many things went wrong, the problem was not a grid that's overreliant on wind and solar, says Antonio Gomez-Exposito, electrical engineering professor at University of Seville.

ANTONIO GOMEZ-EXPOSITO: (Speaking Spanish).

SIMON: ""The problem isn't whether there are too many renewables,"" he says. Reports on the outage from Spain's government and main grid operator echo this point. Gomez-Exposito says he thinks Spain needs more regulations around voltage.

The idea that solar and wind are inherently risky is a common narrative of critics, many tied to the fossil fuel industry. It's false. When renewable energy is paired with large batteries or other forms of grid management, it's proven to be reliable. Still, in Spain, the misinformation had an impact. A new survey finds 7 out of 10 Spanish respondents believe at least one false narrative about the outage. The most common? A grid with too much renewable energy was to blame.

Philip Newell is communications co-chair of Climate Action Against Disinformation, the coalition of nonprofits that commissioned the survey. False narratives against solar and wind, he says, are a recurring issue.

PHILIP NEWELL: This content makes it seem more normal and feel normal to hate on renewables. And the big frame is that renewables are bad and we can't trust them.

SIMON: Newell says it's important to counter this misinformation as countries around the world increasingly use renewable energy to move away from planet-heating fossil fuels. Grid operators from Texas to Australia are finding that renewables plus batteries are cost-effective and stable. Elliot Mainzer is chief executive of the California Independent System Operator, which assures the reliability of California's grid. He says solar plus batteries helped prevent blackouts in 2022, when a heat wave hit California and gas plants were underperforming.

ELLIOT MAINZER: Especially during the kind of heat waves we've seen in recent years, that the natural gas plants can come under some significant strain. They have to run harder. They mechanically get challenged. And we tend to see a higher outage rate amongst the gas fleet when the temperatures are really, really hot.

SIMON: As the planet sees longer and more intense heat waves with global warming, Mainzer says solar, combined with batteries, will be important to keep the lights on. Julia Simon, NPR News.

That's the Point. - Heatmap News",Andrew Moseman,,,,,https://heatmap.news/electric-vehicles/tesla-standard-ford-hyundai,"The impending end of the tax credit on September 30 helped propel Tesla to record sales numbers in the third quarter of 2025.
The tax credit deadline had looked like one that would demarcate two distinct EV eras, with October 1 acting as the beginning of new, less-affordable time.
By making the down payment before the end of September, Ford and GM qualified these vehicles for the federal tax benefit.
Incentives like the federal tax credit for EVs aren’t meant to last forever, of course.
Ford has only just announced a roadmap to overhaul its entire EV production system in order to stop losing billions on electric vehicles.","We finally know what Tesla means by an “affordable” electric vehicle. On Tuesday, the electric automaker revealed the stripped-down, less-fancy “Standard” version of its best-selling Model Y crossover and Model 3 sedan. These EVs will sell for several thousand dollars less than the existing versions, which are now rebranded as “Premium.”

These slightly cheaper Ys and 3s aren’t exactly the $25,000 baby Tesla that many fans and investors have anticipated for years. But the announcement is an indication of where the electric vehicle market in the United States may be headed now that the $7,500 federal tax credit for purchasing an EV is dead and gone. Automakers have spent the past few months rejiggering their lineups and slashing prices as much as they can to make sure sales don’t crater without the federal incentive.

The impending end of the tax credit on September 30 helped propel Tesla to record sales numbers in the third quarter of 2025. It was a stark reversal from months of disappointing sales stemming from factors like increased competition and Elon Musk’s political antics that alienated potential buyers. Money talks, of course; Tesla sent me a blitz of emails to make sure I didn’t forget what a good deal I could get before September’s end. But now, with the deadline passed, Musk’s company needed a new shot in the arm to stop sales from falling off a cliff.

The budget Teslas are, indeed, lesser vehicles. They have simpler headlights, less power, and less range than the now-Premium versions. They even come in fewer colors. But the prices — $40,000 for a Model Y Standard and $37,000 for a Model 3 Standard — effectively mirror what those cars would have cost if the tax credit were still in place. In other words, you can still buy a Tesla in the $35,000 to $40,000 range. It just won’t be as good a Tesla as you used to be able to get for the money.

The tax credit deadline had looked like one that would demarcate two distinct EV eras, with October 1 acting as the beginning of new, less-affordable time. But it turns out things aren’t quite so black and white. Lots of automakers are experimenting with ways to soften the financial blow for those who still want to get into an EV. After all, there’s always a loophole.

For example, as the September tax credit deadline approached, Reuters reported on a scheme orchestrated by Ford and General Motors to allow the American car giants to keep the good times going by buying their own cars. It goes like this: Before the September 30 deadline, the financing arms of these big corporations began the process of purchasing a host of their own vehicles from their dealerships. By making the down payment before the end of September, Ford and GM qualified these vehicles for the federal tax benefit. (They even checked with the IRS to make sure this plot was legitimate, Reuters said.) They plan to pass on the savings by leasing those vehicles back to everyday Americans.

According to Car and Driver, a number of citizens did something similar to what the corporations devised — that is, some buyers made their first payments on EVs that won’t be delivered to them for weeks or months in order to qualify for the tax break. These shenanigans are for the short term, though. Ford and GM could pre-purchase only so many of their own vehicles, and Ford said this deal effectively extends the tax credit only another quarter, through the end of December.

The bigger question is whether the automakers can — or will — simply cut prices on their EVs to make the loss of federal incentives sting a little less.

That’s the plan at Hyundai. The Korean giant has announced an enormous price cut on its successful Ioniq 5, one that more than makes up for the vanishing federal incentive. The most basic version of that car will fall from $42,600 to $35,000, putting it on par with the Chevy Equinox EV that’s been a hit at that price. Fancier versions of the Ioniq 5 will fall by more than $9,000 for the 2026 model year. Hyundai and its partner Kia are offering some of the best October lease deals, too.

Other car companies have begun to follow suit. BMW will simply offer a $7,500 discount on its electric models for those who take delivery by the end of October. Stellantis, the parent company of Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge, Ram, and others, will do the same for electric sales through the end of the year. No word yet on what happens after these deals expire.

Incentives like the federal tax credit for EVs aren’t meant to last forever, of course. In theory, their purpose is to lift up a new technology until it can compete at scale with the tech that has been around forever.

Whether electric cars have reached that point is a contentious question. Ford has only just announced a roadmap to overhaul its entire EV production system in order to stop losing billions on electric vehicles. Hyundai’s EVs are profitable — or, at least they were before the Trump administration began monkeying with tax incentives and tariffs. A batch of more affordable EVs are on the way, though the ever-changing map of tariffs makes it unclear exactly how much they’ll cost when they finally arrive.

Since January, the Trump administration has made deep cuts to the nation’s science funding, including more than $1 billion in grants to the National Science Foundation, which sponsors much of the basic research at universities and federal laboratories, and $4.5 billion to the National Institutes of Health. Thousands of jobs for scientists and staff members have been terminated or frozen at these and other federal agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Park Service.

To thousands of researchers — veteran scientists and new grad students, at state universities and Ivy League institutions alike — these sweeping reductions translate as direct personal losses: a layoff, a shuttered lab, a yearslong experiment or field study abruptly ended, graduate students turned away; lost knowledge, lost progress, lost investment, lost stability; dreams deferred or foreclosed.

“This government upheaval is discouraging to all scientists who give their time and lend their brilliance to solve the problems beleaguering humankind instead of turning to some other activity that makes a more steady living,” Gina Poe, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote in an email.

Next year looks to be worse.

Renewable electricity generation continues to grow rapidly worldwide, despite recent U.S. policy shifts, with global capacity expected to more than double by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Compared to last year, the IEA says pullbacks on renewables in the U.S. and China led to a slight reduction in its five-year global renewable energy growth forecast; however, even with the weaker prospects in those two countries, the agency reports that solar power continues to drive record growth.

In the U.S., the downward revision is primarily due to the early phase-out of federal tax incentives and other regulatory changes, which have lowered growth expectations by almost 50%. Still, the IEA said that in 2024, solar and wind accounted for 16% of total electricity in the U.S., surpassing coal.

While China and the U.S. may experience a downward trend in the growth of renewable energy sources, these losses are being offset by stronger outlooks in other regions, including India, Europe and most emerging and developing economies, where growth prospects have been revised upward due to ambitious new policies, including faster permitting.

And for the first half of 2025, record solar and steady wind growth led to renewables overtaking coal generation globally for the first time on record, according to a new report from Ember, an independent global energy think tank.

Renewables grew by 7.7% while coal generation recorded a decrease, according to Ember.

""Solar PV is on course to account for some 80% of the increase in the world's renewable capacity over the next five years,"" IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said.

The growth of renewable energy is not just confined to electricity generation. The IEA projects that renewable energy consumption in the transportation sector is expected to rise 50% by 2030. This surge will be driven by increased use of renewable electricity, liquid biofuels, biogases and renewable hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels.

A significant portion of this growth is expected to come from the continued expansion of electric vehicles, particularly in China and Europe, which are projected to account for 45% of the anticipated increase over the next five years.

The IEA highlights that surging energy consumption will likely not derail global sustainability efforts, as rapidly expanding low-emission energy sources, such as renewables and nuclear energy, will provide record-high electricity generation and offset additional global demand over the next three years. Renewable energy sources, including solar, wind and hydropower, are forecast to meet over 90% of the global electricity demand growth through 2030.

These changes are already delivering measurable environmental benefits. In 2024, carbon dioxide emissions in advanced economies dropped to their lowest level in 50 years. According to the IEA, the deployment of solar, wind, nuclear, electric cars, and heat pumps since 2019 is now preventing an estimated 2.6 billion tons of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere each year.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/e0TJDPUayGtnyKZWtiFR2Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/us.abcnews.go.com/0eba82bee8e58e03fb737d110a81f734,N,,2025-10-09 04:59:04.879007

Those temporary workers were building a battery factory at the Metaplant campus and training colleagues that included Americans.
Yet South Korean president Lee Jae Myung said the ICE raid might make companies hesitant to build in the U.S. Hyundai had pledged in March to boost its total investment in the U.S. to $21 billion through 2028.
Several South Korean companies have struggled to obtain short-term visas to bring enough specialized workers to their leading-edge plants.
“They feel they were ready and willing to do some of the jobs foreign workers were doing,” Jones says.","When I visited Hyundai Motor’s “Metaplant” in May to drive the new Ioniq9 electric SUV, the facility was a symbol of everything right about U.S. auto manufacturing. It’s a US $7.6 billion showpiece of automation staffed by gung-ho and highly skilled workers, capable of churning out 500,000 EVs a year at full crank. The biggest publicly backed project in Georgia’s history, the Metaplant is the linchpin of Republican Governor Brian Kemp’s bid to make the state the “electric mobility capital of the country.”

Then it all went wrong. On 4 September, federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents raided the supersized facility in Ellabell, Ga., about one hour from Savannah. Agents arrested some 475 people—including more than 300 South Korean contractors—and led them away in shackles and handcuffs. Those temporary workers were building a battery factory at the Metaplant campus and training colleagues that included Americans. Following a week of detention, and tense negotiations between the South Korean and U.S. governments, the workers were ejected from the U.S. and sent home on a chartered plane. Outraged Korean officials opened an investigation into potential human rights abuses during the workers’ incarceration.

“America is not a safe place to work,” one of the workers told The New York Times, after his return home.

Production of the Ioniq9 and smaller Ioniq5 has proceeded apace. But the opening of the battery plant, jointly owned by Hyundai and LG Energy Solution, has been pushed back by at least two months. And the episode laid bare some messy contradictions, as America seeks to stand up an EV-and-battery business that can compete against China.

The Trump Administration’s Mixed Messages Confuse Investors

President Trump has demanded that foreign companies build products in the U.S., using tariffs and other strongarm tactics to secure investment pledges. That contrasts with President Biden’s carrot-and-stick approach, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which offered generous incentives to manufacturers and consumers. The Trump administration has also been nakedly hostile toward EVs and green initiatives, seeking to reverse Biden’s ambitious pollution and fuel-economy agenda, and deny the ability of California and other states to set their own greenhouse-gas standards. At the administration’s behest, the GOP-led Congress eliminated a $7,500 clean-car tax credit that ended Sept. 30. That tax break had spurred Hyundai to accelerate the Metaplant’s construction to make their EVs eligible for credits, and, over the years, had helped make EVs more affordable for hundreds of thousands of Americans. In the wary dalliance between Trump and manufacturers, there are enough mixed messages to keep a hundred dating apps buzzing.

“The Trump administration was raving about the plant, but then raided it less than two weeks later,” says Betony Jones, who served as senior advisor on labor to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Michigan’s former governor, and directed the Department of Energy’s office of energy jobs in the Biden administration. “It’s a confusing situation, and confusing for foreign investors,” she adds.

Trump insisted he had no intention of “frightening off” specialized workers such as the South Koreans, some of whom had helped build car, battery or semiconductor factories around the world, including in Michigan, Texas, Poland, Indonesia and the Middle East.

“We welcome them, we welcome their employees, and we are willing to proudly say we will learn from them, and do even better than them at their own ‘game,’ sometime into the not too distant future!” Trump posted on Truth Social.

Responding to a question from IEEE Spectrum, Kush Desai, a White House deputy press secretary, said the President will support any company investing in the U.S. by slashing regulations and enabling them to bring in technical experts to set up facilities and train American workers. “Industry leaders in sectors ranging from autos to pharmaceuticals to technology have committed to investing trillions in the United States because they know they have a friend and ally in the White House,” Desai said.

Yet South Korean president Lee Jae Myung said the ICE raid might make companies hesitant to build in the U.S. Hyundai had pledged in March to boost its total investment in the U.S. to $21 billion through 2028. The controversial raid comes at a fraught moment for EVs, amid slowing consumer demand and steep tariffs on raw materials and import cars, which have led many automakers to scale back electric plans and lean back into ICE cars and hybrids.

The raid, Jones says, also exposed familiar fault lines in labor and manufacturing. These included ones related to workplace safety and the proper role of foreign workers, and the tendency of foreign manufacturers to locate factories in the southern U.S., where they can operate free of union labor, often at lower wages. A TV station near the Hyundai complex, WTOC, had aired investigative reports about poor safety conditions and unauthorized labor at the plant. At least three workers have died there, according to law enforcement. Hyundai has sought to distance itself from the battery portion of the Metaplant, saying none of the foreign contractors were directly employed by the automaker. Both Hyundai and LG Energy Solution have begun their own inquiries into the raid, and have vowed to follow all laws and rules, including those for workplace safety.

Deportations Renew Attention to Visa Policy

In Georgia, many contract workers had arrived on six-month B1 visas issued for business travel, or through a visa-waiver program that allows stays of up to 90 days. Some companies, experts say, have played fast-and-loose with visa rules, in part because H-1B visas, which allow six-year stays for employees, are expensive and in short supply. Several South Korean companies have struggled to obtain short-term visas to bring enough specialized workers to their leading-edge plants.

“Previous U.S. administrations had largely turned a blind eye to” the visa abuses, according toThe Guardian.

The Trump administration now faces criticism for its new policy to charge $100,000 for those coveted H-1B visas, which some companies say would be counterproductive, unaffordable and potentially illegal. In Georgia, some local union workers said they had been unfairly bypassed for work in the battery plant.

“They feel they were ready and willing to do some of the jobs foreign workers were doing,” Jones says. “So what does that knowledge-transfer need to look like? How do we pivot from foreign workers and train up a U.S. workforce that has enough specialized skills to do those jobs?”

As General Motors pivoted to EVs, it struggled to scale up battery plants in Ohio and Tennessee, in a joint venture with LG Energy to manufacture a new line of batteries called Ultium Cells. The automaker’s “Factory Zero” in Detroit — where President Biden lauded GM CEO Mary Barra in 2021, and test-drove a GMC Hummer EV in a parking lot — also suffered glitches as GM sought to rush its batteries and EVs into production. That included a fire when a forklift pierced a stack of robotically-assembled batteries.

The Detroit factory was the American industry’s first attempt to scale up a fully automated assembly line to make pouch-style batteries (which have since been partially supplanted by prismatic cells). GM raced to bring in outside battery consultants and executives to fix battery and assembly issues, finally hiring former Tesla battery chief Kurt Kelty to run its battery operations. It paid off: after those frustrating growing pains, GM began cranking out Ultium batteries, and is now America’s leading producer of lithium-ion cells among automakers.",https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/aerial-view-of-the-hyundai-metaplant-shows-multiple-sprawling-buildings-shown-to-be-of-a-large-scale-by-comparison-to-some-cars.jpg?id=61673725&width=2000&height=1500&coordinates=272%2C0%2C273%2C0,N,,2025-10-08 22:01:17.373327

That program has absorbed the bulk of the population that would otherwise be using ACA tax credits to offset their costs.
This raises the possibility that some available revenues, including proceeds from enhanced tax credits, could be going unused.
The legislation cut off most legally present immigrants from eligibility for federal health programs, including ACA tax credits, starting in 2026.
Given these looming changes, the lost revenue associated with enhanced tax credits is one of many moving parts in a complicated financial structure.","As Washington skirmishes over the future of enhanced tax credits under the Affordable Care Act, New York has relatively little to gain or lose.

The number of New Yorkers using any ACA credits – enhanced or not – stands at about 119,000 or 0.6 percent of the population, the lowest proportion of any state other than the District of Columbia, according to the latest federal enrollment report.

That compares to utilization rates as high as 19 percent in Florida and 13 percent in Georgia and an average of 6 percent nationwide.

The driver of this disparity is New York’s Essential Plan, which offers zero-premium, government-funded coverage to residents up to 250 percent of the poverty level. That program has absorbed the bulk of the population that would otherwise be using ACA tax credits to offset their costs.

The Essential Plan also reaps the federal money that would otherwise have been spent on credits for its enrollees, covering all of its $14 billion budget.

Although the enhanced credits enacted in 2021 have nominally boosted that revenue by about $1 billion per year, it’s not clear the state is actually collecting that amount – because the program was unable to spend all of its available funding even before the enhancements took effect.

Still, the Hochul administration has joined a Democrat-led campaign to prevent the enhanced credits from expiring in December – and the state’s publicity materials portray the Essential Plan’s 1.7 million enrollees as having something to lose if that happens.

The original ACA tax credits were targeted to the working poor – people who made too much money to qualify for Medicaid but didn’t have access to employer-sponsored health benefits and could not afford insurance on their own.

The law established a percentage of income that consumers were expected to pay toward their own coverage – on a sliding scale from 100 percent to 400 percent of the poverty level – and offered tax credits that were enough to cover the balance of a benchmark premium from coverage purchased through an ACA insurance exchange (see table).

As part of a pandemic relief package in 2021, Washington lawmakers enhanced the credits by lowering the share of income consumers were expected to contribute – to zero for incomes up to 150 percent of the poverty level and to no more than 8.5 percent at the high end. They also extended the credits to people of any income, ending what had been a benefit “cliff” at 400 percent of the poverty level.

As seen in the chart below, the biggest benefit of the enhancement went to people just above 400 percent of the poverty level, who saw their net costs cut in half. Based on a typical premium of $27,000, a family of four with income at 900 percent of the poverty level, or $289,000, could claim a credit of more than $2,000.

However, that would be an unusual scenario. Most Americans at that income level get health coverage through their employers – and have no reason to buy insurance directly. The bulk of people claiming ACA credits still fall below 400 percent of the poverty level.

New York’s ACA insurance change – known as the New York State of Health – said that 146,000 New Yorkers were benefiting from enhanced tax credits as of September 2024. This includes 43,000 or 29 percent with incomes above 400 percent of the poverty level.

The report also said that federal funding for the Essential Plan “is estimated to be $1 billion higher as a result of these enhanced federal subsidies.”

That $1 billion figure is consistent with what the Health Department estimated when it applied for – and later received – federal authorization to extend the Essential Plan’s eligibility ceiling from 200 percent to 250 percent of the poverty level.

However, those same estimates indicated that the program’s revenue would exceed its costs by $1.4 billion even if the credits were allowed to expire – implying that the extra $1 billion was unnecessary in the near term.

Over its first nine years, excess revenue accumulated in the Essential Plan’s trust fund, which held a balance of $8.9 billion as of May, according to the state comptroller’s office. Since the program’s expansion took effect in April 2024, the comptroller’s records indicate that the trust fund balance is no longer growing because the state is now collecting only the federal revenue it needs to cover expenses. This raises the possibility that some available revenues, including proceeds from enhanced tax credits, could be going unused.

With enactment of President Trump’s tax- and budget-cutting package this summer, the Essential Plan’s well-cushioned finances are in jeopardy. The legislation cut off most legally present immigrants from eligibility for federal health programs, including ACA tax credits, starting in 2026. Some 730,000 of the affected immigrants are enrolled in the Essential Plan. Their departure will chop the plan’s revenue by more than half, or $7.6 billion.

In response, Governor Hochul has moved to unwind the program’s 2024 expansion. Officials say this would temporarily save the state money on covering about 500,000 of the affected immigrants but displace some 450,000 enrollees above 200 percent of the poverty level.

Given these looming changes, the lost revenue associated with enhanced tax credits is one of many moving parts in a complicated financial structure.

The executive order has been used as an excuse by the Trump administration to give handouts to Big Oil and Gas executives while attacking affordable, clean energy, raising consumer costs and killing jobs in the process.

Sierra Club and nearly 170 other groups sent a letter to Senators asking them to support the resolution. The letter reads:

“President Trump’s declaration is a thinly-veiled attempt to ban cleaner and cheaper forms of energy and gut environmental protections in order to further enrich his oil and gas executive donors at the expense of our communities, property rights, and clean air and water.”

The groups cite a variety of reasons to support termination of the executive order including the administration’s attacks on grid stability, safety, and reliability, as well as undermining efforts to keep energy affordable for Americans, including rolling back energy efficiency standards.

In reaction, Sierra Club Director of Beyond Fossil Fuels Policy Mahyar Sorour issued the following statement:

“It has been painfully obvious from the beginning that the only reason Donald Trump declared an energy emergency was in order to line the pockets of his fossil fuel donors - he told us as much on the campaign trail. Now the American people are starting to feel the effects of higher energy prices because of this sham emergency and the subsequent attack on clean energy. We are grateful for the leadership of Senators Heinrich and Kaine and Senate Democrats to get rid of this disastrous executive order.”

The region has relied on companies like Engie to improve its energy sector alongside government subsidies and institutions. Now, Engie has revealed that it plans to expand its reach in specific markets instead of operating in too many countries, which undermines its long-term goals.

Engie aims to improve existing operations in the Middle East region

For any company the size of Engie, maintaining a smooth operation in several markets is key to its long-term plans for the energy sector. Engie has stated it plans to focus its energy on the Middle East region, where it hopes to expand its presence in several key markets.

The company is ramping up renewables, flexible power, and grid-stabilising technology in the UAE and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which has been welcomed by the countries’ governments. In a recent interview, Engie’s leadership underscored the importance of adopting renewable energy generation.

“The ambitions for Engie in CO2 emissions reduction and net zero are stricter than the ambitions in the region. But we feel supported by the governments that have similar goals, even if the timelines sometimes differ.” – Engie’s Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) flexible power managing director Niko Cornelis

The company has stated that it plans to maintain a balanced approach to its legacy thermal and desalination operations, in line with a 2045 net-zero target. Not that long ago, the company was excited about the possibilities of the green hydrogen sector, but it has opted to focus on what it can control. The green hydrogen sector has seen significant investments in recent years, but a lack of optimism has led to the slow progress the sector has seen.

“What we have seen over the past two to three years is that while there were huge ambitions for green hydrogen, they were often based on optimistic assumptions about technological advances and cost reductions. For green hydrogen to truly scale, we need a viable offtake market — one that is prepared to absorb the premium costs that green hydrogen currently commands. This remains one of the biggest missing pieces in the ecosystem.” – Engie’s Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) flexible power managing director Niko Cornelis

Engie aims to position itself not as a developer, but as a long-term partner for the markets in the region

Keeping the renewable energy sector in mind, Engie has made several commitments to improving its portfolio in the region through a variety of projects, which include:

Battery energy storage systems (BESS)

low-carbon thermal power generation

desalination switching entirely to reverse osmosis (RO)

The transportation sector, which is directly linked to the energy sector, has seen a significant drop in traffic in the ports and rail networks of the world. Which could be solved by companies like Engie improving the existing infrastructure in markets where it already operates.

The project will produce deeply carbon-negative hydrogen from water without electricity for the mobility sector, setting a new benchmark for cost-effective decarbonization.

The project will be located at a dairy farm complex in California and will integrate dairy digester biogas systems with Utility's proprietary H2Gen technology to produce economical clean fuel for heavy-duty transportation. This innovative combination will deliver hydrogen with one of the lowest negative carbon intensity scores in the market and provide a scalable pathway to decarbonize heavy-duty transportation economically. The project has also secured initial offtake at attractive pricing to both partners.

Under the agreement, MEW will develop, build, and operate the anaerobic digesters and associated biogas treatment systems, while Utility will develop and operate the fuel production system. Together, the companies are demonstrating that collaboration across the agriculture and energy sectors can enable economic decarbonization at scale, further supporting the US's energy independence.

""This project is another breakthrough moment for Utility - proving that hydrogen fuel can be produced economically, without electricity, and at deeply negative carbon intensity – greener than 'green hydrogen' from renewable power,"" said Parker Meeks, CEO of Utility Global. ""Partnering with MEW allows us to unite world-class biogas expertise with our H2Gen® technology to deliver extremely clean fuel at scale and accelerate California's transition to zero-emission, heavy-duty transportation.""

""Maas Energy Works has always focused on turning dairy manure into biogas and clean energy,"" said Daryl Maas, CEO of Maas Energy Works. ""Partnering with Utility Global takes that innovation further -- producing carbon-negative hydrogen to power the growth of heavy-duty transportation.""

Once operational, the project is expected to produce approximately three tons per day of carbon-negative hydrogen fuel, creating a scalable solution to supply the growing network of hydrogen fueling stations across California. This fuel will play a critical role in enabling zero-emission trucks and buses to meet the state's leadership in climate and air quality targets.

The Utility Global–MEW collaboration represents an alternative model for the integration of bio-based clean fuels and industrial decarbonization technology. In addition to dairy farms, other sources of biogas like landfills and wastewater plants are also profitable opportunities for H2Gen to provide a practical and economic pathway to produce and decarbonize transportation fuels near the point of use. The project is currently in front-end engineering development, with final investment decision anticipated following completion of feasibility and design studies and finalization of binding offtake agreements in 2026.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Utility_MAW_9f500c6c4f.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 20:02:19.199291

Even Saudi Arabia, the ultimate petrostate, is embracing renewable energy and seeking to acquire half of all its electricity from clean sources by 2030.
The rise of China as the clean energy superpower and the ambitions of a country like Saudi Arabia show that the U.S. is thinking small.","While the Trump administration has effectively declared war on wind and solar energy — blocking all permitting of projects on federal lands and pushing through a rollback of federal subsidies and tax credits — other nations are embracing renewable energy as a strategy for building economic and political strength. China remains the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases; however, it has also become the global leader in the manufacturing and deployment of renewable energy, electric vehicles and batteries, achieved through sustained industrial policy support that began a mere two decades ago.

The motivations were not primarily environmental. Chinese leaders saw these technologies as strategic industries of the future, and believed the country that dominated these technologies would gain economic and political advantage in the long run. Thus, clean technologies were included within China’s 2010 “Strategic Emerging Industries” policy and its “Made in China 2025” strategy.

Chinese thought leaders conceived of the strategy in epochal terms. The super power had missed out on each of the four major waves of industrialization technological change that had allowed European powers and the U.S. to become global hegemons and China’s elites and top academics were determined not to make the same mistake again. China’s Communist Party leadership saw clean technologies as part of a set of innovations, including artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing, that were critical to Chinese modernization and global competition.

That dominance in clean technologies would enable China to position itself as a leader in global climate talks; build stronger ties with Global South countries in need of cheaper, cleaner energy; and reduce choking pollution within China was only further reason to go all in on clean technologies.

This strategy has been wildly successful. Today, China makes more than 70% of solar PV modules, 80% of the cells that compose those modules and 90% of the wafers used to make cells. It manufactures more than 60% of electric vehicles globally and accounts for roughly three-quarters of global battery cell production, with even greater dominance in cathode and anode production and critical mineral processing. China has rapidly expanded offshore wind capacity and now accounts for more than half of global capacity (41.8 gigawatts), up from just 1 gigawatt in 2015. China’s surge in renewables and electrification is starting to shrink its greenhouse gas emissions while creating the conditions for other countries to move away from fossil fuel use, according to a recent analysis by the think tank Ember. The surge is putting China so far out in front on clean energy that it’s now in a league of its own.

Meanwhile, President Trump’s team is severely hampering the development of clean energy projects in the U.S. and is even threatening existing manufacturing investments. The regulatory assault on renewable energy is broad and plainly at odds with Trump’s declaration of an energy emergency. The attacks on clean energy include the August stop-work order on the Revolution Wind offshore project, which was 80% complete, and the removal of a panoply of support for clean energy in the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill.” The recent ICE raid on a multibillion-dollar Hyundai-LG battery plant project in Ellabell, Ga., was an own goal for an administration that claims to be bringing manufacturing back to the U.S.

It doesn’t have to be this way. While Democrats and Republicans have deep disagreements over the risks of climate change and the role of fossil fuels in the future American energy mix, there is a political consensus that Americans can benefit from maximizing the availability of cheaper, more abundant energy. Even Saudi Arabia, the ultimate petrostate, is embracing renewable energy and seeking to acquire half of all its electricity from clean sources by 2030. Several Saudi companies announced a combined investment of $8.3 billion this year to stand up massive new solar and wind projects, the Wall Street Journal recently reported. The desert kingdom is also investing in becoming a major supplier of critical minerals, like lithium, copper and rare earths.

It might sound funny that oil-rich Saudi Arabia is racing to go green. But more electricity from sunshine means more barrels of oil they can save for export to willing buyers. And the truth is that Chinese-made solar panels are now the cheapest and easiest ways to become energy rich.

The rise of China as the clean energy superpower and the ambitions of a country like Saudi Arabia show that the U.S. is thinking small.

The Environmental Integrity Project and EarthJustice filed a lawsuit against the EPA because of these actions, which Northwest Indiana groups Just Transition Northwest Indiana and Gary Advocates for Responsible Development joined.

“We’re glad that EPA recognizes the harm coke oven plants cause to communities and that it is more than reasonable for these facilities to meet emissions standards now,” Adrienne Lee, senior attorney at EarthJustice said in a news release. “The health and well-being of impacted communities should not come at the cost of giving corporate polluters a pass. We hope to see the same logic and law applied to air standards at steel mills, many of which are located in the same communities as coke ovens.”

According to the Environmental Integrity Project, the EPA finalized updates to the emission standards for steel facilities with coke plants in 2024, which would have required steel mills to reduce emissions since last April. However, President Donald Trump’s administration issued an interim final rule that would delay compliance until July 2027.

The EPA held a virtual public hearing for the coke oven interim final rule in September, according to Post-Tribune archives. The agency also hosted a hearing for the interim final rule for national emission standards for integrated iron and steel manufacturing facilities, which revises all 2025 and 2026 compliance dates for April 3, 2027, according to EPA documents.

Multiple Northwest Indiana facilities were included in the rule updates, including U.S. Steel’s Gary Works facility and Cleveland-Cliffs’ Burns Harbor facility. The Indiana Harbor facility, which is operated by Cleveland-Cliffs and has a partnership with SunCoke Energy, was also included.

“Our communities, which have endured generations of environmental racism and injustice, cannot afford any more reckless and unnecessary delays to compliance for coke ovens,” Ashley Williams, executive director for JTNWI, said in a news release. “We are tired of defending our fundamental right to breathe and live a healthy life in Northwest Indiana. JTNWI is relieved that EPA heard our rally cry and withdrew this dangerous proposal.”

The lawsuit challenged the interim final rule because “it deprived nearby residents and communities of protection against toxic air pollution,” according to the Environmental Integrity Project’s news release. An EPA brief filing acknowledged that coke ovens are capable of complying with the 2024 rule.

U.S. Steel responded to the EPA’s decision in a Tuesday statement. The company does not have coke ovens at its Gary Works facility, but coke is produced at the Mon Valley Works Clairton plant near Pittsburgh.

“U.S. Steel is committed to working with the EPA and supports regulations that are well-grounded in law; and are based on sound science, available and proven technology, and that consider costs and other non-air quality impacts,” a U.S. Steel representative said in an email statement. “Unfortunately, the 2024 coke rules do not meet these criteria, and we are evaluating next steps. Meanwhile, our environmental teams are working on plans and logistics toward compliance with the regulations. EPA remains open to revising the 2024 rule and we look forward to joining industry partners in continuing discussions with the agency..”

Chris Hardin, environmental manager for U.S. Steel, said in September that interim final rule deadlines are infeasible and based on insufficient data and miscalculations, adding that the EPA needs to fully consider all relevant factors before finalizing the rule, according to Post-Tribune archives.

During the EPA’s coke hearing, Michael Long, Cleveland-Cliffs’ senior director of environmental affairs, said the organization supports “environmental regulations that are based on sound science and prudent technology,” according to Post-Tribune archives.

“The technologies that would be needed … are not commercially available and have not been demonstrated to work in the coke byproduct industry either in the U.S. or internationally,” Long previously said. “EPA did not anticipate that we would need to research and develop technologies that have not been implemented in the coke sector, that might not be feasible…”

(Reuters) -General Motors is scrapping a program aimed at allowing its dealers to continue offering for several months a $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles following the Sept. 30 expiration of the federal subsidy, the company said Wednesday.

Toward the end of last month, GM devised a plan to have its in-house lending arm initiate the purchase of EVs in its dealers’ inventory. The company planned to apply for the federal $7,500 credit on those cars hours ahead of the deadline, and then roll that money into EV lease terms for customers.

The idea behind the program was to ease the impact of the expiration of the tax credit on dealers, who worried that they would be stuck with EVs that would be tough to sell. GM had planned to apply for the credit on tens of thousands of EVs in dealer stocks, according to people familiar with the plan.

“After further consideration, we have decided not to claim the tax credit,” the company said in a statement to Reuters Wednesday. The automaker didn’t elaborate on its decision.

Ford rolled out a similar program ahead of the tax-credit expiration. It’s unclear if Ford is continuing its program. A spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

When combusted, hydrogen produces water instead of CO₂: a characteristic that positions it as a key element in decarbonisation strategies.

It can be used directly in engines or to generate electricity in fuel cells, making it a versatile energy carrier. Recognising this potential, governments and trade blocs like the EU are actively developing hydrogen strategies to increase production and adoption.

The industry categorises hydrogen using a colour code system.

These codes signify the production method, with green hydrogen being produced using clean energy and grey hydrogen relying on fossil fuels.

Understanding hydrogen production methods

The most common method for producing grey hydrogen is steam reforming, which involves extracting hydrogen gas from natural gas.

This process releases considerable amounts of CO₂ as a byproduct. Another method, known as autothermal reforming, uses oxygen and carbon monoxide and also results in carbon emissions.

Blue hydrogen uses these same processes but incorporates carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to trap the CO₂ emissions, preventing them from entering the atmosphere.

Green hydrogen is produced using clean energy sources through a process called electrolysis. In this method, electricity from renewable sources like wind or solar power is used to split water into its constituent elements, hydrogen and oxygen.

Growing demand and strategic industrial applications

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) Global Hydrogen Review 2024, demand for hydrogen has more than tripled since 1975.

The report also notes that demand for low-emissions hydrogen saw a growth of almost 10% in 2023.

This rising demand is set against a backdrop of global climate commitments.

The United Nations states that as of June 2024, 107 countries that account for approximately 82% of greenhouse gas emissions have adopted net zero pledges.

Hydrogen could be key in meeting these targets, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as long-haul transportation, chemicals, iron and steel.

The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) projects that hydrogen could meet 12% of final energy demand by 2050.

A 2020 PwC report further estimates that the global demand for green hydrogen could reach 530 million tonnes by 2050, creating an export market worth an estimated US$300bn annually.

Major industrial players are already investing in hydrogen projects.

TotalEnergies and Air Liquide have partnered with a combined investment of over €1bn to develop large-scale electrolysers for producing low-carbon hydrogen to decarbonise their refineries in Northern Europe.

Emilie Mouren-Renouard, Air Liquide’s Group Vice President for Europe, Africa, Middle-East and India, says: “We are proud to lead the way on European renewable and low-carbon hydrogen production and to accompany TotalEnergies in their journey to decarbonising their industrial assets.

In Germany, BASF and Siemens are collaborating on a green hydrogen project that aims to produce up to a tonne of green hydrogen per hour.

The potential for specific manufacturing sectors is also being recognised. Alex Richards, Vice President & Regional Segment Leader at Schneider Electric, believes green hydrogen could be crucial for the UK's steel industry.

He says: ""Producing DRI [Direct Reduced Iron] using green hydrogen can result in over a 95% reduction in CO₂ emissions compared to steel produced with coal. ""This presents an opportunity to sustain a steel industry with much less environmental impact"".

Overcoming hydrogen's commercialisation hurdles

Despite its potential, hydrogen faces major challenges before it can be widely adopted.

According to the US Department of Energy, liquid hydrogen has a volumetric energy density of 8MJ/L, which is only a quarter of that of gasoline at 32MJ/L.

This means a much larger volume of hydrogen is required to produce the same amount of energy necessitating more sophisticated storage solutions like cryogenic methods or high-pressure tanks.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/8b15a693c1dcd3d5c904bb024bdd4a96:db46027a72a54eef8a7f18e13605528e/im2018040415co-300dpi.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 20:02:15.637803

Total emissions include process emissions, energy emissions and downstream emissions from treated biosolids land application or landfill disposal.
COD is a statistically significant driver only in lagoon systems, for which fugitive CH4 emissions are directly proportional (as reflected in CH4 emissions factors).
The US EPA provides, to the best of our knowledge, the only other national-level inventory of wastewater treatment emissions in the USA.
For landfills, we used the US EPA’s Landfill Gas Emissions Model (LandGEM) to calculate the CH4 emissions factor for municipal solid waste landfills46.","Wastewater treatment is essential for protecting public health and the environment. However, treatment processes generate greenhouse gases (GHGs) while relying on energy and chemicals whose production also contributes to total emissions1. Globally, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated wastewater treatment emissions to be 0.38 Gt of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) in 2019, comparable to key industries targeted for decarbonization, including the chemical (0.37 Gt CO2e), cement (0.82 Gt CO2e) and iron and steel (1.35 Gt CO2e) industries2. Yet, recent studies found that the IPCC and US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) may underestimate methane (CH4) emissions from on-site processes alone by twofold3,4, and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions factors are often oversimplified and/or inaccurate5. This study aims to improve understanding of wastewater GHG emissions, which are critical for meeting global climate targets as this sector grows with increasing population and expansion of essential sanitary services.

On-site emissions at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs, also called water resource recovery facilities) are dependent on wastewater characteristics (for example organics and nitrogen), treatment processes, level of treatment and plant size3,5. N2O emissions span multiple orders of magnitude, but appear correlated with treatment objective5,6. Biogas used for on-site power generation can reduce imported energy, but leaking equipment and treated solids handling emits CH4 (ref. 3). In addition, upstream electricity emissions depend on power requirements of treatment processes and regional grid carbon intensity.

Given this complexity, emissions reduction strategies must consider key plant and geospatial characteristics, energy and material inputs, factors not currently accounted for in national emissions inventories7. Internationally, several studies report national wastewater treatment inventories (Supplementary Table 1), including on-site biogenic CH4 and N2O emissions7,8,9,10. However, they accounted for different emissions components inconsistently. For instance, the US EPA did not include upstream energy emissions7, and only one inventory considered on-site, non-combustion CO2 emissions9. Seiple et al. catalogued US facilities as part of their analyses to quantify the energy potential from wastewater sludge but did not estimate GHG emissions or energy consumption11.

Therefore, we developed an approach to inventory wastewater emissions based on facility location and treatment processes, accounting for on-site, upstream and downstream GHG sources. We estimated on-site emissions from treatment processes, on-site and upstream emissions from producing and using energy for facility operation and chemical production, and downstream emissions from off-site disposal of treated solid waste. We used this approach to generate a national emissions inventory of over 15,000 WWTPs across the contiguous USA. To capture uncertainty associated with various emission sources, we estimated potential emissions ranges using Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, we conducted a global sensitivity analysis to identify key parameters influencing emissions, providing guidance for future data collection and decarbonization efforts. Our approach allows policymakers and engineers to analyse trade-offs inherent to different treatment technologies, better informing interventions for reducing wastewater treatment emissions. This method can be adapted as new measurement studies improve accuracy of emissions estimates and associated emissions factors.

For clarity, the following terminology is used in all text and figures: CH4, N2O and fossil origin CO2 emissions are collectively described as ‘process emissions’ and refer to the gases produced on-site during biological wastewater treatment processes, unless otherwise specified. CH4 and N2O produced from biosolids disposal are distinguished as ‘landfill CH4’ and ‘land application N2O’. Emissions associated with natural gas include those from natural gas combusted on-site for heat (via boiler, dryer and incinerator) and chemical production, as well as upstream emissions from natural gas extraction and distribution. Electricity-related emissions are full fuel cycle, accounting for upstream and power plant emissions.

Total emissions include process emissions, energy emissions and downstream emissions from treated biosolids land application or landfill disposal. We did not include emissions from sewer systems, effluent discharge and facility construction. To facilitate comparison between generic configurations, we calculated emissions intensity (kg CO2e m−3) for each treatment train (Fig. 2c,d) using the national profile for electricity carbon intensity, while calculations elsewhere associated with inventoried facilities use the carbon intensity of the plant’s regional electricity supply (Supplementary Methods section 2.6.1). Highest total emissions are from configurations removing nutrients with membrane bioreactors: *D1e (1.8 [1.2–2.6] kg CO2e m−3) and *D3 (1.5 [0.85–2.4] kg CO2e m−3). Fifty-nine per cent [39–77%] (*D1e) and 71% [45–89%] (*D3) of emissions are from energy consumption, attributable to the electricity requirement of membrane systems and the natural gas needed for acetic acid production. The train with the next-highest carbon intensity is *G1 (1.1 [0.73–1.7] kg CO2e m−3). Here, 60% [40–76%] of emissions are produced through biological treatment (CH4, N2O and CO2) and 37% [22–56%] are from electricity and natural gas use. Across treatment trains, biosolids disposal at most accounts for 12% [4.6–26%] of total emissions (*C4). Finally, by comparing median emission values from identical configurations with and without energy recovery through combined heat and power (CHP), we found that energy recovery reduces total emissions by only 5.2–13%. Understanding whether emissions are driven by treatment processes or electricity requirements will inform decarbonization strategies, particularly as the US electricity generation mix continues to evolve17.

We conducted a sensitivity analysis using Spearman’s rank correlation to identify the following key drivers of emissions (P < 0.05 and an absolute ρ value >0.2) across treatment configurations: wastewater influent chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total nitrogen (TN), emissions factors for CH4 and N2O, electricity requirement and grid carbon intensity (Fig. 3). Across nearly all configurations, emissions are most sensitive to the CH4 emissions factor, even when anaerobic digestion is not present. By contrast, N2O emissions factor and influent TN are primarily, although not exclusively, important for nutrient removal facilities. COD is a statistically significant driver only in lagoon systems, for which fugitive CH4 emissions are directly proportional (as reflected in CH4 emissions factors). These findings underscore the importance of further refining emissions factors and influent wastewater variability through representative measurement campaigns and public datasets.

Nationally, wastewater treatment produces 47 [41–55] MMT CO2e per year (Table 1), based on a national-scale Monte Carlo simulation. CH4 dominates annual emissions (41% [31–54%]), followed by N2O (24% [16–38%]) and electricity (23% [19–27%]). Wider percentile ranges for CH4 and N2O reflect higher uncertainty and greater variability in available emissions data. Electricity emissions show lower uncertainty, reflecting less variation in estimates. While emissions from biosolids remain poorly characterized, our estimate of these emissions is only 1.1 [0.53–2.0] MMT CO2e per year, or 2.2% [1.1–4.3%] of national emissions. Emissions associated with natural gas production, distribution and combustion are similarly low (1.4 [1.2–1.5] MMT CO2e per year).

We estimated emissions from wastewater treatment in the USA are 47 [41–55] MMT CO2e per year, with CH4 and N2O accounting for 66% [51–86%] of emissions. Compared with previous works (Supplementary Table 1), our approach integrates a greater number of emissions sources, including electricity, CO2 (fossil origin) and biosolids disposal, and allows a side-by-side comparison across key emission types. Our estimates of GHG intensity for specific treatment trains range from 0.33 [0.19–0.74] kg CO2e m−3 (*C6) to 1.8 [1.2–2.6] kg CO2e m−3 (*D1e), aligning with models by the US EPA (0.5–1.8 kg CO2e m−3), although the relative contributions of different components differ20. Largely due to a higher number of identified anaerobic digestion facilities, our national estimate of CH4 emission (19 [15–25] MMT CO2e per year) is approximately twice that of Song et al., who estimated 9.7 MMT CO2e per year by drawing on one of the four source datasets used in this study3 (see Methods for additional details). Our nationwide estimate for N2O (12 [7.9–17] MMT CO2e per year) is similar to values reported by Song et al. (11.6 MMT CO2e per year), calculated using the same underlying emissions factor data that we grouped by treatment objective, whereas Song et al. organized by bioreactor type5.

Methane emissions are the largest single contributor to annual emissions in our inventory. We found that 85% [74–92%] (16 [12–21] MMT per year) of CH4 is produced by treatment configurations with anaerobic digestion (code 1 or 2). Anaerobic digestion produces energy on-site in the form of biogas, while reducing the spatial footprint of WWTPs and providing additional opportunities for resource recovery21. However, our results indicate fugitive CH4 emissions currently outweigh climate benefits gained from renewable biogas. On a volumetric basis, energy recovery (code suffix e) reduces the median emissions by only 0.061 kg CO2e m−3 on average. By contrast, the average of median emissions from treatment configurations with anaerobic digesters is 0.34 kg CO2e m−3, or 0.30 kg CO2e m−3 higher than those with aerobic digestion. While our analysis uses data from the USA, these findings have broader global implications as concerns about GHG emissions from similar treatment trains are global. Recent studies in Europe have identified key sources of methane leaks in anaerobic digestion facilities, including non-gas-tight digestate storage22, biomass storage tanks and pressure relief valves23. In addition, minor technical fixes to existing infrastructure have been demonstrated to reduce methane emissions from biogas facilities by up to 46% (ref. 23), highlighting the potential impact of leak detection and repair programmes and the importance of immediately adopting such a programme globally.

We developed N2O emissions factors adapted from those compiled by Song et al. (2024), distinguishing on the basis of treatment objectives (organics removal, nitrification and denitrification)5. However, 79% of the underlying measurement data come from denitrifying systems24. Additional measurements are needed from conventional activated sludge and nitrifying systems. Given the high spatial and temporal variability in N2O emissions from wastewater treatment6, improving the characterization of N2O production is essential. In addition, current N2O mitigation efforts use aeration, feed and process optimization25, which are not captured in existing facility-level data. Understanding current operation strategies and their impact on emissions should be a focus of future research.

The relative importance of electricity generation (23% [19–27%] of total emissions) will decrease with grid decarbonization26. Biosolids disposal through landfilling or land application contribute only a small portion of total emissions (2.2% [1.1–4.3%]), but CH4 and N2O from biosolids are poorly studied. We used IPCC’s emissions factor for managed soils, which has a high uncertainty (0.002–0.018 kg N2O-N per kilogram of nitrogen)27 but aligns with the small number of recent studies where biosolids were used as an agricultural amendment28,29,30. Finally, our model did not account for CH4 produced through different practices for biosolids dewatering and on-site storage, which also contribute to fugitive CH4 emissions31.

The US EPA provides, to the best of our knowledge, the only other national-level inventory of wastewater treatment emissions in the USA. The two inventories differ in that we included electricity-associated emissions to enable a side-by-side comparison of key emissions sources, reflecting the wastewater industry’s historic prioritization of achieving net-zero energy use1. Also differing from the US EPA, we did not include CH4 and N2O effluent discharge emissions because we focused on emissions that can inform decarbonization efforts. Comparing on-site emissions, our N2O estimate (12 [7.9–17] MMT per year) is comparable to the EPA’s value (16.3 MMT per year), although our CH4 emissions estimate (19 [15–25] MMT per year) is threefold greater than their estimate (5.6 MMT per year−1)7. The relative contributions of the two gases also differ, with CH4 contributing 63% [51–73%] (19 [15–25] MMT per year) of combined on-site CH4 and N2O emissions in our inventory but only 26% (5.6 MMT) in the US EPA inventory. This difference is meaningful, as the relative importance of each gas informs potential mitigation measures. CH4 and N2O emissions are produced by different wastewater treatment processes via distinct microbial pathways, which are impacted by local climate (for example, temperature and seasonal changes to operation6,32). In addition, atmospheric lifespan and global warming potential will impact the priority of mitigation strategies for these two gases.

There are several limitations to this work. Our analysis relies on data reported through the US EPA’s Clean Watersheds Needs Surveys (CWNS), which did not require reporting unit process data in the most recent 2022 survey. As a result, 75% of our inventory relies on unit process data from 2012, although we used supplemental datasets and manual verification to update the data where possible (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Methods section 2.2.2). Furthermore, our results indicate a strong linear relationship between cumulative national flow rate and emissions (Fig. 5b). However, most recent national flow data from the CWNS do not distinguish between observed and design flow at facilities, meaning we probably overestimated the volume of wastewater treated. In addition, we used uniform influent concentrations for all facilities and did not account for variations in effluent requirements based on local regulations. Given their importance in estimating GHG emissions, future CWNS surveys should require data reporting on treatment processes; biogas production and utilization; observed flow; and influent and effluent water quality.

There are also several opportunities for further refining in future inventories, particularly with expanded data collection. We made the simplifying assumption that, within a particular treatment plant configuration, energy consumption is directly proportional to flow rate, despite the potential for increased efficiency at larger sizes33. In addition, the energy requirements for lagoons may not reflect current designs and operation34. Future inventories and resulting mitigation efforts will also benefit from improved CH4 and N2O emissions factors, which will require direct measurement studies across a range of representative facilities, climates and time periods. Moreover, for lagoons, we used current IPCC assumptions that aerobic lagoons do not produce CH4 and that anaerobic and facultative lagoons do not produce N2O. However, given the lack of fully uniform mixing, and the many connections between CH4 and nitrogen microbial metabolism35, it is likely that both gases are produced across all lagoon categories.

Our analysis considered only climate impact, but facility-level decision-making requires a more comprehensive environmental assessment. For example, trickling filter configurations are among those with the lowest total emissions. However, they have large spatial footprints and need adequate hydraulic head differences across the plant to limit pumping requirements. In addition, because anaerobic digesters are the largest source of on-site emissions, facilities using incineration (codes 5 and 6) compare favourably because they have lower on-site emissions. However, incineration requires adequate pollution control measures to prevent release of particulates, heavy metals and volatile organic compounds, considerations that we did not capture.

Wastewater treatment is a growing sector inextricably linked to public and environmental health, and understanding its current climate change impact is critical for decarbonization efforts. This analysis provides a comprehensive inventory of over 15,000 WWTPs across the contiguous USA, including treatment configuration, energy requirements and emissions estimates. Although confined to the USA, a similar approach can be adopted elsewhere. In less data-rich contexts, the archetypical treatment configurations reported here can be selected on the basis of best fit with available information, or serve as a guide for future data collection. In the USA, we identify on-site emissions of CH4 and N2O as priorities for climate change mitigation efforts, expanding the historical focus of the wastewater sector beyond energy-associated emissions. In addition, data generated from this work can be used to determine the impact of specific policy levers on overall emissions, and to analyse the effects of adopting novel resource recovery and emissions reduction technologies.

Facilities inventory development

We integrated multiple national datasets to compile an inventory of wastewater treatment facilities in the USA, their energy requirements and GHG emissions (Fig. 6). Our inventory consists of 15,863 WWTPs that reported non-zero flow to the US EPA in 202215. Throughout this Article, WWTPs refer to facilities owned and/or operated by municipalities or other public entities, including treatment plants and lagoons. We determined the treatment train for each facility in our inventory, defined as a common set of unit operations designed to reduce wastewater pollution between the influent and effluent of the plant. We used unit processes reported across the aggregated 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2022 CWNS12,13,14,15, supplemented with additional publicly available data that provided more granular or recent information: the US EPA’s Lagoon Inventory Dataset36, the Water Environment Federation’s Water Resource Recovery Facilities Biogas Database37 and the US Department of Energy’s Combined Heat and Power Installation Database38.

Using reported unit process data, we assigned each facility one or more treatment trains, abbreviated using alphanumeric codes, based on those previously defined by Tarallo et al.16 but with modifications to reflect additional possible combinations of liquids and solids treatment processes (full details are provided in Supplementary Methods section 2.2.2) Each treatment train is a unique combination of unit processes depicted in Fig. 1, and each configuration includes liquids and solids treatment processes, with optional primary treatment, chemical phosphorous removal and CHP for energy recovery. Liquids (or secondary) treatment technologies include activated sludge configurations, trickling filters and membrane bioreactors. Solids treatment options include aerobic and anaerobic digestion, lime stabilization and two incineration methods (see Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 for additional details). With available unit process data, we assigned treatment trains to 10,962 facilities, approximately 69% of the national fleet.

Where unit process data were incomplete or unavailable, we assigned treatment trains on the basis of facilities of a similar size and geographic location. For the 1,991 facilities with only partial unit process data available (that is, plants that provide information on secondary treatment or solids management but not both), we assigned treatment trains on the basis of the most common treatment train of similar plant size in the same EPA region, considering key unit processes present (activated sludge, biological nutrient removal, aerobic/anaerobic digesters, lime stabilization, incineration and trickling filters). For the remaining facilities with either insufficient partial data or fully absent data (2,910 facilities), we assigned a treatment train on the basis of the most common treatment train of similar plant size in the same EPA region. Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 7 provide a size breakdown and additional details on facilities with missing data.

Facility-level emissions associated with energy

For all treatment trains in the national inventory, we calculated electricity and natural gas consumption, as well as on-site electricity generation from biogas utilization. We used energy calculations from the results of process models in GPS-X reported by Tarallo et al.16. Because our study includes treatment trains beyond those reported by Tarallo et al., we used mass and heat balances for unit processes to determine energy requirements for treatment trains that were not modelled previously16 (details in Supplementary Methods section 2.3.1).

To estimate the GHG emissions associated with electricity consumption, we assigned each facility a regional emissions factor (kg CO2e kWh−1). Specifically, we used existing model results that simulate the energy mix across 134 simulated subregions of the USA, reflecting state-level and utility boundaries and capturing the existing variation to maintain load–interchange–generation balance39. We calculated electricity emissions factor (kg CO2e kWh−1) for each geographic region using the corresponding total emissions (kg CO2e) divided by the net power generated, as reported in National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Standard Scenarios Cambium data for 202017,40. We used data from the mid-case scenario based on central parameter values, including future electricity consumption, fuel costs and technology selection. We also calculated full fuel cycle GHG emissions for electricity and natural gas using the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies (GREET) model41 (Supplementary Table 18).

Carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide

We estimated total CO2, CH4 and N2O from biological treatment processes, referred to here as ‘process emissions’ for brevity. For CO2, we assumed a baseline of 11.9% of influent carbon is of fossil origin, and 53.5% of influent COD (508 mg l−1) is released as CO2 during biological treatment42. To determine CH4 production, we used emissions factors based on the presence of key unit processes, and for N2O production we used emissions factors based on treatment targets. Namely, anaerobic processes (anaerobic digestors and lagoons) emit CH4, and nutrient removal processes emit N2O. For CH4, we used data reported by Song et al. (2023) to assign emissions on the basis of whether a facility contains an anaerobic digester3. For facilities with anaerobic or facultative lagoons, we used emissions factors reported by the IPCC43. For N2O, we developed emissions factors using data compiled by Song et al. (2024) to determine the median value of literature-reported values categorized by treatment objective: organics removal, nitrification or full denitrification5 (Supplementary Table 20). N2O emissions factors are a function of influent TN, and we assumed a range typical of domestic wastewater (23–69 mg l−1)44. As with CH4, we used N2O emissions factors reported by the IPCC for aerobic, anaerobic and facultative lagoons43. For uncategorized lagoons, we calculated both CH4 and N2O emissions factors using a flow-weighted average of the three other types of lagoon in the contiguous USA. For specific emissions factors and additional details, see Supplementary Methods section 2.4.

Biosolids-associated emissions

To estimate biosolids production, we combined reported production rates, where data were available, with mass flow calculations where data were unavailable. For 2,124 facilities, we used the US EPA’s Biosolids Biennial Report for 2020–202145, which documents the volume of biosolids produced, and their ultimate disposal through incineration, landfilling or land application. For the remaining facilities, we calculated sludge production based on facility flow rate, as developed elsewhere11 and described in Supplementary Methods section 2.5.1. For land applied biosolids, we used the IPCC N2O emissions factor for organic soil amendments27. For landfills, we used the US EPA’s Landfill Gas Emissions Model (LandGEM) to calculate the CH4 emissions factor for municipal solid waste landfills46. Full details are included in Supplementary Methods section 2.5.2.

Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses

For all treatment trains, we conducted Monte Carlo simulations (N = 10,000) for 19 input parameters subject to uncertainty. We selected all uncertainty ranges and distributions (Supplementary Table 24) using the tiered selection criteria previously developed47,48, with minor modifications described in Supplementary Methods section 2.6. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the relative impact of all input parameters on total per-volume GHG emissions for each treatment train, using Spearman’s rank order correlation coefficients. In this analysis, we defined key drivers of uncertainty as those with a P value <0.05 and an absolute ρ value >0.2.

For national-level results, we also evaluated uncertainty around two additional inputs: local electricity carbon intensity and facility biosolids production. We determined baseline facility-specific carbon intensity using 134 geographic regions reported in NREL Standard Scenarios Cambium data for 202017,40 and determined emissions factors for each electricity production pathway using the GREET model41. For local electricity carbon intensity, we assumed a uniform distribution with 80% and 120% of the baseline value as the lower and upper bound, respectively. For biosolids, we calculated the baseline facility-level mass flow rate and determined disposal pathways as described above and in Supplementary Methods section 2.5. Next, we used facility-level data to calculate the national total biosolids mass flow to landfills and land application. For our uncertainty analysis, we assumed a uniform distribution with 80% and 120% of the national total biosolids mass flow rate as the lower and upper bounds, respectively. Full details are provided in Supplementary Methods sections 2.5 and 2.6.

Due to the large number of facilities included in this study, we report only median values for all facility-level results (Figs. 4 and 5 and Supplementary Dataset C). Specifically, for each WWTP, we used median emissions factors to estimate emissions from individual processes (for example, biological CH4 emissions and upstream electricity emissions) and summed across all processes at a given facility to determine total emissions.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs44221-025-00485-w/MediaObjects/44221_2025_485_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-10-08 22:59:17.409960

It’s boom time in the U.S. oil patch, but storm clouds are gathering.

In West Texas, the beating heart of the U.S. oilfield, the telltale signs of prosperity abound: Long lines at the gas station, trailer parks packed with roughnecks and roustabouts, and a healthy business for repair shops as windshields fall victim to gravel kicked up by oil trucks. (I can’t tell you, dear reader, how many windshields I cracked while reporting on the Powder River Basin’s oil boom in the early 2010s.)

Data released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration confirms what my colleague Shelby Webb observed during her recent reporting trip to the Permian Basin: The U.S. produced a record 13.6 million barrels of oil a day in July.

And yet, despite the big numbers, many oil producers are in a dour mood. BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil have all announced plans to lay off workers or have already done so, Shelby writes in a follow-up story today.

The belt-tightening is a reflection of the global oil markets. Yes, production is up, but demand is stagnant and storage tanks around the world are starting to fill up. An analyst at the Macquarie Group last week called the world’s oil market “cartoonishly” oversupplied. And that was before the EIA reported Wednesday that U.S. commercial crude stocks increased by 3.7 million barrels last week, eclipsing the 700,000 barrels predicted by analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.

Add it all up and what you get are predictions of an oil price collapse. The EIA thinks Brent crude, the global price benchmark, will average $52 a barrel next year. That’s down from $81 a barrel last year and around $66 today.

History suggests that U.S. producers will be the quickest to cut production in the face of low prices, leaving their competitors in Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations with a larger slice of the world’s oil-producing pie, said Rory Johnston, an oil analyst who writes the newsletter Commodity Context.

Yet so far there is little sign of U.S. production relenting. OPEC, meanwhile, reiterated a pledge to slightly raise oil production Sunday.

“There is a lot of question in the market of: ‘Is this growth sustainable?’” Johnston told me.

U.S. shale producers are better equipped to handle a bust in prices than they once were, said Kevin Book, managing director at ClearView Energy Partners.

Improvements in drilling technology means oil companies can produce more oil with fewer people. A round of oilfield mergers, such as Chevron’s $55 billion acquisition of Hess, has also resulted in companies focusing on developing only their most profitable assets.

Even so, most analysts think someone is going to have cut production to bring the world’s oil market into balance. The big question is whether that will be U.S. shale producers or OPEC, said Bob McNally, the president and founder of Rapidan Energy Group. “If OPEC+ doesn’t cut, we’ll go lower and it will have to be shale that cuts.”

How low oil goes has big political implications for President Donald Trump, McNally said. Consumers tend to reward presidents for low gasoline prices, especially if they dip below $3 a gallon. But there are dangers for Trump, too, McNally said.

A handful of American oil producers have already criticized Trump’s handling of the economy in the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’ quarterly energy survey — and that’s with the U.S. benchmark price, West Texas Intermediate, hovering in the low $60s. That could morph into full-fledged unrest if prices nosedive below $45 a barrel next year, McNally said.

Somebody might want to keep a running tally of broken windshields in West Texas.

Wright’s misleading talking points

Energy Secretary Chris Wright often hits on familiar themes laden with data when he barnstorms the globe to talk up the administration’s agenda, Brian Dabbs and Christa Marshall write.

But some of the data is misleading or doesn’t take fossil fuels into account.

For example, Wright has said that renewables provided 2.6 percent of global energy last year. While that’s largely accurate — “energy” includes transportation, which oil dominates — wind and solar provided roughly 17 percent of U.S. electricity last year. And electricity is projected to constitute a growing share of U.S. energy because of factors like the rise of electric vehicles, according to data analysis firm Ember.

Wright has also pointed to local protests of wind farms, but polling shows oil and gas projects might be even less popular.

“The public’s continued general preference for developing alternative energy may help explain its tepid support for fracking and offshore drilling,” the polling group Gallup said in April.

U.S. government gets into the mining business

The federal government now partially owns three critical mining companies, marking what experts say is a “new phase” in how the U.S. approaches industrial policy, writes Hannah Northey.

Most recently, the Department of Defense took a 10 percent equity stake in Trilogy Metals, a Vancouver-based company that has mining claims in an isolated part of northwestern Alaska. DOD is also the biggest stakeholder in MP Materials, which operates the nation’s only rare earths mine in California. And the Department of Energy has a 5 percent equity stake in Lithium Americas, a Canadian company that’s developing a lithium mine in Nevada.

The moves are a departure from the U.S. government’s traditional use of grants, loans and tax incentives to stimulate private investment while maintaining distance from ownership, said Stephen Empedocles, CEO at the advisory firm Clark Street Associates.

“This model signals a change in U.S. industrial policy — one that treats the federal government less as a grantmaker and more as a strategic investor,” said Empedocles. “It sets a precedent for similar approaches in semiconductors and other critical supply chains.”

Trump’s cancer answer: AI, not regulations

Trump wants to cure childhood cancer with artificial intelligence, while powering that technology with energy that creates cancer-causing pollution, writes Ariel Wittenberg.

The president signed an executive order last week that increases funding for efforts to use AI for cancer research. It’s part of the administration’s support for the booming technology — and for fossil fuels, which Trump asserts is needed to power AI data centers.

But the Trump administration is also rolling back regulations on the energy industry designed to prevent people from getting cancer in the first place. For example, the administration is delaying rules to limit cancer-causing bromide released in the wastewater of coal plants.

“AI can be an amazing tool for earlier diagnosis and finding cures, but the way they are doing it, the pollution is going to become a huge problem causing more cases over time,” said Katie Huffling, executive director of the Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments.

Asked during a briefing how the administration was balancing the goal of reducing childhood cancer with its rollback of environmental rules, a senior White House official said, “We are going to talk about the executive order today.”

The city is considering a $5.5 million pilot program to probe the use of cool pavement in areas with hot streets that would protect New Yorkers from sizzling asphalt during the summer months.

Such cool pavement — designed to stay cooler than traditional asphalt — reflects sunlight by using lighter colored-materials, coatings or grass, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

The bill, sponsored by Brooklyn councilwoman Sandy Nurse, mandates the two-year pilot to include at least one neighborhood in each borough that has “high summer surface temperatures and low median income” by September 2026.

The city council’s transportation committee is set to consider the proposal during a Thursday hearing.

The cost of cool pavement sealant is about 60 cents more per square yard compared to traditional sealants, per the American Society of Civil Engineers, but the local pol argues the tactic is overrun with benefits.

“Cool pavement offers additional benefits, including decreased stormwater runoff, improved water quality, enhance street safety and better night time visibility depending on the treatment,” Nurse told PIX 11, adding that traditional asphalt absorbs heat and can make the city feel up to eight degrees warmer.

“Moreover, cool pavement treatments could also improve commercial activity where you are able to achieve the cool corridor effect,” she said.

The pilot would be a multi-agency initiative between the Department of Transportation, Department of Health, Department of Environmental Protection and Office of Long-term Planning and Sustainability.

BROWNSVILLE, Texas – At the southernmost point of Texas, where the Rio Grande meets the Gulf, the Port of Brownsville is driving a new era of growth and opportunity. Vessels, trains, and trucks traverse the port’s industrial landscape, signaling more than just cargo in motion. This is the economic engine driving the Rio Grande Valley’s economy.

As the only deepwater seaport located on the U.S.-Mexico border, the Port of Brownsville has become a gateway for trade, a magnet for investment, and a catalyst for opportunity across South Texas. Currently, more than $20 billion in projects are in the pipeline, promising to further transform the economic landscape of South Texas.

The port’s long-term vision is guided by the Brownsville Navigation District Board of Commissioners. This five-member elected body oversees policy, planning, and major investment decisions. The current board includes Chairman Esteban Guerra, Vice Chairman Sergio Tito Lopez, Secretary John Reed, and Assistant Secretaries John Wood and Ernesto Gutierrez. Together, their leadership reflects a strong commitment to economic growth, public trust, and regional impact.

The Port of Brownsville continues to play a central role in the success of the region. According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the port climbed to No. 41 among the nation’s 150 maritime ports for waterborne cargo, its highest ranking to date. In 2023, the port moved 11.2 million tons of waterborne cargo, up from 9.1 million tons in 2022.

That momentum carried throughout 2024, with total cargo reaching 28 million tons marking a 57 percent increase from 2023. Operating revenue at the port in 2024 surpassed $30 million for the fourth consecutive year, reaching $43.3 million.

This growth represents more than statistics. It means jobs for families, new business, and broader momentum across South Texas. Every ton of cargo supports a ripple effect that fuels the local economy.

Contributing to the port’s success are consistent investments in infrastructure. A centerpiece of that effort is the Brazos Island Harbor Channel Improvement Project, which will deepen the 17-mile-long ship channel from 42 feet to 52 feet. The increased depth will allow larger vessels to enter more safely, reduce wait times, and improve overall efficiency.

The project is divided into two phases. It’s backed by a Public-Private Partnership involving the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Port of Brownsville, and energy company NextDecade. In 2019, NextDecade committed to funding Phase 1, a $400 million investment, which includes deepening the channel near its Rio Grande LNG site and building two ship berths and a turning basin. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Company received the contract from NextDecade for work on Phase 1. Phase 2, led by the port and the Corps, is supported by $68 million in federal funding through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. In 2024, a $104 million contract was awarded to Callan Marine Ltd. The estimated completion date of the project is late 2026.

Infrastructure improvements on the port’s land are moving just as quickly. The port has expanded laydown yards, modernized roadways, and improved berths to handle high-volume cargo, including wind energy components. These updates are essential for maintaining the port’s competitiveness in a changing global market.

The Port of Brownsville continues to attract some of the largest private investments in the energy sector. Projects like Rio Grande LNG and Texas LNG are shaping the future of U.S. energy exports. Together, they are expected to create thousands of jobs and generate significant long-term economic benefits for the Rio Grande Valley.

Rio Grande LNG, built by Bechtel Energy Inc., is a natural gas liquefaction and export facility with up to 48 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of potential capacity, making it one of the world’s largest LNG projects in development. Trains 1 through 4, representing about 24 MTPA and $25 billion in investment, are under construction and scheduled to begin operations between 2027 and 2030, supported by customers such as ADNOC, Aramco, Shell, ExxonMobil, and TotalEnergies. Train 5, with commercial agreements secured from Jera, EQT, and ConocoPhillips, is advancing toward a positive Final Investment Decision, while Trains 6 through 8 are in early development and permitting.

Texas LNG, a project of Glenfarne Energy Transition, is a planned 4 MTPA export terminal at the Port of Brownsville designed to be one of the lowest-emission LNG facilities in the world. It has secured offtake agreements with companies including EQT Corporation, Gunvor Group, Macquarie, and a major European utility. Texas LNG recently cleared a key regulatory milestone with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement and is targeting a Final Investment Decision by the end of 2025. Kiewit Corporation has been selected as the engineering, procurement, and construction contractor, with the project expected to be completed by 2029.

The port is also prioritizing sustainability. From habitat restoration projects to native species conservation, it is working to ensure that economic development goes hand-in-hand with environmental responsibility. These efforts help maintain a balance between progress and preservation.

The port’s location and multimodal access position as a unique link between global trade and emerging industries. It plays a growing role in renewable energy logistics, particularly in the transport of oversized equipment like wind turbines. It’s also supporting the commercial space industry. Just a short distance from SpaceX’s Starbase launch site, the port offers specialized logistics that support space innovation and advanced manufacturing.

With competitive costs, unmatched logistics, available land, and a growing labor force, the Port Brownsville is one of the most attractive locations in the country for nearshoring and industrial investment.

The new Model 3 Standard and Model Y Standard are on sale now and should start hitting the streets soon.","After years of hinting at truly affordable models, Tesla announced new “Standard” versions of the Model 3 and Model Y this week. The recipe for both is simple: take the existing models, strip out a bunch of features and sell them at a lower price. Given that the automaker is facing the end of EV tax credits and leasing incentives and the arrival of an armada of new competitors, such models make sense on the surface. The vehicles, however, still start at $38,630 and $41,630, respectively, including destination fees, putting them in direct competition with newer alternatives.

KEY TAKEAWAYS

Tesla’s new “Standard” Model 3 and Model Y are stripped-down base model versions of aging cars

Long-promised new $30,000 Tesla still vaporware, cheapest Model 3 starts at $38,630

Already basic inside, these new models don’t even have an AM/FM radio

Longtime Tesla observers will note that these two “Standards” are still nothing like the $30,000, clean-sheet design budget Tesla that CEO Elon Musk has been promising for at least half a decade.

As recently as the firm’s January earnings call, Musk personally confirmed that a new, next-generation small crossover would “start production towards the end of 2025.” Such a model is arguably more important to Tesla’s competitiveness in China than in the U.S., but the Model Y Standard definitely isn’t going to fill that gap. Nor is it likely to win over consumers alienated by the CEO’s political adventures.

That said, there will be people shopping for these two vehicles, so it’s worth taking a look at just how they stack up in this rapidly changing marketplace.

Both the Model 3 and the Model Y have had major refreshes in the last 18 months that smoothed out their harsh rides and spiffed up their bare-bones interiors, but they are now eight- and five-year-old designs, respectively, under the skin.

The changes on the Standard models remove a bunch of the things that made the updates compelling, and they make them resemble long-ago stripper models like Dodge Omni America or Chevrolet Chevette Scooter, which removed the back seat (and lots of other things) to reduce sticker shock in the stagflationary 1970s. They’re built to meet a price point and seem likely to feel that way.

Here’s what’s on offer, or rather, what isn’t.

Tesla Model 3 & Model Y: New Standards

Both the Model 3 Standard and Model Y Standard will be single-motor, rear-wheel drive designs. That’s no bad thing, as the rear-drive versions of these vehicles handle a little better than the all-wheel drive ones, and they’ll still be relatively quick. Tesla says the Model 3 standard will do 0-60 mph in 5.8 seconds and the Model Y in 6.8. That's not rocket ship stuff, but more than okay for most drivers, and quicker than most similarly sized gas vehicles.

They’ll also have a very competitive maximum range of 321 miles and the usual quick and easy access to Tesla Superchargers, but charging speed will be limited to 225 kW (which is still really fast!).

2026 Tesla Model 3 Standard

A variety of features have been cut from both designs, particularly on the interior. The ambient lighting, rear passenger screen, leather seats, HEPA filter, ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, sound-insulating double-paned acoustic glass and power-adjustable steering column are gone, as is AM/FM radio functionality.

Advertisement

That’s right, there’s no terrestrial radio (and no antenna), and there are only seven speakers instead of fifteen. The giant 15.4-inch screen remains, with its busy interface and complete lack of physical controls, though Tesla’s site does note that a “Turn signal stalk comes standard.” The consoles have been redesigned to make them simpler, and the power front seats lose their physical controls, so you can only use the screen to adjust them.

Both models keep their glass panoramic roofs, but here’s where the differences get really weird. The Model 3’s roof is just like any other 3, but Tesla’s engineers designed a sound-deadening headliner to cover over the one on the Model Y. They’ve kept the glass roof for manufacturing efficiencies; they just covered it over.

Advertisement

A couple of improvements on the cheaper models, however, are the manual rear vents, which are much more easily adjusted manually than through the touch screen and the manually adjustable steering wheel, which also eliminates an overly cumbersome process.

Advertisement

The Model Y also loses the refreshed design’s Cybertruck-inspired light bar. The whole front end gets a new and simpler fascia that resembles the kind of basic de-chroming and de-ornamenting that car companies used to differentiate base models in the 1950s. It’s just big and plain, and the adaptive high beams are gone too. Both Standard models get jet black 18-inch wheels, which look pretty small on the Model Y.

2026 Tesla Model Y

The new Model Y standard will also use the passive shock absorbers of earlier Model Ys, rather than the new (and massively improved) suspension pieces from the refreshed model that debuted a few months ago.

Tesla has also made changes to its suite of driver assistance gear. Autosteer, the lane-centering function for it adaptive cruise control systems, is deleted unless you opt for the optional, $8,000 “Full-Self Driving (Supervised)” setup, which would seem to negate the purpose of buying one of these cheaper models. Notably, despite the misleading name, it’s not a Level 3 autonomous system or “self-driving” in actuality.

How do these “Standard” Teslas stack up?

When the Model 3 was new in 2017, there really weren’t any other vehicles that could match it, and the Model Y was almost the same way in 2020, undercutting then-current EVs like the Jaguar I-Pace on price and practicality. But that was then and this is now, and today there are a host of alternatives that provide nicer interiors and experiences for the same price or less, and many have competitive range and performance.

The Chevrolet Equinox EV now starts at $34,995, including destination, and offers 319 miles of range, easier controls, bigger screens, similar safety features and a much nicer cabin. The freshly redesigned Nissan Leaf doesn’t have as much passenger space, but it does have over 300 miles of range, similar safety and connectivity features, another far nicer cabin and a price tag $8,000 lower than the Model 3 Standard. Then there’s the Hyundai Ioniq 5 SE rear-drive, which is pricier than these new Standard models, but comes with a big rebate and is materially nicer in lots of ways.

Congress’ acquiescence in cancelling the EV tax incentives has upended the electric market, but that affects Tesla as much as these competitors. Even so, there are still more affordable EVs that will come online in the near future, like the revived Chevrolet Bolt and the upcoming Kia EV3 and EV4.

It’s hard to see these stripped-down Model 3 and Model Y variants as a step towards the future rather than an attempt to eke out a little more mileage from old designs. Rideshare drivers might like them, as they still have very low operating and maintenance costs, but if you’re spending almost $42,000 off the lot, it seems like there are better, newer alternatives, as well as better-equipped pre-owned Teslas.

The new Model 3 Standard and Model Y Standard are on sale now and should start hitting the streets soon. The Model Y’s stripped-down visage, at least, will be easy to recognize.",https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/c8e3a11/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F5a%2F2d%2F8cc8bb964e0a8d4eff7ecfedee2a%2F2026-tesla-model-y-standard-a1.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 19:00:18.731261

October 7, 2025

The Michigan budget bills on Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s desk rein in many cuts to Michigan environmental programs that were included in a budget proposal passed by Michigan's Republican-controlled House in late August.

The previous House budget would have cut $200 million, or roughly 19% of the funding, from Michigan's Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, while the present budget proposal reduces the agency's funding by $71 million, or 7%, according to a House Fiscal Agency analysis.

The budget adds roughly $1.1 billion in annual road and bridge funding, with a small increase in education spending.

A stopgap funding measure was passed last week to allow the government to avoid a shutdown until Wednesday.

""What we have (includes) a lot of really important priorities and stayed a lot of cuts,"" state Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) told Planet Detroit.

Public transit, Michigan hospitals, and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources may benefit from funding included in the budget, which also removed language to weaken PFAS rules and limit the attorney general's ability to pursue litigation against oil and gas companies.

The budget totals roughly $81 billion when about $5 billion in Medicaid provider tax revenue is included. This is a step down from last year's $82.5 billion budget, but larger than the $78.5 billion proposal from House Republicans.

Michigan legislators passed the budget bills late Thursday and early Friday, with the Michigan Senate voting 31-5 on the general omnibus budget and the House voting 101-8. The Senate approved the education omnibus budget with a 31-5 vote, while the House voted 104-5.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is under pressure to reach a deal, state Sen. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) said during budget negotiations in September.

Former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm is widely viewed as responsible for the state's last government shutdown in 2009, Irwin said, although he argues then-Senate Majority Leader Mike Bishop (R-Rochester) was largely responsible.

""People see the governor as being in charge, even though, in reality, the governor does have to work with the legislature,"" Irwin said.

In a Friday statement, Whitmer said the budget represents a “big win for Michiganders” and is balanced and bipartisan, although she has not yet signed the legislation at the time of writing.

Michigan budget avoids major environmental job cuts

Cuts at EGLE should have minimal impacts on operations and staffing, agency spokesperson Dale George told Planet Detroit in a Friday statement.

The House budget would have cut 250 full-time EGLE employees, 116 of whom work on water quality programs in the water resources division, according to the Michigan House Fiscal Agency analysis.

Irwin said Monday that cuts to EGLE would likely only affect 15 unfilled positions, although he would prefer to see staffing levels at the agency increased.

The budget cuts funding for drinking water affordability in the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services budget from $10 million to $5 million.

Language that would have barred EGLE’s Water Resources Division from spending funds until the department adopts weaker federal drinking water standards for toxic PFAS chemicals was removed from the budget.

A provision to limit Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s ability to join other states in lawsuits or sue the federal government or oil and gas companies was also cut.

Nessel is suing the Trump administration over its energy emergency order, which would fast-track fossil fuel projects, and 3M, Dupont, and other companies for PFAS pollution damages.

Legislators struck a proposed $50 million earmark for the Copperwood Mine in the Upper Peninsula from the budget, a project that environmental groups and Indigenous nations have opposed, in part because of its proximity to Lake Superior and Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park.

Irwin said this was a ""particularly foolish thing to subsidize"" because development incentives are normally used to attract businesses that could go to other states.

""The mine can't relocate to Alabama,"" he said. ""The mine has to be where the copper is.""

Michigan budget includes support for health care, parks, transportation

The budget contains some good news for park and public transportation users, with funding increases for some programming, as well as health care funding that could be critical for hospitals.

The Michigan Health & Hospital Association said in a statement that the full funding of Medicaid would help patients maintain health care access, especially in rural and underserved areas.

The Michigan Department of Natural Resources, which manages Belle Isle and other state parks, will see an $8.6 million, or 1.6%, funding increase, including modest bumps to capital funding and staffing.

Officials in charge of managing Belle Isle said last month that cuts to the DNR in the proposed House budget would seriously impact policing and upkeep of the island park.

The Michigan Public Transit Association praised the budget, which it said would provide increased funding for local bus systems and $65 million for projects to build, expand, and enhance public transportation.

Environmental groups expressed support for the budget's inclusion of $129 million for communities hosting wind, solar, and battery storage, but Evergreen Action and the Michigan Energy Innovation Business Council criticized a fee hike for electric and hybrid vehicle owners.

Irwin said this is a bad policy that adds an extra fee for EV and hybrid drivers who already pay to cover the cost of what they would have paid in gas tax on an internal combustion vehicle.

One curious aspect of this year's proposed budget: the state revolving fund for water infrastructure and many other items were moved to one-time funding.

Irwin said this stems from a Republican effort to force departments to spend small surpluses they had built up, which could create funding issues in 2026.

""It means that there's going to be a big budget problem next year.""

Hello, my name is Haley Schulz. I am a Community Organizer with Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization that champions the public interest. I am firmly opposing the EPA’s proposal to repeal and delay the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program requirements.

Not only has the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program been a primary pillar in data transparency for the public, but it has benefited industry and communities, alike. While providing essential emission data, companies can be proactive and monitor emissions, providing cost avoidance by being proactive rather than reactive. Communities I work with rely on many monitoring tools, like FLIGHT, to actively check industry polluters and use that data to protect their community, as well as hold polluters in-check in congruence with state and federal regulators, like the EPA. The public already lost EJ Screen. Pulling further resources with transparent data that benefits both industry and the public is reckless.

As the EPA, you are beholden to the public first. The claim that the GHGRP “has no material impact on improving human health and the environment” is a baseless statement. Decades worth of robust data and facts have proven what the public at-large AND the EPA have recognized and known for years – greenhouse gas emissions are harmful not only to our environment and way of life, but to human health. Unchecked emissions will only lead to a higher cost of mortality and negatively impact our society as we know it.

I live in Houston, Texas, where we are one of the most polluted cities in the country. Our petrochemical and fossil fuel buildout is significantly higher than most cities and we are home to the largest coal plant in the state. Without a program that tracks and reports GHG emissions, the public will be left in the dark without knowing what is in their air. For communities with climate action plans or companies with sustainability reports, they all rely on access to this data. While companies self-report emission data, the public shares their lived experiences and research, and the regulators enforce protective regulations. By removing or delaying the reporting of GHG emission data, we are eliminating visibility and taking out an essential pillar of checks and balances.

To cut the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program will not save $2.4 billion, it will cost Americans with their lives. Neither this program nor holding polluters accountable drive up the cost of living – it is a part of business to either reduce emissions to protect Americans or pay the fine. Until GHG emissions are essentially halted, or counties reach attainment status for ozone, there will still be a need to monitor, report, and make the data accessible for GHG emissions.

Without transparency, there can be no accountability. And without accountability, like what this program provides, the public is at the mercy of the offenders. Greenhouse gas emissions will not disappear if reporting is taken away, so by delaying actions taken thanks to this reported data, we are only making pollution control and environmental justice more expensive and difficult to handle in the years to come. Do not remove or delay the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program requirements and let’s strengthen public confidence in the agency created to protect our environment. Thank you for your time and consideration of my comments.",https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/public_citizen_shared_link.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 19:00:53.886968

Appalachian Power submitted its plan for the next 10 years to state regulators, and changes could be coming to its coal plants.

Appalachian Power filed its integrated resource plan last week with the West Virginia Public Service Commission.

The company mapped out six scenarios for its Mountaineer, Mitchell and Amos plants.

Only Mountaineer would stay in operation through 2035 in all scenarios, and it may be converted from coal to 100% natural gas.

In some scenarios, Amos would retire completely by 2035 or be partially converted to gas.

The Mitchell plant also would partially retire or partially convert from coal to gas.

The scenarios contemplate a delay in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency power plant rules that are currently under review by the Trump administration.

Karen Wissing, a spokeswoman for Appalachian Power, says if those rules are delayed, “maintaining coal operations at all three plants would be the most cost-effective option for our customers.”

“However,” she added, “if the EPA rules are not modified from their current form, conversion to natural gas generation would become a more cost-effective option.”

The company’s plan also outlines scenarios for both high economic growth or low economic growth.

A low-growth scenario would lead to the retirement of all coal generation by 2032.

The planning document outlined options for replacing the plants with wind, solar and combined-cycle natural gas.

The Amos and Mountaineer plants provide power to Appalachian Power customers in southwest Virginia.

Virginia’s Clean Economy Act sets targets for emissions reductions in electricity generation, something West Virginia lacks.

Of the three plants, Mountaineer had the highest capacity factor this year through July of 64%.

Amos had a capacity factor of 34% and Mitchell 25%. The average in the PJM region is about 40%. The West Virginia PSC and the legislature would prefer the plants operate closer to 69%.

An expert witness testified to the PSC over the summer that the three plants lost $81 million in the 12 months ending in February. The company has said it burned coal at a loss to manage an excess supply at the plants for worker safety.

It also has said that breaking coal contracts would have cost electricity customers more.",https://wvpublic.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_3490-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-09 01:59:10.962696

State AGs Focus on Consumer Fraud in the Electronic Payment and Robocalls Spaces

State AGs Continue to Target Auto-Renewing Subscriptions

State AGs Target Healthcare Fraud Through False Claims Settlements

State AGs Focus on Environmental Reporting and Climate-Related Conduct

1. State AGs Press AI Companies on Deepfake Risks and Child Safety

On August 22, 2025, all State AGs—except those from Alabama, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Montana, and Texas—sent a letter to major search engines calling on them to strengthen measures against the spread of “deepfake pornography.”[1] The State AGs pointed to existing safeguards that redirect potentially dangerous searches—such as queries about building explosives or self-harm—toward safer resources and recommended similar guardrails for terms like “deepfake porn,” “nudify apps,” and “undress apps.” On the same day, all State AGs—except those from Alabama, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Montana, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming—sent a similar letter to payment platforms asking them to block transactions tied to deepfake content, citing terms of service models that already restrict other prohibited activities.

On August 25, 2025, all State AGs—except those from Alabama, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, Oregon, Texas, and Wisconsin—sent a letter to major AI developers urging them to make child safety a priority in the design and rollout of chatbot technologies. The State AGs cited investigations showing AI-driven chatbots engaging in sexually suggestive or emotionally manipulative conversations with minors and cautioned that these incidents reflect broader systemic vulnerabilities. The AGs noted that they stand ready to use their enforcement authority to prevent the exploitation of minors.

Together, these letters highlight the State AGs’ growing focus on AI-related risks. Child safety and intimate image abuse are bipartisan enforcement priorities, with parallel federal interest in the executive and legislative branches. Companies in the technology sector should expect continued scrutiny, and service providers, such as payment platforms, also may face expanding obligations to address these concerns.

2. State AGs Focus on Consumer Fraud in the Electronic Payment and Robocall Spaces

We note two focus areas for recent AG activity in the consumer fraud space: (1) pursuing matters that have been abandoned by federal regulators; and (2) targeting companies that are allegedly providing platforms for fraud.

A prime example of the first area of focus is the lawsuit filed by the New York Attorney General (NYAG) alleging fraud against Early Warning Services, LLC (EWS), the company that developed and operates the electronic payment platform Zelle. The NYAG brought this lawsuit after the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau abandoned a similar lawsuit.

Although EWS did not directly engage in the type of scams alleged in the complaint, the NYAG seeks to impose liability on EWS for allegedly “creat[ing] an atmosphere conducive to fraud” by designing Zelle without critical safety features, allowing scammers to easily target users and steal more than $1 billion between 2017 and 2023. The NYAG further alleges that EWS and its partner banks knew for years that fraud was spreading on Zelle, failed to adopt safeguards or enforce meaningful anti-fraud rules on its partner banks, and fraudulently promoted and marketed the safety and security of the Zelle network.

Regarding the second area of focus, State AGs are sending warning letters to phone providers that are associated with a high volume of illegal and/or suspicious robocall campaigns even though the providers themselves are not making the robocalls. The Anti-Robocall Litigation Task Force, comprised of State AGs from all 50 states plus the District of Columbia, sent notice letters to 37 phone providers warning them that their transmission of calls associated with high-volume illegal and/or suspicious robocall campaigns may violate state and federal law. These 37 notices follow five rounds of warning letters sent to 23 companies between November 2023 and April 2025. The Task Force is also sending notice letters to 99 downstream providers that accept call traffic from the 37 phone providers.

Businesses should anticipate heightened state-level enforcement, as State AGs are increasingly pursuing focus areas that they believe federal regulators will no longer focus on and targeting companies with platforms they believe may enable fraud. Risks extend to vendors and third parties and thus companies should strengthen fraud-prevention and monitoring systems, enforce clear compliance obligations with partners and other third parties, align marketing claims with actual security measures, and consider prompt engagement with regulators when issues arise.

3. Auto-Renewing Subscriptions Continue to Be Targeted by District Attorneys

On August 14, 2025, HelloFresh, the world’s largest meal kit delivery company, agreed to pay $7.5 million to settle a lawsuit brought jointly by the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Consumer Protection Division and the Santa Clara County District Attorney’s Office. The case grew out of investigations conducted by the California Automatic Renewal Task Force, which was established by the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office in 2015 to address rising consumer complaints about subscription-based traps.

The lawsuit alleged that HelloFresh violated California’s Automatic Renewal Law by deceptively enrolling consumers in auto-renewing subscription plans without proper disclosure or consent. It also alleged that HelloFresh violated California’s False Advertising Law by failing to disclose the material terms and conditions of advertised free meals, surprise gifts, and free shipping offers. As part of the settlement, HelloFresh agreed to pay $6.38 million in civil penalties, $120,000 in investigative costs, and $1 million in restitution to eligible California consumers.

Other state regulators have sued and secured settlements with companies offering automatically renewing subscriptions. For example, the NYAG initiated a lawsuit against an audio entertainment company and the Massachusetts Attorney General secured a $6.5 million settlement with a home security services company. This trend highlights the importance of clearly disclosing subscription terms, obtaining each consumer’s affirmative consent before charging their credit card, providing a post-transaction acknowledgment of the material terms of the transaction, and offering an easy-to-use mechanism for cancellation.

4. State AGs Target Healthcare Fraud Through False Claims Settlements

State AGs have been harnessing the federal False Claims Act and their own state false claims statutes to target fraud in the healthcare sector. The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on persons and companies that knowingly submit false claims to the federal government. Most states have their own versions of the False Claims Act. Recently, AGs in Connecticut, Oklahoma, and Massachusetts have reached settlements with medical providers and companies for violating state and federal False Claims Act statutes often in partnership with federal prosecutors and agencies.

The Connecticut Attorney General reached a $150,000 settlement with a dentist, resolving allegations that she submitted false claims to Connecticut Medicaid through prohibited fees paid to a third-party patient recruiting company in violation of state and federal False Claims Act statutes. The Connecticut Attorney General alleged that the dentist paid the third-party patient recruiting company a fee for each Connecticut Medicaid patient it referred to her, whenever a patient received dental services over and above routine preventative care. This is the fifth settlement[2] arising from the Connecticut Attorney General’s joint investigations with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services – Office of Inspector General, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into paying kickbacks for patient recruitment.

The Oklahoma Attorney General reached a $173,143 settlement with a psychiatrist, resolving allegations that he knowingly submitted false claims to the Oklahoma Medicaid program and then caused his agents and employees to fabricate records when the Oklahoma Health Care Authority notified him of the intention to audit his patient records. The Oklahoma Attorney General alleged that the psychiatrist “upcoded” claims for evaluating and managing patients and then submitted those false claims to the Oklahoma Medicaid program in violation of the Oklahoma Medicaid False Claims Act.

The Massachusetts Attorney General reached a $6 million settlement with two ambulance companies for violations of the Massachusetts False Claims Act. The settlement resolved allegations that the ambulance companies submitted false claims to MassHealth for more expensive services than were provided, violated MassHealth medical necessity requirements, and failed to disclose relevant information when submitting the companies’ applications to serve as MassHealth providers. As part of the settlement, the ambulance companies will implement a three-year independent compliance monitoring program.

These settlements demonstrate that State AGs, who often work closely with their federal counterparts, continue to aggressively enforce false claims violations to protect against defrauding state Medicaid programs, making compliance programs and accurate billing practices essential for providers.

5. State AGs Focus on Environmental Reporting and Climate-Related Conduct

On August 7, 2025, 22 State AGs, joined by several major cities and local governments,[3] submitted comments urging the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to withdraw its proposal to repeal federal greenhouse gas reporting rules for the oil and gas sector. The coalition warned that eliminating the rules would undermine transparency and hinder states’ ability to track emissions, particularly methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The State AGs emphasized that reliable emissions data is critical for enforcement and policymaking and argued that the EPA has both a statutory duty and scientific basis to maintain strong reporting requirements. By highlighting the risks of regulatory rollback, the coalition signaled that environmental reporting and accountability remain an enforcement priority for certain states and localities.

Separately, on July 28, 2025, the Florida Attorney General announced an investigation into what that office described as a potential “climate cartel,” targeting major financial institutions and other entities that coordinate to restrict investment in fossil fuel industries. The investigation will examine whether such activities violate state and federal antitrust laws by limiting competition under the banner of environmental, social, and governance goals.

While the Florida Attorney General investigation is at an early stage, it reflects a contrasting trend in state enforcement, with some State AGs framing climate-focused initiatives as potential threats to market fairness. The investigation illustrates that environmental issues are not only a regulatory matter and increasing partisan matter but also an emerging battleground for antitrust enforcement.

Their goal: keep the lights on during the next winter storm.

The company, co-founded by Zach Dell, aims to install batteries that offer on-site energy storage options for customers. The company launched in 2023.

“The chance to reinvent our power system comes once in a generation,” said Dell in a press release. “The challenge ahead requires the best engineers and operators to solve it, and we’re scaling the team to make our abundant energy future a reality.”

According to the release, the company has partnerships with homebuilders and serves homeowners in Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth and the Houston area.

The company is currently building its first energy storage and power electronics factory in downtown Austin at the former Austin American-Statesman building.

“Austin is the place where innovation is happening. I think we’re seeing a lot of technology companies, a lot of hardware companies in particular coming to Austin, and as a born and raised Austinite, it’s just incredibly fun to see,” he said. “And I’m just really excited for the next decade of growth in Austin and building the company here and attracting the best and brightest to the city,” Dell told KXAN in 2024.

The energy startup—co-founded in 2023 by CEO Zach Dell and COO Justin Lopas—offers fixed-rate home electric plans with whole-home battery backup. Backed by venture capital, Base aims to reimagine the power grid through distributed storage that delivers both affordability and reliability.

The company began serving the DFW region in 2024 and expanded into Dallas proper this past August. With a new office and warehouse in Grapevine, its North Texas footprint now includes Fort Worth, Arlington, Plano, and Irving.

Base says it’s working to lower electric costs for homeowners while proving how distributed battery systems can operate at utility scale.

“The chance to reinvent our power system comes once in a generation,” CEO Zach Dell said in a statement announcing the funding round.

The new funding, one of the largest Series C rounds of the year, was led by Addition. New investors include CapitalG, Spark, BOND, Lowercarbon, and Ribbit, with continued support from existing backers Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, and Lightspeed. The round brings Base’s total funding to $1.3 billion, according to Crunchbase. Earlier this year, the company raised $200 million in its Series B funding round.

With the capital in place, the company plans to expand beyond its current Texas markets, including DFW, Houston, and Austin.

“We’re scaling the team to make our abundant energy future a reality,” Dell said in the announcement. He added that meeting the challenge “requires the best engineers and operators to solve it.”

A battery in every home, but no solar required

Base’s model is designed for reliability and resilience. It offers a fixed-rate energy plan that includes installation of a whole-home backup battery, even if the home doesn’t have solar panels. The company owns and maintains the battery, which kicks in automatically during outages to provide up to 24 hours of backup depending on usage.

The company recently qualified for Texas’s Aggregated Distributed Energy Resource (ADER) program, allowing it to pool capacity from individual home batteries and bid it into the market. Base said the ability to participate in this program “strengthens reliability statewide and generates additional revenue from the grid.”

From print plant to power plant

To meet growing demand and support operations, Base said it is building its first factory in downtown Austin by repurposing the former Austin American-Statesman newspaper press facility. The site will manufacture energy storage systems and power electronics.

“The only way to add capacity to the grid is physically deploying hardware,” said COO and co-founder Justin Lopas. “We need to make that here in the U.S., ourselves.”

While the factory in Austin is the company’s first, Lopas said, Base is already planning for its second. “We’re building the infrastructure, systems, tools, processes, supporting software, and team that’s reindustrializing America and reinventing the grid,” he added.

Since launching, Base reports it has deployed over 100 megawatt-hours of residential battery capacity, making it one of the fastest-scaling distributed energy platforms in the U.S. The company said that its growth is driven by organic demand, utility partnerships, and relationships with national homebuilders like Lennar.

Dell, whose father founded Dell Technologies, has emphasized the urgency of Base’s mission. “The pain every Texan feels in the summer and the winter is a preview of what may come nationwide,” he said in August. “Base Power is the key to unlocking an energy-abundant future through dispatchable, distributed battery storage.”

As Prepared for Delivery

Watch a video of Wyden deliver his remarks here

Shortly, the Senate will vote on a resolution brought forward by Senator Kaine on the topic of U.S. energy production.

Donald Trump came back into office huffing and puffing about “energy dominance.” He said all our economic problems would go away if we: “Drill, baby, drill!”

Here’s the reality. Like the vast majority of his agenda, everything he says about this issue is fraudulent, and everything he does is rooted in a sweetheart deal for his wealthy donors. Back in February, he signed the executive order declaring an “energy emergency,” which is the subject of today’s floor action. This emergency declaration has nothing to do with energy dominance, and everything to do with creating more giveaways to Big Oil. He’s looking out for the same oil and gas companies he solicited for big checks right in the middle of the 2024 campaign. His offer to them was, give me your money, get me elected, and I will let you oil companies run the show.

That was as dirty as it gets. But I’ll give Trump this: he’s kept his promise to Big Oil.

He has gutted American energy production, ceded ground to China on the clean energy arms race, and rigged the system in favor of fossil fuels.

After declaring this energy emergency, he and Republicans took a wrecking ball to American energy production by gutting tax credits for wind and solar energy in their budget bill. These tax credits passed under Democratic leadership back in 2022 finally put wind and solar energy on equal footing with oil and gas. My guiding principle when crafting that legislation was that creating good-paying American jobs and securing a clean energy future aren’t mutually exclusive. They can and must go hand-in-hand.

These tax credits helped to kick off a manufacturing boom in America. Hundreds of billions of dollars in private investments. Hundreds of thousands of jobs. New factories went up all over the country. Battery technology. Clean vehicles. Energy-efficient products for businesses and homeowners. It was already bringing down energy costs for consumers.

In terms of the global arms race for clean energy jobs and investment, the U.S. went from the middle of the pack to the front basically overnight. Until at Trump’s direction, Republicans destroyed all of that progress at the first opportunity, in order to pay for more tax cuts for corporations and his wealthy pals and donors. When Republicans were gearing up to pass their reconciliation bill, I warned that it would be a bloodbath for clean energy.

Fast forward three months. Manufacturing projects are being canceled. Jobs are being lost. Utility bills are rising.

Their budget bill was a total abandonment of clean energy, and the workers that will lose their jobs as a direct result.

And last week, the Administration announced plans to cancel over 7 billion dollars in funding for clean energy projects. Almost every single one of those projects was located in a blue state. Oregon alone had over 400 million dollars in funding canceled.

And they’re not stopping there. Republicans have derailed management of our public lands to prop up coal. Oregonians see through this for what it is. A gobsmacking attempt to hurt American families just to score campaign contributions.

Now, the United States is barreling toward a self-inflicted energy crisis manufactured entirely by Republicans. Energy demand is skyrocketing. Utility bills are rising. Keeping costs low and meeting demand is going to require an all-of-the-above approach. Instead, Republicans are focused on handouts to billionaires, Americans’ bank accounts be damned. It’s clear as Crater Lake that all the talk from Trump and Republicans about American “energy dominance” was a fraud. Nothing but a hollow campaign slogan.

The Republican energy agenda is a level of economic self-sabotage that leaves you slack-jawed.

I’ll close with this. The American people voted for cheaper groceries, utilities and gas. They didn’t vote for an energy crisis that benefits no one except Big Oil investors.

Beginning with Senator Kaine’s resolution, the Senate has an opportunity to help bring an end to Trump’s manufactured energy crisis. This is a chance for the Senate to fight for lower prices, more jobs, and greater energy security while Donald Trump works to undermine them.

I urge my colleagues to support the resolution, and I yield the floor.

Businesses are investing in carbon capture. Renewable energy has surpassed coal as the world’s largest source of electricity. The shift to a green economy is gaining momentum, partly thanks to Canada’s ambitious target to become carbon-neutral by 2050. Achieving this goal will require a new generation of workers to operate our system of solar panels, wind turbines, geothermal wells and nuclear plants. Job opportunities for green building technicians, sustainability consultants and energy auditors are essential—and increasing.

The push to combat climate change is set to boost the industry’s value to US$23 trillion globally by 2030. Here at home, Canada’s clean energy sector employed more than 466,000 workers in 2023 and generated $22 billion in employment income. Jobs in environmental sectors, including areas like carbon capture, critical mineral mining (retrieving minerals used in sustainable technologies), geothermal system installation and the electric vehicle industry are expected to grow by 3.4 per cent annually over the next decade—almost four times faster than the average employment growth. That’s in part due to support from the federal government, whose 2024 Canadian Sustainable Jobs Act mandates the creation of sustainability-focused jobs.

Regionally, British Columbia could have more than 317,000 new clean energy jobs between 2025 and 2050, with opportunities to work on cutting-edge projects like repurposing CO₂ for clean electricity production, decarbonizing buildings or protecting coastlines from climate impact. In Alberta, the government forecasts 10 per cent annual growth in clean energy employment and Ontario is heavily investing in nuclear and electrification projects, creating thousands of jobs.

College renewable energy programs to consider

There are several hands-on college diploma programs in clean and renewable energy available to students across the country. Most diploma programs are two years long, while advanced diplomas, which specialize in things like system design and energy modeling (digitally monitoring the energy output of a system, like in a home), typically take three years. In Mohawk College’s energy systems engineering technology program and Fanshawe College’s renewable energies technician diploma program, students get hands-on field experience with solar, wind and geothermal energy systems, and participate in a co-op. Lakeland College’s sustainable energy technology diploma covers solar, wind, biofuel and geothermal systems, with the opportunity to acquire certification from the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners, or NABCEP, considered the gold standard in accreditation for many renewable energy professionals. Vancouver Community College’s clean energy technology diploma, meanwhile, prepares students for roles in renewable energy systems and green building design, or energy auditing of industrial sites.

Opportunities for renewable energy grads

A college diploma in clean and renewable energy can lead to a variety of in-demand jobs in Canada’s growing green sector. Students may go on to careers as solar or wind technicians, panel installers or EV infrastructure designers. Others find roles as sustainability consultants, building systems technicians or project coordinators who support clean energy installations. Students who want a leadership role can pursue additional credentials like the NABCEP certification or become project management professionals.

Graduates of clean and renewable energy programs earn competitive wages, which vary by role, experience and location. A 2023 survey by ECO Canada, an organization that advocates for workers in environmental and sustainability-related jobs, found that the annual salary for workers in Canada’s green economy in 2024 was $80,752, which is significantly higher than that of the average Canadian, which sits at $60,880. In Toronto, entry-level renewable energy technicians earn between $39,000 and $58,000 annually, with an average around $47,800, according to Glassdoor. As workers rise to senior roles, energy-related positions commonly net more than $100,000 per year.",https://cms.macleans.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MACLEANS-EDUCATION-IN-DEMAND-PROGRAMS-CLEAN-ENERGY-LAKELAND-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 18:02:33.827880

So why do so few Michiganders have a grasp of how the commission functions? Journalist and climate activist Bill McKibben told the New York Times that public service commissions often fly under the radar because they’re “protected by a force field of their own boringness,” discouraging individuals from participating in the process.

In hopes of breaking through that force field, Planet Detroit created this guide for Michiganders to gain a better understanding of what the Michigan Public Service Commission — or MPSC — does, who it serves, and how to get involved.

What is the Michigan Public Service Commission?

The MPSC is a three-person public body that regulates privately owned electric utilities, natural gas providers and pipelines, and to a lesser extent, phone and cable services across the state.

As “regulated monopolies,” investor-owned utilities, or IOUs, like DTE Energy and Consumers Energy, must get approval from the commission before making any major changes that affect the power grid or their customers.

When was the MPSC created and why?

The state Legislature first established the Michigan Public Service Commission in 1939. Originally operating as a five-person body, the regulatory agency was created to fill the void left after legislators disbanded the Michigan Public Utilities Commission, which oversaw a variety of utilities including rail, electric, natural gas, steam, telephone service, ferry service, and more.

The MPSC inherited its predecessor’s responsibilities, though over time the commission played less of a direct role in regulating telecommunication companies.

The commission temporarily had jurisdiction over water utilities from 1967 until 1995 — when state legislators repealed the law — as well as the regulation of motor carriers from 1968 until an executive order transferred the responsibility to the Michigan State Police in 1982.

What does MPSC regulate today?

The Michigan Public Service Commission regulates three main industries:

Electricity

MPSC regulates all investor-owned public utilities that distribute electricity to Michigan customers.

Seven IOUs are operating in the state of Michigan:

Alpena Power Co.

Consumers Energy Co.

DTE Energy Co.

Indiana Michigan Power Co.

Northern States Power Co. – Wisconsin (Xcel Energy)

Upper Michigan Energy Resources Corp.

Upper Peninsula Power Co.

The commission oversees all conditions of service for these utilities and has the power to approve or deny rate increases, new energy projects or expansions, infrastructure upgrades and more. DTE Energy and Consumers Energy are the largest investor-owned electric utilities operating in the state.

The MPSC requires that all IOUs submit a long-term plan, known as an Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP, to ensure that electric energy supply will continue to meet or exceed demand, and to help utilities adhere to the latest policy standards and energy goals.

Natural Gas

The MPSC regulates the storage, transmission, and distribution of natural gas to ensure providers are following statewide safety and technical standards. Regulators also have jurisdiction to approve or deny residential and commercial rate changes and conditions of service like metering or billing.

Seven natural gas utilities are under MPSC’s purview:

Consumers Energy Co.

DTE Energy Co.

Michigan Gas Utilities Corp.

Northern States Power Co. – Wisconsin (Xcel Energy)

SEMCO Energy Gas Co.

Upper Michigan Energy Resources Corp.

Upper Peninsula Power Co.

Telecommunications

The commission no longer regulates retail rates for telecom services like phone, cable, and internet, but it still provides minimal oversight related to quality of service, reliability, and consumer protection.

How is the MPSC structured?

Commission members are appointed by the governor and typically serve staggered six-year terms. One commissioner is selected by the governor to serve as chairperson of the body, and no more than two members can share the same political affiliation.

Supported by a staff of about 200 people across nine divisions, the commission is tasked with making determinations in a variety of cases, ranging from proposed rate changes, energy upgrades, and licensing renewals to consumer disputes, administrative rulemaking, and more.

As a state agency, the MPSC is required to provide opportunities for public engagement related to matters under its jurisdiction. As such, anyone who would like to voice their opinion about a case before the commission can do so by filing a public comment or attending a regularly scheduled meeting either virtually or in-person.

Who serves on the commission?

Commissioner Dan Scripps (Term ends July 2, 2029)

Appointed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in February 2019 and named MPSC chair in July 2020.

Active in several state energy advisory groups.

Former member of the Michigan House of Representatives.

Graduate of Alma College and the University of Michigan Law School.

Commissioner Katherine Peretick (Term ends July 2, 2027)

Appointed by Whitmer in January 2021 and reappointed in July 2021.

Previously worked in the public and private sectors with a focus on energy storage and technology development.

Worked on the Juno and Curiosity spacecraft missions with NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Holds a bachelor of science in mechanical engineering and a masters in energy systems engineering from the University of Michigan.

Commissioner Shaquila Myers (Term ends July 2, 2031)

Appointed by Whitmer in July 2025 to replace outgoing Commissioner Alessandra Carreon.

Former senior advisor to the governor.

Served as chief of staff for former Michigan House Speaker Joe Tate (D-Detroit) and Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist.

Former legislative director for Senate Democratic Leader Jim Ananich and policy analyst for the Michigan Senate.

Holds a masters of public administration and an undergraduate degree from Oakland University.

Whitmer drew criticism from environmental groups over the summer when she made the decision not to reappoint Carreon to the MPSC upon the expiration of her partial term on July 2.

In a June 2025 letter citing concerns about the MPSC’s integrity, a coalition of nearly 20 environmental organizations referred to Carreon as “the clearest voice for frontline communities” who “drove efforts to make the clean-energy transition both affordable and inclusive.”

Despite those concerns, Whitmer appointed Shaquila Myers — her former senior advisor — in Carreon’s place, leading many to speculate whether the decision was politically motivated.

Who is the MPSC meant to serve?

State regulators are required to balance consumer interests against the interests of utilities and the importance of fostering competitive markets to ensure Michigan residents are receiving “safe, reliable and accessible energy and telecommunications services at reasonable rates,” according to the MPSC’s website.

How does the MPSC affect me?

Many Michiganders — including Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel — have harshly criticized DTE and Consumers in recent years for making more frequent rate hike requests.

In April, DTE filed for a $574.1 million rate hike case — its second-highest request in company history and the fourth in five years — months after state regulators approved a $217 million increase for the utility. That increase amounted to approximately $4.61 more per month for the average customer.

Consumers Energy similarly filed a $436 million electricity rate increase request with the commission in June, only three months after receiving approval for a $153.8 million rate increase that raised rates by $2.78 per month for customers on average.

In both cases, the utilities were approved for significantly lower rate increases than what they sought.

Nessel has referred to the continuous rate increase requests by DTE and Consumers as “an endless cycle,” accusing them of prioritizing profitability over improving service.",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MPSCMay29-min-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-10-08 18:03:20.412245

Doral secures offtake agreement for 430MW Texas solar-plus-storage project

Yesterday, US independent power producer (IPP) Doral Renewables announced a power purchase agreement (PPA) with an unnamed “corporate buyer” for its 430MW Cold Creek solar-plus-storage project in Texas.

The project is currently under development, and will pair the solar generation facilities with a 340MWh battery energy storage system (BESS). The facility is located in the Schleicher and Tom Green Counties of Texas, and is expected to be connected to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid, and begin commercial operations, in 2028.

The deal will cover 75% of the facility’s energy output, which Doral estimates at over 1 million MWh annually, and all of the associated Renewable Energy Credits (RECs). While the developer did not name the offtaker, it described the company as a “well-known and experienced energy buyer”, and that this is a new commercial relationship for the company.

Arevon powers 264MW Indiana PV portfolio with Meta PPA

On Monday, US IPP Arevon began operations at two utility-scale solar projects in Indiana.

The Heirloom and Ratts 1 projects in Pike County, Indiana, represent 264MW in combined solar generation capacity. These projects—representing around US$400 million in investment—are the first utility-scale projects that Arevon owns in Indiana.

Both sites will operate under long-term offtake agreements. The 150MW Ratts 1 project is contracted under a power purchase agreement (PPA) with the Indiana Municipal Power Agency (IMPA).

EDF and Enlight advance solar-plus-storage projects in the US

Last week, EDF Renewables announced that it had started work at its 150MW Milagro solar-plus-storage project in New Mexico, while Enlight Renewable Energy completed two tax equity partnerships for its 290MW Roadrunner solar-plus-storage project in Arizona.

The former project is co-located with a 75MW/300MWh battery energy storage system (BESS). Milagro will supply electricity to utility El Paso Electric (EPE) under a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA).

The latter project, meanwhile, is teamed with a 290MW/940MWh storage facility and the agreements were closed through Enlight’s US subsidiary Clēnera Holdings.

SunStrong raises US$900 million to refinance SunPower residential portfolio

US renewable energy services provider SunStrong Management has raised US$900 million to refinance a “large portfolio” of residential solar assets developed by SunPower.

The financing takes the form of an asset-backed securitisation (ABS), a form of fundraising backed by assets, in this case a 528MW solar portfolio, split across 18 states, currently managed by SunStrong. The deal was closed on 30 September, with money raised in four phases, and was heralded as “another significant milestone” for the company by its leadership, which offers management and servicing of existing solar projects.

The deal represents that latest positive development for SunPower, which was pushed to the brink last year after breaching a credit agreement, and having to file for bankruptcy.

California passes bills to reduce energy prices, ‘applauded’ by SEIA and CEBA

Last month, the California State Legislature passed two bills that aim to reduce energy prices in the state, which have been heralded as “common sense” solutions to energy affordability by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).

The two bills are Assembly Bill 825 (AB 825) and Senate Bill 302 (SB 302), which cover regional electricity and taxes, respectively.

California law included a number of conditions that must be met before the beginning of 2019, including approval of bodies such as the Public Utilities Commission (PUC), to establish “an independent regional organisation” to work with the independent system operator (ISO) in managing the state’s energy grid.

Carolyn Kissane, academic director and clinical professor at the Center for Global Affairs at New York University, leads the conversation on the geopolitics of oil. FASKIANOS: Thank you. Welcome to the final session of the Winter/Spring 2023 CFR Academic Webinar Series. I’m Irina Faskianos, vice president of the National Program and Outreach here at CFR. Today’s discussion is on the record. And the video and transcript will be available on our website, CFR.org/Academic, if you would like to share these materials with your colleagues or classmates. As always, CFR takes no institutional positions on matters of policy. We are delighted to have Carolyn Kissane with us to discuss the geopolitics of oil. Dr. Kissane is the academic director of both the graduate program in global affairs and the graduate program in global security conflict and cybercrime at NYU’s Center for Global Affairs, where she is also a clinical professor. She also serves as director of the energy, climate justice, and sustainability lab in the School of Professional Studies at NYU. She was named in 2013 by Breaking Energy as one of the top ten New York women in energy, and top ten energy communicator. She’s a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, and serves on several boards. So, Carolyn, thanks very much for doing this. We really appreciate it. I thought we could begin by talking about how has the geopolitics of oil changed, especially vis-à-vis Russia’s war in Ukraine and OPEC’s recent announcement to cut oil production? KISSANE: Well, first of all, I’d just like to say, thank you so very much for having me. I’m really delighted. I am a big fan of CFR’s Academic Webinars. So, to have the opportunity to participate in this—in this way is very meaningful to me. So, thank you. So, wow. There is so much happening in this space, the geopolitics of oil. This has been a tremendous fourteen months. Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine very much upended the geopolitics of oil because Russia is a significant producer, one of the top three in the world. And it’s—you know, it’s caused a kind of a reshaping, a kind of a remapping of the—of oil geopolitics. And we’ve seen some, you know, shifts in how countries think about oil security, in light of larger questions about broader energy security questions. And also, on top of that, is the ongoing energy transition, coupled with, you know, climate change, and the need to decarbonize. So, there’s just—it’s been quite a—you know, a year and a half, that has really sort of put energy security, and oil security, very much at the forefront of people’s minds. FASKIANOS: Fantastic. I thought maybe you had some really interesting data to show us. And if you could walk us through those—the trends you are seeing and really bring it to life, that would be fantastic. KISSANE: Sure. So, before I do—I have a couple of slides. And before I share my slides, I think it’s really important that, sort of, we understand how interconnected, sort of, the global energy system is, and how interconnected we are, when it comes to the flows of oil. You know, some countries are very well resourced-endowed, so they have oil. And other countries do not, so they need to import oil. There’s really no country in the world that doesn’t need oil for larger national security issues. And I think one of things that many people sort of are not necessarily aware of or think about, is the amount of oil that gets produced every day. So, every day, the world consumes over 100 million barrels a day. And every day, that 100 million barrels has to be—has to be moved. It has to be—you know, as part of getting it into the system, getting it to its respective destinations. And what we’re not seeing—which, maybe some people may have thought that we would see at this point—is we’re not seeing a reduction in demand, but we’re seeing an expansion in demand. And much of that global demand is coming out of Asia. And we’re also, of course, seeing the—with the reopening of China, lots of really interesting questions as to what oil demand will be in China for the 2023-2024 years, whether or not they will—they will, sort of, put extra pressure on global demand. And you know, Irina, just also, you know, it’s—I’m going to share this in my slides. But you know, last week’s decision from OPEC+ to reduce production, of course, had an impact on the price of oil. So when the decision was announced on Sunday, by Monday morning, we saw an uptick in the price. It’s stabilized, but we are sort of looking at $80-plus-a-barrel oil. And again, lots of uncertainty as to what that’s going to mean across economies that are in recessions, experiencing sort of the beginnings of a recession, and sort of what does it mean for the global economy, where we may see sort of more energy inflation. So, one of the things that I really like to do when I teach the geopolitics of oil is sort of show some visuals. Because I think, again, sort of, really reinforcing the interconnected nature of our global energy system, but also sort of seeing where in the world is oil produced, and where in the world are the—are the importers. And also, just a couple of sort of fun pieces on what we have seen, just this—you know, in the last week, of course, some of this—you’ll be familiar with, those in the audience—but this decision on the part of OPEC to reduce production by 1.2 million barrels a day—again, happening at a time, not when we have an excess supply, but when we’re seeing a tight supply across the oil market. So, it came as a bit of a surprise to—you know—to even the most, you know, longstanding analysts and OPEC observers. And again, part of this is directed probably toward self-interests on the part of Saudi Arabia and the oil producers that are really going to make the cuts. But of course, it also has an impact here for those of you that are sitting in the United States. What does it mean then for prices that Americans pay at the gas pump? So, the Biden administration sort of came out after this decision was made in sort of being disappointed, surprised that OPEC would make this decision. Now, it’s also important to sort of recognize that this is not just a singular OPEC decision. This is part of, now, a larger OPEC+. And OPEC+ does also include Russia, as well as other countries like Kazakhstan and Mexico. So, the OPEC that we have historically known is now different, because you have other countries that are not official members but nonetheless are part of what we now refer to as OPEC+. And these are the countries that are part of OPEC, and really the country that’s considered to be sort of in the driver’s seat of OPEC is that of Saudi Arabia, because Saudi Arabia is the largest producer within the OPEC organization, producing anywhere from 10 to 11 million barrels a day. Venezuela has the largest reserves, but it is far from being at capacity, in terms of what it can—what it can produce. So, just to kind of put that into perspective, these are OPEC countries and their respective reserves. And then non-OPEC—the United States being a non-OPEC country, but again, this sort of—this chart to the right shows, you know, again, the world is consuming a little over 100 million barrels a day, expected to increase over 2023 and into 2024, question marks as to when we may see peak oil demand. But again, to sort of link this to energy security—energy security, especially when it’s in the context of oil security—is making sure that we have adequate supply at affordable prices. So, when we see a reduction in supply at a time of tight markets, that suggests that we’re also going to see higher prices that’s going to directly hit vulnerable economies. And so, again, just to sort of point out sort of where in the world sort of are the top three oil producers: the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia. Russia remains in the top three. Canada as well, our, you know, neighbor to the north. And China is also a producer of oil. The United States figure here also includes gas liquefied, so liquid petroleum, which the United States is endowed with a lot of both oil and natural gas. And then the top oil consuming countries, you have U.S., China, and India. Now, the United States is not the largest importer. That position is now held by China. But as far as consumption goes, we consume over 20 million barrels a day. Again, big question mark about China, in terms of whether or not we will see higher demand coming out of China over the next year, two years, with China’s reopening and what is being, you know, discussed as revenge tourism. And more Chinese who have accumulated a lot of savings, 2.1 trillion, how are they going to use that savings and whether or not, after three years of being under lockdown restrictions, whether or not we’ll see impacts to demand. And I think Russia is—there’s lots of questions about Russia. And this is now—we’re fourteen months into, you know, Russia’s reinvasion of Ukraine—and I emphasize reinvasion, because oftentimes, we forget that, you know, Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. But Russia is still moving its oil. And up until, you know, a few months ago, its overall production and exports were as high—at some points, even higher—than pre-invasion. Now, you have new countries that are takers of Russian oil, and they’re buying it at discounted prices. We see Turkey, Singapore, China has been a big buyer, as well as India, that they have been buying discounted Russian oil. Lots of interesting questions that we could discuss about the oil price cap and seaborne embargo to Europe. But I think the takeaway from this slide is that Russia continues to produce oil, continues to sell it, selling at a discounted price, but there are still many countries in the world that are eager to take Russian oil. And again, I’m not going to go into this, but I just love this slide, to just emphasize the—you know, the world’s pipelines. These are the pipelines that help sort of the transit of oil. Something also that’s really unique and interesting to look at is just tanker traffic, so, the tankers that carry oil around the world. But again, you know, there are a lot of pipelines, so twenty-three—two thousand, three hundred, and eighty-one operational oil and gas pipelines. Again, these are—it’s moving a lot of the oil that is consumed every day. And then finally, is this—is—you know, one of the things that we oftentimes—we think about the hundred million barrels a day that the world is consuming, over 75 percent of the world’s oil is controlled, managed by state-owned oil companies. So, Saudi Aramco being one, PDVSA of Venezuela being another. But it’s really important to sort of recognize the position that state-owned companies have. The rest is controlled or managed by international oil companies—ExxonMobil, Chevron, ENI, Total, and a host of other—host of other companies. But again, I think the—you know, to understand that NOCs, as they’re referred to, are very, very important for understanding their role in the larger context of the geopolitics of oil. And again, what we saw last week coming out of OPEC, this decision, this is also being driven by state budget concerns. This is—again, it’s about the production of oil, but it’s also about, you know, governments and their budgets. And oftentimes, you know, there is a desire to add more, rather than—you know, more revenues rather than less. So, those are the slides that I have. And I hope that they sort of provide some sort of context, and a little bit of, you know, that we can discuss in the questions that I really look forward to answering from the audience. FASKIANOS: Thank you, Carolyn. That was great. So now, we’re going to go to all of you for your questions and comments. (Gives queuing instructions.) All right, so I’m going to go to the first raised hand in the thing. Amadine Hom, go to you first, and please accept the—unmute yourself. (Pause.) You are still muted. (Pause.) OK, I don’t know—are you there? Oh, I think—OK. Let’s go to Morton Holbrook. Q: Yes, good afternoon. Dr. Kissane, what a shocking presentation—(laughs)—a hundred million barrels a day and it’s going up, notwithstanding the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. Is that agreement simply a dead letter, or is it having any effect on oil—on fossil fuel production, particularly oil production? Or what’s the best scenario, in terms of reducing dependence on fossil fuels, considering the oil market? Thank you. KISSANE: Well—hi, Morton, thank you so much for that excellent question. Yeah, that’s kind of why I emphasize that number, is because a lot of people sort of just aren’t aware of how much oil we continue to consume, and again, what the demand expectations are moving forward. And these demand expectations are, you know, coming out of forecasts from the International Energy Agency. So, I think there’s a big question as to when we see peak demand. And, you know, if you look at BP scenarios, they expect peak demand to happen, you know, before 2030, where, as, you know, others kind of contest that they—that they think that peak demand won’t happen until after 2030. I mean, again, a lot depends on, you know, what we are now experiencing in the energy transition, and how, sort of quickly are we—can we transition away from oil. I think what’s really critical, when we’re looking at oil, is oftentimes we think only about the transportation sector. So we’re thinking about cars, we’re thinking about planes, you know, we’re thinking about trucks, and tankers, and all these things. But it’s petrochemicals, you know? There’s just a lot of oil that also goes into fertilizer. So, it really is across our economy, and across economies, across the global system. One of the things that I always tell my students is even during COVID, where you had many countries, right, much of the world was experiencing some level of lockdown, we did have a reduction in oil demand, but it wasn’t—it wasn’t like 20 million barrels. It was under ten. So, the fact that now it’s 2023, the world has reopened, it’s really hard to sort of see, or to know with certainty, is when we’re going to see that—see that reduction in demand. Now, I think with the Paris Agreement, what’s also important is—to note is, you know, if you’re—if you’re in the oil and gas space—and I was just at a conference earlier this morning where this was a point of conversation—was, you know, what are the companies doing to reduce the emissions from production? So, how are they integrating carbon capture, sequestration, you know, how are they managing the emissions that come from the production of fossil energy—in this case that we’re talking about, oil. And I think one of the things that—I think if you sort of follow oil markets, or a country like Saudi Arabia, they are marketing low-emission oil. Now, we could—you know, we could sort of challenge, well, what does that—you know, what does that really mean? But you are having, you know, countries that are now sort of competing to state that they have lower emitting carbon in the production—in the production of oil. And that’s a whole other interesting sort of thing to look at, in the context of the geopolitics of oil, is to kind of understand the variation across emissions, across different countries, in the production of oil. So, we are—you know, again, we are going to be going into COP-28 this fall. Again, we are not seeing—you know, and we haven’t seen a, you know, reduction in fossil energy demand. Again, lots of people are sort of, you know, hoping that we’ll start to see it sooner rather than later. But for the time being—and again, you know, to Irina’s first question, that, you know, the last fourteen months, and with, you know, with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it has both shown us that, you know, Europe is sort of seeking to hasten the energy transition, by building out more renewable energy, and creating more opportunities to buy electric vehicles. But there’s still big swaths of the world that, you know, are still, and have yet to move towards, you know, really reducing—and that are actually going to see higher demand moving forward, as their economies grow. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Jovana Vujanic, who is a graduate student at Lewis University: How big of an—of an impact will the decision of the Saudi energy minister to cut oil production have on the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia? KISSANE: Love the question, thank you so much. Yeah, no, it’s a great one. So, my take is that, of course, this decision came as a bit of a surprise, and it wasn’t something that the United States, you know, wanted. But I would say that the U.S.-Saudi relationship has been very tense for the last ten years. And as part of that—there are lots of different reasons for that, but this is yet—kind of another thing that Saudi has done. And again, I think it’s also—Saudi has taken a non-alignment policy with relation to its position on Russia and Ukraine. So, it continues to—you know, it continues to have a relationship with Russia. It also has the relationship with Ukraine. As we saw, you know, China just brokered a very significant deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran. You know, again, Saudi Arabia and Iran are two—are two important producers for China. So, China is a large importer of oil. So, if you go back to World War—the end of World War II, that’s when the United States established the oil-for-security relationship with Saudi Arabia. And as we have grown, sort of, more—I wouldn’t say independent, but our—as our own oil production has increased, especially through the shale revolution, our dependence on the Middle East and Saudi Arabia, more specifically, has shifted. So, I think we’re seeing a very different Saudi Arabia today, which I think is going to be a challenge for the United States. I think it’s going to be very interesting to see what the summer holds. Last summer, the Biden administration did tap into the U.S. strategic petroleum reserves, the largest—the largest take in the history of the reserves, which started in 1975, you know, taking 180 million barrels out, you know, not because there was massive supply disruptions. But because, you know, as the administration said, it was—you know, it was—it was—it was a war—it was a war-specific decision, because the—you know, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was causing energy prices to skyrocket. And to cushion the American consumer, and to better cushion the, sort of, the global economy, the United States withdrew from the SPR. So I think the summer is going to be very interesting. But I think we’re going to see, definitely, much more attention in the years to come, between the United States and Saudi Arabia. It’s not the relationship of the past. This is a kind of a very new relationship. That’s a great question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. Thank you, let’s go Curran Flynn, who has a raised hand. Q: Hello? FASKIANOS: We can hear you, but we’re getting feedback. So you might have two devices open. Q: Can you hear me now? FASKIANOS: Yes. Q: That’s better. OK. FASKIANOS: That’s better. Thank you. Thank you so much. Q: So, I’m here at King Fahd University in Saudi Arabia, right next to Aramco, here with my class from international relations. And one of my students has a question, Nasser al-Nasir (ph). Here he is. Q: So, thank you, Mrs. Carolyn. My question is: How could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. market, the domestic market, and the role of the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers through their RDIF fund? And thank you to Mrs. Irina. KISSANE: Thank you. And, Dr. Flynn, thank you so much for having your students join this webinar. So, I’m a little—so, the question is about the East Siberian Pipeline? Just could you—would you mind repeating it? I just want to make sure I have it—I’m clear on the question. Q: So, how could Russia’s use of alternative transportation methods, such as the East Siberian Pipeline to China, impact the U.S. energy markets, I mean domestically, and the SPR, given potential insurance workarounds from Russia’s side such as ensuring Russian tankers to the RDIF fund? KISSANE: Yeah, and that’s a great question. You know, I think that, you know, begs a lot of things that we could be looking at, right, in terms of, you know, Russia’s kind of ability or capacity to sort of work around, or find workarounds, to the sanctions that were imposed. And I think we’ve seen sort of new markets—so, this kind of reshaping of the energy map with oil, we see that as—kind of in technicolor, right, whereas, you know, a lot of Russian oil would go west, is now going east, you know, China, India, being takers, and of course, you know, other countries as well. You know, what will be its impact on the—on the U.S. market? I think that’s—you know, again, I do think the sanctions were sort of carefully put into place, so that there wouldn’t be massive disruptions, so we—again, you know, Russia produces over 10 million barrels a day, and about 7 million of those barrels are exported. So, you know, if we lost all of that, that would be a—you know, that would cause some very significant economic disruption globally. We already saw, you know, impacts to sort of grains, grain exports, and food security in many different parts of the world. So, you know, Russia is finding different ways. You have shadow tankers that Russia is using to move—to move its oil—as you pointed out, the East Siberian pipeline. You know, I think there’s only so much the United States can do, or—and European countries that are part of the sanctions regime, can do to curtail Russian exports of oil. But I think that—you know, I think Russia, again, has a—has a desire, and also, you know, revenue needs—they’re funding a very expensive war—that they’re finding ways to get their—to get their oil out. I think an interesting question is, you know, what does this mean in the years ahead, the lack of investment, for example, that’s going into Russian energy infrastructure, a lack of, sort of, any kind of Western investment that is—that is going in, and what that is going to mean. But again, you know, I think, to your question, I think we will see some—you know, we are seeing some impacts, right? There’s a big question as to what—you know, what the next six months to a year will look like, with regards to the reduction from OPEC, and if we were to see a deeper curtailment on Russian oil. And you know, would the United States then tap more into the SPR? We’re now at—you know, we’re down to seven hundred thousand barrels, which, of course, is not insignificant. But we also sort of have to be, you know, judicious about how we use the SPR. But thank you for the question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Michael—let’s see— Trevett, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Southern Mississippi: China and other countries claim there are petroleum reserves under the South China Sea. What are your estimates of the potential amount there, and has China begun to extract any of this oil? KISSANE: Michael, thank you so much. That’s a great question. So, China already is an oil producing country, so you do have oil production in China. In the South China Sea, I can’t—I can’t say exactly. I know that there have been geological tests that have shown the reserves. Again, you do have—you know, you do have territorial concerns about sort of where—is this—you know, can China—can China tap those—or seek to explore and tap those reserves, again, if there are—if there is contention over the territory in which these reserves are located? So you know, China, again—one of the things that’s very interesting about China is that China is an oil producer, but China has seen, over the last, you know, the last decade, they have seen that they have experienced peak demand. So—I mean, sorry. Peak supply. So, they are not producing as much as they used to. And so you’re seeing a year-on-year reduction in the producing capacity. You know, if you go back maybe five or six years ago, there was lots of questions about if China could kind of replicate what happened in the United States around the shale oil revolution. I think one of the big challenges for China is that, of the—you know, where the shale reserves are located, it’s not near water, lots of questions as to—and some of it—basically, some of the tests have shown that it’s—it definitely is proving harder that, you know, they cannot sort of model the same level of development that we have seen in the United States. So, yeah, no, I think in the South China Sea, again, I think we—it’s potentially possible that we might see it. I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t say it’s soon. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m taking the next question from Rob Warren at the Anglo-American University of Prague. This question also got an upvote: How do you foresee Venezuela’s role in the global oil market changing moving forward? And can it be reintegrated into the global economy? KISSANE: Oh, these are all fantastic questions. Thank you all so much. Yeah, Venezuela is—again, you know, Venezuela has—they have the largest reserves in the world. As part of this webinar, right, you—CFR had a—kind of a primer on Venezuelan, and kind of—you know, you look at sort of where Venezuela is. And one of the biggest challenges confronting Venezuela is both its politics, but it’s also—it basically—you know, you don’t have—you don’t have international oil service providers in the country. I think the only—the only one now that the U.S.—the U.S. has sort of given a sanctions exemption to, is that of Chevron. But I think—yeah, I mean, if you were to see, you know, kind of shifts in the political regime, and you were to see more openness, then I think you could imagine, you know, Venezuela having an opportunity, or a pathway forward, to be more integrated into the global energy system, and the global oil system. You know, I think one of the big problems that Venezuela faces is that most of its infrastructure is really old at this point. And it would need a significant amount of reinvestment to get it up to a place that it could sort of meet its potential. So, you know, Venezuela is one of these countries that’s not producing as much as it could, right? It has the potential to be producing 2 million-plus more barrels per day. But you know, we’ve seen that they really have just—they went into freefall. So, I think that’s a big issue. And another big issue, which—God, it goes back to an earlier question—is that of emissions. So, the oil that comes out of Venezuela is a very, very heavy oil. So, it’s—it has very large carbon emissions associated with the production of that oil. So, that, I think, is—again, as we—you know, think about the emissions from oil production in countries that are sort of seeking to kind of market themselves as low-emission producers, you know, Venezuela definitely will have a very hard time recouping its—where its oil sector was. Again, it has the capacity, it has the reserves. But getting that—getting that oil out of the ground right now, you have a lot of significant above-ground risks. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to go next to Clemente Abrokwaa. Raised hand, so please unmute yourself. Q: Can you hear me, please? FASKIANOS: Yes, we can. Q: Thank you. Thank you so much for your—for your talk. I was also very shocked about the amount of barrels that we consume every day. (Laughs.) I didn’t know that. But anyway, I’m from Penn State University. And my question is: You just mentioned about the above-ground, you know, effects. And—so the movement towards, like, electric vehicles and so on, how do you think it is going to affect the African continent? KISSANE: Thank you. Q: I am—I’m thinking, you know, the economies, and then infrastructure. It will be very difficult for them to—(laughs)—move with the rest of the world in terms of electric vehicles, and so on. I just wanted your take on that. KISSANE: Thank you, Clemente. It’s an excellent question. Yeah, I mean, you have countries across the African continent that not only have oil reserves, but are already producing, right? Nigeria is a—is an oil-producing country, also has more capacity, but again, you have some above-ground risks. You also have the need for investment of new infrastructure. I think one of the things that has been very interesting—and I think it’s getting—it’s getting more attention, as it deserves, is how Western governments are—some of—I think a challenge across Africa is that a lot of Western governments have sort of said, listen, we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels—or also, financial institutions, Western financial institutions—we’re not going to invest in fossil fuels, or new projects that are fossil-based. And that—you know, that’s problematic when you look across the African continent, where you still don’t have, you know, 100 percent energy access. You know, the idea of the transition to electric vehicles, which is taking a very, very long time, even here across the—across developed economies—so the need for the infusion of more capital to go into, you know, across the continent of Africa for oil and gas, that’s for their economies and for their own economic growth, I think, is really, really pivotal. And I think this is something that, you know, is being discussed across multilateral financial institutions. And also, you know, is it hypocrisy, right, for Western banks that have, you know, kind of funded the oil and gas industry, or helped to fund the oil and gas industry in the United States and many different parts of the world, and that are now sort of not allowing those funds to flow to Africa. And they have the—again, they have the—they have the resources. So you know, is it—you know, the equity of some of these decisions that are being made, I think, is one that’s—is one that’s really important. And again, I—you know, I said earlier in this talk, is that, you know, all—most of the demand for oil is not coming from North America and from Europe. All of the demand that we’re seeing and new demand that we’re going to see, is coming from Asia, and is going to come from Africa. So again, you know, how are we going to make sure that that demand is met, again, going back to that idea of energy security, so there is—there is accessibility, so there is reliable sources of energy at affordable prices, you know, without sort of thinking about kind of a whole-of-energy approach. So, I think it’s very—it’s a very complex issue. And I think, you know, Western banks who have sort of taken very sharp positions on what they will and will not fund, when it comes to new oil and gas projects, are getting sort of challenged as to, you know, what does that mean, then, for, you know, countries across Africa that are still very much in need of more energy, not less. And again, recognizing that, you know, EVs that, again, are still—are—you know, we’re seeing adoption here in the United States and across Europe, but it’s a big, big, big adoption in China. But it’s very uneven. So how do we ensure greater energy security for the continent of Africa, I think, is a really critical question. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’ll take the next question from Kyle Bales, who is a senior at Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois: How is the war between Russia and Ukraine having an effect on the progress of the European Green Deal? Maybe you can tell us what the European—define the European Green Deal for us, Carolyn, give us the context for that. KISSANE: Yes, so, again, this is another fantastic question. Yeah, the European Green Deal, it’s—this is—this is great. Yeah, I mean, a lot of people would say that the European Green Deal now is—that the—Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has sort of said, hey, this is why the Green Deal is so important. This is why we really need to more quickly transition to renewable energy, because look what—look what happened when we were dependent on Russia for over 30 percent of our natural gas. And look, when Russia, you know, illegally invades Ukraine and suddenly weaponizes gas, we are left very energy-insecure. It affects—it affects consumers. It affects industry across the continent. So, I think we’re seeing, not just through the Green Deal, but we’re also seeing through, sort of European green industrial policy—so in some ways, akin to what, you know, we put into effect in—this past summer, is the Inflation Reduction Act. And we’re seeing almost, kind of, this industrial competition around clean energy technologies. And so, Europe is investing—you know, I think it’s about $250 billion, the United States, it’s about 370 billion—towards the—kind of the energy transition, and helping to support domestic industries and companies to—you know, to be able to, you know, develop the technologies, and to have the, you know, the opportunity to contribute to the energy transition. So, I think one thing, though—whenever I talk about Europe, it’s really important, is to sort of recognize that, you know, when you look across Europe, you have very different policies and kind of approaches, to sort of thinking about energy, and how quickly some countries want to transition and can transition, whereas others, you know, are probably going to experience a slower transition. So, just really interesting example, as you talked about the Green Deal, is the EU taxonomy, the green taxonomy, that went into effect in the—January of 2022. And there, you had, like, really a lot of contention between France and Germany, because France wanted to make sure that nuclear was part of the green taxonomy. Germany was opposed, right, but Germany wanted to make sure natural gas was part of the green taxonomy. So ultimately, in the end, both natural gas and nuclear—and again, this was—this predated Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But in the EU green taxonomy, you have—you know, you have both nuclear and natural gas, in addition to other renewable energies that can make up this taxonomy, that includes specific measures towards adaptation and mitigation for climate change. So you know, I think you’re seeing this kind of—some people call it a race, a competition. You know, ideally, it’s—you know, we’re kind of working together to—because we’re all sort of going in the same direction—to, you know, support the transition, and to reduce—to reduce carbon emissions, and to bring in more, sort of, cleaner energy technologies into our system. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Dr. Laeed Zaghlami. Q: Yes, good afternoon. This is Laeed—good afternoon, Irina. Good afternoon, Carolyn. I’m very pleased to be part of your program. Just to—want to be back to Africa and particularly to Nigeria, how practical the two projects that Nigeria is advocating for pipelines, one from—through Algeria, and the other one to Morocco through western African countries? How practical are these pipelines to supply gas to Europe and parts of some African countries? FASKIANOS: And Dr. Zaghlami, you are at Algiers University, correct? Q: Indeed, Irina, yes. I am professor at University of Algiers, faculty of information and communication. FASKIANOS: Thank you. KISSANE: Dr. Laeed, can I—can I keep you on for just one second? Can I ask you, what is the—what is the status right now? Is it—it’s planned, under construction? Where is—what is the status of those two pipelines? My understanding is that it’s—they’re proposed, but— Q: Yes, well, actually in—practically, the pipeline between Algeria and Abuja, which means through Niger and so forth, is already in progress, whereas the other project, through thirteen western African countries, they are supposed to be implemented by 2047. But is it—is there any political game or something of strategic—(inaudible)—how practical, how logical, how efficiently will be for Nigeria to have two similar project(s)? KISSANE: Yeah, no, it’s—again, thank you for the question. You know, pipelines, again, that’s why I wanted to show the—(laughs)—kind of the map of pipelines, is because, you know, a lot of pipelines transverse, you know, multiple countries, right? And this is—this requires not just, you know, a lot of cooperation, but it requires technically. It also can be very complex to build—to build pipelines. And when you’re talking about something like, as you—as you point out, these are, you know, crossing many countries. You know, I think one of the—again, one of the issues is whether or not—since, you know, what already is under construction, I think you can, you know, with confidence, that one will be completed. Anything that’s not yet under construction—and again, the timeline, 2047, is way out there—a lot of—a lot of uncertainty as to what the status of those projects will be moving forward, for various reasons, in terms of making sure that the investments are there. Someone I know that studies pipelines, he says, you know, until the steel is in the ground, you don’t have the pipeline, and so until you know that you’ve got that, you know, you’ve got all the OKs, and you feel that kind of security of being able to build it, and being able to provide the resources to supply it and to move it. I think Algeria has been a really interesting case that hasn’t gotten enough attention, in terms of Algerian gas, that has—that has helped support Europe. Over the last years, we’ve seen an increase in Algerian gas going into Europe. Again, a lot of attention on U.S. LNG and the increase of liquefied natural gas exports into Europe, but also Algeria has been, you know, very important for helping to support European energy security, and make up for some of the losses of the—of the Russian gas. And I think we’ll see more attention on Algeria, and Algeria’s role as a—you know, as an important source of energy, especially, you know, gas, going into—going into Europe, moving forward. FASKIANOS: So, I’ll take the next written question from Vincent Brooks, who is at Harvard and Diamondback Energy board of directors: How do you view the purchasing of discounted Russian oil by India, in particular relative to the purchasing by China? How are they using the oil purchased? And are you seeing more internal usage or external profit-making sales in places like Africa? And what are the implications of all of this? KISSANE: Right, great. Great question. So, all of the above—(laughs)—in some ways, right? There is definitely sort of profits that are being made. You know, I was—I was talking about this last week with someone, and you know, if you sort of put your shoe—put yourself in the shoes of India, right, so, India is a—is a rapidly growing economy, 1.4 billion. You know, if you had—if you have very high energy inflation and high oil prices, that’s going to have ripples effects across the Indian economy. And so, you know, when you have a kind of opportunity to buy, you know, pretty steep discounted oil, which, you know, they had been able to buy from Russia, you know, for purposes of national security, they’ve been buying the oil. And one of the things that’s very interesting about India is that, actually, India has been building out its refining capacity. So, a lot of that oil is both for domestic, and some of it is being sort of re-exported. But I think what we’ve seen is that they’re using that oil to also sort of enhance their capacity and capabilities as a rapidly emerging, refining power in Asia. And we see that in some ways in China, too. So, China, even though oil demand was down in 2022, much of the oil that they were buying from Russia went into its strategic supplies, which, you know, they now have access to. And again, I think, you know, a big question is what we’re going to see moving forward around oil demand in China. Wood Mackenzie just published a really interesting piece, kind of very bullish, on the expectations for oil demand in China, so whether or not they’re going to continue to buy, you know, Russian oil—and again, sort of taking advantage of these lower prices, you know. And I think—I think one of the things that—it’s kind of an inconvenient truth, whereas a lot of this oil trading used to happen in Europe, so European trading houses were kind of the main—the main points of Russian oil trade. A lot of that has been moved out, so, you know, Russia has found ways to kind of bypass some of the sanctions, and have set up—in some cases, they’ve set up trading houses. And some of those trading houses have been sort of set up in places that, you know, that they can sort of, again, bypass the compliance to the sanctions. And you have some—you have some Russian oil traders that are making a lot of money—(laughs)—selling discounted oil, and then reselling it. A really interesting case, a couple of months ago, was out of Malaysia. Malaysia announced—or, in the, you know—that they were—that 1.5 million barrels were produced and sold, but only—Malaysia doesn’t produce that much. So, those were Russian barrels that were sort of being sold under, sort of, the Malaysian—under the Malaysian barrel. So, again, I think China and India have, you know, have taken advantage. Some of this has, again—as I said, has been re-exported. And some of it, you know, has been re-exported through petroleum products, because China and India, you know, both are building and have refining capacity. FASKIANOS: Thank you. I’m going to take the next question from Bhakti Mirchandani at Columbia University: What global trajectory do you see for nuclear? The Russia-Ukraine crisis has taken some of the refining capacity offline, and nuclear has the potential to change the geopolitics of energy. And so what steps can be taken to foster nuclear energy? KISSANE: Bhakti, thank you. And I was just at Columbia earlier today for the Center for Global Energy Policy’s conference. Yeah, nuclear is very interesting, right? So when we’re thinking about, you know, decarbonizing our energy systems, you know, nuclear plays a very important role, because it’s zero-emitting. So in certain parts of the world—China being one, Saudi Arabia—you know, you have a lot of new nuclear build. You know, in other parts of the world, you have a lot of contention about nuclear. We saw that even in Germany, which have, you know, three remaining nuclear power plants. And even in the midst of massive energy crisis over the last year, there was still sort of pushback about, no, those nuclear power plants need to be shut down, whereas you would think, OK, in light of energy insecurity, let’s keep them open. So, you know, France is an interesting country. France had planned to reduce its nuclear capacity by 50 percent. But this past year, they pivoted and they’ve said, no, we’re actually going to build out more nuclear, and we’re sort of—we’re totally scrapping that idea of reducing nuclear energy. And nuclear is very important for France’s electricity system. Sweden has also announced that they are going to build new nuclear, and they’re going to increase by, I think, almost 50 percent. Again, part of this is their—to meet their targets of net zero. We also see Japan. Japan, you know, the Fukushima disaster really turned Japanese—the Japanese public off of nuclear. Very, very deep opposition to restarting the nuclear power plants. But this past year, even though there’s still safety concerns on the part of the public, the public is also very concerned about energy insecurity and higher prices. So, nuclear being a domestic source of energy. So, I think when you look at, you know, net-zero pathways, I have not seen a net-zero pathway that does not include nuclear. So, here in the United States, the net-zero America project out of Princeton, very important place for nuclear. We just have a really hard time—(laughs)—building nuclear at cost, so it’s very expensive. Usually, it’s significant cost overruns. And of course, there is the—I think they have a really significant PR problem. People—there’s still a lot of concern about the safety of nuclear. So, I think to your point, it’s very, very important for decarbonizing energy systems, but you’re going to see, I think, very disjointed approaches. Some countries are going—are embracing nuclear, and other countries are sort of doubling down on their opposition, and are not going to allow nuclear to be part of the energy system. FASKIANOS: We have so many questions, and we are just not going to get to them all. So, I’m going to take the next question from Christian Bonfili, who’s at Torcuato di Tella University in Argentina. So, do you think, Carolyn, that the landscape resulting from the Ukraine invasion by Russia, vis-à-vis securitization of gas and energy between Europe and Russia, could accelerate energy transition toward greener energy? KISSANE: Great question. I think in Europe, it is. And I think, you know, many analysts would agree that—the IEA, for example—you know, you had the, you know—how does Europe continue—you know, to enhance and achieve energy security without the dependence on Russia gas? And a lot of that is through renewable energy. You also have a lot of new attention on hydrogen, and the role that hydrogen will play. I think—I think Europe is being cautious, and so they are not saying that they are going to completely move away from gas, so as earlier questions, are they getting gas from Algeria, or are they getting gas from Norway? Are they getting more gas from the United States in the form of liquefied natural gas? And then also an uncomfortable truth is they continue to get liquefied natural gas from Russia. So, we’ve seen an increase in LNG from Russia going into Europe. That said, I think all in, you are seeing that, you know, countries across Europe are saying, OK, you know, how can we enhance our energy security? How do we build more sort of domestic energy sources? Solar, wind, we’re seeing, you know, more rapid deployment. You’ve got a lot of questions about supply chains and things like that, but I think—overall, I think the answer would be that it’s quickening the energy transition. FASKIANOS: So, I will take the moderator prerogative to just ask the final question for you to close on. And just to give us your top three—what are the major challenges for the geopolitics of oil, as you look out over the next five- to ten-year horizon, that you would leave us with, to be looking for? KISSANE: OK. You know, so I think what we saw, right, tensions between Saudi Arabia and the United States. We also have a, you know, a hot war, cold war, depending on, you know, the term you want to use, between the United States and China, and lots of sort of questions as to what that’s going to look like. I think there’s—you know, I think there’s concern that, you know, we’re not reducing demands, but we’re seeing tightening supply. And so that’s going to have, you know, very significant impacts for economies, especially economies that are already very fragile, economically fragile, politically fragile. So that concerns me a lot, in terms of, you know, what happens when, you know, economies don’t have adequate access to energy to make sure that their industries, that their—that consumers, you know, are able—that the lights can stay on, and you can get—you know, if you’re dependent on cars, you’re depending on trucks, like, all these kinds of things are really, really critical. So, I think we have to be very cautious moving forward, that we don’t take more out of the system before we have adequately set up the system to be resilient, and to be able to sort of meet the energy security demands that are not—are not—they’re not decreasing. I think they are increasing and becoming even more complex. So, I think there’s a lot of concerns and a lot of uncertainty. And you know, this definitely is going to be an area to watch in the years ahead.

Dive Brief:

DMR Technologies is spending $1.4 million establishing its first full-scale drone manufacturing facility in Lafayette, Louisiana, the state’s economic development agency announced Oct. 2.

The 10,000-square-foot plant will serve as the Detroit-based company’s primary domestic production hub, integrating advanced flight control printing, rotor manufacturing, assembly, quality control and logistics, according to the press release.

The site is expected to create 521 jobs over the next 10 years, with an average annual salary of $85,000, as well as 766 indirect jobs. Renovations are currently underway and production is set to begin by year’s end.

Dive Insight:

North America has the largest agriculture drones market, which is currently valued at $5.4 billion and is expected to reach $12.7 billion by 2030, according to market research firm Mordor Intelligence.

The growth could be due in part to the reforming of drone regulations, Mordor noted. In August, the Trump administration proposed a rule to revamp the authorization process for longer-distance drone operations, aiming to simplify the process for operators to obtain regulatory approval.

DMR anticipates the facility will assemble 500 to 1,000 drones within its first year of production, according to the press release.

The manufacturer is shifting production of its precision agriculture drone model, the Field Ranger X50 model, in an effort to shorten lead times, improve regulatory compliance and strengthen its domestic supply chain capabilities.

The facility will also house space for engineering and compliance teams focused on quality testing.

The existing industrial building is strategically located in the Acadiana region, providing easy access to Lafayette Regional/Paul Fournet Field Airport and the Port of Iberia. The area also stands at the intersection of Interstates 10 and 49, between the Houston and New Orleans markets, granting access to other U.S. customers through the Mississippi River and to international markets via the Gulf of Mexico, according to the economic development organization One Acadiana.

The location provides DMR Technologies with a “strong logistics footprint” to serve its U.S. and international customers, Ryan Case, co-founder and U.S. operations head, stated in a press release.

“This isn’t just about production — it’s about access,” Case said in a statement. “With the launch of our Lafayette facility, we’re eliminating lead time issues and delivering next-day fulfillment for many of our U.S. customers.”

The location also provides the company with the infrastructure and policy environment that DMR Technologies needs to ramp up production and operate efficiently, David Wang, co-founder and CEO, stated in a press release.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/9e5UC5fwuZxVVOcWnPhzl-z9asRGyeYFG8eB6jLPs4Y/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9ETVJfVGVjaG5vbG9naWVzRmllbGRfUmFuZ2VyX1g1MF9kcm9uZS5wbmc=.webp,N,,2025-10-08 18:03:43.103930

Tesla argues that these incentives are critical for maintaining grid stability, especially as demand for AI and domestic manufacturing grows, requiring over 60 gigawatts of capacity deployment annually. The loss of these credits could disproportionately affect Tesla, which relies on them to make its EVs and energy storage solutions more affordable. For instance, the $7,500 EV credit directly reduces the cost of models like the Tesla Model 3, making them more competitive against gas-powered vehicles.

Kotek’s order comes after the Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill made sweeping changes to when and how developers can receive tax credits for building renewable energy projects.
That’s due, in part, to the approval process that renewable energy developers must navigate to get all permits necessary to begin construction.
Under the governor’s order, the Oregon Public Utility Commission, which regulates utilities, will accelerate procurement of renewable energy resources.","Oregon is preparing to fast-track solar and wind permits to take advantage of federal tax credits before they expire next year, in response to an executive order signed Monday by Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek.

It directs state agencies to prioritize, authorize and accelerate renewable energy projects in the state.

“With the elimination of promised incentives by the Trump Administration, states must step up as the last line of defense against climate catastrophe. We have to get renewable energy infrastructure built, and quickly,” Kotek said in a statement. “We cannot afford to lose this critical window; every wind and solar project we help complete now directly fights the irreversible climate damage we’re racing to prevent.”

The state needs more renewable energy projects, like wind and solar, on its grid to meet its renewable energy goals and help lower the cost of electricity.

But Oregon is nearly at the bottom of the country when it comes to adding renewables to the grid due to lengthy permitting processes as well as delays and costs associated with hooking these projects to regional transmission lines, as a joint investigation by OPB and ProPublica found.

The executive order directs state agencies, boards and commissions to take “any and all steps necessary and authorized by existing statutes ” to prioritize siting and permitting renewable energy commercial projects to begin construction by July 4, 2026.

Those projects would qualify for the Investment Tax Credit and the Production Tax Credit — if they also follow other requirements and complete construction within four years. If projects fail to meet the July 4 construction deadline, they only have until December 31, 2027, to come online in order to qualify for those credits.

Kotek’s order comes after the Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill made sweeping changes to when and how developers can receive tax credits for building renewable energy projects. The tax credits could fund between 30% to 50% of most solar and wind projects.

Under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, those credits sought to lower construction costs for wind and solar projects and to boost the renewable energy industry, as part of a push to help the transition from fossil fuels to power homes.

Because those credits are being phased out under the Trump-backed bill, Oregon could lose about 4 gigawatts of planned wind and solar energy, or enough renewable electricity to power one million homes. According to Atlas Public Policy, a data and policy firm based in Washington, D.C., Oregon has nine wind and solar projects now at risk of not qualifying for the tax credit.

The new deadline to receive tax credits could be especially challenging in Oregon.

That’s due, in part, to the approval process that renewable energy developers must navigate to get all permits necessary to begin construction. Those include state land use and siting permits that take years to get. A project may also have to go through an environmental impact study that could take years to finish and add additional time to when a project might be approved.

As developers wait for these permits, some also have to wait for the Bonneville Power Administration to allow projects to connect to its transmission lines, another barrier to getting these projects done. Bonneville owns about 75% of the Northwest’s transmission lines, and its lines are largely full with no capacity for new sources of electricity. It can take years before Bonneville determines whether a proposed project can plug into its grid.

Kotek’s executive order might help fast-track those projects within state agencies, but renewable developers would still need Bonneville’s approval to hook on to the grid so their power can reach homes and businesses.

Now, Oregon’s on the clock to approve and begin construction on those projects.

The executive order directs the Oregon Department of Energy and the state Energy Facility Siting Council to identify and prioritize siting approval for projects that must begin construction by July 4 to get federal incentives. The highest priority would be given to projects that have secured contracts between a developer and a utility and that can demonstrate they will provide benefits to Oregon ratepayers.

Under the governor’s order, the Oregon Public Utility Commission, which regulates utilities, will accelerate procurement of renewable energy resources. Kotek also directed the commission to consider using an outside contractor to study how solar and wind power projects connect to the electrical grid.

“Oregonians are already feeling the strain of rising energy costs and worsening climate impacts, yet Congress and the Trump administration have launched an all-out assault on affordable clean energy and our safe climate future,” Climate Solution Oregon Director Nora Apter said in a statement. “By moving swiftly to get as many wind and solar projects across the finish line as possible before the loss of federal tax credits, Governor Kotek is defending Oregon families, family-wage jobs, and energy resilience against these senseless attacks. Today’s action will help ensure that renewable energy projects can capture critical federal incentives before they disappear – keeping Oregon competitive and able to power our state’s growing energy demands with clean, affordable electricity.”

Oregon joins a handful of states that have already moved to more rapidly approve qualifying projects, like Colorado, Maine and California.

Both through legislation like the Big Beautiful Bill, as well as executive actions by the president and political leaders of federal agencies, the Trump administration has rescinded billions in previously approved federal funding for climate action and renewable energy projects.

Last week, the administration cancelled funding for an additional $400 million in renewable energy projects, most of them aimed at building out transmission, including the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs and Portland General Electric’s $250 million Bethel-Round Butte transmission line.

In August, the administration also rescinded Oregon’s $87 million Solar For All Grant, a program aimed at boosting solar adoption for low-income residents. The state sent a formal letter asking the federal government to reverse its decision.",https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CB2PVDCAVNETZAS4QL3IEVGLBA.jpeg,N,,2025-10-08 17:05:17.988007

The new Model Y, costing just under $40,000 with a stripped-down interior, comes in a brutal year for Tesla as it tries to attract more customers despite an aging lineup, stiff competition from foreign EV makers and anti-Elon Musk boycotts targeting the company.

The reaction from the stock market after the news broke suggests the new models are not expected to help much.

“Investors were looking for something truly different, not an iteration of a old product,” said Edmunds analyst Ivan Drury, speaking as Tesla stock dropped sharply in the last minutes of trading. “I can’t imagine this will bring levels back to what they want.”

Tesla also announced a cheaper version of its Model 3 for under $37,000. For New York residents taking advantage of a state rebate, the price was below $35,000.

Tesla has talked about a cheaper car to appeal to more cost-conscious consumers for years, though the two new “standard” models are priced well above the $25,000 price tag promised. They come as customers are widely expected to hold off from purchases over the next several months due to the recent expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles.

The Detroit News

(TNS)

General Motors Co. no longer will apply for federal electric vehicle tax credits as part of a scheme to extend savings to customers after Congress and President Donald Trump axed the government incentive program in September, the Detroit automaker confirmed Wednesday.

The company will continue to offer about $6,000 in savings on EV leases through October, with the cost footed by GM. The federal tax credit offered savings up to $7,500.

“GM worked on an extended offer for the benefit of our customers and dealers,” according to a GM statement. “After further consideration, we have decided not to claim the tax credit. GM will fund the incentive lease terms through the end of October.”

GM and crosstown rival Ford Motor Co. used their finance arms to place down payments on EVs in inventory from dealerships at the end of September. That would enable the companies to apply for the federal tax credits before the program expired Sept. 30 and then extend the discounts to their customers through leases beyond the deadline. Reuters was first to report GM’s reversal Wednesday.

A Ford spokesperson declined to comment Wednesday on whether the automaker will reverse course on its tax credit plan.

Sources familiar with the matter said U.S. Sen. Moreno, R-Ohio, met with both GM and Ford and pressured the automakers to abandon the tax credit plan.

The automakers’ plan was to pass along savings to lessees to avoid a sudden price uptick following the loss of the tax credit.

Most EVs cost thousands of dollars more than similar gas-powered models, a top reason why the electric market is lagging in the United States. Without the tax credit, analysts and automakers predict a steep drop in sales, at least temporarily.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said last month he wouldn’t be surprised if U.S. EV sales are halved following the loss of the tax credit.

The idea behind Ford and GM’s programs was to help EV buyers transition away from discounted prices with the end of the government incentives.

“VOTE NO on PROP 50. STOP Newsom’s Rigged Elections!”

The signs in English and Spanish, paid for by Republican Assemblymember David Tangipa of Fresno, are one of the only clues in this region that California voters are hurtling toward a statewide special election next month.

Residents here would be the first to tell you they spend far more time thinking and worrying about the rising cost of living, access to water for their farms, homelessness and the threat of immigration raids than the shape of California’s 52 congressional districts.

Many of them don’t realize that in just a few weeks, they’ll be asked whether they want to temporarily change their districts — and for some, their representation in Congress — in a gerrymander that favors Democrats. And unlike in politically attuned coastal hubs like the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles, traditional online, TV and mail campaign ads are rarely enough to get people to vote. Often they need an in-person push from a friend or family member.

But even those unfamiliar with the term “Proposition 50” proved they could quickly form an opinion as soon as someone — a friend, a relative, a journalist, a politician — explained the measure.

At the Kern County Fair in Bakersfield, past the Ferris wheel and rows of food stalls hawking corn dogs and Labubu-themed drinks, congressional candidate and educator Randy Villegas shook hands and snapped selfies in the exhibit hall with fairgoers at Democrats’ pamphlet-laden table.

Nearby waited Villegas’s former drumline student Nickolas Orozco, 29, a cafeteria and playground security monitor for a local elementary school. Although he was raised in a Democratic household, Orozco adopted more conservative views post-graduation when he moved to North Carolina. Now, back in Bakersfield, he considers himself a “true neutral” politically. He has supported both Democrats and Republicans in the past, and his top concerns are affordable housing and resources for K-12 schools.

Orozco’s stern expression melted into a grin as his former teacher greeted him with a hearty handshake and slap on the back. He told Villegas he knew “little to nothing” about the upcoming special election and was at the Democrats’ booth to learn more.

“Educate me, like you used to,” Orozco said.

As Villegas explained how congressional districts are drawn every 10 years after the Census to ensure proportional representation, Orozco interjected.

“I think I may have lied, I heard about this,” he said excitedly. “This is happening in Texas.”

Yes, Villegas said, Texas Republicans redrew their maps this summer, in the middle of the decade, to help their party keep control of the U.S. House. In response, California is asking voters to temporarily suspend its current maps, drawn by an independent citizens commission, and instead adopt gerrymandered districts that favor Democrats for the next five years. Ballots are already going to voters.

“Can I count on you to vote ‘Yes’ on it?” Villegas ultimately asked.

“I don’t see why not,” Orozco replied. “I mean, we’ve got to stand up to Texas!”

A district Democrats have eyed for a long time

Newsom and his party hope Prop. 50’s new maps will help their challengers oust five congressional Republicans and offset likely GOP pickups from mid-decade gerrymandering in Texas and Missouri. But a pickup in the 22nd Congressional District, which currently spans from the town of Hanford through the San Joaquin Valley to Bakersfield, is far from guaranteed.

Democrats have long dreamt of ousting Republican Rep. David Valadao, a dairy farmer who fashions himself a political moderate. Yet to their disappointment, Valadao has consistently defied political gravity and Democrats’ voter registration advantage in the district. His only loss in the last 15 years came in 2018 during the first Donald Trump presidency after Valadao alienated voters on both sides of the aisle by voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act and in favor of Trump’s first impeachment.

But two years later, Valadao won his seat back even as former President Joe Biden won the same district by more than 10 percentage points over incumbent Trump.

A campaign spokesperson for Valadao, Andrew Renteria, did not respond to multiple emailed requests for an interview.

Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains, a Bakersfield doctor who specializes in addiction treatment, hopes she can lead Democrats to a repeat of 2018 by punishing Valadao for his vote to pass Trump’s megabill.

The legislation could in the next 10 years push an estimated 57,000 of Valadao’s most vulnerable constituents off Medi-Cal, the state’s health care program for the poor, according to an estimate from Democrats on the congressional Joint Economic Committee. Another 8,200 would lose access to health care coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Valadao’s district has the highest Medicaid enrollment rate of any congressional seat, according to an analysis by The New York Times of data from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank.

Yet Bains, who has often been a thorn in the Democratic Party’s side for her moderate approach in the state Legislature, has distanced herself from Prop. 50. She was the sole legislator to buck her party and vote against the plan to fast-track the special election. Bains declined to be interviewed through her spokesperson, Adam Capper, who said she had no additional comment on Prop. 50.

“I oppose any effort to circumvent independent redistricting, and the courts should act to stop these political games,” Bains said previously. “We don’t need more ways for politicians to rig the system.”

Farmers and other rural Californians are spooked that the new maps will dilute their votes by drawing them into districts with voters from urban centers. For instance, a new proposed district in Northern California lumps conservative, rural Modoc County with some of the state’s wealthiest communities in uber-liberal Marin County.

In the San Joaquin Valley, Prop. 50 would stretch the compact 22nd Congressional District, which currently includes parts of Kings, Tulare and Kern counties, to include the northwest corner of the city of Fresno and smaller towns like Kerman.

Jenny Holterman, a fourth-generation farmer in Kern County whose family primarily grows almonds, denounced Democrats’ redistricting plan as a “power grab” that threatens to leave farmers and rural Californians with far fewer voices in Congress.

“This is not a game. This is our livelihood. This is our representation that you’re playing with,” said Holterman. She called the Democratic effort to oust him “really sad.”

“He is that boots-on-the-ground that actually understands how an agriculture business works,” Holterman said. “That’s who should represent the valley.”

Voter turnout could decide Prop. 50’s fate

Campaign strategists and election watchers agree there are two big questions whose outcomes could decide the race — who can sell a simpler message, and which side can convince more uninformed voters to turn out.

Republicans could benefit from energizing conservatives as well as uninformed voters who, with limited information about a complex subject, might be predisposed to vote “no” and keep the status quo.

“If the message is simple enough — ‘Hey, stop Trump,’ or ‘Hey, protect our elections,’ — it’s likelier that they’ll end up turning out more voters in the valley,” said Blake Zante, executive director of nonprofit The Maddy Institute which focuses on public policy affecting the San Joaquin Valley.

On a recent Friday just after 7:30 a.m., Democrats Doug Hillhouse and John Waddell waved American flags and signs from an overpass on Highway 198, just outside the town of Lemoore.

Dubbed the “Bridge Brigade,” the two men, along with several others from the Kings County Democrats, alerted the drivers below to the upcoming special election and urged them to vote “Yes.” Lashed to the bridge was a series of poster boards that read, “Worried? Register to vote. Yes on 50,” while another urged drivers to honk their horns.

“We’re out here fighting the demagoguery,” said Hillhouse, a former Republican who became a Democrat after Trump took over the GOP. He argued that Prop. 50 represents a proportional “tit for tat” response to Texas Republicans.

“If we don’t get that passed, we’re going to be doomed to Republican rule,” said Waddell, who stood next to Hillhouse on the bridge and carried a sign that read, “ICE is gestapo.”

While the bridge brigades, billboards and television advertisements might raise awareness about Prop. 50, those alone won’t guarantee that voters turn out, said Zante. Instead, person-to-person voter engagement through door-knocking — but especially through conversations with friends and family — is much more effective at getting voters to cast ballots.

Reno Lanfranco, who owns several businesses in Kerman, about 20 minutes west of Fresno, views Prop. 50 as Newsom’s personal vanity project and a waste of taxpayer money. He blames California Democrats for high taxes — sales, income and gasoline — as well as what he feels is a byzantine regulatory system.

“I’m telling everybody — all my employees, if they want to listen to me or not, and all my customers — vote no on it,” said Lanfranco, an imposing figure with his plaid work shirt stretched taut across his muscled frame, as he surveyed his hardware store.

Prop. 50 would also disenfranchise conservative voters like himself, he argues, which is especially infuriating since Democrats hold a legislative supermajority and control all statewide offices.

“We have very few Republicans in office now and it’ll just squeeze the rest of them out,” he said. “That’s not right.”

One of Lanfranco’s employees credits his boss with helping him understand what’s at stake in the next special election. Shawn Delgado, a 24-year-old clerk at the hardware store, hadn’t heard of Prop. 50 until a CalMatters reporter asked for his opinion on it. After some follow-up research and talking with his boss, he’s leaning toward a “no” vote.

“We already have a bipartisan committee to decide those maps,” said Delgado, who voted for the first time in 2024 and supported Trump. While he acknowledged that redrawing California’s maps might be “more fair as a whole for the country,” he argued California shouldn’t gerrymander and disenfranchise its own Republican voters just because other states are redrawing their maps.

Fear of immigration raids could keep some voters home

One potential roadblock to voter education in the Valley is the palpable fear of immigration enforcement raids, even among citizens. The Supreme Court’s recent decision to allow law enforcement to racially profile their targets has stoked existing fears and prompted many Latino people to stay home, lock their doors and refuse to answer the door for anyone they don’t know, even if they are U.S. citizens.

Maria Pacheco, the mayor of Kerman and a frequent leader of local protests against immigration and customs enforcement, said many Hispanic residents are “politically disillusioned” and aren’t paying close attention to Prop. 50 — and she doesn’t blame them.

“How do you get the community to come out and vote when they’re afraid to come and go to the grocery store?” Pacheco said.

She noted that any white vans or SUVs that drive through town immediately trigger her and others who are fearful of ICE. “How do you get the community to want to participate when they’re seeing that their government is against them right now?”

But Pacheco also said she was enraged by the “racist and inhumane” rhetoric that Texas Republicans, specifically Gov. Greg Abbott, have used to justify their detention and deportation of Hispanic people who they claim are violent criminals or entered the country illegally. While ICE has not conducted raids in Kerman or the surrounding area, she’s on edge. It’s not a matter of if, but when, the immigration crackdown will come.

“Harvest is coming to a close. So, is this when they’re gonna do it? When we’re no longer needed?” she said.

After Texas redrew its congressional maps to give Republicans an edge in five additional districts, Pacheco was proud of Newsom and California for “not just sitting back and allowing it,” but taking a stand and asking the people to weigh in as well. She’s worked to turn that pride into momentum and is encouraging community members to participate in the special election.

In one-on-one and small-group meetings with Hispanic voters, Pacheco emphasizes that voting “Yes” on Prop. 50 with a mail-in ballot from the relative safety of their homes is a small yet crucial act of resistance and a step toward reclaiming the humanity the Trump administration and GOP states have worked to strip away.

“We can’t just sit and be complacent. We have to be brave,” Pacheco said. “We have to be uncomfortable for just a little while so that we can turn this around and make a difference.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/092525-Redistricting-Day-2-LV-31.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-08 16:02:23.373134

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -The European Union should ease its CO2 reduction targets for cars, vans and trucks, with longer compliance periods and a greater role for hybrid vehicles and alternative fuels, the bloc’s auto association said on Wednesday.

The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) presented proposals to the European Commission, which is due to review its targets by the end of the year, taking into account the squeeze on the sector from U.S. tariffs and Chinese supremacy in electric vehicles.

ACEA’s premise is that cutting new car and van CO2 emissions by 100% by 2035 with intermediate 2030 targets is no longer feasible, with automakers facing fines for factors beyond their control, such as insufficient charging stations or low demand.

EVs have a market share of around 15.8% of new EU cars, with vans at 8.5% and trucks at 3.6%.

For cars, ACEA proposes that compliance with 2030 targets should be based on the average for the five-year period 2028-2032, that small EVs should be given a super credit towards meeting targets and that plug-in hybrids and range-extenders play a greater role.

It also wants vehicles using carbon-neutral fuels to be put on a par with EVs and incentives for decarbonisation initiatives, such as using green steel.

For vans, it recommends meeting 2025 CO2 emission targets over the period 2025-2029 and modifying the 50% reduction target for 2030. For trucks, ACEA wants a review earlier than the planned 2027 and urgent action to prevent manufacturers from being fined for missing current targets.

Transport and environment campaign group T&E said ACEA’s proposals would create loopholes, meaning carmakers would only have to achieve a 52% EV market share in 2035.

ACEA said this was a very premature assessment and that the clear majority of vehicles sold would be electric. Allowing flexibility would not slow down the transformation, it said, but would ensure the bloc’s economic security.

Reuters reported on Wednesday that the automaker devised a scheme towards the end of September under which its in-house lending arm, called GM Financial, would initiate the purchase of EVs in its dealers’ inventory. The automaker planned to apply for the federal tax credit on those cars. This money would then be rolled into EV lease terms for customers through the end of the year under the plan.

The company was planning to claim credit on roughly 20,000 EVs on dealership lots or en route to stores under the plan, the report said.

However, GM has now opted to kill the plan and decided not to claim the tax credit, a spokesperson told Reuters. As per the report, the decision was influenced by Republican Senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio, who raised concerns about the scheme.

Federal tax credit of $7,500 on the purchase of new EVs expired on Sept. 30, raising prices for end customers and creating concerns about EV demand in the fourth quarter.

Reuters on Wednesday noted that it is unaware if Ford is continuing a similar program it devised while nearing tax credit expiration.

GM shares traded 1% lower at the time of writing. On Stocktwits, retail sentiment around GM rose from ‘neutral’ to ‘bullish’ territory over the past 24 hours, while message volume stayed at ‘normal’ levels.

GM stock is up by 7% this year and by about 23% over the past 12 months.

There’s a huge demand for energy, and the elimination of this clean energy funding will do irreparable harm.

Last week, the White House announced that it was going to abruptly terminate nearly $500 million in clean energy grant funding to factories and other businesses across New York. These cuts will risk more than 1,000 good-paying jobs and harm economic growth in regions across the state, with an estimated statewide economic hit of $650 million. With the cancellation of these projects, communities will suffer and families will go without paychecks, including those in the very districts whose Congressional representatives continue to greenlight reckless cuts out of Washington.

“Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Congress are playing politics with the government shutdown, and New York's economy and hard-working families are paying the price,” Governor Hochul said. “These cuts directly impact local businesses and major companies, putting workers out of jobs, shuttering factories, and slowing our state's economic progress. New York Republicans should grow a spine, stand with our workers and demand that President Trump restore this funding.”

Empire State Development President, CEO, and Commissioner Hope Knight said, “These federal cuts are shutting down projects already underway, and will stifle New York’s clean energy economy while killing good paying jobs. Communities that were on the brink of transformative growth will now face stalled investments and lost paychecks, as New York's progress toward a sustainable future stalls. Governor Hochul continues to stand up and speak out for New Yorkers, and the businesses looking to drive economic growth in the 21st century.”

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “These federal funding cuts put thousands of good-paying jobs at risk while harming the momentum of New York's clean energy industry by creating further uncertainty for the organizations and businesses that need stability to plan, invest, and grow here. Once again, short-sighted political games at the federal level will undermine innovation and progress in one of the fastest growing sectors of our economy.”

Senator Charles Schumer said, “Donald Trump’s rash actions will hike energy costs for New Yorkers and waste hundreds of millions in investment by wiping out projects already underway in his reckless campaign of chaos & revenge. This goes beyond targeting blue states. It is taking a wrecking ball to working families’ lives from Jamestown to Rockland County, putting countless construction workers out of jobs and raising families’ electric bills just to score petty political points. NY House Republicans’ silence — as Trump rips away billions of sound investment and thousands of good-paying jobs from their backyard — is deafening. Instead of playing politics with the shutdown, President Trump should be working on bipartisan solutions to lower Americans’ costs, boost diverse energy supply, and create jobs.”

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said, “Clean energy is the way of the future for a healthier and more affordable New York State. These Trump administration cuts will have devastating consequences for New Yorkers’ quality of life, the state’s economy, and the overall wellbeing of our communities. I am deeply disappointed in my Republican colleagues who are turning their backs to their constituents by supporting these funding cuts.”

Representative Jerrold Nadler said, “Trump has brazenly cut half a billion dollars in clean energy funding, and my Republican colleagues lack the spine to stand up to him. We will not let Donald Trump’s personal campaign of retribution against our city and state continue down this reckless path. This careless decision will have detrimental consequences; if New York’s economy gets hit, the entire country will feel it, thousands of good paying jobs will be lost, and hard-working families will go without paychecks. These cuts must be reversed immediately, and I hope my Republican colleagues will join me in calling on Trump to give New York our already approved funding back.”

Representative Nydia M. Velázquez said, “These cuts are a direct attack on New Yorkers and our clean energy future. These grants create good jobs, grow our economy, and move our state toward sustainability. Stripping away this funding threatens workers in my district and across the state and undermines the progress our communities have fought to achieve. New York Republicans need to stand with their constituents instead of standing by while this administration puts New Yorkers’ livelihoods on the line.”

Representative Yvette D. Clarke said, “At a time when Trump’s devastating cuts risk undermining the economic stability of communities across New York, our neighbors statewide are pleading with their Republican representatives to stand up for them, their families, and their futures – but they’ve heard nothing back but betrayal. New York Republicans are running out of time to figure out if they serve the people who put them in Congress, or the corrupt president who will toss them aside the instant they’re no longer useful. I stand with Governor Hochul and the people of our state in demanding my Republican colleagues make the right choice by, at long last, putting New York first.”

Representative Grace Meng said, “We should always be working to promote jobs and economic growth in our state and that includes New York’s clean energy sector. I have spoken out against cuts made by the administration that harm our local communities, and I will continue to do so. New York deserves to receive all the resources we require.”

Representative Adriano Espaillat said, “From the rising costs of groceries, utilities, and housing, affordability is among the highest concerns facing New Yorkers and their families. Yet, the Trump administration has failed to work collaboratively to find solutions that would provide families the much needed relief they deserve. Rather than focusing on solutions to curb these ballooning costs, the administration has canceled critical projects and programs that communities rely on. We will stand firm to combat the administration’s ineffective and dangerous policies that threaten the livelihoods and wellbeing of New York families and we will hold them accountable.”

Representative Paul Tonko said, “Instead of working in a bipartisan fashion to advance our state’s growing 21st century economy, Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Congress have chosen to unilaterally terminate hundreds of millions of dollars in clean energy funding for New York State and our Capital Region. Let’s be clear — these aren’t Democratic or Republican projects. These are cutting-edge programs working to drive innovation and bring energy costs down for everyone. By canceling hundreds of these projects across the nation, Donald Trump and his enablers are showing that they care more about their own power than about making life affordable or delivering good-paying jobs for the American people. It’s time for my Republican colleagues to stand up to this bullying behavior and advocate for the best interests of our communities.”

Representative Joe Morelle said, “At the direction of Donald Trump, Congressional Republicans chose to shut down the government rather than negotiate with Democrats—and New Yorkers are paying the price. These cancelled grants—including over $75 million destined for the Rochester region—will hurt businesses and families across our great state. As Vice Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee, I’m working with my colleagues to stand up to Donald Trump and secure the federal investments New Yorkers deserve.”

Representative Dan Goldman said, “Donald Trump’s reckless and shortsighted clean energy cuts are nothing short of partisan warfare against New Yorkers. After kicking over a million New Yorkers off their health care, Trump and his New York Republican allies like Elise Stefanik and Mike Lawler are now yanking away half a billion dollars in clean energy funding as punishment for a shutdown they caused. They’re putting politics over paychecks and jeopardizing thousands of good-paying union jobs in communities across our state. Once again, New York Republicans in Congress would rather serve Trump’s political agenda than stand up for their own constituents.”

Representative Tim Kennedy said, “Canceling these shovel-ready projects will kill jobs, stifle innovation, and raise costs for working families. These projects would have lowered energy costs and strengthened our grid during severe weather. Instead, Trump and Congressional Republicans have again sided with special interests over their own constituents, making it harder for families to pay their bills and for America to lead in the industries of the future. Western New Yorkers should be building the technologies that power the next generation, not watching those opportunities disappear because of Republicans in Washington.”

Representative John W. Mannion said, “This administration thinks research and innovation only matter in the states they won in an election. They're wrong. These reckless cuts are job killers that hurt families across New York. They also sell out our future, hand an advantage to China, and will drive up energy costs for everyone. This funding should be restored immediately - and I'm advocating to restore it in congressional districts represented by either party, because that's what's good and right for all New Yorkers and all Americans.”

Representative Josh Riley said, “Families and small businesses in the Hudson Valley and Southern Tier are already getting squeezed by sky-high utility bills — and now this administration wants to make it even harder to keep the lights on. These cuts will only make life more expensive for working people. I’ve fought utility monopolies and their outrageous rate hikes, and I’ll keep fighting to restore funding and lower costs for Upstate New Yorkers.”

Assemblymember Al Stirpe said, “The ongoing attack from the current federal administration on anything that promotes clean energy continues unabated. Any disruption in already approved funding for these programs threatens the potential for new, high-paying jobs, stifles economic growth, and stagnates significant progress towards greener alternatives. As Chairman of the State Assembly Economic Development Committee, it is clear that such cuts do nothing but set New York State’s businesses and communities back – all while hurting real people and working families in the process. Companies that had been planning their next steps forward in the clean energy sector will now be faced with unnecessary hardship or be forced to reconsider critical investments. Without restoring this funding, New York risks falling behind in one of its fastest-growing industries and losing hard-won progress in the clean energy sector.”

Assemblymember Micah Lasher said, “Donald Trump is once again targeting New York's economy by slashing funding for clean energy, putting thousands of good-paying jobs on the chopping block. Every Republican member of Congress from New York has a lot to answer for. I stand with Governor Hochul in demanding that these cuts be immediately reversed.”

Albany County Executive Daniel P. McCoy said, “Clean energy investment has been one of the most effective drivers of growth in our state, fostering innovation, strengthening our economy, and positioning us as a leader in sustainability. The withdrawal of these funds threatens to stall that momentum and undermine years of progress. I urge the Trump administration to reconsider this decision and fully restore the funding. Maintaining our commitment to clean energy is not only sound environmental policy, but it is also a vital economic necessity for the Capital Region and New York State as a whole.”

Erie County Executive Mark C. Poloncarz said, “Who is served by these cruel and vicarious cuts supported by New York’s cravenly sycophantic GOP caucus? Did New York Republicans realize that they were electing ‘representatives’ who would gladly vote to crush their local economies, strip away good-paying jobs, and let their communities wither all to pay for tax cuts for billionaires? It’s disturbing that elected officials would so openly and brazenly vote against the best interests of their constituents, but that’s today’s GOP. Their legacy will be one of shame and dishonor, accumulated in the service of a felon. New York deserves far, far better than this group of feckless bootlickers who sell us out for their own benefit.”

City of Schenectady Mayor Gary McCarthy said, “GE Vernova has played a vital role in revitalizing the GE campus through continued innovation in clean energy technologies. However, the proposed federal funding cuts threaten to significantly impede this progress, with far-reaching negative impacts not only on the company's momentum but also on the broader economic and workforce development efforts across the city and county.”

Amherst Town Supervisor Brian Kulpa said, “Not only do these cuts immediately impact families and businesses, by cutting funding for clean energy development, Washington is taking direct aim at future generations. There’s a huge demand for energy, and the elimination of this clean energy funding will do irreparable harm. Today’s investments are the cornerstone that builds industry of tomorrow. These cuts are reckless and they significantly hurt local communities. I join Governor Hochul in urging our local representatives to immediately restore this vital funding – we need to invest in energy the same as we invest in infrastructure, it is our lifeblood.”

Henrietta Town Supervisor Steve Schultz said, “The need to reduce our environmental impact is reinforced almost every news cycle with violent storms, record high temperatures, shrinking glaciers, and rising sea waters. As with any developing technology, it can have difficulty competing with established solutions. This is where a responsible government steps in with incentive programs and policies to help level the playing field while those new technologies mature. The United States has a long history of such programs, which has helped the nation not only lead the world in new technologies but become an economic superpower while doing so. The investment in these new technologies pays dividends in the long term. Plug Power, Inc, in Henrietta, is an example of this, creating clean energy equipment for use in industrial and commercial settings. Dramatic cuts, especially those of a retaliatory or vindictive nature as we have seen lately out of Washington, will have a lasting negative impact that could take years or decades to recover from.”

Brighton Town Supervisor William Moehle said, “The Trump administration’s attacks on green energy investments are bad for the nation, but they are especially bad for Brighton. $4,969,022 in funding has been cut for one of Brighton’s high technology businesses, Ionomr Innovations, which conducts cutting edge clean technology research here in Brighton. Now more than ever, it is important to fund advances in clean energy technology, and I call on the administration to restore this important research funding for America’s future.”

Albany County Legislature Chairwoman Joanne Cunningham said, “We are resilient in Albany County. Even with nearly $111 million of our taxpayers’ funding not returning to us, we will continue to support our local business community with our state partners and Governor Hochul in particular. Recognizing the uncertainty of federal funding, we are proactively working to advance development in Albany County through our partnership with the State and the Governor on the multi-million-dollar expansion of the Albany Capital Center. We’re also thankful for the $400 million the State is investing in Downtown Albany at her request. With this continued support, we’re confident we can overcome this latest challenge.”

Rensselaer County Legislature Deputy Minority Leader Nina Nichols said, “Governor Hochul stands with the thousands of New Yorkers whose livelihoods are threatened by Washington’s reckless cuts. Slashing $500 million in clean energy grants doesn’t just stall progress—it risks over 1,000 good-paying jobs and delivers a $650 million blow to our economy. These communities deserve investment, not abandonment.”",https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/styles/cover_image_660x400_/public/thumbnails/image/wind_offshore.jpg?h=765d7f50&itok=gHZpIsa4,N,,2025-10-08 16:01:54.878719

EV Charger Rebates in Indiana In addition to federal credits, Indiana businesses may qualify for statewide and utility rebates that further reduce costs.
For businesses in Indiana, EV charger rebates and the commercial EV tax credit make installing chargers far more affordable than most realize.","Electric vehicles (EVs) are no longer a niche market. More consumers and businesses are choosing EVs every year, and commercial properties that install EV chargers can benefit from increased customer traffic, tenant satisfaction, and long-term property value. For many businesses, the biggest concern is cost. Fortunately, EV charger rebates in Indiana and federal tax credits make installation much more affordable.

To make this easier, we’ll break down what business owners need to know about available incentives, eligibility, and how to maximize your return on investment.

The Cost of Commercial EV Charger Installation

Before diving into incentives, it’s important to understand what businesses typically spend. Commercial EV charger installation costs vary based on:

Type of charger – Level 2 chargers are more affordable and common, while DC fast chargers require a bigger investment.

Electrical upgrades – Some properties need panel upgrades, trenching, or new wiring to support the load.

Permits and compliance – Meeting local electrical codes, ADA accessibility, and inspection requirements adds to the total cost.

On average, businesses can expect installation to range from $6,000–$12,000 for Level 2 chargers, and $30,000+ for DC fast chargers. That’s where commercial EV tax credits and rebates become crucial.

Federal EV Charger Tax Credit

The federal government offers strong financial support through the Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Tax Credit.

Covers 30% of installation costs (equipment + labor).

Maximum credit of $100,000 per charger for commercial projects.

Applies to both Level 2 and DC fast charging stations.

This credit was extended under the Inflation Reduction Act, meaning businesses still have access to these savings for projects completed in the coming years.

EV Charger Rebates in Indiana

In addition to federal credits, Indiana businesses may qualify for statewide and utility rebates that further reduce costs. While programs change frequently, here are common opportunities:

Utility Incentives – Some Indiana utility companies offer rebates for installing commercial charging infrastructure. These can cover anywhere from a few hundred to several thousand dollars per charger.

State & Regional Grants – Programs tied to environmental goals sometimes provide additional funding for EV infrastructure, especially for fleets or multi-unit properties.

Partnership Programs – Businesses may also receive cost-sharing incentives if they partner with charger networks to make their stations public.

It’s always smart to consult with a licensed installer who stays updated on Indiana rebate availability.

Stacking Incentives for Maximum Savings

The good news? Businesses can often combine federal credits with state or utility rebates. For example:

A hotel installs four Level 2 chargers at $40,000 total.

A federal tax credit covers 30% ($12,000).

The utility rebate contributes another $6,000.

Final out-of-pocket cost: just $22,000.

By stacking incentives, businesses can cut nearly half of their upfront expense.

Why Businesses Should Act Now

The EV market is growing rapidly, and properties without charging risk being left behind. By installing chargers now, businesses benefit from:

First-mover advantage – Attract eco-conscious customers and tenants before competitors.

Tax savings before programs expire – Incentives are powerful, but they’re not guaranteed forever.

Future-proofing properties – As EV adoption grows, demand for charging stations will only increase.

How To Get Started

Consult a Commercial EV Installer – A licensed electrician can assess your site’s electrical capacity, permitting needs, and charger options.

Research Incentives – Check federal, state, and utility programs that apply to your property.

Plan for Scalability – Even if you start small, consider installing infrastructure (conduit, panels) for future expansion.

Apply for Credits and Rebates Early – Many programs have limited funding windows.

For businesses in Indiana, EV charger rebates and the commercial EV tax credit make installing chargers far more affordable than most realize. From retail centers and hotels to office parks and multi-unit housing, these incentives help properties stay competitive while supporting a greener future.

With the right planning and professional installation, you can take advantage of available funding, reduce upfront costs, and enjoy long-term benefits for both your business and your community.",https://www.zimmermanelectricindy.com/hubfs/Zimm%20blog%20-%20commercial%20ev%20(3).jpg,N,,2025-10-08 20:02:03.215435

Addition led the round, with support from existing and new investors. The fresh capital will help Base scale up operations, grow its team, and build out domestic manufacturing to meet surging demand for resilient, distributed home batteries.

Base Power is a licensed electricity provider operating in Texas’s deregulated electricity market, and it functions as a virtual power plant (VPP). Its model is simple but transformative: customers pay a monthly fee for energy, installation, and a home battery – no rooftop solar required. When the grid is up, Base’s networked batteries help stabilize it; when it goes down, the battery keeps the lights on at home.

“The chance to reinvent our power system comes once in a generation,” said Zach Dell, Base Power’s CEO and cofounder. “We’re scaling the team to make our abundant energy future a reality.”

In under two years, Base has already deployed more than 100 megawatt-hours (MWh) of residential battery capacity, making it one of the fastest-growing distributed energy platforms in the US. The company’s rapid growth has been fueled by organic customer demand, partnerships with major homebuilders like Lennar, and collaborations with forward-thinking utilities.

Base Power currently serves homeowners across the Dallas–Fort Worth, Houston, and Austin regions, and plans to expand nationwide. To support that growth, the company is building its first factory, an energy storage and power electronics manufacturing hub at the former Austin American-Statesman printing press site in downtown Austin.

The company also recently qualified for Texas’s Aggregated Distributed Energy Resource (ADER) program, which allows distributed batteries to participate directly in the grid market. That means extra reliability for the state and lower costs for customers through shared revenue from grid services.

“The only way to add capacity to the grid is by deploying hardware — and we need to make that here in the US, ourselves,” said Justin Lopas, Base’s COO and cofounder. “This factory in Austin is our first, and we’re already planning for our second. We’re building the tools and systems to reindustrialize America and reinvent the grid.”

Electrek’s Take

Texas’s grid struggles, from heatwaves to winter blackouts, make Base Power’s model timely. Linking home batteries to a virtual power plant offers home backup and grid support. (I was part of a VPP in Vermont, and I can’t stress enough how great it is, especially in power outages.)

With $1 billion in new funding and a planned Austin factory, Base aims to scale fast. For context, Tesla deployed over 31 GWh of storage in 2024, but that figure includes utility-scale Megapacks as well as residential Powerwalls because Tesla didn’t separate out the two in its report. Sunrun’s VPPs now include 20,000+ customers across nine states, and it supplies significant grid support in California. Base’s 100 MWh so far is much smaller, but as a licensed electricity provider, not just a technology platform, its focused Texas rollout and participation in the state’s ADER program could position it as a nimble challenger in the growing VPP space.

Jared Polis announced an increase in Colorado’s point-of-sale electric vehicle rebates.
While electric vehicles and hybrid car sales were up throughout the beginning of this year, experts do not expect this upward trend to continue.
“The state envisions the large-scale transition of Colorado’s transportation system to zero emission vehicles,” said Colorado’s 2023 Electric Vehicle Plan.
This includes 940,000 electric vehicles on Colorado roads by 2030, as explained previously by Toor.","(The Center Square) – As national incentives for electric vehicles end, Colorado has decided to jump in and offer its own incentives.

Last week, Gov. Jared Polis announced an increase in Colorado’s point-of-sale electric vehicle rebates.

“The market has made it clear: EVs are here to stay. Colorado is a national leader in EVs, expanding access and creating pathways for Coloradans to purchase an EV at low-cost,” Polis said. “I encourage all Coloradans who are thinking of buying an electric vehicle or have been holding off: Get out there right now.”

Starting Nov. 3, rebates will increase from $6,000 to $9,000 for new EV purchases and leases and $4,000 to $6,000 for used EV purchases and leases.

These rebates are all through the Vehicle Exchange Colorado program, which is designed to assist income-qualified Coloradans “recycle and replace their old or high-emitting vehicles” with EVs. When the program launched in 2023, it received $25.6 million in funding from the Colorado Energy Office for its first three years. Polis’ office said it anticipates it will also receive ongoing funding through 2032.

To meet eligibility criteria, the buyer must have a household income below 80% of the area median income in the county where the resident lives. In the past two years, just over 2,700 Coloradans have taken advantage of the credits.

The state hopes this will continue to incentivize Coloradans to buy electric vehicles.

“Transportation is a leading source of emissions in Colorado, making widespread EV adoption essential to achieve our climate goals,” said Colorado Energy Office Executive Director Will Toor. “Coloradans have made it clear that they want EVs, and with Congress revoking key incentives that save Coloradans money, we are stepping up. These increased incentives will help ensure EVs stay affordable in Colorado as we work toward nearly 1 million EVs on our roads by 2030.”

This comes even as market experts anticipate a decline in EV sales, as previously reported by The Center Square.

While electric vehicles and hybrid car sales were up throughout the beginning of this year, experts do not expect this upward trend to continue.

“With credits disappearing and shrinking, we expected a sharp downturn in these numbers,” said the Colorado Automobile Dealers Association CEO Matthew Groves. It is unclear how Colorado increasing rebates might affect that prediction.

Longterm, the state hopes that light-duty electric vehicles will make up “nearly 100%” of the market share by 2050.

“The state envisions the large-scale transition of Colorado’s transportation system to zero emission vehicles,” said Colorado’s 2023 Electric Vehicle Plan.

This includes 940,000 electric vehicles on Colorado roads by 2030, as explained previously by Toor.

“By doing so, Colorado could see significant environmental benefits that include emissions reductions from transportation, the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in the state,” the state said.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/da/8da1d8d8-238c-4c95-9f24-7582039cc556/68d6a443e78f9.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C22,N,,2025-10-08 18:03:29.662055

This lack of coordination prevents counties and other local governments from aligning local requirements — such as zoning modifications — with federal permitting actions, adding unnecessary time to project completion.

In response to the Unleashing American Energy EO, CEQ issued a rulemaking removing their authority to create new regulations under NEPA and to remove current CEQ NEPA regulations from the federal code on February 25. CEQ also issued a memo directing federal agencies to “revise or establish their NEPA implementing procedures (or establish such procedures if they do not yet have any) to expedite permitting approvals and for consistency with NEPA as amended by the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA), including the deadlines established in NEPA.”

On July 3, several agencies released updated NEPA procedures in accordance with the CEQ memo. USDA, DOE, DOI, DOT and the Army Corps of Engineers published interim final rules while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) published a final rule. NACo submitted comments to the five agencies accepting comments on their interim final rule. The comment letter can be found here.

The updated NEPA guidelines present several challenges for counties. CEQ provided NEPA guidance that was standard across the federal government. However, the recent rescission of the CEQ guidance has created a patchwork NEPA system that could lead to delays for projects that must potentially clear multiple sets of guidance across multiple agencies.

The role of counties as cooperating agencies is also unclear in this new patchwork NEPA system. Counties support streamlining the NEPA process to better serve residents through the construction of critical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, highways, ports, irrigation systems, forest management, transmission lines, energy projects, broadband and water infrastructure. However, not all the agencies included in this analysis outline how counties and other local government stakeholders will be included during the early stages of the planning process. This lack of coordination prevents counties and other local governments from aligning local requirements — such as zoning modifications — with federal permitting actions, adding unnecessary time to project completion.

Tax credits: Pretax or income tax, or some of each

While tax credits are typically claimed on the income tax return, there is diversity in how they are accounted for in the financial statements. This diversity arises from a number of factors, including:

who generates the tax credit;

how the tax credit can be monetized; and

what the tax credit is designed to incentivize.

Adding to this diversity are the policy choices in US GAAP – of which there are many – and practices that have developed over time as entities try to apply the limited guidance available.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) ushered in a new era of credit monetization – introducing elective payment (direct pay) and third-party transfer provisions that expanded access to tax credits well beyond the traditional tax-paying population. Now, with the enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), the landscape is evolving again. The bill accelerates phase-outs, repeals certain credits altogether, and imposes new eligibility restrictions – while preserving many of the mechanisms that have transformed how tax credits are used and reported.",https://kpmg.com/kpmg-us/content/dam/kpmg/frv/images/2024/handbook-tax-credits.png,N,,2025-10-08 23:58:37.083280

Red States Might Be Next.,"Maxine Joselow, Brad Plumer, www.nytimes.com, maxine-joselow, brad-plumer",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/climate/trump-clean-energy-grants-cuts.html,"The New York figures represent the first official tally of how the funding cuts, which so far have largely targeted Democratic-led states, would affect the state and its growing clean energy sector.
At the same time, many lawmakers and companies fear that the Energy Department could soon cancel even more funding, including for projects in Republican-led states.
The Energy Department said on Wednesday it had not made any final decisions beyond the initial $7.5 billion in cancellations announced last week.
“The department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration,” Ben Dietderich, a spokesman for the Energy Department, wrote in an email.
The Trump administration initially chose to slash a subset of those funds, about $7.5 billion, that were largely concentrated in blue states.","The Energy Department’s cancellation of $7.5 billion in Biden-era awards for clean energy projects is poised to cause significant job losses and disruptions, leaders of several states have said, even as internal documents suggest that the agency may be contemplating deeper cuts in the months ahead.

The agency’s termination of more than two dozen grants in New York State alone would threaten more than 1,000 jobs and nearly $500 million in investments in the state, according to figures compiled by the office of Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, and reviewed by The New York Times.

The New York figures represent the first official tally of how the funding cuts, which so far have largely targeted Democratic-led states, would affect the state and its growing clean energy sector. They come as President Trump appears to be seeking to maximize the pain of the government shutdown for his political opponents, including Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, and Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the House minority leader.

At the same time, many lawmakers and companies fear that the Energy Department could soon cancel even more funding, including for projects in Republican-led states. An internal document circulating among lobbyists and lawmakers suggests that the agency is considering terminating an additional $12 billion in Biden-era awards, including funding for two large projects in Louisiana and Texas that aimed to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

Technology that removes carbon dioxide, a main driver of global warming, is supported by some oil and gas companies that want to use that captured gas to extract more crude from mature oil fields. One of the federal hubs would have been located in the Louisiana district of Representative Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker.

The Energy Department said on Wednesday it had not made any final decisions beyond the initial $7.5 billion in cancellations announced last week.

“The department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration,” Ben Dietderich, a spokesman for the Energy Department, wrote in an email. “No determinations have been made other than what has been previously announced. Any reporting suggesting otherwise is false.”

In New York, most of the canceled funding would have gone toward Democratic congressional districts. But some of the money would have benefited Republican districts in the blue state, including those of Representatives Nick Langworthy and Mike Lawler.

“By refusing to stand up to Trump, New York Republicans in Congress are stabbing their own constituents in the back,” Ms. Hochul said in a statement. “Instead of celebrating the opening of a local factory or congratulating a neighbor on their new six-figure job, these Congress members would rather stand idly by as Trump strips their communities of 21st century economic opportunity.”

The Energy Department had awarded more than $26 million to two companies in Mr. Lawler’s Hudson Valley district, including a company developing advanced batteries. “I’m in New York and I’m a Republican, and obviously this project cancellation impacts my district, so it’s not just Democrats getting impacted,” Mr. Lawler told CNN.

A spokesman for Mr. Lawler, Ciro Riccardi, blamed Democrats for the shutdown. “None of this would be happening if Senator Schumer and his caucus hadn’t shut down the government at the behest of Hakeem Jeffries,” he wrote in an email.

In the Central New York district of Representative John Mannion, a Democrat, a factory that makes parts for electric heat pumps may no longer pursue a $25 million expansion after the Energy Department canceled a $5 million grant to help pay for the project. The expansion of the Bitzer Scroll plant would have added a new assembly line, initially creating 20 jobs.

“The whole thing of Trump bringing jobs back to America is completely running in reverse for us,” John Allcott, vice president of North American operations for Bitzer Scroll, told the local media outlet Syracuse.com. “It’s just killing us.”

For months, political appointees at the Energy Department have been reviewing billions of dollars worth of climate and infrastructure spending that had been awarded by the Biden administration, claiming that the money was rushed out the door but providing few details about specific problems.

In recent weeks, the Energy Department sent the White House’s Office of Management and Budget a list of roughly $23 billion in funding that it had marked for potential termination, according to two people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to describe internal documents.

The Trump administration initially chose to slash a subset of those funds, about $7.5 billion, that were largely concentrated in blue states. The cuts underscored the administration’s strategy of putting pressure on Democrats to accept a Republican budget bill and reopen the government.

“Nearly $8 billion in Green New Scam funding to fuel the Left’s climate agenda is being canceled,” Russell T. Vought, the White House budget director, wrote in a social media post last week.

Those projects include major upgrades to electrical grids in California, Minnesota and Oregon; efforts to reduce methane leaks from oil and gas operations in Colorado; and large hubs to produce clean-burning hydrogen fuels in California and the Pacific Northwest.

This week, however, a leaked list marking an additional $12 billion in potential terminations has been circulating in Washington. It indicated that funding could be canceled for dozens of projects in Republican-led states as well.

That larger list of potentially affected projects includes the five remaining clean hydrogen hubs in places like Appalachia, the Gulf Coast, the Midwest and Texas, many of which aimed to produce hydrogen from natural gas. It would also include a variety of grants for retooling automotive factories to produce electric vehicles or to recycle lithium-ion batteries.

The list of expanded targets also suggests that the Energy Department is considering axing up to $1.2 billion in awards for so-called direct air capture hubs in Louisiana and Texas. Those hubs, authorized by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, aimed to test and scale up technology to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

It is uncertain whether or when the Energy Department might go through with this additional wave of cuts, and the leaked list has set off a furious lobbying battle in Washington to save projects. Some companies that would be directly affected by the cuts said they had not heard of any final decisions.

“We aren’t aware of a decision from D.O.E. and continue to productively engage with the administration in a project review,” said Vikrum Aiyer, head of global policy at Heirloom, a company working on carbon dioxide removal and a main participant in Louisiana’s direct air capture hub.

Companies or universities that receive federal awards typically sign a legally binding agreement and then spend their own money, on the expectation that they will be reimbursed by the government. Any recipients that have their funding axed could potentially sue the Energy Department, just as recipients from the Environmental Protection Agency have sued after the Trump administration canceled their grants.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/08/multimedia/08cli-energy-mtkb/08cli-energy-mtkb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 15:01:58.337383

Many European countries have ambitious decarbonization targets and supportive policies for clean energy technologies, creating a favorable environment for Plug Power’s hydrogen solutions.",", a key player in the green hydrogen market with a market capitalization of $4.2 billion, is navigating a period of significant transition as it grapples with leadership changes, financial challenges, and a strategic pivot towards global markets. According to InvestingPro data, the company has shown strong momentum with an impressive 246% price return over the past six months, though it continues to face operational challenges. The company, known for its hydrogen fuel cells and production technologies, is at a critical juncture as it seeks to capitalize on the growing demand for clean energy solutions while addressing operational hurdles and regulatory uncertainties.

Leadership Transition and Strategic Direction

Plug Power recently announced a significant leadership change, with Jose Luis Crespo set to become the new CEO in March 2026, succeeding Andy Marsh, who will transition to Executive Chair of the Board. Crespo, currently serving as Chief Revenue Officer, brings nearly 12 years of experience with the company and is expected to drive growth, particularly in European markets.

This transition comes at a crucial time for Plug Power as it enters its next growth phase. The company is shifting its focus towards expanding its presence in Europe, a move driven in part by uncertainties surrounding the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and potential changes to the 45V tax credit for hydrogen production. This strategic pivot aims to diversify the company’s market exposure and tap into regions with favorable clean energy policies.

Financial Performance and Market Position

Plug Power’s financial performance has been a mixed bag, with recent quarters showing both promise and challenges. In the second quarter of 2025, the company reported revenue of $174.0 million, surpassing analyst estimates. This performance was largely driven by strong electrolyzer sales, which reached $45 million compared to an estimated $25 million.

Despite this positive revenue surprise, Plug Power has revised its full-year revenue outlook for 2025 to $700 million, down from the previous target of $850-$950 million. This adjustment reflects ongoing challenges in the market and the company’s operational environment. InvestingPro analysis reveals concerning fundamentals, including a negative gross profit margin of -66.5% and significant cash burn. InvestingPro subscribers have access to 16 additional key insights about PLUG’s financial health and market position.

Looking ahead, analysts project revenue growth from $628.8 million in 2024 to $1,132.5 million in 2027, indicating significant expansion potential. However, this growth trajectory is accompanied by concerns over profitability and cash burn rates.

Operational Challenges and Cost Reduction Efforts

One of the primary challenges facing Plug Power is its ongoing struggle to achieve profitability. The company has been grappling with high cash burn rates, with $230 million burned in Q2 2025, up from $146 million in the previous quarter. InvestingPro data shows the company’s total debt stands at $992 million, though it maintains a moderate debt-to-equity ratio of 0.59 and a current ratio of 1.59, indicating sufficient liquidity to meet short-term obligations. This significant cash outflow has raised concerns about the company’s liquidity and its potential need for expensive debt or equity financing.

In response to these challenges, Plug Power has initiated a comprehensive cost reduction program. The company aims to achieve $200 million in annualized cost savings across various operational areas. These efforts are crucial for improving the company’s financial health and moving towards profitability.

Encouragingly, there have been signs of improvement in gross margins, which rose from -55% to -31% quarter-over-quarter. This progress is attributed to equipment cost reductions and better hydrogen pricing. Management has set an ambitious goal of reaching gross margin breakeven by the end of 2025, a target that will be closely watched by investors and analysts alike.

Regulatory Environment and Policy Impact

The regulatory landscape plays a significant role in shaping Plug Power’s prospects, particularly in the United States. The company has been navigating uncertainties surrounding the Inflation Reduction Act and potential changes to hydrogen production tax credits. These policy shifts have the potential to significantly impact the demand for Plug Power’s products and services in the U.S. market.

The clarification of the 45V Production Tax Credit (PTC) and 48E Investment Tax Credit (ITC) has provided some positive policy tailwinds for Plug Power. However, delays in finalizing these rules have slowed market adoption, creating short-term challenges for the company.

In response to these regulatory uncertainties, Plug Power has been actively exploring opportunities in European markets, including Denmark, France, Spain, Portugal, and the UK. This geographical diversification strategy aims to mitigate risks associated with U.S. policy changes and tap into regions with supportive clean energy initiatives.

Market Opportunities and Growth Potential

Despite the challenges, Plug Power remains well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for clean energy solutions. Based on InvestingPro’s comprehensive Fair Value analysis, PLUG currently appears to be trading near its Fair Value. For deeper insights into PLUG’s valuation and growth potential, including exclusive ProTips and detailed financial metrics, explore the full Pro Research Report available to InvestingPro subscribers. The company’s diverse product portfolio, which includes fuel cells, electrolyzers, and green hydrogen production capabilities, provides multiple avenues for growth.

One significant opportunity lies in the potential for hydrogen to supplement U.S. power grid shortages. As the energy sector continues to transition towards cleaner alternatives, Plug Power’s technologies could play a crucial role in addressing grid stability and reliability concerns.

Furthermore, the company’s expansion into European markets opens up new growth prospects. With many European countries aggressively pursuing decarbonization goals, Plug Power’s hydrogen solutions could find fertile ground for adoption and deployment.

Bear Case

How might the CEO transition impact Plug Power’s growth strategy?

The upcoming CEO transition from Andy Marsh to Jose Luis Crespo in March 2026 introduces an element of uncertainty to Plug Power’s growth strategy. While Crespo brings extensive experience with the company, any leadership change carries inherent risks. There may be a period of adjustment as the new CEO implements his vision, potentially leading to short-term disruptions in operations or strategic direction.

Moreover, the transition comes at a critical time when Plug Power is pivoting towards European markets and grappling with financial challenges. If the new leadership fails to execute this strategic shift effectively or struggles to address the company’s profitability issues, it could hinder Plug Power’s growth prospects and erode investor confidence.

What risks does Plug Power face in terms of liquidity and cash burn?

Plug Power’s high cash burn rate presents a significant risk to its financial stability. The company burned through $230 million in Q2 2025, an increase from previous quarters. This level of cash consumption raises concerns about Plug Power’s ability to fund its operations and growth initiatives without resorting to dilutive equity issuances or taking on expensive debt.

If the company fails to significantly reduce its cash burn or achieve profitability in the near term, it may face liquidity challenges. This could force Plug Power to seek additional financing on unfavorable terms, potentially diluting existing shareholders or increasing its debt burden. In a worst-case scenario, persistent liquidity issues could threaten the company’s long-term viability and ability to compete effectively in the rapidly evolving clean energy market.

Bull Case

How could Plug Power’s expansion into European markets drive growth?

Plug Power’s strategic pivot towards European markets presents a significant growth opportunity. Many European countries have ambitious decarbonization targets and supportive policies for clean energy technologies, creating a favorable environment for Plug Power’s hydrogen solutions.

By diversifying its geographical presence, Plug Power can tap into new customer bases and potentially secure large-scale projects. The company’s experience in the U.S. market could give it a competitive edge in Europe, allowing it to quickly establish a strong foothold. If Plug Power successfully executes its European expansion strategy, it could drive substantial revenue growth and reduce its dependence on the U.S. market, mitigating risks associated with policy uncertainties in a single region.

What potential does Plug Power have to capitalize on the growing demand for clean energy solutions?

Plug Power is well-positioned to benefit from the increasing global focus on clean energy and decarbonization. As governments and industries worldwide seek to reduce their carbon footprints, hydrogen technologies are gaining traction as a viable solution for various applications, including transportation, industrial processes, and power generation.

Plug Power’s diverse product portfolio, encompassing fuel cells, electrolyzers, and green hydrogen production, allows it to address multiple segments of the clean energy market. The company’s potential to supplement power grid shortages with hydrogen solutions could open up significant opportunities, especially as grid stability becomes a growing concern in many regions.

Furthermore, as the cost of hydrogen production continues to decrease and infrastructure expands, Plug Power could see accelerated adoption of its technologies. If the company can leverage its first-mover advantage and technological expertise, it could establish itself as a leader in the hydrogen economy, driving long-term growth and value creation for shareholders.

Longer lead times and rising costs are also delaying data center construction and grid expansion projects, underscoring the urgent need for increased domestic transformer manufacturing capacity to reduce dependence on foreign suppliers.
One such company, Pennsylvania Transformer Technology (PTT) – which Quanta acquired in 2023 – is expanding its manufacturing footprint to bolster domestic transformer production.
PTT, a domestic manufacturer of a wide range of sizes and types of power transformers for electric utility and industrial applications, is investing heavily in facility expansions in both Pennsylvania and North Carolina.
In 2024, a year after the PTT acquisition, Quanta acquired Niagara Power Transformer Corp., a Buffalo, N.Y.-based manufacturer of power transformers.","The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has issued a Request for Information (RFI) to kickstart its new Speed to Power initiative, seeking stakeholder input on how to best leverage DOE funding programs and authorities to rapidly expand energy generation and transmission grid capacity.

The timing of the initiative and the RFI is critical as the nation faces unprecedented load growth, driven by factors like data centers and electrification, and as DOE projects a staggering 260% increase in transformer capacity by 2050 to meet future demand.

“In the coming years, Americans will require more energy to power their homes and businesses, and with President Trump’s leadership, the Department of Energy is ensuring we can meet this growing demand while fueling AI and data center development with affordable, reliable, and secure sources,” U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Sept. 18.

In the RFI, which has a Nov. 21 deadline, DOE requests that commenters identify potential projects and challenge areas with specificity and supporting data.

“With the Speed to Power initiative, we’re leveraging the expertise of the private sector to harness all forms of energy that are affordable, reliable, and secure to ensure the United States is able to win the AI race,” said Wright.

The RFI underscores a growing national concern over the power grid’s capacity to handle explosive demand growth — with one of the largest bottlenecks being the critical shortage of transformers. Lead times have ballooned from months to as long as three years.

Driven by surging demand from electrification, data centers, and domestic manufacturing, the need for transformers has soared even as U.S. production capacity has lagged. The result is a heavy reliance on imports amid supply chain constraints.

Compounding the issue are shortages of essential materials such as grain-oriented electrical steel, copper, and aluminum, along with logistical challenges and a shortage of skilled workers in manufacturing and the electrical trades.

“This market imbalance is escalating costs and lead times and is delaying our ability to bring generating plants online in pace with the surging energy demand,” Ben Boucher, senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie, told Reuters in August, noting that utilities have been stockpiling transformers to ensure they have adequate supply.

Longer lead times and rising costs are also delaying data center construction and grid expansion projects, underscoring the urgent need for increased domestic transformer manufacturing capacity to reduce dependence on foreign suppliers.

The private sector is taking action, with new players investing to meet critical grid needs. As an example, Quanta Services Inc., the leading specialty contractor for the energy industry, has made several strategic acquisitions of key manufacturers of essential grid components, including transformers.

One such company, Pennsylvania Transformer Technology (PTT) – which Quanta acquired in 2023 – is expanding its manufacturing footprint to bolster domestic transformer production. PTT, a domestic manufacturer of a wide range of sizes and types of power transformers for electric utility and industrial applications, is investing heavily in facility expansions in both Pennsylvania and North Carolina.

Most recently, PTT announced a $102.5 million investment to expand its operations in Raeford, N.C., adding 300,000-square-feet across two new state-of-the-art facilities to increase manufacturing capacity of transformers to help reduce domestic supply chain bottlenecks and meet the high demand.

“This will not only enhance our production capacity, it will provide economic benefits to the community by creating additional well-paying, high-quality jobs and more broadly, contribute to the country’s economic growth,” said PTT President Sandeep Chakravarty.

In 2024, a year after the PTT acquisition, Quanta acquired Niagara Power Transformer Corp., a Buffalo, N.Y.-based manufacturer of power transformers. Quanta plans to invest in expansions and upgrades at Niagara’s 105,000-square-feet factory through 2030.

“We continue to see constraints on large transformers. The factory certainly helps us with that,” said Quanta CEO Duke Austin during last year’s third-quarter earnings call in which he mentioned the Niagara Power acquisition.

“Our backlog in the business has gotten longer, not shorter … The supply chain constraints are there. They’re real. We’re trying to do things in the lower 48 with the load that we see and so I think we’ll continue to see ourselves get in a good position to make sure that we can have self-performed capabilities both from a manufacturing standpoint, as well as to build and the craft skill labor on certain critical path items,” Austin added.

With federal initiatives like DOE’s Speed to Power and private-sector investments from companies such as Quanta Services, the path forward depends on aligning policy, production, and innovation to ensure the U.S. grid can meet the accelerating demands of the AI-powered, electrified economy.",https://dailyenergyinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shutterstock_2197288849-2.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 19:01:33.582062

General Motors (GM, Financial) introduces a $6,000 incentive program for electric vehicle leases, replacing the expired $7,500 federal tax credit.

GM's financial health shows consistent revenue growth and expanding operating margins, but faces challenges with debt levels and insider selling.

Valuation metrics suggest GM is fairly valued, with a P/E ratio close to its 3-year high, indicating potential market caution.

General Motors (GM) has decided not to pursue the $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit and will instead introduce its own $6,000 incentive program for electric vehicle leases through October. This change follows scrutiny over automakers like GM and Ford using IRS rules to continue offering credits despite the expiration of the government’s tax credit at the end of September. By purchasing vehicles through their finance arms, companies could previously claim tax credits indirectly. The move signals a shift in response to potential policy conflicts with green initiatives.

General Motors Co. emerged from the bankruptcy of General Motors Corp. (old GM) in July 2009. GM has eight brands and operates under three segments: GM North America, GM International, and GM Financial. The United States now has four brands instead of eight under old GM. The company regained its US market share leadership in 2022, after losing it to Toyota due to the chip shortage in 2021. 2024's share was 17.0%. The Cruise autonomous vehicle arm, which GM now owns outright, previously operated driverless geofenced AV robotaxi services in San Francisco and other cities, but after a 2023 accident, GM decided that it will focus on personal AVs. GM Financial became the company's captive finance arm in 2010 via the purchase of AmeriCredit.

With a market capitalization of $54.05 billion, GM operates within the Consumer Cyclical sector, specifically in the Vehicles & Parts industry. The company has demonstrated resilience and adaptability in a competitive market landscape.

Financial Health Analysis

General Motors has shown robust financial performance with a revenue growth of 24.3% over the past three years. The company's operating margin stands at 5.68%, indicating an expansion that is generally a positive sign for profitability. However, the net margin is relatively low at 2.55%, suggesting room for improvement in cost management.

On the balance sheet front, GM's debt-to-equity ratio is 2.05, reflecting a significant level of leverage. The current ratio of 1.22 and quick ratio of 1.05 indicate adequate liquidity to meet short-term obligations. However, the Altman Z-Score of 1.24 places GM in the distress zone, highlighting potential financial vulnerability.

Insider activity raises some concerns, with 10 insider selling transactions and no insider buying over the past three months, totaling 2,074,824 shares sold. This could be perceived as a lack of confidence in the company's near-term prospects.

Valuation & Market Sentiment

GM's valuation metrics suggest it is fairly valued in the current market. The P/E ratio of 8.68 is close to its 3-year high, indicating that the stock might be priced at a premium relative to its earnings. The P/S ratio of 0.32 and P/B ratio of 0.82 are within historical ranges, suggesting a balanced valuation.

Analyst sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with a target price of $60.85 and a recommendation score of 2.3, indicating a moderate buy. Technical indicators such as the RSI of 41.54 suggest the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, while moving averages provide a mixed signal.

Institutional ownership is strong at 85.34%, reflecting confidence from large investors, although insider ownership is low at 0.39%.

Risk Assessment

GM's financial health grades highlight some areas of concern. The Altman Z-Score indicates potential distress, while the ROIC of 3.47% is below the company's WACC, suggesting inefficiencies in capital utilization.

Sector-specific risks include the cyclical nature of the automotive industry and potential regulatory changes impacting electric vehicle incentives. GM's beta of 1.64 indicates higher volatility compared to the market, which could lead to significant price fluctuations.

Overall, while GM demonstrates strong revenue growth and expanding margins, challenges such as high leverage, insider selling, and potential financial distress warrant careful consideration for investors.",https://static.gurufocus.com/logos/0C00006B5P.png?20,N,,2025-10-08 16:01:42.645095

“RCEA is very concerned with the reports that the Department of Energy has plans to terminate the TERAS project,” said Eileen Verbeck, Deputy Executive Director of RCEA.
The TERAS project leverages local renewable energy generation, battery storage, and advanced grid control systems to strengthen Tribes’ energy independence, providing power to critical health and public safety needs.
About the TERAS Project The Tribal Energy Resilience and Sovereignty (TERAS) Project is a multi-Tribe, multi-partner initiative to design, build, and operate a network of community microgrids in Northern California.
The project combines innovative and proven technologies to deliver clean and reliable power, strengthen Tribal sovereignty, and create a scalable model for energy resilience in rural and Indigenous communities across the country.","On October 2, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced the termination of 321 financial awards supporting 223 projects nationwide. Among the rescinded awards is the Tribal Energy Resilience and Sovereignty (TERAS) Project, a regional initiative led by the Blue Lake Rancheria Tribe, Hoopa Valley Tribe, and Yurok Tribe, in partnership with the Redwood Coast Energy Authority (applicant), the Schatz Energy Research Center (project design and development lead), and Pacific Gas and Electric Company (local utility).

In January 2025, RCEA entered into a conditional award agreement with DOE’s Grid Resilience Innovations Program for $87.6 million to support TERAS. The funding was intended to build a network of Tribally owned and operated community microgrids designed to address persistent power reliability issues across Northern California’s rural and mountainous terrain. While DOE has not directly notified RCEA of a change in award status, the TERAS project appeared on a circulated list of terminated projects.

“RCEA is very concerned with the reports that the Department of Energy has plans to terminate the TERAS project,” said Eileen Verbeck, Deputy Executive Director of RCEA. “We remain hopeful that the federal government will continue to support this project, but in the event of termination, we will pursue alternative funding to ensure the successful completion of this critical work.”

The TERAS project is designed to support more than 140 miles of power lines on the Hoopa 1101 circuit, which experiences some of the most frequent and longest-duration power outages in the state. This electricity circuit serves communities along the Trinity and Klamath Rivers — including Hoopa, Weitchpec, and Orleans — which are home to essential government services for the Hoopa Valley, Yurok, and Karuk Tribes. Already, Tribal Nations pay 56% higher electricity prices than the U.S. average and experience 6.5 times more outages. Along the Hoopa 1101 circuit, families and Tribal facilities currently experience dozens of outages each year, which take their local water, critical communication, and health systems offline, increase the risks to elders during heat waves and freezing weather, interfere with classroom education and information access, and cause a significant loss in stored food and other supplies.

The TERAS project leverages local renewable energy generation, battery storage, and advanced grid control systems to strengthen Tribes’ energy independence, providing power to critical health and public safety needs. The Blue Lake Rancheria Tribe’s nationally recognized microgrid system would serve as the pilot site for new technologies, providing a model for other rural and Tribal communities facing similar challenges nationwide.

[DISCLOSURE: The Blue Lake Rancheria is a minority owner of the Outpost’s parent company, Lost Coast Communications, Inc.]

“We are deeply disappointed by this news, as the TERAS project represents years of technical design, multi-tiered partnership, and extensive regulatory and policy review,” said Linnea Jackson, General Manager of the Hoopa Valley Public Utilities District. “Most importantly, TERAS will provide critical energy resiliency in our remote region of Northern California, where reliable power is a daily necessity for health, safety, and community well-being. The Hoopa Valley Tribe remains strong and steadfast in pursuing other solutions and pathways to ensure this project moves forward and our people have the resilient energy systems they deserve.”

Despite the federal uncertainty, the TERAS team affirmed its unified commitment to advancing the project. Philanthropic and purpose-driven partners now have a unique opportunity to help advance a first-of-its-kind, scalable model for community-owned microgrids that can be replicated in other regions facing climate and infrastructure challenges.

The majority of that growth comes from the solar sector, underscoring the importance that the renewable energy sector plays in India’s long-term decarbonization goals as well as providing enough electricity to meet the rise in energy demands from its citizens. Several industry insiders have praised the accelerated adoption of the renewable energy sector in the region.

Solar power is leading the transition of India’s energy sector in the first half of this year

For a nation as industrious as India, innovation and an accelerated adoption process of technology are key. For many generations, India has lagged behind the rest of the world in reducing its vast emissions from the energy sector. India has extreme levels of poverty, and as such, the government is responsible for developing new and innovative solutions to the nation’s energy needs that do not make electricity more expensive.

According to state energy department data, India has seen a significant increase in renewable energy projects, adding much-needed electricity to the national grid. Among the biggest contributors during the first half of the year are:

Solar power – 22,806 MW

Wind energy – 14,235 MW

Large hydro – 1,990 MW

Small hydro – 113 MW

Biopower – 129.8 MW

The pace of the renewable energy buildout in the Indian state of Gujarat is astonishing

Several nations around the world have implemented significant measures aimed at curbing the reliance on the conventional energy sector in favor of the possibilities presented by the renewable energy sector.

Industry analysts have noted that the surge in production can be attributed to several factors, including but not limited to:

Favorable government policies – India’s government is incentivising the renewable energy sector with favorable policies aimed at increasing the output for the sector.

The commissioning of large-scale solar parks and hybrid projects – India has commissioned several massive projects, as well as a new hybrid solar/wind project that is the first of its kind.

Improvements in transmission infrastructure – Improving the existing infrastructure would allow faster grid integration.

Another factor to consider is the falling project costs and rising corporate demand for clean energy. The rapid surge in the renewable energy sector reinforces the Asian nation’s goal of achieving 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2070.

The news of India adding several companies to the Approved List of Models and Manufacturers (ALMM) List-II has been welcomed by industry insiders. An industry analyst has stated his thoughts on the nation’s surge in solar power capacity.

“Aggressive govt policy coupled with a favourable atmosphere has driven the growth in RE installations. Gujarat has also set a benchmark in rooftop solar installations for other states to follow.

Strategic Implications for Energy Companies Texas remains the core of the U.S. energy economy, and TXSE’s approval creates a regulatory and financial platform potentially tailored to that sector.
Key Considerations: Legislative Support: Texas Senate Bill 1057 offers favorable governance treatment for companies listed on Texas exchanges—providing incentives even for non-Texas-based companies to list locally.

For decades, U.S. equity markets have been dominated by two national exchanges: the NYSE and Nasdaq. The SEC’s approval of TXSE introduces a new contender, potentially increasing competition in trading, listings, and market structure.

One of TXSE’s core ambitions is to help reverse the long-term decline in U.S. public companies. In the 1990s, the U.S. had over 8,000 listed companies; today, that number has fallen to around 4,400. TXSE seeks to compete directly in listings, targeting mid- to large-cap companies. It has adopted a mandatory confidential pre-application review and has publicly noted that approximately 35% of currently listed U.S. public companies would not meet its listing criteria.

Strategic Implications for Energy Companies

Texas remains the core of the U.S. energy economy, and TXSE’s approval creates a regulatory and financial platform potentially tailored to that sector.

Key Considerations:

Legislative Support: Texas Senate Bill 1057 offers favorable governance treatment for companies listed on Texas exchanges—providing incentives even for non-Texas-based companies to list locally.

Lower Compliance Burden: While maintaining federal compliance, TXSE intends to streamline the listing process, potentially reducing ongoing costs compared to legacy exchanges.

Industry Alignment: Major TXSE shareholders include Kelcy Warren, executive chairman of Energy Transfer, who owns over 30% of the exchange’s parent company. Other major investors include BlackRock, Citadel Securities and Charles Schwab.

Existing Exchanges & Flexibility: NYSE launched “NYSE Texas” in Dallas. Nasdaq has also announced plans to open a regional headquarters in Dallas. Early indicators suggest energy companies—particularly midstream, E&P, and transition-focused firms—may consider dual-listing, migration, or spinout listings on TXSE. Notably, NRG Energy recently dual-listed on “NYSE Texas,” signaling increased regional diversification in exchange strategy.

Without the tax credit, analysts and automakers predict a steep drop in sales, at least temporarily.","General Motors Co. no longer will apply for federal electric vehicle tax credits as part of a scheme to extend savings to customers after Congress and President Donald Trump axed the government incentive program in September, the Detroit automaker confirmed Wednesday.

The company will continue to offer about $6,000 in savings on EV leases through October, with the cost footed by GM. The federal tax credit offered savings up to $7,500.

“GM worked on an extended offer for the benefit of our customers and dealers,” according to a GM statement. “After further consideration, we have decided not to claim the tax credit. GM will fund the incentive lease terms through the end of October.”

GM and crosstown rival Ford Motor Co. used their finance arms to place down payments on EVs in inventory from dealerships at the end of September. That would enable the companies to apply for the federal tax credits before the program expired Sept. 30 and then extend the discounts to their customers through leases beyond the deadline. Reuters was first to report GM's reversal Wednesday.

A Ford spokesperson declined to comment Wednesday on whether the Dearborn automaker will reverse course on its tax credit plan.

Sources familiar with the matter said U.S. Sen. Moreno, R-Ohio, met with both GM and Ford and pressured the automakers to abandon the tax credit plan.

The automakers’ plan was to pass along savings to lessees to avoid a sudden price uptick following the loss of the tax credit.

Most EVs cost thousands of dollars more than similar gas-powered models, a top reason why the electric market is lagging in the United States. Without the tax credit, analysts and automakers predict a steep drop in sales, at least temporarily.

Ford CEO Jim Farley said last month he wouldn't be surprised if U.S. EV sales are halved following the loss of the tax credit.

The idea behind Ford and GM’s programs was to help EV buyers transition away from discounted prices with the end of the government incentives.

Solar: Exposed to trade policy more than any other resource, solar faces a wide range of cost impacts.
While not as tariff-sensitive as solar, policy changes still shift wind’s relative cost-competitiveness.
Battery Storage: Tariff impacts are smaller in range but more certain, largely due to dependence on imported lithium-ion cells.
Slower solar development may also hamper battery economics in the medium to longer term.","Kushal Patel, Gregory Gangelhoff, Tali Perelman and Amber Mahone are colleagues at Energy and Environmental Economics.

The U.S. electric system is embroiled in a phase of rapid change and great uncertainty. Demand growth is accelerating and sudden policy changes threaten project viability. The path forward will hinge less on predicting exact outcomes and more on preparing for a wide range of possibilities.

After years of relatively flat load growth at the national level, electricity demand is growing at the fastest rate in decades. E3’s modeling projects national growth of between 1.1% and 2.2% annually through 2035, driven by data centers, electric vehicles, heat pumps and manufacturing. These sectors continue to expand robustly, despite federal rollbacks on clean energy and advanced manufacturing incentives.

But just when new generation development is becoming indispensable for meeting rapidly increasing demand, the economics of building resources have been thrown into turmoil. Federal actions, most notably the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, combined with recent tariffs, have reshaped costs and created unprecedented uncertainty around answering a seemingly simple question: “How much do new renewables, energy storage and natural gas generation cost?”

Restrictions associated with Foreign Entities of Concern, or FEOC, in the OBBBA also cast doubt on federal incentives in the near term, separate from the cost impacts above. Trade restrictions are especially affecting the economics of solar and wind. Reciprocal tariffs and Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duties, or AD/CVD, have been finalized on imported solar equipment and are still in progress for storage, both aimed at addressing concerns about international pricing and supply chain dependence.

These shifting policies are already reshaping project timelines and market behavior, with developers responding in markedly different ways. In the near term, the rush to build before incentives expire is driving extreme price dispersion, even for identical technologies. Price dispersion reflects project realities: some projects are racing to lock in equipment and secure contracts before tariff step-ups or tax credit cliffs, while others are holding off, unsure how long the current conditions will last. In this environment, two wind or solar projects that look the same on paper can exit construction with very different cost profiles and pricing risks. Even projects already selected through requests for proposals are not immune, as unexpected cost pressures are leading developers to request offtaker contract protection upfront or via renegotiation.

Below are the results of E3’s updated resource cost forecasts incorporating recent federal and congressional action. The arrows represent how OBBBA and tariffs change costs for each technology relative to prior expectations. For instance, tax credit expirations and FEOC rules create added risk for solar and wind, while batteries face high but more predictable tariff exposure.

Solar: Exposed to trade policy more than any other resource, solar faces a wide range of cost impacts. Capital costs could increase by 30% to over 300%, depending on AD/CVD tariffs. Corresponding levelized costs could rise by 44% to 470%. Solar also faces reduced long-term certainty from OBBBA’s shorter tax credit timeline. If projects experience only reciprocal tariffs and minimum AD/CVD tariffs announced by the Commerce Department, E3 would expect levelized costs to increase by up to 114%. This is before incorporating FEOC dynamics, however, which E3 would expect to further increase costs all else being equal.

Wind: Wind is similarly affected by earlier expiration of production and investment tax credits, which introduces uncertainty around project economics in the 2030s. While not as tariff-sensitive as solar, policy changes still shift wind’s relative cost-competitiveness. Furthermore, increasing federal hostility to wind development, such as restricting development on federal land and revoking permits for projects already under construction, seem to pose greater risk to wind than solar.

Battery Storage: Tariff impacts are smaller in range but more certain, largely due to dependence on imported lithium-ion cells. Battery projects are less affected by OBBBA’s tax credit revisions, with eligibility extending through 2032. Under safe harbor provisions, which let developers preserve credit eligibility based on when construction begins, some projects could still qualify through 2036 before a credit phase-out period begins. Storage may be more susceptible to risk of FEOC non-compliance, however, given the dependence of the current supply chain on China. Slower solar development may also hamper battery economics in the medium to longer term.

Gas: Under the highest tariff assumptions, the competitiveness of new gas combined cycle plants is enhanced, most notably for projects requiring around-the-clock power. These dynamics could influence build decisions through 2029, with the greatest effect on projects still in early planning or pre-construction phases. The rapid increase in data center load also enlarges the market for CCGTs due to higher run times. Gas CTs may also maintain an advantage over battery storage for peaking applications, at least until battery supply chains can adapt to the new tariff regime.

For most resources, tariffs introduce greater potential cost pressures than OBBBA’s shortened tax credit windows. Critically, we must avoid over-indexing to recent policy and tariff actions or assuming a smooth return to Inflation Reduction Act incentives post-2028. America’s polarized political environment points strongly to continuous policy volatility, with frequent swings that can lead to sudden market accelerations, crunches, pauses, or complete reboots.

This table shows tariff impacts for key technologies as represented in E3’s RECOST model and market report for July 2025. Tariff inputs shown here should be interpreted as reasonable points on a wide spectrum of potential tariff rates that could apply to projects.

The net effect of these changes indicates a near-term rush to develop existing renewable projects seeking safe harbor from changing credits and tariffs. Meanwhile, accelerating load growth will continue to drive development of battery energy storage and new thermal generation projects.

This pattern is likely to generate a boom-and-bust cycle for developers of both renewable and conventional projects: rapid deployment while incentives last, potential pauses in expiration years as developers wait to see if extensions are authorized, and the risk of a lasting slowdown if federal tax benefits are not renewed.

This investment climate will also trigger changes to planning, procurement, permitting and development strategies:

Resource planning will need to encompass a wider range of load and price possibilities. Flexible plans will lead to better outcomes for ratepayers in an uncertain world.

Procurement strategies will tilt toward established and reputable developers, while preserving contractual and technological optionality through flexible contract structures, like power purchase agreements with reopener clauses or development options that allow adjustments if costs or policies change unexpectedly. We’re seeing greater reliance on quantitative triggers in contracts that set clear thresholds associated with trade policy changes or load forecast deviations that automatically prompt contract or planning updates. This makes contract and policy monitoring more structured and less ad-hoc.

Development sites are likely to be planned with surplus interconnection capacity, phased build schedules, and adjacent parcels to create modularity, leaving open the option for storage add-ons, fuel switching, or clean-firm upgrades as needs arise and as technology costs change.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/2QBGmziF_434PL5cgL24hW1NhbW8glyYxi5YW7pwASg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9PQkJCQV9zaWduaW5nLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-10-08 16:02:13.187629

Lacy McManus, FUEL’s director of Workforce Development, told members of the Louisiana Clean Hydrogen Task Force on Tuesday that the program is focused on scaling proven initiatives that prepare students and workers for clean energy careers.

“I made the strategic decision to take the resources at my disposal and really look to scale what was already working in Louisiana,” McManus said, noting that about $1 million in grant funding has already been distributed across 14 workforce projects statewide.

Six months into those projects, McManus said interim reports show “tangible results” in education and training.

“We were thrilled to see the K-12 students we were able to reach over the summer through intensive programming, the graduate and higher ed students we engaged, and the many K-12 teachers we were able to influence as well,” McManus said.

The goal, she added, is to expose more young people and educators to opportunities within Louisiana’s evolving energy ecosystem – a key step toward retaining local talent as the state’s energy industry diversifies.

“This was just the tip of the iceberg that we were able to achieve in the last year,” McManus said.

Looking ahead, McManus said FUEL expects to announce another $45 million in National Science Foundation funding over the next three years, covering the next phase of the grant.

“Our mission for the next phase is to ensure we’re preparing an innovative energy workforce from all Louisiana communities to participate, benefit and contribute to our energy ecosystem,” McManus said.

The upcoming phase — covering years three through five of the NSF grant — will focus on three core areas, beginning with education and training partnerships across all levels, from K-12 to higher education and technical programs.

The FUEL initiative, led by Louisiana State University and supported by more than 50 public and private partners, is one of several federally funded “regional innovation engines” across the country. It is designed to accelerate energy research, commercialization, and workforce development while supporting local economies.

As part of that broader effort, Louisiana Economic Development previously committed $67.5 million in matching funds to the NSF’s grant – one of the state’s largest single investments in energy innovation.

“LED’s support through matching funds for the FUEL partnership is a strategic investment in Louisiana’s economic future,” said Josh Fleig, the agency’s chief innovation officer. “Energy has long been the backbone of Louisiana’s economy, and by investing in technologies and research that keep us on the leading edge, we’re ensuring our state remains a global industry leader for generations to come.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/22/9220c79c-b079-4183-beb7-b2fe2eeaff91/68de8c3e677b9.image.jpg?crop=1080%2C567%2C0%2C19,N,,2025-10-08 20:03:54.099821

“The Department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration,” DOE press secretary Ben Dietderich said in an email to Canary Media.

1PointFive didn’t immediately return Canary’s request for comment on the purported DOE funding cuts.
China, for example, has announced plans to build 37 domestic ​“carbon management and removal” projects by 2030, according to the Carbon Removal Alliance.","America’s fledgling carbon-removal industry is on edge following funding cuts from the Trump administration — and rumors of even further clawbacks to follow.

On Tuesday, a list of potential U.S. Department of Energy award terminations shared with Canary Media, and which circulated in Washington, included two giant direct air capture (DAC) hubs planned in Louisiana and Texas. Each project has received about $50 million to begin planning and developing CO2-sucking facilities, and together they are slated to receive up to $1.1 billion in federal support.

However, a spokesperson for DOE said that it is ​“incorrect to suggest those two projects have been terminated” and that no determinations have been made beyond the award cancellations announced last week. On Oct. 2, the agency said it was scrapping 321 grants totaling over $7.5 billion — including nearly $50 million to help 10 smaller DAC initiatives begin concept and engineering studies for future installations.

“The Department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration,” DOE press secretary Ben Dietderich said in an email to Canary Media. Following last week’s cancellations, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said more cuts would be announced, though he did not specify further.

The real and rumored grant terminations reflect the chaos and confusion that’s engulfed virtually every federally backed energy project since the start of the second Trump administration. Even developers whose awards haven’t been slashed — at least not yet — must try to navigate the lengthy and complicated funding process with an agency wracked by layoffs.

For carbon removal in particular, ​“a lot of these projects have kind of been in limbo this year, not sure of if they should commence and continue their work,” said Courtni Holness, the managing policy adviser for the nonprofit Carbon180. ​“There’s a lot of uncertainty around if they’re going to get continued funding, if they’ll be able to be reimbursed.”

While cutting greenhouse gas emissions is the most urgent and necessary way to tackle climate change, the world will also need to remove CO2 from the atmosphere in order to avert the worst consequences of a warming planet, climate scientists say. However, most carbon-removal solutions are early-stage, expensive, and largely unproven at any meaningful scale, making government support critical to their success.

The Biden administration launched the Regional Direct Air Capture Hubs program in 2023 with $3.5 billion in funding provided by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law. The DAC initiative was part of a broader push by the DOE to help the private sector deploy novel technologies at commercial scale.

Funding for the Louisiana and Texas megaprojects ​“represented the largest ever public investment in carbon removal,” said Erin Burns, executive director of Carbon180. If completed as planned, the hubs are each expected to create thousands of jobs in the regions where they’ll operate.

The South Texas DAC Hub is an initiative of the Occidental Petroleum subsidiary 1PointFive. The project is located just south of Corpus Christi and is expected to be capable of removing over 1 million metric tons of CO2 per year — roughly equal to the annual emissions from 2.5 gas-fired power plants. The project will use technology developed by Carbon Engineering, a company that 1PointFive acquired for $1.1 billion in November 2023.

DAC plants can use giant industrial fans to draw in large amounts of air, then separate out the carbon using chemical solutions or filtered materials. The captured CO2 can be injected into deep geological formations, or it can be repurposed to make valuable industrial products, such as concrete and synthetic fuels.

1PointFive didn’t immediately return Canary’s request for comment on the purported DOE funding cuts.

The company is separately building another DAC facility in the Texas Permian Basin that is designed to capture up to 500,000 metric tons of CO2 annually and could begin operating later this year. That project, called Stratos, will likely use captured carbon for ​“enhanced oil recovery,” a process that involves pumping the gas into older oil wells to force up any remaining fossil fuels.

Although Stratos didn’t receive a DOE grant, the operation will still likely benefit from the federal 45Q tax credit, which was expanded under the GOP-led budget law that passed in July — mainly for the benefit of carbon-capturing projects linked to oil production.

Meanwhile, in Louisiana, a coalition of companies is building a DAC hub called Project Cypress. Climeworks and Heirloom, two leading carbon-removal developers, are partnering with the applied-sciences organization Battelle to design and operate two facilities, which together are intended to capture over 1 million metric tons of carbon per year. The company Gulf Coast Sequestration will then take the captured CO2 and permanently store it in a deep saline aquifer.

Climeworks, a Swiss company, will use its fan-driven technology, a version of which is already operating in Iceland. The U.S. startup Heirloom will build a separate plant for its own DAC process, which involves heating trays of limestone inside kilns to turn the mineral into a ​“sponge” that absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere.

Vikrum Aiyer, Heirloom’s head of global policy, said on Tuesday that the company wasn’t ​“aware of a decision from DOE” to cancel its federal award and that the companies continue ​“to productively engage with the administration in a project review.”

Both the South Texas and Louisiana DAC hubs still face significant hurdles to crossing the finish line — including sourcing massive amounts of clean electricity to run their machines — even if they ultimately receive federal funding as promised. 1PointFive, for example, has run into local opposition, in part because of its association with the fossil fuel industry. Community advocates in both states have said they felt shut out of early planning processes that should have included them.

For DAC proponents, rescinding federal awards means the U.S. could risk losing out on the potential jobs and investment these first-of-a-kind projects are expected to create, especially as other countries press ahead. China, for example, has announced plans to build 37 domestic ​“carbon management and removal” projects by 2030, according to the Carbon Removal Alliance.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Climeworks-Mammoth-plant_2025-10-08-172604_gwam.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=3969166eeeb0fc1b88a6ad3bf70cf1ff,N,,2025-10-08 14:04:10.766957

But when the rubber meets the road, electric utilities are still turning to carbon-free energy sources.

In an annual Request for Proposals (RFP) issued this week, Dominion Energy Virginia (DEV) and Dominion Energy North Carolina (DENC) are exclusively seeking bids for power purchase agreements (PPAs) with new solar, onshore wind, and energy storage projects in Virginia and North Carolina. Dominion says the PPAs will support its customers’ future energy needs, as outlined in the company’s most recent Integrated Resource Plan. The projects associated with the PPAs will also support local jobs, increase spending in local communities, and bring in new tax revenue for local governments.

Dominion is interested in proposals for five categories:

New photovoltaic (“PV”) solar: Utility-scale (>3 MW) and distributed projects (<3 MW)

New PV solar generation co-located with energy storage

New onshore wind

New onshore wind co-located with energy storage

New stand-alone energy storage

The company will consider facilities located in Virginia and North Carolina. For distributed projects smaller than 3 megawatts (MW), the facilities must be located within the DEV or DENC service territories, where there are location grid benefits to Dominion Energy customers. Dominion encourages the submission of PPAs from solar, onshore wind, and energy storage projects on previously developed sites, such as former landfills or industrial uses.

All participating bidders must register by submitting an Intent to Bid Form and an executed confidentiality agreement (CA) by January 20, 2026. The Intent to Bid Form, CA, and other additional information on this RFP can be found near the bottom of the page linked here. The deadline for submitting proposals is February 9, 2026.

Why Renewables Still Make Sense

Love ’em or hate ’em, renewables comprise the bulk of new power generation coming onto the grid in the United States, accounting for about 90% of additions thus far in 2025 and roughly the same throughout all of last year.

Interconnection queues packed with clean energy projects can be explained to some degree by widespread federal support over most of the last decade, in addition to the more than two dozen states and territories actively adhering to emissions reduction legislation to the benefit of more than half the U.S. population.

The bottom line, however, is that solar, wind, and storage are the most cost-effective and fastest-to-market generation solutions available. Why wait for a gas turbine when a solar+storage site can be brought online in half the time? Even without tax incentives, most stakeholders recognize that renewables will play a sizable role in addressing unprecedented load growth spurred by data centers.

More Utilities Procuring Clean Power

Dominion Energy is far from the only utility seeking to add clean power to its system. Last month, fellow southern U.S. service provider Georgia Power got the green light from the Georgia Public Service Commission for five new PPAs, adding more than 1,000 MW of large-scale solar capacity across the state. The projects were selected through the company’s 2023 Clean and Renewable Energy Subscription (CARES) request for proposals, part of the utility’s 2022 integrated resource plan (IRP). Each facility will be built and operated by third-party developers under long-term PPAs.

The utility also received approval to procure 500 MW of energy storage, to be online no later than the end of 2031. That RFP, administered by independent evaluator Ascend Analytics on behalf of Georgia Power, solicits standalone storage with grid-charging capability and energy storage with new or existing renewable resources and grid-charging capability.

Xcel Energy subsidiary Southwest Public Service Company (SPS) announced new generation resource additions in July as part of an overall portfolio to meet the “rapidly rising” energy needs of its Texas and New Mexico service areas.

Even in an area rich in gas infrastructure, a significant portion of the utility’s 2024 request for proposals consists of bids for solar and wind projects. The selected portfolio included extensions of 521 MW of existing generation and 17 new power projects that will add 5,168 MW of new nameplate capacity and 3,121 MW of accredited capacity to the SPS system by 2030.

Associated Press

Several groups and nonprofit organizations filed a lawsuit Monday against the Environmental Protection Agency over the canceling of a $7 billion Solar for All program intended to make solar power accessible to more than 900,000 lower-income Americans.

They say the Trump administration’s termination of the program was illegal and they want a federal judge to direct the EPA to reinstate it. The program is affiliated with another $20 billion in green funding also terminated under President Donald Trump that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin had characterized as a fraudulent scheme fraught with waste.

The EPA said in an email Monday that it does not comment on litigation.

The lawsuit is the latest legal action against the administration amid its assault on clean energy policy and related funding and programs across the country. Trump has moved to boost production of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal.

The lawsuit filed in Rhode Island by the Rhode Island AFL-CIO labor organization and others — including the public interest law center Rhode Island Center for Justice and the nonprofit Solar United Neighbors — detailed the importance of the program for local workforces and lower-income communities looking for access to clean-energy project funding.

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, said Monday that the program’s termination kills jobs and will drive up electricity prices.

EPA rescinded Solar for All in August

The Solar for All money was rescinded after Trump’s massive tax and spending law passed in Congress in July. Zeldin said in a statement on social media at the time, “the bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.”

The groups argued in the lawsuit that the law only revoked climate grants not yet awarded by the EPA and that these solar funds were already awarded.

“The Trump administration’s rollback of the Solar for All program is a shameless attempt to prop up fossil fuel companies at the expense of families,” said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, one of the nonprofit legal advocacy groups representing the plaintiffs.

“This program would provide families with low incomes access to clean, affordable solar power: energy that lowers bills, improves air quality, and keeps people safer during extreme heat,” she added in a statement.

The lawsuit cites previous EPA estimates that the program would have saved recipients about $400 each year on electricity bills and cumulatively reduced or avoided greenhouse gas emissions by over 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

The program was part of a larger, climate-friendly funding push

The $7 billion Solar for All program was part of the $27 billion “green bank,” formally known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. It was established in the Democratic-backed climate law passed in 2022 under former President Joe Biden.

The other $20 billion, canceled by the Trump administration in March, was slated for eight community development banks and nonprofit organizations for tens of thousands of projects to combat the effects of climate change, such as residential energy efficiency projects to larger-scale investments such as community cooling.

Groups have also sued over the cancelation of that money — with a federal judge saying they must have access to some of the funds — though recently, an appeals court ruled that federal officials can move forward with its termination.

Trump’s assault on environmental policy and regulation

The Trump administration has targeted a host of programs and policies dedicated to clean energy.

Just last week, the administration canceled $7.6 billion in grants for hundreds of climate-friendly projects across 16 states. It has also interfered with nearly complete offshore wind developments, moved to rescind the crucial ‘endangerment finding’ that allows climate regulation, is looking to end greenhouse gas emissions reporting requirements for large polluters, and taken a slew of other deregulatory measures.",https://dailyreporter.com/files/2025/04/AP25107485680530.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 14:04:29.308236

Experts say that despite rising costs, there are steps consumers can take to make energy bills more manageable.
Switching providers could shave 10% to 20% off monthly utility bills, said Owen Quinlan, Arbor's head of data.
TURN is lobbying for utilities in the state to have spending caps tied to inflation, among other initiatives aimed at lowering consumer electricity bills.
""Legislators are paying attention, and a lot of them are reporting that the number one issue their constituents call them about is their rising utility bills,"" she said.","If you're a utility customer in the US, you've likely seen your rates go up this year.

Residents in at least 41 states and Washington, D.C., are experiencing increased electric and natural gas bills now or will see increases in 2026, according to a new report from the Center for American Progress.

Costs are rising largely due to the AI data center development boom and the resulting strain it has placed on the country's aging electric grid.

The good news is that, depending on which state you live in and your electricity provider, you might be able to lower your bill through energy conservation. The bad news is that simple steps such as unplugging devices and turning off the lights when exiting a room are ultimately no match for the pace of rising rates.

Data centers accounted for 4.4% of electricity consumption in the US in 2023, according to a report from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. That amount is expected to triple by 2028.

Utilities across the country are predicting an additional 60 gigawatts of new demand from data centers by the end of the decade. That's enough electricity to power six major cities.

Major utilities are planning multibillion-dollar infrastructure projects to meet the enormous demand expected to come from AI. Existing regulations will allow much of those costs to be recovered from a utility's entire customer base.

In August, regulators in Louisiana approved Entergy's plans to spend $5 billion on three new natural gas plants needed to serve a massive Meta data center in the state. Consumer advocacy groups opposed the plan, arguing that average ratepayers would ultimately bear the cost for one of the world's largest companies. Similar battles are unfolding before utility regulators in states across the country.

""It's really creating tremendous stress for a huge segment of the population that struggles to pay those bills,"" said David Conn, head of business development and policy at Exceleron, an energy management software company.

Energy and cost-saving tactics

If you've ever reviewed your energy bill, you may have noticed that many line items factor into a monthly total. While the amount of energy you use is supposed to be the largest part of the bill, utilities often tack on charges and service fees that don't have anything to do with individual consumption. Data centers are driving up the price of those additional charges, as well as the cost of electricity, making the energy you do consume more costly.

The bottom line: If you're a customer of a utility that also serves data centers, your bill is probably going to rise no matter how much energy you use.

""It's one of those things where consumers are fighting against an 800-pound gorilla, and that's a challenge,"" said Larry Paulhus, head of electric consulting at RINA North America.

Experts say that despite rising costs, there are steps consumers can take to make energy bills more manageable.

Arbor is part of an emerging class of new startups aiming to help.

Utility customers who live in one of the 14 states with a deregulated energy market can use Arbor's free app to find a different energy provider. Switching providers could shave 10% to 20% off monthly utility bills, said Owen Quinlan, Arbor's head of data.

Exceleron is another one. The company offers prepay programs for 75 utilities, including major providers like Georgia Power and Salt River Project in Arizona.

Prepay programs allow utility customers to pay their bills in advance, making them eligible for refunds later on if they consume less energy than they originally paid for. With Exceleron's software, customers can track how their daily energy consumption affects their bills, and adjust habits accordingly to lower the amount of their monthly bill.

It is difficult to know exactly how much money programs like these can save customers. There are many line items on an electric bill — such as costs for new transmission lines — that are out of an individual customer's control.

Reducing a home's energy consumption by 10% likely won't equate to a 10% lower bill, said Exceleron's Conn.

""It's probably going to be less than that, but every little bit helps,"" he said.

Natural gas prices are also on the rise right now, according to the US Energy Information Administration.

Curbing reliance on gas fuel can help lower energy bills in the long term, said Cooper Marcus, founder of QuitCarbon, who advises homeowners on energy management.

Replacing a gas boiler with an electric heat pump and installing solar panels on a home's roof can lead to significant long-term savings.

""These are not things that people do at once overnight, but that's okay,"" said Marcus. ""Homes last for decades. Our investment horizons should be decades.""

For people struggling to manage higher rates now, long-term solutions don't offer much relief.

""It's really understandable that people want some control over their expenses, and there are things that people can do to bring down those bills. It's just not realistic for so many people,"" said Sylvie Ashford, an analyst at The Utility Reform Network.

Ashford noted that in California, where TURN is based, 40% of the population are renters who can't install solar panels to reduce costs.

TURN is lobbying for utilities in the state to have spending caps tied to inflation, among other initiatives aimed at lowering consumer electricity bills.

""We try very hard not to make what we're doing political,"" Scaringe said on the ""Decoder"" podcast.

Donald Trump's administration has rolled back EV subsidies and signed a resolution to block a new gas-powered car sales ban.

Should a vehicle be associated with a certain political party? Rivian's CEO doesn't think so.

Electric vehicles have been caught in the crosshairs of Donald Trump's administration. The Trump administration removed the electric vehicle tax credit and signed a resolution to block California's plan to phase out new gas-powered car sales. Several automakers rolled back their EV plans, and analysts expect an industry-wide slowdown.

Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe wants to ""depoliticize electric vehicles,"" he said on the ""Decoder"" podcast on Monday. Scaringe said that EVs had ""become political.""

""They shouldn't be,"" he said.

Scaringe said Rivian employs almost 16,000 people domestically and has one of the ""strongest technology teams, I think, in the United States.""

""We spend a lot of time with the administration on that, and there's a lot of support and enthusiasm for what we're creating and building in that regard,"" he said.

The national emphasis on domestic manufacturing and reshoring the auto industry has bolstered gas-powered vehicles. In June, General Motors announced a $4 billion investment into US manufacturing plants, which included producing gas-powered vehicles to ""meet continued strong demand.""

Compare that to just a few years ago, when several large automotive companies were pledging to phase out the combustion engine.

In August, Scaringe said that he saw a ""reprioritization of capital towards internal combustion,"" one that was ""very bad for my kids and their kids, and very bad for the US auto industry.""

While Trump's policies are evenly applied to the EV industry, he has publicly supported a select few companies. For much of his presidency, Trump has lauded Tesla — one of Rivian's competitors — and even purchased one of the company's EVs.

On the podcast, Scaringe referenced a classic Michael Jordan quote from his partnership with Nike: ""Republicans buy sneakers, too.""

""We have a lot of Republicans who buy our vehicles and love them,"" Scaringe said. ""We have a lot of Democrats who buy our vehicles and love them. We have people who are in the middle, and we have Independents.""

But the opportunities can be easy to miss, and often require navigating a maze of requirements, said Bettina Bergoo, director of affordability and competition at the Virginia Department of Energy.

The department recently launched an online platform, called Energy Connect, which aims to make incentives more accessible, including tax credits, loans and direct assistance.

""It's Virginia's one-stop shop for information about energy savings programs,"" Bergoo said.

The goal is to help people lower their monthly electricity bills while also reducing stress on the regional power grid.

Power demand is expected to surge in Virginia over the next several decades, largely because of data centers that use huge amounts of electricity.

That demand is driving higher prices. Dominion Energy, for example, has proposed a series of rate hikes that would soon add about $21 to the average customer's bill.

Bergoo said the state especially wants to target households with a high energy burden, meaning they spend a disproportionate amount of their income, at least 6%, on energy costs.

Energy Connect is designed to serve homeowners, renters, businesses, multi-family property owners and residential contractors.

People can visit the interactive platform online and type in information such as location and income. The website then matches users with a list of incentives for which they could qualify.

Those include buying into clean energy solutions, such as electric vehicles, solar panels and battery storage.

Other programs promote energy efficiency, using better home insulation, appliances and HVAC systems to reduce overall power usage.

Many of the listed incentives will expire by the end of this year or next, following the Trump administration's rollback of programs associated with clean energy.

But some federal options will still be available, as well as others through electric utilities and state and local governments, Bergoo said.

For example, Virginia's annual sales tax holiday allows consumers to purchase certain Energy Star and Water Sense products tax-free, such as energy-efficient heat pumps, thermostats and showerheads.

Several programs, including Dominion's EnergyShare, also offer weatherization assistance at no cost to lower-income customers.

Bergoo said the state hopes to expand its new initiative to provide more information to contractors, including plumbers, HVAC technicians and installers of electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

""As more Virginians are taking advantage of these programs, that means more demand for contractors,"" she said. ""We want to ensure that they have not only the information about the programs, but also support in growing their businesses and getting the right training to grow the energy workforce.""

For people that prefer in-person help or lack reliable internet access, Virginia Energy plans to train a group of community members called ""energy ambassadors,"" who will begin local outreach later this year.

Toward the end of last month, GM devised a plan to have its in-house lending arm initiate the purchase of EVs in its dealers’ inventory. The company planned to apply for the federal $7,500 credit on those cars and then roll that money into EV lease terms for customers through the end of the year.

GM opted to kill the program after concerns were raised about it by Republican Senator Bernie Moreno of Ohio, a former car dealer who is active in auto policy, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.

“After further consideration, we have decided not to claim the tax credit,” the company said in a statement to Reuters on Wednesday, declining to elaborate on the reason for its decision.

The idea behind the program was to ease the impact of the expiration of the tax credit on dealers, who worried they would be stuck with EVs that would be tough to sell. GM had planned to apply for the credit on tens of thousands of EVs in dealer stocks, according to people familiar with the plan.

GM had planned to claim the credit on roughly 20,000 EVs that were on dealership lots or being shipped to stores, people familiar with the matter said. Its finance arm, GM Financial, began making down payments on those vehicles before the deadline to qualify for the subsidy on each of those cars, the sources said.

In its statement on Wednesday, the company said it would ""fund the incentive lease terms"" through the end of October.

The formula for determining the down payments that GM Financial paid to dealers on those EVs was 5% of the maximum price for each car. For example, GM Financial would have made a down payment of about $6,300 for two Chevrolet Blazer EVs, which top out in the mid-$60,000s, according to documents GM provided to dealers outlining the terms.

GM scrambled to put together the program just a few days before the September 30 tax-credit expiration, and outlined the details on a call with dealers on September 29, three sources said. GM officials had caught wind of a similar program that Ford was putting in place for its dealers, the sources said.

The Global PV Solar Energy Charge Controller Market size is expected to be worth around USD 495.1 Million by 2034, from USD 341.0 Million in 2024, growing at a CAGR of 3.8% during the forecast period from 2025 to 2034.

The solar charge controller industry plays a pivotal role in the renewable energy sector by regulating the voltage and current from solar panels to batteries, ensuring optimal performance and longevity of energy storage systems. This technology is integral to both off-grid and grid-tied solar installations, facilitating efficient energy management and storage.

Government initiatives significantly influence the adoption of solar charge controllers. In India, programs like the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM) and the National Solar Mission aim to promote solar energy in rural and agricultural sectors.

For instance, the Maharashtra government launched the SMART Solar Scheme, offering additional subsidies for rooftop solar installations to consumers using less than 100 units per month, especially targeting Below Poverty Line (BPL) and economically weaker sections. Similarly, the Punjab government plans to develop a 40 MW canal-top solar power project to expand renewable energy while preserving agricultural land.

The market is also witnessing increased investment in local manufacturing. For instance, Socomec, a French power solutions company, plans to invest $7 to $10 million in establishing a third manufacturing facility in India to meet the growing demand in the country’s power infrastructure sector. Additionally, the Indian government has mandated the use of locally-made solar cells in clean energy projects from June 2026, aiming to reduce reliance on imports and boost domestic manufacturing capabilities.

Government initiatives are also contributing to the growth of the solar charge controller market. For instance, the Indian government has set a target to achieve 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030, up from the current 156 GW. This includes a significant increase in solar energy capacity, which will drive the demand for solar charge controllers.

Government Initiatives Drive Growth in Solar Charge Controller Market

India’s commitment to expanding its renewable energy capacity has significantly impacted the solar charge controller market. The government’s proactive policies and initiatives have created a conducive environment for the growth of solar energy systems, thereby increasing the demand for efficient charge controllers.

In the fiscal year 2024–25, India added a record 21 GW of solar power capacity, contributing to a total of 25 GW of renewable energy installations. This surge was driven by various government schemes aimed at promoting solar energy adoption.

For instance, the Pradhan Mantri Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana (PMSG) was launched with an investment of over ₹75,000 crore to provide solar power to about 1 crore households, offering 300 units of free electricity every month. This initiative is expected to significantly increase the number of residential solar installations, thereby driving the demand for solar charge controllers.

Additionally, the Maharashtra government introduced the SMART Solar Scheme, providing additional subsidies for rooftop solar installations, particularly targeting Below Poverty Line (BPL) and economically weaker sections. This scheme is expected to benefit 5 lakh consumers, further accelerating the adoption of solar energy systems and, consequently, the need for efficient charge controllers.

Drivers

Government Initiatives Propel Growth in India’s Rooftop Solar Sector

In 2024, India witnessed a significant surge in rooftop solar installations, with 4.59 GW of new capacity added, marking a 53% increase compared to the previous year. This growth was largely driven by the government’s proactive initiatives aimed at promoting clean energy solutions across the country.

A notable policy in this regard is the PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana, launched in 2024. This scheme has been instrumental in facilitating the adoption of rooftop solar systems among households, especially in rural and underserved areas. By providing financial incentives and simplifying the installation process, the program has enabled nearly 900,000 households to embrace solar energy, thereby contributing to the overall increase in rooftop solar capacity.

Additionally, state-level initiatives have further bolstered this growth. For instance, the Maharashtra government’s SMART Solar Scheme offers additional subsidies for residential consumers using below 100 units of electricity per month, targeting economically weaker sections and Below Poverty Line (BPL) families. This localized approach ensures that the benefits of solar energy reach a broader segment of the population, promoting inclusivity in the transition to renewable energy.

These government-led initiatives not only facilitate the adoption of rooftop solar systems but also contribute to the overall growth and sustainability of the renewable energy sector in India. By addressing financial barriers and providing necessary support, these programs play a crucial role in empowering households to harness solar energy, thereby reducing dependence on conventional power sources and promoting environmental sustainability.

Restraints

High Initial Capital Costs Impede Widespread Adoption of Solar Charge Controllers

One of the primary challenges hindering the widespread adoption of solar charge controllers in India is the high initial capital cost associated with advanced technologies, particularly Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) controllers. These controllers, while offering superior efficiency and performance, come at a significantly higher price point compared to Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) controllers. For instance, a 1 kW MPPT system can cost up to ₹50,000, whereas a comparable PWM system may be available for approximately ₹30,000. This price disparity poses a substantial barrier, especially for low-income households and small-scale farmers who are the primary beneficiaries of government solar initiatives.

The financial constraints faced by these groups are further exacerbated by limited access to affordable financing options. While government schemes like the PM Suryaghar Muft Bijli Yojana and the SMART Solar Scheme aim to provide subsidies, the upfront costs remain a significant hurdle. For example, under the SMART Solar Scheme, a Below Poverty Line (BPL) household is required to contribute ₹2,500 for a 1 kW system, despite the state covering the majority of the cost. Such contributions, though minimal, can still be burdensome for economically disadvantaged individuals.

Moreover, the integration of solar charge controllers with other solar components, such as inverters and batteries, increases the overall system cost. The total expenditure for a complete solar setup can range from ₹1.5 lakh to ₹2 lakh, depending on the capacity and quality of the components. This cumulative cost deters many potential users from adopting solar solutions, thereby slowing the growth of the solar charge controller market.

Opportunity

A Promising Growth Opportunity for Solar Charge Controllers

Agrivoltaics, the integration of solar photovoltaic systems with agricultural activities, presents a significant growth opportunity for solar charge controllers in India. A recent study estimates the potential for agrivoltaics in India at 3,200 GWp, with states like Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan leading the way.

This vast potential is driven by several factors. Firstly, agrivoltaics allows for dual land use, enabling farmers to generate income from both crops and solar energy. Secondly, it provides a sustainable solution to the increasing energy demands of the agricultural sector, which currently accounts for a significant portion of India’s electricity consumption. For instance, Andhra Pradesh’s agriculture sector alone accounts for nearly 18,000 million units of power annually, creating a ₹10,500 crore subsidy liability for distribution companies.

The implementation of agrivoltaics requires efficient solar charge controllers to manage the energy produced and ensure optimal performance. These controllers regulate the charging of batteries and inverters, preventing overcharging and enhancing the lifespan of the system. As the adoption of agrivoltaics increases, the demand for advanced solar charge controllers is expected to rise correspondingly.

Government initiatives further bolster this growth opportunity. Policies such as the PM KUSUM (Kisan Urja Suraksha Evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan) scheme aim to promote the integration of solar energy in the agricultural sector. Under this scheme, farmers are encouraged to install solar pumps and grid-connected solar power plants, thereby reducing their dependence on conventional energy sources and enhancing their income.

Originally granted awards under former president Biden’s administration, the two projects in question are the South Texas DAC Hub by Occidental Petroleum’s subsidiary 1PointFive, and Project Cypress in Louisiana, a joint initiative between Battelle, Climeworks, and Heirloom.

A list published last week by Latitude showed the 321 financial awards that were cancelled as per DOE’s announcement released on Oct 2, 2025.

At that time, Project Cypress and the South Texas DAC hub were not among the initiatives affected by the terminated awards.

This week, however, a new list emerged that seems to indicate the federal funding for these two projects might be cut as well.

«It’s the best and worst time for carbon removal,» Julio Friedmann, Carbon Direct

The new DOE-issued list, obtained by MIT Technology Review, reportedly contains the names of the two projects and a column titled “latest status,” where the entry states “terminate” for the ~$50 million awards granted for each project.

The amount “to be terminated” matches the one approved as a first tranche of federal funding allocated to the projects, and it remains unclear whether a cancellation of this first portion means no further funding will be granted to Project Cypress and the South Texas DAC hub.

The original government support for these projects intended to provide each of the two DAC hubs with $500 million or more in total grants as they develop over time.

As climate solutions, the two DAC hubs would serve to pull atmospheric CO2 pollution as a complementary measure to the emissions reductions needed to meet global environmental targets on time and limit planetary warming to no more than 2°C.

The hubs would do this through a large-scale deployment of direct air capture technology, praised as an effective tool for tackling atmospheric CO2, but also considered challenging due to its high operational costs and intense energy demand.

In this regard, the DOE funding would provide a solid financial backbone for the deployment of Project Cypress and the South Texas DAC hub, helping the country advance on climate goals and fortify its global leading position in climate innovations, while also unlocking economic growth and thousands of new employment opportunities.

If the funding for these two projects is indeed cancelled, the U.S. could miss out on these benefits, raising questions on the future of the carbon removal field in the country.

The reports of the new DOE list have prompted reactions across the carbon removal industry, with many stakeholders coming out with public commentary.

As highlighted in a publication by the Carbon Business Council, the decision to terminate the funding for Project Cypress and the South Texas DAC hub would translate into a risk exposure for more than 130,000 jobs in the United States, along with paused factories, lost leadership edge, and billions of dollars of missed opportunities.

In a joint statement, Giana Amador of the Carbon Removal Alliance and Ben Rubin of the Carbon Business Council and publisher of the Carbon Herald stated:

“The U.S. DAC Hubs program, with $3.5 billion appropriated by Congress, was set to support the largest carbon removal facilities in the world and were intended to further establish American leadership in the sector. If funding for the TA-3 Hubs is cut, the door will be open for other countries to take up leadership of the industry, and claim the job creation and economic benefits of carbon removal.”

As renewable energy sources like solar and wind continue to scale, their intermittent nature poses a serious challenge to achieving true 24/7 power availability. The solution lies in Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) Market, which are redefining the way the world generates, stores, and consumes electricity. According to Fairfield Market Research, the Battery Energy Storage System Market has entered a transformative phase where innovation, government incentives, and grid modernization converge to make round-the-clock renewable power a reality.

The Role of Battery Energy Storage in Renewable Integration

Renewable energy, while clean and abundant, is inherently variable. Solar energy systems depends on daylight, while wind generation fluctuates with weather patterns. Without an effective energy storage mechanism, this inconsistency leads to grid instability and wasted potential. Battery energy storage bridges this gap by storing surplus power during periods of low demand and releasing it during peak hours.

Modern BESS solutions use lithium-ion, sodium-ion, and flow batteries to deliver grid-scale flexibility. This capability ensures that renewable energy can be dispatched on demand — not just when the sun shines or the wind blows. As a result, the integration of renewables into national grids becomes smoother, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and stabilizing power supply even during high-demand intervals.

Why 24/7 Renewable Power Matters?

The goal of 24/7 renewable energy is not just an environmental commitment — it’s an economic imperative. Businesses, industries, and governments are under pressure to meet net-zero emissions targets while maintaining cost efficiency and grid reliability. Achieving continuous renewable power allows for uninterrupted operations, minimizes outages, and reduces dependence on traditional energy sources that emit greenhouse gases.

Battery storage is key to this transformation. With robust storage systems in place, renewable energy can move from being a secondary power source to a primary one, capable of supplying energy whenever and wherever it’s needed. Countries like the U.S., Germany, and China are rapidly scaling up their storage infrastructure, setting global benchmarks for sustainable grid modernization.

How BESS Balances Supply and Demand in Real Time?

One of the most crucial advantages of the Battery Energy Storage System Market is its ability to balance electricity supply and demand dynamically. When renewable generation exceeds consumption, batteries absorb the excess power. Later, during peak demand or low generation periods, that stored power is released to the grid.

This flexibility minimizes energy curtailment and reduces dependency on gas-powered peaker plants. Moreover, advanced software and AI-driven control systems enable predictive energy management, ensuring that storage and dispatch cycles align perfectly with grid requirements. This balance is vital to supporting renewable energy penetration in both developed and developing regions.

Technological Advancements Driving the Battery Energy Storage Revolution

The performance and affordability of BESS have improved dramatically over the past decade. Technological innovations have focused on three key areas — battery chemistry, energy density, and system efficiency.

Lithium-ion batteries remain dominant due to their proven scalability and efficiency. However, emerging technologies like solid-state batteries and redox flow batteries are gaining traction, offering longer lifespans and enhanced safety. Meanwhile, improvements in energy management systems (EMS) and thermal regulation ensure that storage units operate optimally under varied environmental conditions.

Furthermore, the rise of second-life EV batteries — repurposed from electric vehicles — has opened new sustainability pathways. These repurposed cells provide affordable storage solutions, extending battery life cycles and reducing waste in the renewable ecosystem.

Grid Resilience and Decentralized Power Generation

Energy storage is not limited to utility-scale grids; it also empowers communities and industries to generate and store their own energy. This decentralization strengthens grid resilience and reduces the risk of widespread blackouts.

Microgrids and community-based storage projects are rapidly expanding across rural and remote regions. These localized systems ensure continuous access to power, even when main grids fail or natural disasters strike. In addition, smart grid infrastructure allows utilities to integrate multiple distributed energy resources (DERs), enabling a two-way power flow between producers and consumers.

In regions such as Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America, Battery Energy Storage Systems are accelerating electrification efforts, providing reliable power for hospitals, schools, and small businesses.

Policy Support and Global Investments Accelerating Market Growth

The Battery Energy Storage System Market is thriving thanks to proactive government policies and strong investment momentum. Nations across the globe are introducing subsidies, tax credits, and renewable energy mandates to drive adoption.

In the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act offers long-term investment tax credits for standalone energy storage projects. The European Union’s Green Deal and the United Kingdom’s Energy Security Strategy emphasize large-scale storage as a core enabler of decarbonization. Meanwhile, Asia-Pacific economies — particularly China, India, and South Korea — are emerging as key manufacturing and deployment hubs for advanced storage technologies.

Private investors and energy giants are also accelerating deployment. According to Fairfield Market Research, investment in grid-scale battery storage projects has grown exponentially, as companies recognize the strategic importance of storage in achieving net-zero energy systems.

Applications Beyond the Grid: Industrial and Residential Adoption

Battery energy storage is no longer confined to large utility installations. Industries, commercial facilities, and households are increasingly installing energy storage systems to reduce energy costs, improve efficiency, and enhance energy independence.

Industrial users leverage storage for peak shaving, ensuring operations remain stable during demand surges. For residential consumers, home battery systems paired with rooftop solar panels are becoming mainstream, enabling self-consumption and backup power during outages.

As storage prices continue to fall, decentralized adoption will drive the next wave of growth, creating a multi-dimensional market ecosystem that spans households, commercial buildings, and public infrastructure.

Building a Sustainable Energy Future

The path to 24/7 renewable energy is clear — and Battery Energy Storage Systems are paving the way. With advancements in chemistry, intelligent control systems, and supportive regulatory frameworks, battery storage is no longer a futuristic concept but a commercial reality transforming the global energy landscape.

As nations aim for carbon neutrality, storage solutions will remain central to integrating renewables, stabilizing grids, and empowering consumers. The Battery Energy Storage System Market is set to expand not just in volume but also in strategic importance, becoming a cornerstone of the clean energy revolution.

While the state hasn’t been building new gas generation, it has connected gigawatts of new solar and batteries each year.","California has labored for years to build enough clean energy to wean itself off fossil fuels. Now the effort is paying off in an undeniable way.

President Donald Trump’s Department of Energy might tweet that solar plants are ​“essentially worthless when it is dark outside.” But in California, batteries are proving the opposite, by shifting ever more solar into evening and nighttime hours. Consequently, solar generation hit new highs in the first half of the year, and fossil-gas generation has fallen rapidly in turn.

From January to July, as noted by Reuters, solar generation delivered 39% of the state’s generation, a record level, while fossil fuels provided just 26%, a new low since the dawn of modern gas power. In April, a temperate shoulder month, gas generated less than 20%. For context, across all of last year, solar provided 32% of California’s power — the highest rate of any U.S. state — nearly unseating gas as the largest source of power.

Initially, California’s billions of dollars in solar subsidies and suite of supporting policies couldn’t overcome the state’s gas dependency. The solar systems cranked out excess power through the sunny hours, much of which got curtailed for lack of simultaneous demand, then California turned to fossil fuels to keep the lights on at night. That addiction at times overpowered the state’s environmental ethos: California even opted in 2020 to waive enforcement of a regulation protecting marine life because it would have shuttered a number of coastal gas plants that the grid wasn’t ready to lose, despite having a decade to prepare for the rule.

Such desperation gave temporary succor to solar skeptics and gas boosters. But when an energy system starts to change, snapshots in time are less instructive than the trend lines. And California’s trend lines have been pointing in one direction.

While the state hasn’t been building new gas generation, it has connected gigawatts of new solar and batteries each year. These resources are nearly free to operate once built, while gas plant owners have to buy fuel to combust and keep complex machinery in fine working order. And the price of gas has been going up, amid greater demand both at home (due to data center expansion) and abroad (with liquefied exports going to the highest bidder). Now California’s gas plants have more competition in the peak hours from cheaper, cleaner resources; they’re getting squeezed toward fewer hours of intense demand.

But it would be a mistake to think that these trends stop at the Sierra Nevada. Indeed, these patterns are playing out nationally: Very little new gas capacity is getting built, quite a lot of solar and batteries are, and gas prices are going up.

Some regions allow developers to respond nimbly to these trends, namely Texas, which indeed has leapt ahead of California in its pace of solar and storage installations. Other regions obstruct such dynamism and face the consequences, like the mid-Atlantic wholesale markets run by PJM, where skyrocketing capacity auctions are pushing costs to crisis levels.

California’s grid overhaul has been a long time coming, and one lesson here is that big changes — like redesigning the energy system for the world’s fourth largest economy — take time. But other states won’t have to wait as long: They can tap into a mature supply chain that scaled up thanks to California and other early adopters, plus the industrial expertise to design and manage large solar construction efforts and the financing options de-risked by years of data from earlier projects.

The federal government is trying to stymie renewables however it can. But California is demonstrating the rewards for getting solar to escape velocity, and that momentum is set to carry forward in the coming years.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2198226759.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=64e71656c59b62552714da3c5b8d16d1,N,,2025-10-08 13:08:38.296661

Tesla also announced a cheaper version of its Model 3 for under $37,000. For New York residents taking advantage of a state rebate, the price was below $35,000.

Tesla has talked about a cheaper car to appeal to more cost-conscious consumers for years, though the two new ""standard"" models are priced well above the $25,000 price tag promised. They come as customers are widely expected to hold off from purchases over the next several months due to the recent expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles.

Tesla stock fell 4.5% to $443.09 on Tuesday after closing the day before up more than 5% on anticipation of the new model announcement.

Compared to previous models, the new Model Y comes with a shorter 321-mile driving range, fewer audio speakers and a fabric interior, not microsuede. The model also lacks a panoramic glass roof and a touchscreen in the second row.

Reporting from Reuters suggests that these cuts stem from deficit left by the continuing government shutdown.","The transition from gasoline-powered vehicles to battery-electric propulsion requires adaptation by all involved parties, surely, but there's arguably no stakeholder more affected than those who actually produce the vehicles. Retooling factories that produced internal combustion models for decades costs a pretty penny—and now, domestic automakers like General Motors and Stellantis may have to dip further into their savings after a series of previously promised federal grants to help with the transition might be canceled.

Reporters at Reuters have reportedly viewed documents from the U.S. Department of Energy that indicate the federal agency is considering canceling around $1.1 billion in retooling grants awarded to the two domestic automakers. Specifically, GM was set to receive $500 million to convert its Lansing Grand River Assembly plant for EV manufacturing, while Stellantis was slated for $335 million to revived its shuttered Belvidere Assembly Plant for EV pickup production and $250 million to convert its Indiana Transmission Plant into an EV parts factory.

GM's Lansing facility was previously home to production of the Chevrolet Camaro as well as decades of Cadillac sedan models; it continues to produce the Cadillac CT4 and CT5 lines, though the automotive conglomerate has expressed interest in expanding its production capabilities for years. GM even announced its plans to expand manufacturing plans to include EVs as a result of the grant award back in 2024, citing the importance of a resilient supply chain and the necessity of offering a wide array of vehicles to its customer base.

Stellantis's stake in this grant award is arguably more vital, as the $335 million subsidy would allow the automaker to re-open its idled Belvidere, Illinois, plant. The factory most recently produced models like the Jeep Cherokee and Dodge Dart, but has a pedigree dating back to the L-body Dodge Charger hatchback and the Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue.

Global solar generation grew by a record 31% in the first half of the year, while wind generation grew by 7.7%, according to the report by the energy think tank Ember, which was released Tuesday. Solar and wind generation combined grew by more than 400 terawatt hours, which was more than the increase in overall global demand in the same period, it found.

""A turning point"" for global fossil fuel power generation

The findings suggest it is possible for the world to wean off polluting sources of power — even as demand for electricity skyrockets — with continued investment in renewables including solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal energies.

""That means that they can keep up the pace with growing appetite for electricity worldwide,"" said Małgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, senior electricity analyst at Ember and lead author of the study.

At the same time, total fossil fuel generation dropped slightly, by less than 1%.

""The fall overall of fossil may be small, but it is significant,"" said Wiatros-Motyka. ""This is a turning point when we see emissions plateauing.""

The firm analyzes monthly data from 88 countries representing the vast majority of electricity demand around the world. Reasons that demand is increasing include economic growth, electric vehicles and data centers, rising populations in developing countries and the need for more cooling as temperatures rise.

Meeting that demand by burning fossil fuels such as coal and gas for electricity releases planet-warming gases including carbon dioxide and methane. This leads to more severe, costly and deadly extreme weather.

China and India leading the green energy transition

Ember also dedicated part of its report to an analysis of China, India, the European Union and the U.S., which, combined, account for nearly two-thirds of electricity generation and carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector globally.

In the first six months of the year, China added more solar and wind than the rest of the world combined, and its fossil fuel generation fell by 2%, the report said.

India saw record solar and wind growth that outpaced the growth in demand. India's fossil fuel generation also dropped.

In both nations, emissions fell.

""It's often been said by analysts that renewable energy doesn't really lead to a reduction in fossil fuel use,"" said Michael Gerrard, founder and director of the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, who was not involved in the report. ""This report highlights an encouraging step in the opposite direction.""

U.S. and Europe see fossil fuel power generation increase

In the U.S., demand growth outpaced the growth of clean power generation. In the E.U., sluggish wind and hydropower generation contributed to higher coal and gas generation, the report said. In both markets, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased.

The U.S. clean energy market faces challenges as President Trump's administration shifts federal policy away from renewables and toward boosting coal, oil and gas production. The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.

Just last week the Trump administration announced that it would be canceling $8 billion in climate-related projects in 16 Democratically governed states, in funding cuts announced amid a federal government shutdown.

Russ Vought, head of the Office of Management and Budget, announced the cancellations on social media and said additional details would be provided by the Department of Energy. All of the states affected by the cuts voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, and all are represented by Democrats in the Senate.

Meanwhile, the administration has lifted barriers to coal mining, granted two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants and other polluting industries and dedicated millions of dollars to these coal plants.

In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly last month, Mr. Trump attacked renewable energy and questioned the validity of the concept of climate change.

Experts warn that Mr. Trump's efforts to block clean energy will have a long-term impact.

""The federal government is greatly increasing the growth of artificial intelligence, which is going to massively increase electricity demand, and they're also shutting down the cheapest new sources of electricity, wind and solar. That's going to lead to a gap in supply and demand,"" Gerrard said.

Renewables ""still have an opportunity to make inroads into displacing fossil fuels, even with some demand growth,"" said Amanda Smith, senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown, who also wasn't involved in the report.

Smith said that while she remained ""very cautiously optimistic that renewables can continue to grow and continue to displace fossil fuels in the U.S. I am more optimistic on the world scale.""",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/02/21/07820a9f-33b5-4901-a722-f791770cd5eb/thumbnail/1200x630/2aa1457a05e15e73f7c672fc54dd1f34/gettyimages-2192581301.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 13:09:00.876939

Agrivoltaics, the term for agriculture plus photovoltaics (solar energy technology), is a practice that can create efficient dual-use purposes for farmland.","Yesterday was one of those days when you can feel the world shifting. The thinktank Ember reported that for the first half of 2025 renewable energy produced more electricity than coal. More to the point, solar and wind grew so fast that they covered all the growth in demand for electricity so far this year, with room to spare.

That means that fossil fuel emissions for producing electricity plateaued—even fell slightly—over the first half of the year. It’s an epochal moment: it demonstrates that the clean energy transition is not destined to be the slow, dragged-out affair that most analysts would have predicted even five years ago.

“The fall overall of fossil may be small, but it is significant,” said one of the Ember researchers. “This is a turning point when we see emissions plateauing.” Fossil fuel use for electric generation fell 2 percent in China, and dipped in India as well.

We are allowed to celebrate good news—indeed, in the shadow of our disintegrating democracy it’s necessary that we celebrate what we can when we can. But not because this is a fait accompli—instead, because celebrations along the way give us new strength to push harder for faster change. Which we desperately need to do.

Because we we got new data about the earth this week too, and it’s epochal as well. And also bad. A study in Nature looked at four of the largest systems on earth—the Greenland ice sheet, the Atlantic currents, the South Asian monsoon, and the Amazon rainforest—and found that in each case “the stability of these four tipping elements has declined in recent decades, suggesting that they have moved towards their critical thresholds, which may be crossed within the range of unmitigated anthropogenic warming.”

Another way of saying this is: the damage from the carbon and methane trapping heat in our atmosphere has now reached the most critical systems for supporting life on our planet. We have very little time, if any.

And the other caveat to today’s good news is that it didn’t apply to the U.S.—growth in electric demand outpaced new renewable supply in this country, meaning that we poured more, not less, carbon into the air in the first half of the year. Which is hardly surprising, given the Trump administration’s all out war on clean energy. We are quickly emerging as the planet’s rogue nation, determined to deny climate and slow the energy transition as best we can, all in the name of selling more fossil fuel. As Mitchell Beer writes

“The forecast for the United States is revised down by almost 50%” from a year ago, the report states, after the Trump administration phased out federal renewable energy tax credits ahead of schedule, imposed severe import restrictions on renewables industries, suspended new offshore wind leasing, and curtailed wind and solar leasing on federal lands.

That sets up the third piece of epochal news, this one more about economics and hence politics. Though not many people paid too much attention, new data this week showed that China is now exporting more clean energy than the U.S. is exporting dirty energy.

The US, which has positioned itself as a major fossil fuel exporter, sold $80 billion in oil and gas abroad through July, the last month with data available. China exported $120 billion in green technology over the same period.

With that number, you can feel world leadership passing from Washington to Beijing. It’s even more remarkable because the thing that China is mostly exporting—solar panels—keeps getting cheaper and cheaper

Dollars only tell part of the story. The price of solar panels is falling, which means that China is exporting more of them per dollar earned. August’s solar export revenue was nowhere near the high set in March 2023. But the 46,000 megawatts of power capacity shipped abroad set a record.

As Edward White writes in the Financial Times,

While US President Donald Trump calls climate change a con, China is offering new technology and products to countries to develop green energy and to prepare for increasingly frequent and intense storms, floods and droughts.

Two days after our Changsha trip I attended a meeting in Beijing of Chinese officials and representatives of climate-vulnerable nations, a group that includes 74 nations with more than 1.8bn people.

Liz Thompson, a former UN assistant secretary-general and now climate change ambassador for Barbados, said just as climate-vulnerable states are hit by more disasters, they are hampered in their response because of a lack of access to technology and financing. “These challenges provide compelling reasons to work more closely with China,” she said.

Chinese officials and business leaders are keen to oblige. Zhang Shiguo, executive director of China New Energy International Alliance, an organisation backed by government associations and renewable companies, said the country’s green products had already reached 170 countries. “The reason China’s new energy sector has done well is the determination to act,” Zhang added.

The bewildering disgrace of America’s conduct in the world—a disgrace due entirely to the Trump administration, which continues to dismember the Biden-era efforts to compete with China in the clean energy field—is outweighed by the good news from the rest of the world: the atmosphere doesn’t care which nation the co2 comes from. But it should be one more spur—alongside the sickening pictures from Chicago—for all of us to do what we can to restore the rule of reason in our country. No Kings Day is October 18. Here’s a guide that we at Third Act have put together for finding the demonstration near you.

+Surprising no one who’s been paying attention, a big new study finds that carbon offsets have been an abysmal failure. As Ajit Naranjan chronicles

The failure of carbon offsets to cut planet-heating pollution is “not due to a few bad apples”, a review paper has found, but down to deep-seated systemic problems that incremental change will not solve.

Research over two decades has found “intractable” problems that have made carbon credits in most big programmes poor quality, according to the study. While the industry and diplomats have made efforts to improve the system, it found much-awaited rules agreed at a UN climate summit last year “did not substantially address the quality problem”.

“We must stop expecting carbon offsetting to work at scale,” said Stephen Lezak, a researcher at the University of Oxford’s Smith School and co-author of the study, in Annual Reviews. “We have assessed 25 years of evidence and almost everything up until this point has failed.”

Carbon offsets are a tool to cut emissions efficiently by crediting rich polluters for financing cheap climate action abroad while pumping out the same amount of planet-heating gas at home.

+I think Solar United Neighbors is one of the most remarkable groups in the country. They’ve concentrated on helping people build rooftop solar, but in the wake of Trump’s trashing of tax credits for that work, they’ve also been pushing for larger solar farms. They have a way of talking about renewables that makes sense to many people: here’s a bit of their recent work in Indiana, which will hopefully serve to counter the industry disinformation that has scotched many projects across the heartland

Creating energy isn’t a new endeavor on Indiana farmland. In 2024, 43% of Indiana’s corn went to ethanol production. But, in terms of land-use efficiency, solar beats ethanol in multiple metrics. Most importantly, solar is 20 times more efficient than ethanol, even when accounting for useful byproducts such as animal feed. Harvesting solar energy rather than ethanol leads to less pollution from fertilizer runoff and less erosion from tillage while providing a new drought resistant revenue stream.

The loss of farmland should be taken seriously, but the reality is that solar is not the driving force of farmland loss. Between 2013 and 2021, only 5% of lost Indiana farmland was converted to energy production (which includes new wind, natural gas, biomass, and solar production), while 68% of lost agricultural land was developed into homes and neighborhoods. And solar, unlike housing developments, can be returned to agricultural land at the end of its useful life.

Adding solar does not have to stop agricultural production on farmland. Agrivoltaics, the term for agriculture plus photovoltaics (solar energy technology), is a practice that can create efficient dual-use purposes for farmland. In Indiana, there are already a growing number of sheep herds, pollinator habitats, and crop studies under solar panels.

And on this question of land use, here’s Mark Jacobson of Stanford on video busting all the myths about renewables and land use. A good thing to forward to people worried about this

+China is quickly building a network of offshore wind turbines designed to withstand the typhoons that often strafe the coast

A good example is a model called OceanX manufactured by China’s Mingyang Smart Energy Group.

With a floating foundation, the OceanX model supports not just one but two turbines. The main reason behind the unique design is to increase the platform’s output. Compared to a single turbine whose blades swipe across the same area as OceanX’s two turbines combined, OceanX can generate 4.29% more electricity, according to Mingyang. This is because the two turbines’ blades spin side by side in opposite directions – one clockwise and the other anti-clockwise – so the wind between them will blow faster, enabling more electrical energy to be converted from air kinetic energy, the company says.

But the floating platform also has plenty of intriguing features to counter typhoons and stay balanced during extreme weather, says Wang Chao, the turbine’s chief designer. For example, its foundation is tied to the bottom of the ocean by ropes via one single point underneath it. This allows the structure to change its orientation more easily to be aligned with the wind. “As long as the turbines face the typhoon, the load (forces) they take will be the smallest and they will be the safest,” Wang says

+For years, the fossil fuel industry has used ‘stability’ as an argument against renewable energy on the grid. But as batteries have plummeted in cost, that’s actually become one of the biggest selling points: solar plus batteries, for instance, were credited with stabilizing the Texas grid this summer, even amidst high temperatures. What doesn’t help? Coal. The newest, biggest coal-fired power plant in the U.S., also in Texas, went offline after a catastrophic accident in April. It now appears it will be out of service until…April 2027. As Seth Feaster explains,

The outages at Sandy Creek are also reminiscent of the operating problems at another major new coal plant. Comanche 3, a 750-MW coal-fired unit in Colorado that came online in 2010 and is majority-owned by state-regulated utility Xcel Energy. From its opening, it had a history of unexpected and costly outages, capped by a year-long closure starting in January 2020 that was caused by a catastrophic loss of lubricating oil, extensively damaging the turbine and generator.

Facing a backlash from ratepayers and the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, Xcel ultimately reached an agreement to close the plant in 2030, some 40 years earlier than its originally planned retirement. As part of that settlement, Xcel also agreed to gradually step down the use of the plant between 2025 and 2030.

This agreement may soon be challenged by the Trump administration, which is trying to keep coal plants across the country from closing —regardless of the cost to ratepayers and the reliability of the plants—under the guise of an energy emergency and 90-day orders to stay open from the U.S. Department of Energy.

+The always-interesting Hannah Ritchie has a report on a topic I knew nothing about: apparently, we could eliminate most of the heat-trapping contrails from passenger jets just by rerouting them for a minute or two to avoid the areas where the condensation is most likely to form.

One crucial reason why eliminating contrails could be so cost-effective is that a very small percentage of flights create the majority of the impact. This means we don’t need to divert or shift the trajectory of all the world’s flights; only a few percent of them.

Just 3% of flights generate 80% of the warming. A further 14% generate 29%.

Using detailed weather forecasts, satellite images, and flight plans, scientists can identify where these zones will be far in advance and work with flight planners to find a way to reroute flights crossing these zones to avoid them

Its latest concept is also the most complex: an air cargo shuttle with an enormous inflatable wing, engines, and an automated flight system. It’s called NATAC (Navette Aérienne de Transport Automatique de Containers/Automatic Air Shuttle for Containers) and it’s referred to as an aircraft, although it doesn’t look like one.

This concept is innovative in more ways than one; it’s foldable and inflatable, which makes it very easy to ship to different locations; it’s fully automated so that it can operate without human intervention; and it’s 100% hydrogen-compatible – for now, this means that the airship component can switch from helium to hydrogen as the carrier gas, but in the future, its engines could also use hydrogen as fuel.

Capacity-wise, this heavy-duty workhorse is designed to carry up to 30 tons of cargo. Thanks to its hybrid airship design, it can do so with four times less engine power than a conventional cargo aircraft and doesn’t need ballast when setting down its payload. The entire structure can be shipped via container to any location (ten standard 40-foot/12-meter containers are enough) and then inflated on-site.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!T7af!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2b3f31b2-6757-4aa2-884c-2ef4633d10fa_1200x1070.jpeg",N,,2025-10-08 17:05:32.974359

It's as if there was a race to see who could go all-in on EVs first, with companies like Volvo and Bentley pledging to abandon gas cars by 2030. Others, like Ford of Europe, promised it would only sell electric passenger cars by the end of the decade.

Other brands set targets for EVs to represent a large share of their annual sales. Porsche, for instance, hoped electric cars would account for more than 80 percent of total deliveries by 2030, while Audi projected it would discontinue ICE cars altogether by 2032.

Yet, many of these goals have since been delayed; some by a few years, while others have been indefinitely postponed. Notice the pattern?

Automakers jumped on the EV bandwagon, assuming demand would skyrocket. But while most announced plans to phase out combustion engines entirely, two major players bucked the trend: BMW and Toyota.

Neither BMW nor Toyota committed to aggressive EV-only strategies. Instead, the best-selling luxury brand and the world’s largest car manufacturer argued that EVs wouldn’t be suitable everywhere in such a short timeframe. Not only are electric cars generally more expensive than their gas counterparts, but the charging infrastructure is still underdeveloped in many parts of the world.

BMW has stayed true to its ""Power of Choice"" philosophy, offering customers what they want, whether it’s gasoline, diesel, plug-in hybrid, or electric. Come 2028, the company will even launch a hydrogen-powered vehicle based on the X5, featuring a fuel-cell setup co-developed with Toyota.

Then there's the legislation accelerating the demise of conventional drivetrains. BMW CEO Oliver Zipse has repeatedly voiced concern about the European Union’s planned 2035 ban on new gas-powered car sales. He argues the policy would severely limit consumer choice and devastate the automotive industry by forcing companies to cut tens of thousands of jobs:

'We don’t believe in technically one-sided regulations that limit supply. As a standalone technology, e-mobility leads down a dead-end street—that much is now clear. The differences are simply too great, even just within Europe. Europe needs a top-performing automotive and supplier industry. We are fighting for this and pushing back against negative developments.'

That’s not to say BMW is ignoring decarbonization. The company has poured more than €10 billion into the Neue Klasse, its largest single investment ever. The new iX3 leads a wave of upcoming electric vehicles, including an i3 sedan arriving next year. A fully electric iX5 has already been confirmed, with many more zero-emission models to follow in quick succession.

Still, BMW remains committed to combustion engines, even large-displacement ones, such as the M division’s inline-six and V-8. Both are being reworked to meet Euro 7 regulations, ensuring a future for the 3.0- and 4.4-liter powertrains in performance models. Even diesel isn’t disappearing, with BMW already confirming it for the next-generation X5 due in 2026.

Toyota, meanwhile, plans to use its upcoming gasoline engine for everything. Andrea Carlucci, Toyota Europe’s Vice President of Product Strategy and Marketing, recently said: ""We are trying to optimize the new engine for any type of application, whether it’s electric, hybrid, or hydrogen.""

Last year, Toyota chairman Akio Toyoda made headlines by predicting that EVs would never exceed a 30 percent global market share. Regardless, Toyota’s current approach mirrors BMW’s by refusing to artificially limit customer choice. It’s not betting everything on EVs at the expense of combustion engines, especially given its long-running success with hybrids since the Prius debuted in 1997.

Toyota is also investing heavily in alternative solutions to reduce emissions while keeping engines alive. It’s working with Mazda and Subaru to develop synthetic, carbon-neutral, and bio-based fuels. The company has even been testing hydrogen-burning combustion engines, fitting GR Yaris and GR Corolla experimental prototypes with modified versions of the 1.6-liter turbocharged three-cylinder engine.

Because BMW and Toyota never had to overhaul their strategies, both now enjoy a competitive advantage. Just look at Porsche, which must now make unexpected investments to replace the first-generation Macan with a new gas-powered crossover that wasn’t originally planned. Likewise, the 718 Boxster and Cayman will once again receive combustion engines, while a three-row SUV initially intended to be electric-only will launch first with conventional powertrains.

These unplanned course corrections are costly. But that’s not to say EVs are in decline. Despite all the AI-generated anti-EV slop spreading online like a disease, electric vehicle sales continue to grow, just not as quickly as automakers had hoped.

According to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA), EVs represented 17.7 percent of total new car sales in Europe during the first eight months of the year, up from 14.1 percent. In 2024, over 20 percent of new cars sold globally were electric, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

The IEA also reported that global EV shipments rose by more than 25 percent year over year, exceeding 17 million units. For 2025, it expects another 25 percent increase to more than 20 million units, with China accounting for about 14 million EVs, or roughly 60 percent of its new-car market.

Because BMW and Toyota never had to overhaul their strategies, both now enjoy a competitive advantage.

BMW and Toyota appear well prepared for whatever the future brings. By sticking to a multi-energy strategy established years ago, both automakers are positioned to serve all market segments around the world, regardless of how quickly the shift to electric power unfolds.

The only safe prediction is that some regions will transition far faster than others. In 2024, for example, EVs made up 89 percent of new car sales in Norway, according to the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV). Meanwhile, a study by Experian Automotive found that only 9.2 percent of cars sold in the United States last year were fully electric.

A brutal heat dome swept across the East Coast, while a powerful derecho tore through the Midwest, leaving more than 28,000 homes and businesses without power in Iowa alone. Demand surged to record levels. Yet despite the pressure, the grid avoided major blackouts. Smarter, more flexible systems are beginning to deliver results, but the need for faster transformation is undeniable.

COMMENTARY

Official forecasts from the North American Electric Reliability Corp. (NERC), Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and regional operators predicted tight conditions. They were right. In July, U.S. fossil fuel electricity generation hit a nine‑year high—290 terawatt hours (TWh).

This summer also underscored how central renewables are to grid resilience. Renewables supplied a record 44% of the nation’s power through the first seven months of 2025, and, according to Cleanview, 13.5 GW of new renewable generation in Texas slashed ERCOT’s blackout risk from 11% to less than 1%.

Meanwhile, longer-term trends show that renewables-heavy areas enjoy lower costs. Day-ahead electricity prices in ERCOT North fell nearly 50% between 2023 and 2024 with record-breaking solar output, despite continued load growth from data center expansion. This isn’t a coincidence—it’s the economics of zero marginal cost generation working exactly as intended.

Renewables and Demand Response Are Key to Grid Stability

More solar and storage capacity drives lower costs and better reliability. When the sun shines and batteries are charged, the marginal cost of electricity drops toward zero. When demand spikes, storage systems and flexible resources like demand response can respond faster than traditional power plants, providing the response that the modern grids need.

Across North America, demand response activity is reaching new highs—last summer, Enel North America’s demand response resources were dispatched 411 times, totaling almost 11,000 MWh for the grid, or nearly 1,700 hours. This year, we project a record 720 dispatches for the year. During some of the most extreme peak loads this summer, PJM deployed demand response resources to help reduce load by more than 4,000 MW. These dispatches aren’t signs of a failing grid. They’re evidence of a system that’s working smarter, using every available resource to balance supply and demand in real time.

The sophistication of today’s electricity customers is another game-changer. Data centers and other large digital operations, the very loads driving unprecedented demand growth, have the potential to be intelligent and dynamic grid participants. They understand electricity markets, can quickly adjust their operations based on price signals, and actively contribute toward grid stability, rather than just consume power. For example, Google recently signed demand response agreements with Indiana Michigan Power and Tennessee Power Authority for its AI data centers.

Economic Case is Still Strong

The economics of electricity markets are increasingly favoring smart, flexible approaches to grid management. Grid conditions, generation availability, weather conditions, and customer demand can change significantly and swiftly on an intra-day basis. Having tools available to the grid operator that can respond equally as fast as those changing conditions is key to maintaining stability.

While capacity constraints in some regions have led to higher wholesale prices, like in PJM, these conditions also drive investment in cost-effective solutions. Because of the lag in timing to bring new generation or new transmission online to meet demand growth, grid operators are turning to demand response and storage resources that can be added more quickly and provide reliability benefits at a fraction of the cost.

This shift creates real value for consumers. A single demand response event can provide similar grid benefits to a new peaking power plant while costing far less to deploy and maintain. Businesses participating in these programs can offset rising electricity costs by earning revenue for their flexibility, creating a win-win dynamic.

Smart energy users are discovering that operational flexibility has genuine economic value. A manufacturing facility that is available to reduce demand, even if only called upon for a few hours a year, earns payments for that availability. A data center that can shift computing loads based on grid conditions can take advantage of energy price variations between on-peak and off-peak pricing. These capabilities represent new revenue opportunities that didn’t exist in a centralized grid model.

A Cautionary Tale

While this summer demonstrated the resilience of our evolving grid, we shouldn’t be satisfied with scraping by. According to the Department of Energy, data center electricity demand could reach 12% of total U.S. consumption by 2028, up from about 4% today. This transition must be realized utilizing electricity resources that are flexible, dynamic and cost-effective.

The window for staying ahead of this growing demand curve is narrowing. Every month of delay in streamlining the interconnection process and building new transmission infrastructure makes the challenge harder. The alternative—relying primarily on fossil fuel generation—is often more expensive, slower to deploy, and can’t match the operational flexibility that modern grids require.

The past year proved that transition is possible almost everywhere: the grid can handle extraordinary demand if renewables, storage, and demand response scale together. In 2024, for the first time ever, the California ISO service area achieved 100% clean energy for a period of the day every three out of five days, without issuing a single emergency alert, while ERCOT managed record demand with lower prices.

Grid operators are already adapting to manage higher levels of renewable penetration, but they need the tools to succeed. That means storage to capture excess solar generation during the day and discharge it when the sun sets. It means more sophisticated demand response programs that can tap into the inherent flexibility of the technology sector and industrial operations. And it means transmission infrastructure that can move clean energy from where it’s generated to where it’s needed.

But we must continue to move quickly to meet rising demand. The data center boom isn’t slowing down, and neither should our progress toward a modern energy system. The grid of the future won’t look like the grid of the past. It will be more distributed, more flexible, and more intelligent. This summer showed what’s possible, but we need to keep building a resilient grid everywhere—fast.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/stockcake-power-grid-1024x1011.png,N,,2025-10-08 13:11:44.053093

An EV adapter isn’t an overpriced extension cord.","Certified adapters often cost $200-$250.

Using the wrong adapter could damage your vehicle and the charger.

Electric vehicle owners, beware: Buying a cheap, unapproved converter to connect your EV to a Tesla DC fast charger — or connect your Tesla to the more common CCS charger — could damage your vehicle.

Experts agree the best course is to use the adapter your vehicle’s manufacture recommends. They typically cost $200 or more. You can find adapters for under $100 on Amazon, but cheap, off-brand devices could be less efficient and not as reliable.

Worst case, it might damage your vehicle and void the warranty.

“If an adapter overheats, it can melt and damage the inlet on your vehicle and the charger,” said Ted Bohn, the engineer at Argonne National Laboratory who chaired the public-private committee that created the safety standard for adapters you can rely on.

A melted adapter could essentially weld your vehicle’s inlet port to the charging cable, rendering both inoperative.

High voltage, high stakes

DC fast chargers are complicated devices that carry high electric voltages. They connect a big expensive vehicle to a charging kiosk that almost certainly costs more than the vehicle.

What could go wrong?

Plenty, and a faulty adapter could leave you on the hook for damage to both. The tab can easily run into thousands of dollars.

A bad adapter might even expose vehicles and chargers — conceivably, even your home — to cybersecurity threats.

Automaker-approved adapters are available from new car dealers and automakers’ websites and apps.

“It’s important to stick to the adapter your vehicle manufacturer specifies,” Consumer Reports Associate Director of Automotive Testing Gabe Shenhar said. “People who bought cheaper alternatives had problems, including voiding their warranty and the adapter overheating.

“It’s not worth saving a few bucks on something that could damage your vehicle.”

Why do I need an adapter to charge my EV?

EV owners typically use DC fast chargers when they drive long distances or don’t have access to a Level 2 (240 volt) charger to fill their battery overnight or at work. Run by companies like Electrify America, EVgo, Ionna and Charge Point, DC fast chargers — as the name suggests — deliver high levels of power to charge the battery quickly, so the vehicle can get back on the road.

Most EVs use what’s called a CCS, or combined charging system, plug. Teslas have a different plug, called NACS, or North American charging system.

The two are incompatible because Tesla built its DC fast chargers first. It kept the design proprietary, so only Tesla vehicles could charge at its kiosks, which the company calls Super Chargers.

The network of fast, convenient chargers gave Tesla a major sales advantage. Imagine what it would’ve been like in 1910 if Ford owned most of the gas stations in America, and only Fords could fill up at them.

Getting back to the present, it took other automakers a while to catch on, but they eventually agreed on the CCS design. They and independent charging companies built thousands of them around the country.

Now anybody can use Tesla's chargers

Result: A VW or Chevy EV owner couldn’t charge at a Tesla station, and vice versa. On top of that, NACS chargers earned a reputation for being faster and more reliable than CCS.

They were seen as the gold standard.

Today, there are about 17,000 NACS charging stations and something over 18,000 CCS stations in the United States. The numbers are continually increasing, due to EV sales and rising demand. That compares with 145,000 gas stations nationwide. Concern about access to chargers held EV sales back.

Automakers negotiated to get their vehicles access to Tesla’s network.

To solve that, engineers from automakers, charging companies, the U.S. Department of Energy and others created a standard for adapters to connect CCS vehicles to NACS chargers. Doubling the number of places to fast-charge was a boon to automakers, but, initially, owners couldn’t buy an adapter. It still was like trying to plug an English appliance into an American outlet: The plugs didn’t match.

Why did my adapter cost $225?

SAE International, the engineering group that created standards for everything from lubricating oil to how heavy a trailer a vehicle can safely tow, oversaw standards for reliable adapters that work with all vehicles and chargers.

Called J3400/1, the standard specifies performance for charging, durability, use in all kinds of weather and more. They also shut down before damage occurs if something goes wrong and the adapter starts to overheat.

Any adapter stamped UL 2252 has been certified to meet those standards by UL Solutions, the long-standing independent testing group once known as Underwriters Laboratories.

“The requirements outlined in the standard are designed to ensure that an adapter meets safety standards not only when it’s first used but continues to meet them over time — even after typical wear and tear from everyday use,” said UL Solutions engineer Joe Bablo.

An EV adapter isn’t an overpriced extension cord. It’s a sophisticated safety device.

G'head, run a pickup over it

Adapters that meet the standards have been certified to work for years in all weather conditions, endure repeatedly being dropped to the ground and more. A Ford video shows the automaker’s adapter surviving being driven over by an F-150 Lightning full-size electric pickup.

Adapters that don’t meet SAE standard can even present cybersecurity concerns.

Some early adapters had USB ports so they could be updated. The ports left them open to hacking. The standard bans that: Adapters are now like an air-gapped computer, with no data link to the outside world.

“GM designed our adapter to meet the same standards as our vehicles,” GM Energy Chief Operating Officer and Head of Public Charging Bill Hotchkiss said. “We tested it in fleets of vehicles.

Confronting the Mineral Conundrum Critical minerals underpin the world's efforts to build a cleaner, safer future for all.","The world is racing to increase supplies of lithium, cobalt, copper and other ""critical minerals"" that are building blocks of modern technology. Not only are these minerals used in industries like defense, healthcare and electronics, but they are also key to producing the clean energy technologies that are increasingly powering our lives.

Yet critical minerals present an environmental and social conundrum. While necessary in the fight against climate change, mining and processing of these minerals can drive greenhouse gas emissions, pollute the environment and bring risks to nearby communities. Mining and production are also concentrated in a small handful of countries, and surging demand is adding to geopolitical tensions — from trade disputes to global debates over the prospect of deep-sea mining.

There is no question the world will need a lot more of these minerals, and quickly. But how do we meet this demand in a way that's responsible and equitable?

What Are Critical Minerals and Why Do They Matter?

Critical minerals are those that are essential to countries' economies or development. They are generally in high demand and prone to supply chain disruptions, although countries differ on which minerals they define as ""critical"" depending on their level of access, what the minerals are used for, their export value and national supply risks.

Most countries' critical mineral lists include copper, lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite and rare earth elements. These are used widely in clean energy technologies, such as wind turbines, solar panels, EV batteries and motors, as well as in energy transmission infrastructure like power lines. Additional minerals important for the energy transition include aluminum, manganese, silicon and silver, among others.

Many critical minerals are integral to other industries as well. NATO includes several on its list of essential raw materials for defense. And they are needed to manufacture the semiconductors that underpin our electronics, from smartphones and computers to lighting and medical devices.

While the terms ""rare earth elements"" and ""critical minerals"" are sometimes used interchangeably, the two are not the same. Rare earth elements are a subset of critical minerals that includes 17 elements (such as neodymium, promethium and cerium) used extensively in clean energy systems and other advanced technologies. Contrary to their name, rare earth elements tend not to be rare. The challenge is that they are often found in very low concentrations and are intermingled with other minerals, making it difficult and uneconomical to extract them.

Can the World Meet Growing Mineral Demand?

Rapid growth in zero-carbon technology has supercharged the world's need for critical minerals, and demand is expected to keep climbing. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that if governments are to meet their announced energy and climate pledges, critical mineral demand could more than double from 2022 levels by 2030 and quadruple by 2050.

Despite this high demand, there are likely enough critical minerals to meet the world's need. But the reality of accessing them is complex. Some critical minerals, like aluminum and palladium, have stable reserves on land that can fulfil the world's demand through 2050 and likely beyond. For others, like copper, nickel and cobalt, current reserves are likely to come up short, and it will take a combination of more exploration, technological advances and economic incentives to increase supply.

New mining requires long lead times.

Part of the challenge with scaling up critical mineral supplies is that mining operations move slowly. From discovery to first production, it takes an average of 15.5 years to develop new mining projects, depending on the mineral, location and mine type. Long lead times raise questions about the world's ability to ramp up output as demand grows, especially if companies wait for deficits to emerge before committing to new projects.

Mining and processing are concentrated in a handful of countries.

Extraction and processing of critical minerals are highly concentrated, both in terms of geography and ownership. For example, in 2023, Indonesia held 42% of global nickel reserves and 54% of global nickel production, while the Democratic Republic of Congo held 55% of global cobalt reserves and 74% of global cobalt production.

Once mined, the majority of these minerals are shipped to China for processing before they can be applied in end uses. China processes more than half of the world's lithium, two-thirds of its cobalt, one-third of its nickel and nearly all rare earth elements.

China's dominance in processing stems from early strategic investments in global mining and its history of looser environmental standards — although lax regulations are tightening as harms from irresponsible mining come to light. The country's longstanding investment in clean energy development has also propelled it as a leader in mineral-intensive EV battery and solar panel manufacturing, driven by a combination of relatively low, capital and land costs.

How Is the World Responding to Supply Risks?

As countries move to protect their national security and energy independence, critical minerals have become a central point of conflict. Some with a healthy mineral supply, like China, have imposed export restrictions as a geopolitical lever, heightening the urgency for other countries to build up their domestic supplies. For example, the EU's Critical Raw Materials Act aims to establish a secure and dependable critical minerals value chain for the bloc. In the U.S., the Mine of the Future initiative provides nearly $100 million in funding to accelerate research, innovative mining technologies and commercialization, while the Defense Production Act elevates critical minerals as a national security imperative.

Some countries — such as the U.S., EU, Australia, Canada, Japan and South Korea — have joined international initiatives like the IEA Critical Minerals Security Programme and the Minerals Security Partnership to work together on strengthening critical mineral security and scaling up investments in sustainable supply chains. China's partnerships through its Belt and Road Initiative, which supports infrastructure development mainly in developing and emerging economies, have been instrumental in the country's ability to dominate mineral processing.

Several countries and companies are also racing to pursue deep sea mining, a frontier area of exploration. The ocean floor is estimated to hold significant reserves of copper, cobalt, nickel, zinc, silver, gold and rare earth elements. Recent technological advancements have made it possible to readily access these minerals; however, little is known about the deep ocean, and research suggests mining it could pose grave environmental threats.

What Are the Dangers Associated with Critical Mineral Mining?

All mining has social and environmental impacts. These can sometimes be positive; for example, responsible, industrialized mining may bring jobs, income and services to areas with few other economic opportunities. But there are also serious risks to nature and communities, particularly when it comes to irresponsible and illegal extraction.

For one, extracting, processing and shipping minerals releases planet-warming emissions. Global mining already represents about 8% of the world's carbon footprint, and emissions from critical mineral production will grow alongside demand.

Mining can also strain water quality and supplies. Sixteen percent of critical mineral mines, deposits and districts are in highly water-stressed areas (places that already use 40% of their available water each year to meet demand). This means there is high competition for water and sometimes not enough left over to sustain important freshwater ecosystems. If mining waste isn't managed properly, it can leach hazardous materials like acidic mine drainage or tailings impoundments (process waste) into the surrounding environment and contaminate groundwater.

Between 2001 and 2020, the world lost nearly 1.4 million hectares of forest to mining and related activities, an area of land roughly the size of Montenegro. Felling trees not only releases emissions (36 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent a year), but also harms ecosystems. And it often involves extensive removal of vegetation and soil that Indigenous and local communities depend on for food and livelihoods.

While mining may help bolster local economies, it has a track record of social harm when not well regulated. For example, of the 255,000 workers engaged in small-scale mining in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 40,000 are children — some as young as six years old. Communities may face also forced displacement, loss of traditional livelihoods, and health risks linked to pollution from mines.

When it comes to ocean mining, there are many unknowns. But the research available suggests the practice could irreparably harm fragile deep-sea ecosystems. It could also affect species beyond the ocean floor, including fish like tuna that are vital to food security.

How Can the World Scale Up Mineral Supplies Responsibly?

The key question is how to balance the world's growing need for critical minerals with the inherent risks of mining — particularly when these minerals are essential to securing a stable climate and a safer future. This will require: 1) ensuring that all mining is done responsibly, and 2) encouraging a circular mineral economy to minimize demand for new extraction.

Mainstream responsible mining.

Responsible mining means extracting critical minerals in a way that safeguards the environment and respects people and communities. Several different levers can support responsible mining, including:

Standards: An overarching international framework for critical minerals can help regulate and compare companies' environmental, social and governance efforts in a meaningful way. There are numerous protocols already in place — such as the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance, Toward Sustainable Mining and The Copper Mark — but they need to be used more widely. Efforts to harmonize industry-led standards, such as the Consolidated Mining Standard Initiative, are currently underway.

Regulations: Countries can encourage or even require responsible mineral supply chains through policymaking. Regulatory levers may address trade and export controls, resource management, international cooperation and supply chain security. The EU's Conflict Minerals Regulation, for example, requires that gold, tin, tungsten and tantalum be sourced from conflict-free areas across the world.

Technology: Technological advancements can help mining companies reduce their impact. For example, mining companies operating in water-scarce areas are increasingly required to develop desalination plants so they don't put pressure on limited freshwater supplies.

Transparency and accountability: Through groups like Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), countries can commit to disclose information along their mineral value chains. Organizations like the Accountability Accelerator can help hold stakeholders responsible for their mining activities, with consequences for inaction.

Market-based incentives: Large buyers like governments and companies can exert their influence through green procurement, committing to purchase only critical minerals that have been responsibly mined. Companies can also join forces through corporate buyers' clubs and can opt to pay a green premium for products that have met specific environmental, social and governance targets. Financing is also an important lever, and groups like Mining 2030 are looking to define the role of finance in realizing a socially and environmentally responsible mining sector.

Promote a circular economy.

A shift from our current economic model of ""make-use-discard"" to one that emphasizes reduction, reuse and recycling can ease resource pressures, helping to minimize the need for new mining and the impacts that come with it.

Critical mineral use can be reduced through material-efficient products. For example, more and more EV models on the market are SUVs and other larger passenger vehicles that require larger batteries and therefore more minerals. Governments can encourage car manufacturers and consumers to opt for smaller vehicles through measures like the EU's recently announced Small Affordable Cars Initiative. New technologies can also help substitute demand; for example, cobalt-free EV batteries rely on cheaper, more abundant resources, such as iron and phosphate.

Reusing older clean energy components after the end of their ""first life"" can keep minerals in circulation. Retired EV batteries, for example, often retain 70%-80% of their capacity and could be used in renewable energy storage, EV charging stations and microgrids. Retired commercial solar panels could power off-grid structures like electric bike stations or community solar systems. This can help reduce waste while creating new jobs and expanding access to clean energy. However, second-life use needs to be properly managed to avoid becoming a loophole for waste dumping in lower-income countries. ​

Increasing mineral recycling could reduce the need for new mine development by 40% for copper and cobalt and 25% for lithium and nickel by 2050. Though in near-term, improvements in recycling may be outpaced by rising material consumption. For instance, the share of total copper demand that was supplied by secondary or recycled copper actually fell from 37% in 2015 to 33% in 2023.

Fortunately, policy momentum in support of recycling is gaining strength. Since 2022, more than 30 new policies related to critical mineral recycling have been introduced globally. These include India's 2022 Battery Waste Management Rules, which regulate the recycling and management of all batteries, and Vietnam's Decree No.8/2022/ND-CP, which mandates recycling rates and specifications for producers and importers of specific products, including batteries and solar cells.

Confronting the Mineral Conundrum

Critical minerals underpin the world's efforts to build a cleaner, safer future for all. But they are not without risks. As surging demand spurs geopolitical tensions and environmental and social concerns, the need for meeting this demand responsibly is paramount. Countries and companies must work together to ensure that supply chains are not only secure, but sustainable — and that we're making the most of the minerals already in play to minimize the need for new extraction as much as possible.",https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/1222x722/s3/2025-10/lithium_0.jpg?VersionId=fk85E.5AHCkoTEeNlAy8g_QplY4bcgSN&h=b6d03109&itok=VSOZCc3B,N,,2025-10-08 16:02:05.662657

Rising pollution, volatile fuel prices, and mounting climate concerns are converging to make electric vehicles not just an alternative but a necessity. EV adoption promises to cut emissions, reduce fossil fuel dependence, and lower import bills, while spurring innovation, job creation, and investment. Together, these factors could position India as a leader in sustainable mobility.

The electric vehicles market in India has expanded rapidly in line with NITI Aayog’s target of electrifying 30% of vehicles by 2030. Global EV sales surged from 0.9 million units in 2016 to nearly 19 million in 2024 — a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 45.8%. India has outpaced this with a 59.4% CAGR over the same period, moving from 50,000 units in 2016 to 2.08 million in 2024. Although EVs accounted for only 2–3% of new car sales — below the global average of 5% — India remains the fastest-growing large EV market.

NITI Aayog projects a 49% CAGR between 2022 and 2030, reaching 10 million annual sales by decade-end. Encouragingly, adoption is spreading from metros to Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities, signalling a broader social and economic shift. Passenger vehicle data for FY2024–25 show this transition gaining traction. While petrol cars dipped from 2.57 million to 2.47 million units, EV sales grew 50%, from 80,000 to 120,000 units. The numbers remain small, but the trajectory is clear: cleaner mobility is no longer a niche trend.

Why electric vehicles transition matters

The case for electrification extends beyond convenience or cost. Transport contributes about 14% of India’s total CO₂ emissions, and vehicular pollution drives air quality in major cities to hazardous levels. Meanwhile, oil imports account for over 85% of India’s crude consumption, burdening the trade balance.

Government incentives—tax breaks, subsidies, and fee waivers—have boosted sales, but the rationale is strategic. A 2023 NITI Aayog perception survey found that 75% of EV buyers cited fuel savings as the top motivator, followed by pollution reduction. In short, EVs align environmental necessity with economic logic.

The bottlenecks: Cost and infrastructure

India’s electric vehicles revolution faces familiar hurdles. High upfront costs, driven by expensive lithium-ion batteries, remain the biggest deterrent. These batteries also add weight and affect vehicle range.

The lack of adequate charging infrastructure compounds the problem. As of mid-2025, India had only around 12,000 public charging stations—grossly insufficient for mass adoption. Rural and semi-urban regions are particularly underserved, making EV ownership impractical outside major cities.

Awareness gaps and concerns about reliability, battery life, and resale value persist. Dealers and financiers remain cautious, dampening consumer confidence. Unless infrastructure and financing evolve together, achieving 2030 targets will be difficult.

Government push: Policy and incentives

Public policy has been central to India’s electric vehicles push. Schemes like FAME I and II subsidize vehicle purchases and charging infrastructure, while states including Delhi, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu offer additional tax waivers and subsidies. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for Advanced Chemistry Cells is encouraging domestic battery manufacturing, reducing import dependence.

By mid-2025, 29 states and Union Territories had adopted EV policies aimed at lowering imports, expanding manufacturing, and creating jobs. NITI Aayog’s “Shoonya” campaign has promoted zero-emission transport, especially in delivery and ride-hailing sectors.

A further boost came from the GST Council’s September 2025 decision to retain the 5% GST rate on EVs while reducing taxes on small cars, two-wheelers, and auto components to 18%. This move will lower costs across the supply chain and make EVs more competitive.

Cleaner air, lower costs

One of the strongest arguments for electric vehicles lies in their environmental payoff. The Central Pollution Control Board estimates that vehicles contribute nearly 30% of PM2.5 levels in cities such as Delhi and Mumbai. Replacing internal combustion engines with EVs could sharply reduce urban pollution and improve public health.

Battery prices are projected to fall by almost 60% within five years, according to BloombergNEF, narrowing the price gap with petrol vehicles. With improving technology and economies of scale, affordability will no longer be a major obstacle.

Two- and three-wheelers are leading the charge. E-rickshaws, delivery scooters, and shared mobility fleets are rapidly electrifying. Firms such as Tata Motors, Ola Electric, Ather, MG Motor, and Maruti Suzuki have expanded their EV portfolios, from the Nexon and Tiago EVs to the Ola S1 range.

Learning from global leaders

India’s progress is impressive but still trails global leaders. China dominates the EV supply chain, controlling over 70% of global battery manufacturing and offering vast charging networks. Norway, at the other extreme, has achieved over 80% EV penetration in new car sales through a mix of tax waivers and infrastructure investment.

Electric bus fleets in Indian cities like Delhi and Bengaluru are expanding, but the penetration of electric trucks and long-haul vehicles remains limited. Accelerating this segment will be vital if India is to meet its 2030 target of 30% electrification.

Public sentiment and social shift

EVs are increasingly part of urban aspiration. The NITI Aayog survey shows 87% of respondents view EVs positively, citing lower operating costs and environmental gains. Young professionals between 18 and 35 are leading adoption, attracted by the combination of tech-driven design, convenience, and climate awareness.

Still, concerns linger over charging access, upfront costs, and long-term performance. Overcoming these anxieties will require trust built through transparency, warranty support, and widespread charging visibility.

The road to a greener future

India’s electric vehicles future is within reach but not guaranteed. The sector needs a coordinated push—affordable finance, resilient infrastructure, and long-term policy clarity. Private players must invest in R&D, while the government must ensure grid readiness and localize critical supply chains.

If India sustains its current pace, the outcome will be transformative. Cleaner cities, reduced oil imports, and a new generation of green jobs could redefine India’s economic landscape.

The road ahead may be long, but the direction is unmistakable. Electric mobility is not merely a technological shift—it is India’s route to a cleaner, more self-reliant, and globally competitive future.

But there’s no arguing that the tax credit accelerated that demand. The policy, which gifted a $7,500 tax rebate to buyers for EVs starting in 2009, did a lot to bring EVs closer to affordability;, being new, highly complex products, they were always going to be more expensive than their ICE counterparts. Without the tax credit, it’s entirely possible that Tesla wouldn’t be near as big as it is today. As of last week, that EV tax credit is dead. Unsurprisingly, automakers and dealers alike worry the EV market will now cave in on itself, considering every car in the segment just got a whole lot more expensive. To counteract this, automakers are attempting to fill the gap with discounts, rebates, and other incentives. But many of these deals won’t last forever.

What else? Tesla has offered its own car insurance since 2019 as a way to integrate the car ownership experience under one roof. Now, that arm of the company is facing a ban in California, with users reporting big delays in responses and unreasonable claim denials.

In other news, there’s a report out of Washington that says the Department of Energy is considering revoking $1.1 billion in grants to General Motors and Stellantis that would’ve been used to revitalize and retool old plants to build electric cars.

Speaking of Stellantis, it was named as a possible partner alongside Ford in a potential tie-up with Nissan. A report suggests Nissan could start selling rebadged Rogue hybrids to either of the brands mentioned above, a deal that could include a team-up in electric vehicle development. Nissan’s really doing everything it can to stay in the game.

The Discounts Aren’t Totally Gone Just Yet

There’s no doubt that the sales of electric cars are about to see a big slump in the fourth quarter. Lots of buyers sprang for their EVs last month to take advantage of the federal tax credit before it disappeared for good, resulting in record sales for some brands, including Tesla. With a bunch of satisfied buyers now out of the market (and the credit gone), there’s no way Q4 sales will reach anywhere near Q3’s numbers.

To cushion the fall, numerous brands are offering discounts of their own to keep buyers coming through the door. The most interesting strategy comes from Ford and GM, which, as The Autopian reported previously, actually used a loophole to take ownership of cars in its inventory it plans to lease to customers before the September 30th deadline, allowing lessees to take advantage of the credit even after that deadline has passed. Clever stuff.

Stellantis, the last of the Big Three, is using a more conventional approach by simply replicating the tax rebate with a bonus cash allowance of its own, and eating the discount itself. All of the conglomerate’s hybrids and EVs qualify, which means you’ll be able to use it on cars like the Dodge Charger Daytona, the Jeep Wagoneer S, and Jeep’s lineup of plug-ins. The discounts will only apply to existing inventory, according to Automotive News, and according to Stellantis’s websites, they expire on November 3.

Then there’s Tesla, which, on October 1st, added a $6,500 lease credit for the Model 3 and the Model Y to offset the loss of the federal rebate. It’s worth noting this credit isn’t available for either of the more affordable “Standard” versions of those cars launched yesterday. In fact, Tesla doesn’t give potential owners the option to lease that trim at all, according to its website.

Rivian is following in Tesla’s footsteps, offering a lease credit worth up to $6,500 for new owners. The offer expires at the end of the month, and only applies to a few models. From InsideEVs:

The biggest rebate of $6,500 applies to the 2025 R1S and R1T in three specific configurations: the tri-motor, the dual-motor with the Max battery pack and the Performance Upgrade, and the dual-motor with the Large battery and the Performance Upgrade. In other words, Rivian is trying to get rid of its inventory, but it’s worth noting that neither the entry-level Dual version with the Standard battery pack nor the top-spec Quad variant is eligible for any of these discounts.

That said, buyers can get $6,000 off the lease price of a 2026 R1S or R1T with the tri-motor configuration, while the 2026 R1S and R1T dual-motor with the Max battery and Performance Upgrade are eligible for a $5,000 lease bonus.

It’s not just American brands getting in on the action. BMW is offering $7,500 off its electric lineup and $5,000 off its plug-ins. This is only for vehicles purchased, not leased, and the discount ends after November 1, according to Car and Driver. Hyundai is taking what feels like a more permanent approach, slashing prices of its Ioniq 5 by up to $9,800 for the 2026 model year.

So if you’re sad you missed out on the federal credit, just know that there are still deals out there, at least for a few more weeks. Though the golden era may be behind us for now.

California Is Threatening To Shut Down Tesla’s Insurance

Tesla owners who use Tesla’s insurance are pretty upset with the service, at least according to California’s Department of Insurance. The organization announced plans last week to hold the car company’s subdivision accountable for failing “in their legal obligations to adequately handle hundreds of California automobile policyholder claims.” From the release:

The actions allege that, despite being repeatedly warned by the Department of Insurance, the Tesla Companies and State National instead chose to abandon their responsibility to consumers and persist with their non-compliant claims-handling practices, placing profits above people and flouting the law with impunity.

After continuing to receive a significant number of consumer complaints related to the handling of their automobile policyholder claims beginning in 2022, the Department of Insurance repeatedly warned the Tesla Companies and State National of the significant harm to their policyholders — largely Tesla drivers — unless immediate corrective actions were taken. Throughout numerous meetings with, correspondence between, and reports to the Department of Insurance, the companies repeatedly committed to improvements, but the number of justified consumer complaints and violations continued to mount. Instead of correcting their unlawful and egregious behavior, the companies disregarded the Department’s serious warnings and continued their misconduct, and the number of consumer complaints and the amount of legal violations have only continued to significantly increase. The companies face monetary penalties up to $5,000 for each unlawful, unfair, or deceptive act, or up to $10,000 for each such act determined to be willful.

Tesla Insurance has been in the news for years over allegedly less-than-satisfactory business practices. Reuters published a wide-ranging report back in 2023 covering the firm’s alleged inability to deliver timely communications, pay out on claims, or even pick up the phone. The CDI’s accusations seem similar:

The Department’s accusations are based on the companies’ ongoing systemic failures and willful unfair claims settlement practices including, but not limited to, the following alleged violations:

Egregious delays in responding to policyholder claims in all steps of the claims handling process, causing financial harm, out-of-pocket expenses, potential third-party liability exposure, and distress to policyholders

Unreasonable denials and delays in fully paying valid claims to consumers

Failure to conduct thorough, fair, and objective investigations of claims, thus denying consumers the insurance benefits they expect

Failure to advise policyholders of their rights to have their claims denials reviewed by the Department – a major consumer protection in California to make sure insurers are held accountable by their regulator

The CDI says Tesla Insurance has 15 days from October 3 to respond to the accusations, or else the provider could have its license to operate in the state suspended.

GM And Stellantis Could Be Out $1.1 Billion In Factory Retooling Grants

The cuts just keep on coming. Last year, the Biden administration awarded nearly $1.1 billion to GM and Stellantis to retool a trio of plants, with plans to convert them for EV and EV parts production. That money might not be coming in anymore, according to a government document seen by Reuters. From the report:

The projects are among a list of $12 billion in awards that could be canceled as the partial government shutdown persists.

Among those grants: $500 million awarded to GM to convert Lansing Grand River Assembly in Michigan to build electric vehicles; $335 million for Stellantis to convert the shuttered Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois to make midsize electric pickups; and $250 million for Stellantis to convert its Indiana Transmission Plant in Kokomo to produce EV components.

The possible cancellations come a week after the Energy Department announced plans to cancel $7.56 billion in financing for hundreds of energy projects that it said would not provide sufficient returns to taxpayers.

The Lansing plant currently builds the Cadillac CT4 and CT5, while the Belvidere plant hasn’t built anything since 2023, when the last-gen Cherokee went out of production.

As for why these previously earmarked funds could be canceled over the government shutdown, well, you’ll have to ask the current administration. As Reuters points out, this news comes just a week after the DOE announced plans to cut $7.5 billion in financing for various energy projects, and a week after White House budget director Russell Vought said on X that the admin would be cancelling nearly $8 billion in climate-related funding in 16 Democratic-run states. Only Belvidere falls under the States mentioned, though, so going by this Reuters report, the admin’s planned cuts could reach even farther than expected.

Nissan Could Supply Rebadged Rogue Hybrids To Ford Or Stellantis

The Nissan Rogue is a great car, and the world can use more of them. That could soon be a reality, as Rogue production may add a badge-engineered sibling wearing bodywork from one of the Big Three American automakers. A report from Automotive News claims the company is in talks with brands like Stellantis and Ford to sell an electrified crossover based on the ever-popular SUV. From the report:

The compact crossover would feature Nissan’s e-Power hybrid system, which uses a battery-powered electric motor to drive the wheels and a gasoline engine to recharge the battery.

Nissan would assemble the vehicle alongside the Rogue in Smyrna, Tenn.

Discussions include potential collaboration on electric vehicle development, said one of the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussions are private.

“It’s not a quid pro quo,” the person said, adding that a deal could happen even without an EV partnership.

While a Nissan official told Autonews there were no agreements in place right now, they did say the company “remains open to dialogue that delivers strategic, complementary market opportunities to our core model development efforts.” So that’s something.

If such a partnership does materialize, the badge-engineered, Rogue-based hybrid will likely use Nissan’s third-generation e-POWER tech, which utilizes one of the most thermally efficient engines in production right now. It’s already for sale in Europe, and it’s expected to make its first appearance in America via the Rogue next year, according to Autonews.

What I’m Listening To While Writing TMD

This month might be the last opportunity to get a properly discounted electric car before things get really expensive. So I’m listening to Janis Joplin’s “Get It While You Can” from her 1971 album, Pearl. But instead of love, I’ll be thinking about EVs.

(Reuters) -General Motors is scrapping a program aimed at allowing its dealers to continue offering for several months a $7,500 tax credit on electric-vehicle leases following the Sept. 30 expiration of the federal subsidy, the company said on Wednesday.

Toward the end of last month, GM devised a plan to have its in-house lending arm initiate the purchase of EVs in its dealers’ inventory. The company planned to apply for the federal $7,500 credit on those cars hours ahead of the deadline then roll that money into EV lease terms for customers.

“After further consideration, we have decided not to claim the tax credit,” the company said in a statement to Reuters on Wednesday.

GM opted to kill the program after concerns were raised about it by Republican Senator Bernie Moreno, a former car dealer who is active in auto policy, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.

The idea behind the program was to ease the impact of the expiration of the tax credit on dealers, who worried that they would be stuck with EVs that would be tough to sell. GM had planned to apply for the credit on tens of thousands of EVs in dealer stocks, according to people familiar with the plan.

Ford rolled out a similar program ahead of the tax credit expiration. It’s unclear if Ford is continuing its program. A spokesperson declined to comment.

“The future of the bus is electric. However, building the necessary public charging infrastructure is taking too long,” said Till Oberwörder, CEO of Daimler Buses. “We want to give an important impulse with our charging stations. Our new battery-electric intercity bus, the eIntouro, already connects cities and rural areas. It is also suitable for shorter trips. These are currently the most practical applications for electric buses and coaches outside of urban public transport. For long-distance travel to remote destinations, however, a comprehensive charging network is needed so that bus operators can use electric coaches economically and without compromising passenger comfort.”

The initiative will begin with a pilot project in the city of Cologne, Germany. Four public fast charging points for electric buses and coaches are set to be installed near the city center next year. Daimler Buses subsidiary Daimler Buses Solutions will be responsible for planning, construction, operation and maintenance.

The Buspark Cologne parking facility serves as a central location for all intercity buses and coaches taking tourists to Cologne. Bus operators will be able to quickly charge their electric buses and coaches—regardless of brand—with green electricity. Unlike electric city buses, which serve shorter routes and are usually charged overnight at 50 to 80 kW, coaches require especially powerful charging solutions. The four new fast charging stations will each provide a nominal output of 400 kW. The stations will be accessible to the public 24/7.

Daimler Buses debuted the series-production version of its first battery-electric intercity bus, the Mercedes-Benz eIntouro, at the recent Busworld 2025 trade show in Brussels. The vehicle can be equipped with either one or two lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, and achieves a range of up to 500 kilometers.

US President Donald Trump has been rather busy of late, what with taking undisclosed medical treatments on a regular basis, pasting cheap gilt flourishes all over the walls of the Oval Office, building a new ballroom, and sending troops from former Confederate states to invade the Union once again. Meanwhile, he has apparently forgotten all about his war on electric vehicles. In fact, the US has been adding more EV charging stations by the bucketful all this year, indicating that the EV movement is here to stay regardless of Trump’s fossil-friendly energy policy.

Putting EV Charging Aside For The Moment, Let’s Revisit The Civil War

To be clear, there is nothing funny about the current situation. It’s 2025 and the person who occupies the White House has styled himself as a modern-day Jefferson Davis, with his Secretary of Defense playing the role of Robert E. Lee.

For reasons best known only to themselves, other news media has failed to connect the dots, leaving it up to us clean tech reporters to spell it out for them. Okay, we will spell it out for them. In August, the President ordered troops from five Republican-controlled former Confederate states — Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and South Carolina — to invade Washington DC, a feat they failed to perform during the first Civil War lo these many years ago, costing much bloodshed along the way.

In his efforts to foster a modern-day takeover of DC by the former Confederacy, Trump also took a detour over to Ohio and West Virginia, two non-Confederate states currently under Republican control. However, that was just a matter of convenience. The President reverted to the theme of a Confederate takeover this week, sending troops from the former Confederate state of Texas willy-nilly into parts north of the Mason-Dixon Line.

Sheetz Keeps The EV Charging Momentum Going

So much for connecting the dots. This article was supposed to be about EV charging, so let’s get to it. The sharp U-turn in federal energy policy notwithstanding, stakeholders in the travel plaza, quick-serve restaurant, and gas-plus-convenience store areas have played a defining role in the expansion of the public EV charging network in the US this year, with the family-owned business Sheetz front and center.

The latest news from Sheetz is particularly significant because builds on the company’s ongoing relationship with Vontier, a leading global mobility tech firm headquartered in the US.

“Vontier Corporation…announced today that Driivz, a Vontier company and leading global software supplier to electric vehicle (EV) charging operators and service providers, will partner with Sheetz, one of the fastest-growing, family-owned and -operated convenience retailers in the United States, to power its growing EV charging network with advanced EV charging and energy management software,” Vontier announced somewhat cumbersomely on October 7.

As noted by Vontier, Sheetz has already set up 125 EV charging stations among its operations, through third-party providers. The partnership with Driivz slaps the Sheetz brand on its charging station network, supported by the Sheetz mobile app.

Trevor Walter, the EVP of Petroleum Supply Management at Sheetz, put on his EV charging hat to explain the new arrangement with Driivz. “EV drivers already choose our stores because of the amenities and services we provide,” Walter explained in a press statement. “This partnership allows us to build on that trust— making charging a seamless extension of the Sheetz experience, while delivering the same consistency and value customers expect each time they visit.”

It’s Not Just Sheetz

No word yet on how many more charging stations Sheetz expects to crank up under the new partnership with Driivz, so stay tuned for more on that. Meanwhile, another ripe opportunity for new EV charging stations has been cropping up in the multi-unit residential market.

For the latest development in that area, let’s turn to The Solomon Organization, a leading real estate operator with more than 22,000 residential apartments in its portfolio, which spans New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, Michigan, Illinois, Virginia, North Carolina, and Wisconsin.

On October 1 the up-and-coming EV charging investment firm 3V Infrastructure announced a new partnership with TSO, under which 3V will install Level 2 EV charging stations at more than 60 TSO properties in nine different states.

The new charging stations are being installed under the Charging-as-a-Service (CaaS) model, in which neither the property owner nor the tenants pay any up-front costs. “Through the partnership, 3V will fund, install, and operate smart Level 2 EV charging infrastructure powered by SWTCH,” 3V explained in a press statement.

“We built 3V to remove the financial and operational barriers for property owners by fully funding, installing, and managing charging infrastructure long-term,” emphasized 3V CEO Aubrey Gunnels.

3V began surfacing on the CleanTechnica radar in August of 2024 and they have been very busy since then, including a financial assist from GDEV Management’s recently closed Fund II venture, so keep an eye open for more activity where that came from.

Fine Tuning The EV Experience

Growing the nation’s network of EV charging stations is just one way to push the vehicle electrification movement forward. Also helping things along is new technology that finally puts EV range anxiety to bed once and for all. In that regard, check out the new “State of Mission” model under development at the University of California-Riverside. Rather than simply announcing the battery’s current state of charge, the SOM model will factor in traffic patterns, hilly terrain, and other elements specific to the driver’s route.

“The model learns from how batteries charge, discharge, and heat up over time, but it also respects the laws of electrochemistry and thermodynamics. This dual intelligence lets it make reliable predictions even under stress, such as a sudden temperature drop or a steep uphill climb,” UC-Riverside explains.

With range anxiety falling by the wayside, EV affordability continues to be an obstacle. In August, Ford and GM both announced plans to address that issue in the coming years, partly with the aid of the new LFP (lithium-iron-phosphate) battery formulas.

On October 7 Tesla also rolled out its affordable EV plan, consisting of “cheaper versions” of two existing models, marketed under the somewhat unflattering title, “Standard.” The new Standard EVs offer less battery range among other budgetary features.

So far the news has provoked little more than a collective yawn from the fourth estate, with Associated Press providing a representative sample from the general media.

“The new Model Y, costing just under $40,000 with a stripped-down interior, follows a slump in Tesla sales covering most of the past year due to anti-Elon Musk boycotts targeting the company. The company is also offering a cheaper version of its Model 3 for under $35,000,” AP reported on October 7, referring to the automaker’s recent brand reputation woes.

Among members of the automotive press, Motor Trend chipped in its two cents:

While they are well below $45,000, a slightly used 2025 model year version of either vehicle can be had for equal or even less money, and you’ll get all the content lost to create the Standard trims.

You’ll also get all the battery range of the 2025 model year, or nearly so. Today’s batteries practically outlast the rest of the car, making used EVs an attractive alternative for bargain hunters.

If you have any thoughts about that, drop a note in the comment thread. Better yet, find your representatives in Congress and drop them a note about, well, everything.

Base Power, a two-year-old power company based in Texas, is taking an unorthodox approach: It leases huge batteries to homeowners that it can tap for extra energy as needed. And it has amassed yet more financial resources to carry out its plan.

The company plans to announce on Wednesday that it has raised $1 billion in new funding.

The investment round values Base Power at about $3 billion, not counting the new money, said a person with knowledge of the matter, who was not authorized to discuss financials publicly. That is more than double the company’s valuation in April, according to the data provider PitchBook.

Though many power companies are focusing on building giant industrial batteries as a way to store energy — often generated by wind or solar facilities — and provide it when demand rises, Base Power is building what amounts to a fleet of home batteries. The company essentially leases and installs residential backup batteries at a discount to competing systems, and sells power to its customers.

The company then uses software to fill the batteries when electricity is cheap and draw from them when power is more expensive, profiting from the difference in price and passing some of the savings onto customers. (Base Power also offers its software to power companies.)

The goal, according to Zach Dell, Base Power’s co-founder and chief executive, is to build “the modern power company.”

Since it began operations, Base Power has sold more than 100 megawatt hours’ worth of battery capacity, or enough energy to power 33,000 U.S. homes for an hour.

Key to Base Power’s business has been the deregulated nature of the energy market in Texas, where it operates and where customers can choose among different power providers. The company recently qualified for a state program that allows fleets of batteries to combine their power and send it back to the grid.

That could help Base Power sell excess energy from its batteries at times of higher demand. “We can say, ‘Hey, we can give you 100 megawatts faster and cheaper than anyone,” Mr. Dell said.

Though the company had raised $200 million in April, investors clamored to put more money in to help it expand, Mr. Dell said in an interview. It has already embarked on expensive new projects, notably by building a battery factory in Austin, Texas — it currently buys batteries from a company in Asia — and plans to build a second soon.

“The administration has been very clear that they want America to be an energy powerhouse,” Mr. Dell said.

Base Power plans to use the new funds to expand to other regions, among other investments. Mr. Dell said the company was likely to announce its next U.S. market by the end of the year, and hoped to expand internationally by the second half of 2026.

Participants in the round include existing backers such as Addition and Thrive Capital, where Mr. Dell previously worked as a venture capitalist. It also includes new investors like CapitalG, the Google-affiliated investment firm.

The facility will be further supported by $12 million in investments from Nano Nuclear itself.
Quotables: “With the strong presence of nuclear utilities and R&D institutions in Illinois, this is the ideal ecosystem for us to thrive,” said Florent Heidet, chief technology officer at Nano Nuclear.
Beyond those applications, Nano Nuclear says that the reactor’s modular design will allow a multiunit configuration to fulfill gigawatt-scale power needs.

The facility will be further supported by $12 million in investments from Nano Nuclear itself.

More details: In July, the company acquired a property in the Chicago suburb of Oak Brook for $3.5 million. It features a 23,537-square-foot standalone facility, including a dedicated 7,400-square-foot nonnuclear demonstration area.

The facility, which Nano Nuclear promises will create 50 new full-time jobs, will be used to support personnel who are working to advance the company’s flagship project: the Kronos MMR (micro modular reactor) at the University of Illinois–Urbana-Champaign.

Quotables: “With the strong presence of nuclear utilities and R&D institutions in Illinois, this is the ideal ecosystem for us to thrive,” said Florent Heidet, chief technology officer at Nano Nuclear.

Nano Nuclear CEO James Walker added, “This new hub will play a central role in our work to construct, demonstrate, and ultimately commercialize our Kronos MMR.”

Some context: Illinois’s funding of new nuclear development is in line with the state’s nuclear legacy and present, considering it is the largest nuclear energy producer in the country. It also aligns with Pritzker’s generally pronuclear stance, especially when it comes to smaller-scale reactors like the 15-MWe high-temperature, gas-cooled Kronos MMR, which is designed to be co-located with data centers and other energy-intensive industries and could also meet needs for industrial heat.

Beyond those applications, Nano Nuclear says that the reactor’s modular design will allow a multiunit configuration to fulfill gigawatt-scale power needs.

In 2021, Pritzker and the Illinois legislature passed the REV Illinois Act into law with the aim of bolstering the state’s clean manufacturing sector. While electric vehicles and renewable energy were the highlighted focuses of the legislation, it also served as a booster to nuclear. This is because it included companies in the nuclear sector under the definition of “renewable energy manufacturers.”

The new Chicagoland facility will be Nano Nuclear’s second demonstration facility in the U.S. The first, in Westchester County, N.Y., opened in February.",https://www.ans.org/file/20043/l/NANO-Nuclears-KRONOS-MMR.png,N,,2025-10-08 12:06:04.117731

Richard Robson of the University of Melbourne dreamed up the first MOFs, inspired by the tetrahedral, or pyramidlike, shape that carbon atoms take to form diamonds. He mixed a form of copper with a nitrile, an organic compound with nitrogen bonded to carbon, and watched as it formed a repeating structure with small holes in it.

Following a 12 percent drop in vehicles sold during the second quarter of 2025, Tesla is making an attempt to win back customers.

Although the American marque was expected to reveal a low-cost version of the Model Y SUV, the cheaper Model 3 sedan came as a surprise.

Tesla’s reductions will help offset the impact of the U.S. government ending federal EV tax credits. These previously reduced prices by $7,500 (£5,500).

Model 3 cut back to the EV essentials

In the United States, the Model 3 Standard will cost $36,990 (£27,500), representing a $5,500 (£4,100) saving over the rest of the range.

On the outside, the Model 3 Standard has 18-inch Prismata wheels and a choice of just three paint finishes.

A stripped-out approach is taken to the interior, with cloth upholstery, a manually adjustable steering wheel, and no FM radio or rear touchscreen. Following recent revisions, the Model 3 will also come with indicator stalks in place of touch-sensitive buttons on the steering wheel.

Tesla has not confirmed full technical details, but the Model 3 Standard offers an official range of 321 miles based on EPA testing.

No glass ceiling to Model Y ownership

The new Tesla Model Y Standard costs $39,990 (£29,750), undercutting Premium trim by $5,000 (£3,700), and offering a battery range of 321 miles.

A similar pared-back strategy has been applied here, with the panoramic glass roof removed, along with the FM radio and subwoofer for the sound system.

Cloth upholstery is used inside, and there are manual side mirrors and a manually adjustable steering wheel. When it comes to climate control, there is no longer a HEPA filter to provide protection against bioweapons.

Owners of both the Model 3 and Model Y in Standard trim will have to use their smartphone to lock and unlock their car. No physical key is provided.

Tesla intends to release lower-priced cars for other worldwide markets, with more details expected soon.

Dive Brief:

The Department of Energy terminated 321 financial awards worth about $7.56 billion after a review determined the projects failed to meet economic or national energy standards, according to an Oct. 2 release.

The DOE said the decision, which affects 223 projects, followed a case-by-case review of awards issued under clean energy and manufacturing, many of which were approved in the final months of the Biden administration.

Democratic leaders in Congress blasted the move as politically motivated, noting the terminations affected 108 Democratic districts versus 28 Republican House districts, and could likely raise energy prices.

Dive Insight:

The cancellations signal heightened scrutiny of federally-backed energy projects and create another layer of risk for contractors in the space.

The terminations stem from a May DOE policy that tightened financial review standards across several program offices, including the Offices of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Grid Deployment, Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy and Fossil Energy, according to the release.

The agency concluded the shuttered projects “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars,” according to the release.

Recipients have 30 days to appeal the termination decisions.

The policy shift piles on more uncertainty for contractors engaged in federally supported clean energy work. For example, in April, the Trump administration ordered construction halted on Equinor’s 810-MW Empire Wind 1 project offshore New York. The stoppage cost an estimated $50 million per week before the order was lifted in early October.

“The chance to reinvent our power system comes once in a generation,” said Zach Dell, CEO and co-founder of Base Power.
Base recently qualified for Texas’s Aggregated Distributed Energy Resource (ADER) program, which allows distributed batteries to be combined and bid directly into the grid.
“We’re building domestic manufacturing capacity for fixing the grid,” said Justin Lopas, COO and co-founder of Base Power.
About Base Power","AUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Base Power announced today it has raised $1 billion in Series C financing, led by Addition. All other major investors are re-investing, including Trust Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, Thrive Capital, Lightspeed, Andreessen Horowitz, Altimeter, StepStone, Elad Gil, 137 Ventures, Terrain, and Waybury. New major investors include Ribbit, CapitalG, Spark, BOND, Lowercarbon, Avenir, Glade Brook, Positive Sum, and 1789.

Power is the foundation of day-to-day life, yet America’s aging grid is strained, unreliable, and increasingly vulnerable. Base is a first-of-its-kind energy company powering America with reliable and affordable electricity. Base delivers for homeowners and for the grid through a network of distributed storage technology.

“The chance to reinvent our power system comes once in a generation,” said Zach Dell, CEO and co-founder of Base Power. “The challenge ahead requires the best engineers and operators to solve it and we’re scaling the team to make our abundant energy future a reality.”

In less than two years, Base has deployed more than 100 MWh of residential battery capacity. That pace makes it one of the fastest-scaling distributed energy platforms in the U.S., driven by organic growth, partnerships with leading homebuilders like Lennar and with forward-thinking utilities. The company has also rapidly expanded operations, now serving homeowners across the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, Greater Houston, and the Austin region, with plans to expand nationally in the near future.

To meet current and future demand, Base is building its first energy storage and power electronics factory at the site of the former Austin American-Statesman printing press in the heart of downtown Austin.

Base recently qualified for Texas’s Aggregated Distributed Energy Resource (ADER) program, which allows distributed batteries to be combined and bid directly into the grid. This participation strengthens reliability statewide and generates additional revenue from the grid, helping Base lower costs for homeowners while proving how distributed assets can operate at utility scale.

“We’re building domestic manufacturing capacity for fixing the grid,” said Justin Lopas, COO and co-founder of Base Power. “The only way to add capacity to the grid is physically deploying hardware, and we need to make that here in the U.S., ourselves. This factory in Austin is our first, and we’re already planning for our second. We’re building the infrastructure, systems, tools, processes, supporting software, and team that’s reindustrializing America and reinventing the grid.”

Luckily for the postal service, the batteries were all replaced under warranty, which must’ve cost Gould a fortune.
From the 1920s until the 1990s, the Electruck was the only production electric vehicle that could be purchased (albeit commercially) from a mainstream automaker in America.","Electric automobiles have existed since the late 1800s, and while they had a flash of market share back in the early days of the automobile, it hasn’t been until the last 15 years that the technology has really taken off. But tracing the roots of the first modern, practical, or mainstream EV is difficult, especially when most of the qualifiers are subjective.

Some benchmarks, like the 2012 Nissan Leaf, 2008 Tesla Roadster, and the 1997 General Motors EV1 are obvious. However, the history of modern EVs can be traced back even further. Arguably, the first modern, production EV from a major automaker was the 1974 AM General DJ-5E Electruck.

An obscure battery-powered postal Jeep may seem like an unlikely starting point for the EV revolution, but in many ways it is a forgotten milestone.

Smoggy History

While gasoline was still relatively cheap in the 1960s, air pollution had become a major problem in large U.S. cities. In response, the federal government passed the Clean Air Act and several other laws which included a small amount of funding for automakers to research electric vehicles. In response, GM developed the battery-powered Electrovair I & II concepts, plus the hydrogen fuel-cell-powered Electrovan concept. Ford made advances with sodium sulfur batteries, but wouldn’t put them in a vehicle until the 1990s.

American Motors Corporation joined the program with the development of the Amitron, a two-seater city car concept that claimed an impressive 150 miles of range per charge. The proposed powertrain used a clever dual-chemistry battery system, where two smaller nickel-cadmium batteries provided rapid on-demand power for acceleration and larger but slower-discharging lithium batteries provided the energy for sustained long-range cruising.

The Amitron was also supposed to have regenerative braking, a revolutionary idea for a passenger EV in the 1960s. Although the technology had existed on some electric cars in the early 1900s, it had to be articulated manually through separate controls in combination with friction brakes. The Amitron would be the first EV that automatically transitioned from regenerative braking to friction brakes with just one brake pedal.

However, reports from the time indicate that the Amitron did not actually have a motor or battery when it first appeared at auto shows in 1967. Supposedly, AMC planned to road test the battery technology in a Rambler American prototype the following year, but whether the powertrain was ever installed in the Amitron remains unclear.

Despite newly appointed CEO Roy Chapin’s optimistic platitudes about the technology and VP of Styling Richard Teague’s jokes of a future EV called “the Voltswagon,” the Amitron never got past the concept stage. Like Ford and GM, AMC soon admitted that EVs were still too expensive and impractical, even with new battery technologies. But while Ford and GM abandoned their EV efforts, American Motors would get a second chance.

(Not So) Speedy Delivery

In 1969, AMC purchased Jeep Corporation from Kaiser Industries, which included a division for government vehicle production. Renamed AM General in 1971, the division manufactured everything from tactical five-ton trucks to urban transit buses to postal delivery Jeeps.

Around that time, the United States Postal Service began testing electric delivery vehicles from various manufacturers across the country. In Cupertino, California, which was plagued by air pollution and smog, the regional Post Office eventually purchased 30 battery-powered vehicles from Harbilt Electric Trucks, an English manufacturer that specialized in milk delivery vans. While usage was limited to dense, low-mileage, urban routes on relatively flat terrain, the results were positive. Along with being cleaner, the EVs were also cheaper to operate than the gasoline-powered Jeep DJ-5s already in use, as a 1978 U.S. Department of Energy report later highlighted:

“Performance of the Harbilt vehicles has been outstanding from both a reliability and cost standpoint as indicated by… operating and maintenance costs of $0.085 per vehicle mile versus $0.120 per vehicle mile for the ICE Jeeps.”

While the Harbilt test was motivated primarily by reducing air pollution, the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo provided a second, equally urgent reason to pursue electric vehicles. Following the success of the Harbilts, the Postal Service opened bids in 1974 for an additional 352 electric delivery vehicles for use in select markets. Requirements were:

Minimal ground-level pollutants

Low noise level

Low energy cost

Low maintenance cost

20-mile range

33-mph top speed

30 mph in 20 seconds acceleration

300 stops and starts per charge

Ability to climb a 10% grade at 10 mph

Four-year battery life

Right-hand drive

Sliding side doors

Easy mount/dismount

Steering and handling comparable to present gasoline vehicles

Acceleration and braking close to that of the existing fleet

Safety engineering to meet DOT standards

Necessary accessories (lights, defroster, gauges, etc.)

With thousands of gasoline vehicles already in service that were already DOT-approved and met the right-hand-drive and sliding door requirements, AM General partnered with electronics manufacturer Gould Industries to build an electrified version of the DJ-5. Competing against Otis (the elevator company) and Electromotion (a startup that used a lot of SAAB parts), AM General won the contract with the lowest bid. Appropriately, the new vehicle would be called the DJ-5E Electruck.

The Electruck would be assembled at AM General’s plant in South Bend, Indiana (which had formerly belonged to Studebaker’s defense group before Kaiser Jeep acquired it). The body and chassis were mostly unchanged from the conventional DJ-5, but Gould would supply the entire propulsion system, including the motor, batteries, controller, and chargers. Ironically, the vehicles wouldn’t be 100% electric, as a small gasoline heater was necessary to heat the cabin and defog the windows.

Like the Amitron, the DJ-5E would have regenerative braking, making it the first production EV since the early 1900s to have this feature. Unlike the Amitron, the DJ-5E would use lead-acid batteries, which were a proven technology and far cheaper than either nickel-cadmium or lithium batteries. Unfortunately, they were also considerably heavier and less energy-dense.

Outputting 54 volts, the battery pack contained 27 cells and weighed approximately 1,300 pounds. Total storage was listed as 330 amp-hours, which equaled 17.82 kWh–or roughly one-quarter the size of the battery in a 2020 Chevrolet Bolt EV. All told, the DJ-5E’s curb weight was a hefty 3,618 lbs, about 1,200 lbs more than the gasoline-powered DJ-5C.

Propulsion came from a 20-horsepower DC electric motor that itself weighed 263 lbs. Mounted almost dead-center in the frame, it connected directly to the rear differential with no transmission. The motor also functioned as a generator during regenerative braking, but unlike modern EVs, the system was activated only by the brake pedal, not by lifting off the accelerator. Connected to a speed sensor, it worked only above 15 mph before transitioning to friction brakes.

Like all other DJs, the 5E was rear-wheel-drive only (despite being a Jeep). Charging hardware was optional, with an onboard 120-volt unit adding 90 lbs, or an exterior 240/480-volt unit available in a weatherproof cabinet. Depending on voltage, charging times ranged from 10 to 15 hours.

Performance could best be described as “middling.” The low horsepower and high weight yielded a glacial zero-to-30 mph time of 20 seconds and a maximum speed of 33 to 40mph. The primary range estimate, based on a 300 stop/start drive cycle from the Postal Service, resulted in an estimated 29 miles from 100% to 20% charge. When driven at a constant speed, range estimates were as high as 60 miles at 20 mph, falling to just 32 miles at 35mph. Unimpressive though the figures may have been, they met or exceeded all of the Postal Service’s requirements.

Going Postal

A pilot model of the DJ-5E was delivered to the USPS on September 4th, 1974, and it passed all its tests. Official production deliveries began in May 1975 and continued until March 1976, with a total of 352 DJ-5Es being delivered to the Postal Service. The majority went to the smog-plagued cities of San Bernardino, Torrance, and Gardena, California, while additional Electrucks were sent to Evansville, Indiana, Charleston, South Carolina, Falls Church, Virginia, Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and New Haven and Hartford, Connecticut. As of May 1977, 310 were put into service, with 33 as spares and nine used for training programs.

In March of 1977, the Postal Service supplied an Electruck to NASA for performance testing. NASA had been hired by the Energy Research and Development Administration (a precursor to the United States Department of Energy) to compile a report on electric and hybrid vehicles. The DJ-5E came remarkably close to AM General’s estimated figures for range and acceleration, although NASA did conclude that the 15-mph speed threshold of the regenerative braking system prevented it from adding any meaningful amount of energy back during low-speed stop-and-go driving (which I’d argue kind of defeated its whole purpose). The report also mentioned difficulty starting from a standstill on hills, due to the brake pedal cutting all power to the motor, requiring drivers to use the emergency brake as a hill holder to prevent coasting backwards.

As for the Postal Service, responses to the DJ-5E were…mixed. From the beginning, there were problems, as the 1978 D.O.E. report explained,

“Unfortunately, the performance capabilities of the Harbilt resulted in some routes being accepted for DJ-5E assignments with requirements in excess of the performance specifications used by the U.S.P.S. for procurement of the DJ-5E. These routes were later identified as being responsible for some vehicle failures due to overstressing the assigned vehicles.”

In colder test climates, DJ-5Es struggled to complete routes as short as five miles, having to be replaced with internal combustion vehicles until the weather warmed up. While the California fleets fared better, the Jeeps were still more problem-prone compared to their English counterparts:

“DJ-5Es have experienced a very high failure rate relative to the Harbilt vehicles… about 7 failures per vehicle per year. This contrasts with the less than one failure per vehicle per year indicated by the Cupertino records for the Harbilts…

A table breaks down the cause of failures, which were overwhelmingly due to the powertrain. Motor controllers were especially troublesome, requiring 639 repairs by April of 1977, most of which were performed by Gould Industries under warranty. Unfortunately, by the time Gould developed a more reliable replacement, another problem had popped up:

“Recently the DJ-5Es have been experiencing an excessive number of battery failures… warranty repair records… show a total of 143 battery replacements in 1976, which means a battery replacement rate of almost one per operating vehicle per year, or an average life of about 3,000 vehicle miles. The batteries carry a 4-yr warranty, which implies that Gould expected to achieve a life of at least 1,200 cycles.”

As it stood, batteries on average lasted only 300 charge/recharge cycles before they failed, or only about a third of the life Gould was expecting. Luckily for the postal service, the batteries were all replaced under warranty, which must’ve cost Gould a fortune. Despite all this, the report claims the Electrucks weren’t a total disaster:

Despite the excessive number of failures experienced with the U.S.P.S. DJ-5Es, the availability of the vehicles to perform scheduled duties has been fairly good. This can be attributed primarily to the excellent support provided by Gould to minimize downtime and reduce failure rates. The U.S.P.S. reports the percentage availability–the percentage of days vehicles successfully complete their assigned routes–as 97% for the DJ-5E fleet through 1976.

But as battery failures increased with age, so did downtime, causing the Postal Service to substitute more gasoline vehicles. Even with Gould and AM General footing the bill for most of the repairs under warranty, higher-than-expected maintenance costs ended up making the DJ-5Es more expensive on average to operate than their gasoline counterparts, and that didn’t even include the nearly double initial purchase price over ICE Jeeps.

It was likely for these reasons that the Postal Service didn’t order any more DJ-5Es after its initial 352 units, although AM General managed to convince Canada Post to purchase five of them and Bell Telephone to order 10 as maintenance vehicles. By 1983, the USPS retired most of its DJ-5Es, just one year after the Cupertino Post Office gave up its fleet of beloved Harbilts.

Return to Sender

Ironically, AMC trotted out the old Amitron concept again in 1977, this time with a fresh coat of paint and the new name: Electron. It was part of Concept 80, a traveling exhibit designed to get the press and the banks to have more faith in AMC’s ability to build modern, economical cars. Looking through the video archives at the Kenosha History Center, I thought I spotted a DJ-5E in the background of the show, too.

But aside from a print brochure, a service parts catalog, and a single paragraph in AMC’s 1974 shareholders’ report, I haven’t been able to find much more official information from American Motors on the DJ-5E. I guess 367 electric Jeeps weren’t a big priority when the company was struggling just to make payroll in the late 70s.

That 1978 DOE report includes data on several other EVs available at the time, all of which had major drawbacks compared to gasoline vehicles. With low ranges but high price tags, the technology simply wasn’t there to make practical electric cars. Yet, we had to start somewhere.

When I look at the DJ-5E, I see more than just a goofy, impractical mail truck; I see a milestone in the slow but determined evolution of electric vehicles. Unlike the Electrovair, or even the Amitron, this wasn’t just a headline-grabbing one-off prototype never intended for sale. And while other third-party companies throughout the ’70s and ’80s built EV conversions of existing cars (including AMC models) or designed and built low-volume models, AMC was the only major automaker to actually build its own.

From the 1920s until the 1990s, the Electruck was the only production electric vehicle that could be purchased (albeit commercially) from a mainstream automaker in America. Although its production was very limited, it pioneered features that we now take for granted in modern EVs, like regenerative braking, a silicon-based controller, and a separate 12-volt accessory battery. That’s pretty innovative stuff, and it wasn’t GM or Ford who figured it out; it was little AMC.

In light of that, I think the AM General DJ-5E deserves to be up there with the Tesla Roadster, the GM EV1, and the other milestones of EV history. And while EVs still have a ways to go until they’re as popular as gasoline cars, it looks like the Postal Service is going to give EVs another try. Hopefully, it will work out better this time around. If any of those postal workers from the 1970s are still on the job, I think they would be pretty impressed to see how far we’ve come since the days of the Electruck.",https://media.hagerty.com/media/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Electruck-Lead-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 13:11:57.174528

LITIGATION AND DISPUTES

Third Circuit Rules Pennsylvania Commission’s Transmission Siting Decision Preempted by Federal Law

In a September 5, 2025 decision, a unanimous three judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that a Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission order denying Transource Pennsylvania’s application to build transmission lines in Pennsylvania was invalid under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The specific project is meant to relieve congestion along the Pennsylvania-Maryland border, and is projected to lower costs in Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. However, it is also forecasted to increase costs in Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Commission decided there is not a need for the project, and in doing so it rejected PJM’s Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)-approved cost-benefit analysis. The Third Circuit concluded the Pennsylvania Commission’s decision frustrated FERC’s objectives. It found that regional planning was one tool FERC had developed to support competition and held that “[w]hen an RTO has selected a project for inclusion in a regional transmission plan as part of its federal mandate, a state regulator cannot, consistent with the Supremacy Clause, reject the project based on a lack of ‘need.’” The district court had also found that the Pennsylvania order violated the dormant commerce clause, but the Third Circuit did not reach that issue.

D.C. Circuit Upholds FERC Decision on Solar-Plus-Battery Project in Post-Chevron PURPA Case

On September 9, 2025, in a 2-1 decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld FERC’s certification of the Broadview solar power facility as a “small power production facility” under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA). The court had upheld FERC’s decision in 2023, but the United States Supreme Court remanded the case back to the D.C. Circuit following the decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024), overruling Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, 467 U.S. 837 (1984). The Broadview facility will be capable of generating up to 160 MW and has a 50 MW battery, but the facility’s inverters can only send 80 MW to the grid. The question before the court was whether Broadview will violate the 80 MW power production capacity ceiling for a “facility” set forth in 16 U.S.C. § 796(17)(A). Earlier, the court had deferred to FERC in resolving the issue, but on remand the court concluded for itself that the “power production capacity” of a “facility” is the amount of power it can send to the grid. The D.C. Circuit held this reading of the statute best accounts for the facility as a whole and not just the maximum capacity of the solar production array, which the court characterized as just one component of the facility.

Xcel Energy and Telecommunications Defendants Settle Marshall Fire Litigation

On September 24, 2025, one day before trial was scheduled to begin in Boulder County District Court in Boulder, Colorado, Xcel Energy, Qwest Corporation, and Teleport Communications America announced an approximately $640 million settlement in principle to resolve claims brought by individual plaintiffs, subrogation insurers, and public entities related to the 2021 Marshall Fire. In its statement, Xcel Energy said that approximately $350 million of the settlement would be funded by its remaining insurance coverage and none from its customers. Xcel Energy did not admit any fault, wrongdoing, or negligence, consistent with its position throughout the litigation. Plaintiffs had sought billions in damages.

Pennsylvania Supreme Court Allows Utility to Keep Competitors Add-Ons off Utility Bills

On September 25, 2025, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided that FirstEnergy does not have to provide “on-bill billing” to third parties offering non-utility goods and services, such as tree trimming services and smart thermostats, even though it will include such amounts when customers purchase such goods and services from FirstEnergy itself. Under Pennsylvania law, FirstEnergy and other Electric Distribution Companies (EDCs) do have to provide on-bill billing when customers choose to purchase power generated by a different utility operating as an electric generation supplier (EGS), but the court concluded that the applicable provisions of Pennsylvania’s Competition Act do not apply to non-commodity goods and services.

REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS

Trump Administration Cancels Awards to Clean Energy Projects in Blue States

In a press release issued on October 1, 2025, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced the termination of 321 financial awards supporting 223 projects. DOE stated that the projects did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on the investment of taxpayer dollars. DOE did not provide a list of the projects in question in its press release, but reports indicate they include a Minnesota Power direct current upgrade project and Xcel Energy long-duration energy storage projects. The projects are clean energy projects and are located in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington, Democratic leaning states.

Texas Commission Approves Two Entergy Gas-Fueled Plants with $2.4 Billion Hard Cap

On September 11, 2025, the Public Utility Commission of Texas approved a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity for Entergy’s proposed gas-fueled 754-MW Legend Power Station and 453-MW Lone Star Power Station. Legend is a combined cycle facility that would be carbon capture-enabled and have a hydrogen-capable turbine, and Lone Star is a combustion turbine facility with a hydrogen capable turbine. In remarks at hearing and a Commissioner Memorandum, Chairman Thomas Gleeson agreed Entergy needs to address projected capacity shortfalls but advocated for a hard cap on costs in light of concerns that the utility had not taken sufficient steps to ensure the projects will be cost effective. Notably, Entergy had not issued a request for proposals to determine what projects to pursue. The Commission set a $1.6 billion hard cap for the Legend project and a $799 million hard cap for the Lone Star project.

Nevada Commission Institutes Daily Demand Charge for Nevada Power and 15-Minute Interval Net Metering for Sierra Pacific Power

In a September 16, 2025 Order, the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada (PUCN) resolved the contested issues in rate cases brought by Nevada Power Company and Sierra Pacific Power Company, both of which do business as NV Energy. Importantly, the PUCN established a new daily demand charge for all Nevada Power residential and small business customers to be implemented beginning April 2026, which will be calculated based on the maximum amount a customer uses each day with the daily charges summed up monthly. The new charge is designed to address what the PUCN said was “under-recovery of costs” from customers with solar generation participating in a statutorily required net-metering program. PUCN also established 15-minute interval net metering, rather than monthly net metering, for new net metering customers in Sierra’s service territory to address the same issue.

Framework for New Proactive Grid Planning Process Adopted in New York

On September 18, 2025, the New York Public Service Commission (NYPSC) adopted a Proactive Planning Framework designed to establish a statewide unified process to study and identify necessary system upgrades to support building electrification and transportation electrification. In contrast to New York’s Coordinated Grid Planning Process, which is focused on higher-voltage infrastructure, the new process is to use bottom-up modeling to identify upgrades to distribution and local network systems for NYPSC consideration. The first step under the framework is for utilities to file plans outlining data needs and assumptions needed to develop granular load forecasts.

Washington Commission Adopts Rules for Combined Gas and Electric Integrated System Plans

The Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission issued rules on September 26, 2025 for combined gas and electric Integrated System Plans that Puget Sound Energy, the state’s only large gas and electric utility, will have to begin filing in 2027. The rules include specific plan requirements, including a cost test to be used for emission-reduction measures. The combined planning process was mandated by the Washington Legislature in the Large Combination Utilities Decarbonization Act, which was enacted in 2023. A voter-approved initiative, Initiative 2066, would have required significant changes to the rules and the underlying statute in ways that would continue access to and use of natural gas, but it was found unconstitutional by a district court earlier this year. The Washington Supreme Court granted review of that decision on September 3, 2025.

FERC Issues Direct Final Rule to Sunset 53 Existing Regulations

On October 1, 2025, the FERC approved a direct final rule to incorporate a conditional phaseout date into 53 existing regulations. FERC stated that the rules chosen for sunsetting are “outdated, seldomly used, or duplicative regulations.” Some regulations are outdated because their governing regulations or statutes have been amended or repealed. Other regulations concern filing protocols that are not used by FERC anymore. The rule will be effective 45 days after being published in the Federal Register and the conditional sunset dates incorporated into the existing rules are one year after the effective date. FERC explained that the one-year period provides an opportunity to comment on the costs and benefits of the regulations in question prior to the sunset date. FERC also stated that if it receives significant adverse comments on any part of the direct final rule by 30 days after the date of publication in the Federal Register, it will withdraw such part of the rule and address it in a separate rulemaking. FERC’s action was taken in response to Executive Order 14270, “Zero-Based Regulatory Budgeting to Unleash American Energy.”

The promise of new engineering techniques for geothermal energy – heat from the Earth itself – has attracted rising levels of investment to this reliable, low-emission power source that can provide continuous electricity almost anywhere on the planet. That includes ways to harness geothermal energy from idle or abandoned oil and gas wells. In the first quarter of 2025, North American geothermal installations attracted US$1.7 billion in public funding – compared with $2 billion for all of 2024, which itself was a significant increase from previous years, according to an industry analysis from consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.

As an exploration geophysicist and energy engineer, I’ve studied geothermal systems’ resource potential and operational trade-offs firsthand. From the investment and technological advances I’m seeing, I believe geothermal energy is poised to become a significant contributor to the energy mix in the U.S. and around the world, especially when integrated with other renewable sources.

A May 2025 assessment by the U.S. Geological Survey found that geothermal sources just in the Great Basin, a region that encompasses Nevada and parts of neighboring states, have the potential to meet as much as 10% of the electricity demand of the whole nation – and even more as technology to harness geothermal energy advances. And the International Energy Agency estimates that by 2050, geothermal energy could provide as much as 15% of the world’s electricity needs.

Why geothermal energy is unique

Geothermal energy taps into heat beneath the Earth’s surface to generate electricity or provide direct heating. Unlike solar or wind, it never stops. It runs around the clock, providing consistent, reliable power with closed-loop water systems and few emissions.

Geothermal is capable of providing significant quantities of energy. For instance, Fervo Energy’s Cape Station project in Utah is reportedly on track to deliver 100 megawatts of baseload, carbon-free geothermal power by 2026. That’s less than the amount of power generated by the average coal plant in the U.S., but more than the average natural gas plant produces.

But the project, estimated to cost $1.1 billion, is not complete. When complete in 2028, the station is projected to deliver 500 megawatts of electricity. That amount is 100 megawatts more than its original goal without additional drilling, thanks to various technical improvements since the project broke ground.

And geothermal energy is becoming economically competitive. By 2035, according to the International Energy Agency, technical advances could mean energy from enhanced geothermal systems could cost as little as $50 per megawatt-hour, a price competitive with other renewable sources.

Types of geothermal energy

There are several ways to get energy from deep within the Earth.

Hydrothermal systems tap into underground hot water and steam to generate electricity. These resources are concentrated in geologically active areas where heat, water and permeable rock naturally coincide. In the U.S., that’s generally California, Nevada and Utah. Internationally, most hydrothermal energy is in Iceland and the Philippines.

Some hydrothermal facilities, such as Larderello in Italy, have operated for over a century, proving the technology’s long-term viability. Others in New Zealand and the U.S. have been running since the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Enhanced geothermal systems effectively create electricity-generating hydrothermal processes just about anywhere on the planet. In places where there is not enough water in the ground or where the rock is too dense to move heat naturally, these installations drill deep holes and inject fluid into the hot rocks, creating new fractures and opening existing ones, much like hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas production.

A system like this uses more than one well. In one, it pumps cold water down, which collects heat from the rocks and then is pumped back up through another well, where the heat drives turbines. In recent years, academic and corporate research has dramatically improved drilling speed and lowered costs.

Ground source heat pumps do not require drilling holes as deep, but instead take advantage of the fact that the Earth’s temperature is relatively stable just below the surface, even just 6 or8 feet down (1.8 to 2.4 meters) – and it’s hotter hundreds of feet lower.

These systems don’t generate electricity but rather circulate fluid in underground pipes, exchanging heat with the soil, extracting warmth from the ground in winter and transferring warmth to the ground in summer. These systems are similar but more efficient thanair-source heat pumps, sometimes called minisplits, which are becoming widespread across the U.S. for heating and cooling. Geothermal heat pump systems can serve individual homes, commercial buildings and even neighborhood or business developments.

Direct-use applications also don’t generate electricity but rather use the geothermal heat directly. Farmers heat greenhouses and dry crops; aquaculture facilities maintain optimal water temperatures; industrial operations use the heat to dehydrate food, cure concrete or other energy-intensive processes. Worldwide, these applications now deliver over 100,000 megawatts of thermal capacity. Some geothermal fluids contain valuable minerals; lithium concentrations in the groundwater of California’s Salton Sea region could potentially supply battery manufacturers. Federal judges are reviewing a proposal to do just that, as well as legal challenges to it.

Researchers are finding new ways to use geothermal resources, too. Some are using underground rock formations to store energy as heat when consumer demand is low and use it to produce electricity when demand rises.

Some geothermal power stations can adjust their output to meet demand, rather than running continuously at maximum capacity.

Geothermal sources are also making other renewable-energy projects more effective. Pairing geothermal energy with solar and wind resources and battery storage are increasing the reliability of above-ground renewable powerin Texas, among other places.

And geothermal energy can power clean hydrogen production as well as energy-intensive efforts to physically remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as is happening in Iceland.

Geothermal potential in the US and worldwide

Currently, the U.S. has about 3.9 gigawatts of installed geothermal capacity, mostly in the West. That’s about 0.4% of current U.S. energy production, but the amount of available energy is much larger, according to federal and international engineering assessments.

And converting abandoned oil and gas wells for enhanced geothermal systems could significantly increase the amount of energy available and its geographic spread.

One example is happening in Beaver County, in the southwestern part of Utah. Once a struggling rural community, it now hosts multiple geothermal plants that are being developed to both demonstrate the potential and to supply electricity to customers as far away as California.

Those projects include repurposing idle oil or gas wells, which is relatively straightforward: Engineers identify wells that reach deep, hot rock formations and circulate water or another fluid in a closed loop to capture heat to generate electricity or provide direct heating. This method does not require drilling new wells, which significantly reduces setup costs and environmental disruption and accelerates deployment.

There are as many as 4 million abandoned oil and gas wells across the U.S., some of which could shift from being fossil fuel infrastructure into opportunities for clean energy.

Challenges and trade-offs

Geothermal energy is not without technical, environmental and economic hurdles.

Drilling is expensive, and conventional systems need specific geological conditions. Enhanced systems, using hydraulic fracturing, risk causing earthquakes.

Overall emissions are low from geothermal systems, though the systems can release hydrogen sulfide, a corrosive gas that is toxic to humans and can contribute to respiratory irritation. But modern geothermal plants use abatement systems that can capture up to 99.9% of hydrogen sulfide before it enters the atmosphere.

And the systems do use water, though closed-loop systems can minimize consumption.

Building geothermal power stations does require significant investment, but its ability to deliver energy over the long term can offset many of these costs. Projects like those undertaken by Fervo Energy show that government subsidies are no longer necessary for a project to get funded, built and begin generating energy.

Despite its challenges, geothermal energy’s reliability, low emissions and scalability make it a vital complement to solar and wind – and a cornerstone of a stable, low-carbon energy future.",https://img.designdevelopmenttoday.com/mindful/im/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/10/istock-2192345122.eLPq14x7xl.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-10-08 09:57:48.204177

The electric carmaker's shares fell on Tuesday after the launch of new stripped-back versions of Tesla's best-selling Model Y and 3.

The new Model Y and Model 3 Standard cost $39,990 and $36,990, around $5,000 less than Tesla's flagship models, but come without Autosteer, rear screens, leather seats, and radios.

Despite this, the new variants will cost you around $2,000 more than the classic Model 3 and Y would have done before the expiry of the $7,500 federal tax credit for a new electric car, which ended on September 30.

Wannabe Tesla owners can still access EV subsidies in states like New York and Colorado, but many customers now face the prospect of paying more than they would have just over a week ago for a car with fewer features.

The Model Y and 3 Standard are also more expensive than the cheapest EVs on the market. The Nissan Leaf starts at $29,990 in the US, while Tesla's Detroit rival General Motors sells the electric Chevy Equinox from $35,100.

Tesla's affordable models are also a long way from the $25,000 price tag that has often been held up as a benchmark for electric vehicle adoption.

Jeff Bezos-backed EV startup Slate is targeting a price point in the mid-$20,000s with its buzzy electric truck, while GM and Ford have both said they will ship electric cars that cost $30,000 or less in the coming years.

Elon Musk floated the idea of a $25,000 Tesla as early as 2020, saying the vehicle had ""always been our dream."" But the company has backed away from plans to build a radically low-cost vehicle in recent years.

Last April, Reuters reported that Tesla had scrapped a proposed affordable model, code-named NV91. In October 2024, Musk told investors that the rise of autonomous vehicles meant it would be ""pointless"" for the company to build a non-robotaxi $25,000 car.

Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) said, opening National Clean Energy Week last month.
The reason for the trend, she explained, is the enormous opportunity in the clean energy market: “The federal opportunity on the clean energy side may be diminished right now, but the market opportunity is massive.
U.S. Rep. Bob Latta (R-OH-8) noted that global electricity demand is surging due to the growing use of data centers.
Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-VA-02) reflected on the importance of state support for clean energy.
As Sen. Murkowski said, “Americans, including Republicans, broadly support clean energy.” Both parties have changed their tune over the years, according to Sen. Curtis.","“I can remember a time when energy wasn’t necessarily political,” U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) said, opening National Clean Energy Week last month. “The reality that we’re facing right now is this is not necessarily the happiest year on record for clean energy. You’ve got some headwinds that you’re facing,” she reflected on the uncertainty facing the industry.

And yet, Sen. Murkowski expressed optimism and pointed out reasons for hope: “What I’m here to assure you is that it will get better. It will get better. And the reason I’m so confident of that is just looking at at the fundamentals, the cold, hard facts of new industries that are emerging to create more demand for electricity than ever, ever before; of a strained grid, where reliability can only be protected if we build out more of everything that we have, and we do it as fast as we can; and, rapidly rising electricity prices. The solution to all of this is more power.” Taking resources off the table, whether they be fossil fuels or clean energy, is simply a bad idea, she argued.

Sen. Murkowski pointed to a report from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which found that solar accounted for 77.7% of the capacity added to the grid; when combined with wind, renewables accounted for nearly 96% of the new sources of generation in 2025. The reason for the trend, she explained, is the enormous opportunity in the clean energy market: “The federal opportunity on the clean energy side may be diminished right now, but the market opportunity is massive. Even with less federal support, what clean energy can tap into is virtually unparalleled.”

Sen. Murkowski was not the only legislator to advocate for an all-of-the-above approach at NCEW. U.S. Sen. John Curtis (R-UT) explained, “We’re now in a world where we need every electron we can get, and we’re not quite sure where we’re going to get all of our electrons and where they’re going to come from.” That was why it was so easy for him to support clean energy credits during the budget reconciliation process, he remembered. U.S. Rep. Bob Latta (R-OH-8) noted that global electricity demand is surging due to the growing use of data centers. He said that Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) and Independent System Operators (ISOs) have all told him, “We’ve got to have more power,” and “We cannot take any generation offline that we have right now.” He reflected on the country’s trajectory, starting in 2008 when House Republicans promoted an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy to reduce reliance on foreign oil and gas, which ultimately led the country to become the world’s number one natural gas producer. He summarized, “We have great things that can happen in this country. So, it’s using everything we have at our disposal so we make sure we’re on top.”

U.S. Rep. Buddy Carter (R-GA-01) added that his state’s energy needs have resulted in a diverse energy mix: “Because Georgia has been the number one state in which to do business for eleven years in a row, we need every electron we can get, and that’s why I believe in an all-of-the-above energy strategy.” He shared estimates that in the next decade, the state will need about 9,500 more megawatts (MW) of power, or two more Plant Vogtles, which is already the country’s largest supplier of clean energy. Tapping into clean, reliable energy is the state’s solution to prepare for the future and remain a top business hub.

U.S. Rep. Marc Veasey (D-TX-33) noted that there is room for a state like Texas, which is known for its oil and gas, to lead in other energy forms, as well: “I’m very proud to be a Texan, because I think that we probably do all-of-the-above better than anyone else.” For example, the state is a dominant player in the wind industry and a leader in solar energy. Meanwhile, U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans (R-VA-02) reflected on the importance of state support for clean energy. She said that she loves being from the Commonwealth of Virginia “because I’ve got a great governor who is also on board with this all-of-the-above energy approach, and he’s really set the stage for us and allowed us really a safe space to be all-of-the-above energy champions, from nuclear small modular reactors… to geothermal and traditional forms of energy.”

As for the role of the federal government, U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg (R-MI-07) discussed the importance of Congressional support for clean energy: “As we continue our work in Washington, we must remain laser-focused on strengthening the energy capacity of our country by promoting an all of above energy approach and unleashing American energy production.” At the same time, U.S. Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV-03) said that the government should allow the free market to play out: “We need to make sure we’re doing everything to not pick winners or leave losers. It shouldn’t be Washington that is making these decisions on what investments should be made. It should be investors.”

U.S. Rep. Scott Peters (D-CA-50) concurred that as a country, we should move beyond relying solely on oil and gas and “truly invest in an all-of-the-above energy strategy that looks to the future instead of clinging to the past.” The country should “invest in all forms of energy, build transmission, get out of our own way, and honor the rights and expectations of our private investor partners,” he detailed. U.S. Rep. Juan Ciscomani (R-AZ-06) simplified, “We have to be supporting every form out there.”

Multiple leaders pointed out that clean energy has broad bipartisan support. Rep. Ciscomani stated that his district is one-third Republican, one-third Democratic, and one-third Independent, and “I call it a district where good ideas win, and this is what we’re working on here is one of those good ideas.” He advocated for Congressional Republicans to step up and lead on these issues by working with both public and private partners. As Sen. Murkowski said, “Americans, including Republicans, broadly support clean energy.”

Both parties have changed their tune over the years, according to Sen. Curtis. He reminisced on a time when Democrats did not want to admit that the country needed nuclear power, and Republicans did not want to discuss climate. Now, he pointed out, “I think there’s about 85 in the House Republicans that are pretty comfortable talking about climate.”

Rep. Walberg used his state as a specific example of what can happen when there is bipartisan collaboration. After the 2022 closure of the Palisades Nuclear Plant in Michigan caused an adverse economic impact of more than $250 million, “a bipartisan group of Congressional leaders came together to request the funding necessary to reopen the plant, and the Trump administration continues to pave the way for the plant’s awaited restart.” It will generate more than 800 MW of energy, enough to power approximately 800,000 homes, and create 600 jobs in the area.

Rep. Lee concurred, “I think we have to remember that there are members of Congress who are committed to working across the aisle, and that it doesn’t matter if you represent a blue state or a red state, a rural community or an urban community – we all understand our needs, and it’s going to require all of us to put the hatchets down a little bit and work together.” Sen. Curtis summarized, “We need to figure out how to keep the politics out of it.”

U.S. Sen. Murkowski concluded that the incredible demand for energy should cause all of us, across the aisle, to stretch our imaginations as to what is next: “What’s next that’s going to allow us to meet this in a manner that is head-on, demonstrating our resolve, demonstrating our ingenuity in these spaces that we have long led on? And we will continue to lead in all forms of energy, whether they are what we know today or what will be coming tomorrow.”",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/548225642_1353175589503893_8662140847904679327_n-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 09:57:52.123647

The new Model Y, costing just under $40,000 with a stripped-down interior, comes in a brutal year for Tesla as it tries to attract more customers despite an aging lineup, stiff competition from foreign EV makers and anti-Elon Musk boycotts targeting the company.

The reaction from the stock market after the news broke suggests the new models are not expected to help much.

“Investors were looking for something truly different, not an iteration of a old product,” said Edmunds analyst Ivan Drury, speaking as Tesla stock dropped sharply in the last minutes of trading. “I can’t imagine this will bring levels back to what they want.”

Tesla also announced a cheaper version of its Model 3 for under $37,000. For New York residents taking advantage of a state rebate, the price was below $35,000.

Tesla has talked about a cheaper car to appeal to more cost-conscious consumers for years, though the two new “standard” models are priced well above the $25,000 price tag promised. They come as customers are widely expected to hold off from purchases over the next several months due to the recent expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles.

Tesla stock fell 4.5% to $443.09 on Tuesday after closing the day before up more than 5% on anticipation of the new model announcement.

Compared to previous models, the new Model Y comes with a shorter 321-mile driving range, fewer audio speakers and a fabric interior, not microsuede. The model also lacks a panoramic glass roof and a touchscreen in the second row.

America’s national parks, national monuments, and wild public lands don’t deserve this fate and we’ll work tirelessly to stop it from happening,” Steve Bloch, legal director at the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, said in a news release.
There are also parcels on the east side of Zion National Park, including a portion of the North Fork of the Virgin River and North Fork Road, the analysis says.
“Coal mines near Zion, Bryce Canyon or Capitol Reef?
It was decided decades ago that these lands would be off the table,” Cory MacNulty, Southwest campaign director for the National Parks Conservation Association, said in a statement.","An initiative of Congress’ spending package known as the “big, beautiful bill” started becoming a reality last week, leaving environmentalists with deep concerns about the future landscape of national parks.

The map of 13.1 million acres of federal land now available for coal leasing triples the benchmark set by the law and includes parcels near or directly adjacent to landmarks like Zion, Bryce Canyon and Capitol Reef national parks, an analysis from groups including the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance found.

“The Trump Administration views Southern Utah’s remarkable redrock country as just another place to exploit and plunder as they promote new coal mining. Nothing could be further from the truth. America’s national parks, national monuments, and wild public lands don’t deserve this fate and we’ll work tirelessly to stop it from happening,” Steve Bloch, legal director at the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, said in a news release.

About 48,000 acres of federally-owned land in Utah are available for coal-mining operations, a big step in the Trump administration’s plan to increase energy production in the country, particularly fossil fuels.

According to the analysis, an almost 12,000-acre parcel available for coal leases is directly adjacent to the west side of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, and south of Bryce Canyon.

Mining in the area could affect the water that feeds tributaries of the Paria River, Jacqualine Grant, executive director of Grand Staircase-Escalante Partners, said in a statement.

There are also parcels on the east side of Zion National Park, including a portion of the North Fork of the Virgin River and North Fork Road, the analysis says. Public land bordering scenic roads like state Highway 89, also known as Utah Heritage Highway, and the Mount Carmel Scenic Byway would also be available for lease in the area.

East of Capitol Reef National Park, the Bureau of Land Management is also offering an approximately 2,000-acre piece of land for leases, the environmentalists said.

“Coal mines near Zion, Bryce Canyon or Capitol Reef? It’s absurd. It was decided decades ago that these lands would be off the table,” Cory MacNulty, Southwest campaign director for the National Parks Conservation Association, said in a statement. “Dirty energy development has no place near our national parks, especially as iconic landscapes across the Southwest are already at risk of having hazy skies, polluted water, and a degraded visitor experience from nearby drilling and mining.”

The Department of the Interior, however, argues that opening the land for lease, along with lowering royalty rates to 7%, will help strengthen supply chains and the country’s energy security.

“President Trump promised to put American energy workers first, and today we’re delivering,” Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a news release. “By reducing the royalty rate for coal, increasing coal acres available for leasing, and unlocking critical minerals from mine waste, we are strengthening our economy, protecting national security, and ensuring that communities from Montana to Alabama benefit from good-paying jobs.”

Lease sales are already happening across the country, according to the release. Together, they add hundreds of millions of tons of coal.

The agency is also spearheading efforts to recover minerals like uranium, zinc, germanium, tellurium and rare earth elements from mine waste and abandoned sites.

The Fremont development was selected by UAMPS as part of its 2024 resource procurement plan, which will purchase all energy and related project products, including renewable energy credits (RECs) and capacity rights. Acting as the scheduling coordinator, UAMPS will have exclusive rights to dispatch the BESS.

UAMPS negotiated the agreement with Longroad on behalf of its 50 members, who must now all individually approve the PPA in order for it to become effective.

Although the guaranteed delivery date of the project is June 30, 2028, commercial operations are expected by December 31, 2027.

Under the terms of the agreement, Longroad will be fined US$21,970/day if it’s unable to deliver the BESS before this guaranteed date.

Tariff related adjustments

With the ongoing uncertainty surrounding import tariffs, offtake agreements in the US are increasingly including future tariff-related pricing adjustments as standard.

Energy-Storage.news has reported on the signing of several new offtake agreements over the past six months, with each featuring provisions whereby developers can increase the contract price if they can prove costs have been impacted by import tariffs.

This recent reporting includes agreements between NextEra Energy Resources (NEER) and Orange County Power Authority, alongside EDP Renewables and Ava Community Energy.

Utilities Director at Northern California Power Agency (NCPA), Alan Kurotori, revealed during a recent Board of Directors meeting that developers are “really insisting” that these provisions be added to offtake agreements.

As stipulated within the Fremont PPA, UAMPS will pay a fixed price of US$13.6/kW-month with no escalation for battery storage capacity.

However, if a third-party evaluation demonstrates that project costs were impacted due to import tariffs introduced after January 1 2025, Longroad can amend this price as high as US$14.14/kW-month, representing an increase of up to 4.7%.

When combined with the solar energy price of US$35.45/MWh, UAMPS expects the hybrid Fremont facility to cost between approximately US$69/MWh and US$74/MWh.

Operation Gigawatt

Utah is still heavily reliant on fossil fuels, with coal and fossil gas having provided a cumulative 77% of the state’s net electricity generation during 2025, according to data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA).

As for BESS, Utah’s utility-scale energy storage industry is still very much in its infancy, with the State only having a single operational 1MW project as of October 2 2025.

However, things have begun to pick up over the past six months, with some of the US’ most prominent independent power producers (IPPs) having progressed several large BESS projects.

This includes NEER, who in August received approval to develop a 200MWh project in Salt Lake City, dubbed Dominguez Energy Storage.

As recently reported by Energy-Storage.news, rPlusEnergies also secured more than US$500 million in financing for a larger 400MW/1,600MWh hybrid solar and storage BESS project located in Emery County. Construction is currently underway, with the project scheduled to come online sometime next year.

Additionally, Utah Governor Spencer Cox announced plans last year to double the state’s energy capacity over the next ten years, as part of a plan known as “Operation Gigawatt.”

Although the plans remain fairly broad, the Office of Governor Cox last month celebrated the news that technology provider Torus has raised US$200 million in private capital to deploy its proprietary battery storage and flywheel technology in Utah.

“Utah-based companies like Torus are proving what’s possible, deploying new capital to strengthen the grid, improve reliability, and meet America’s growing energy needs,” said Cox.",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Longroad_Energy_Sun-Streams-3.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 13:11:04.735368

And the International Energy Agency estimates that by 2050, geothermal energy could provide as much as 15% of the world’s electricity needs.
Why geothermal energy is unique Geothermal energy taps into heat beneath the Earth’s surface to generate electricity or provide direct heating.
Types of geothermal energy There are several ways to get energy from deep within the Earth.
And converting abandoned oil and gas wells for enhanced geothermal systems could significantly increase the amount of energy available and its geographic spread.","As energy use rises and the planet warms, you might have dreamed of an energy source that works 24/7, rain or shine, quietly powering homes, industries and even entire cities without the ups and downs of solar or wind – and with little contribution to climate change.

The promise of new engineering techniques for geothermal energy – heat from the Earth itself – has attracted rising levels of investment to this reliable, low-emission power source that can provide continuous electricity almost anywhere on the planet. That includes ways to harness geothermal energy from idle or abandoned oil and gas wells. In the first quarter of 2025, North American geothermal installations attracted US$1.7 billion in public funding – compared with $2 billion for all of 2024, which itself was a significant increase from previous years, according to an industry analysis from consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.

As an exploration geophysicist and energy engineer, I’ve studied geothermal systems’ resource potential and operational trade-offs firsthand. From the investment and technological advances I’m seeing, I believe geothermal energy is poised to become a significant contributor to the energy mix in the U.S. and around the world, especially when integrated with other renewable sources.

A May 2025 assessment by the U.S. Geological Survey found that geothermal sources just in the Great Basin, a region that encompasses Nevada and parts of neighboring states, have the potential to meet as much as 10% of the electricity demand of the whole nation – and even more as technology to harness geothermal energy advances. And the International Energy Agency estimates that by 2050, geothermal energy could provide as much as 15% of the world’s electricity needs.

Why geothermal energy is unique

Geothermal energy taps into heat beneath the Earth’s surface to generate electricity or provide direct heating. Unlike solar or wind, it never stops. It runs around the clock, providing consistent, reliable power with closed-loop water systems and few emissions.

Geothermal is capable of providing significant quantities of energy. For instance, Fervo Energy’s Cape Station project in Utah is reportedly on track to deliver 100 megawatts of baseload, carbon-free geothermal power by 2026. That’s less than the amount of power generated by the average coal plant in the U.S., but more than the average natural gas plant produces.

But the project, estimated to cost $1.1 billion, is not complete. When complete in 2028, the station is projected to deliver 500 megawatts of electricity. That amount is 100 megawatts more than its original goal without additional drilling, thanks to various technical improvements since the project broke ground.

And geothermal energy is becoming economically competitive. By 2035, according to the International Energy Agency, technical advances could mean energy from enhanced geothermal systems could cost as little as $50 per megawatt-hour, a price competitive with other renewable sources.

Types of geothermal energy

There are several ways to get energy from deep within the Earth.

Hydrothermal systems tap into underground hot water and steam to generate electricity. These resources are concentrated in geologically active areas where heat, water and permeable rock naturally coincide. In the U.S., that’s generally California, Nevada and Utah. Internationally, most hydrothermal energy is in Iceland and the Philippines.

Some hydrothermal facilities, such as Larderello in Italy, have operated for over a century, proving the technology’s long-term viability. Others in New Zealand and the U.S. have been running since the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Enhanced geothermal systems effectively create electricity-generating hydrothermal processes just about anywhere on the planet. In places where there is not enough water in the ground or where the rock is too dense to move heat naturally, these installations drill deep holes and inject fluid into the hot rocks, creating new fractures and opening existing ones, much like hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas production.

A system like this uses more than one well. In one, it pumps cold water down, which collects heat from the rocks and then is pumped back up through another well, where the heat drives turbines. In recent years, academic and corporate research has dramatically improved drilling speed and lowered costs.

Ground source heat pumps do not require drilling holes as deep, but instead take advantage of the fact that the Earth’s temperature is relatively stable just below the surface, even just 6 or 8 feet down (1.8 to 2.4 meters) – and it’s hotter hundreds of feet lower.

These systems don’t generate electricity but rather circulate fluid in underground pipes, exchanging heat with the soil, extracting warmth from the ground in winter and transferring warmth to the ground in summer. These systems are similar but more efficient than air-source heat pumps, sometimes called minisplits, which are becoming widespread across the U.S. for heating and cooling. Geothermal heat pump systems can serve individual homes, commercial buildings and even neighborhood or business developments.

Direct-use applications also don’t generate electricity but rather use the geothermal heat directly. Farmers heat greenhouses and dry crops; aquaculture facilities maintain optimal water temperatures; industrial operations use the heat to dehydrate food, cure concrete or other energy-intensive processes. Worldwide, these applications now deliver over 100,000 megawatts of thermal capacity. Some geothermal fluids contain valuable minerals; lithium concentrations in the groundwater of California’s Salton Sea region could potentially supply battery manufacturers. Federal judges are reviewing a proposal to do just that, as well as legal challenges to it.

Researchers are finding new ways to use geothermal resources, too. Some are using underground rock formations to store energy as heat when consumer demand is low and use it to produce electricity when demand rises.

Some geothermal power stations can adjust their output to meet demand, rather than running continuously at maximum capacity.

Geothermal sources are also making other renewable-energy projects more effective. Pairing geothermal energy with solar and wind resources and battery storage are increasing the reliability of above-ground renewable power in Texas, among other places.

And geothermal energy can power clean hydrogen production as well as energy-intensive efforts to physically remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as is happening in Iceland.

Geothermal potential in the US and worldwide

Currently, the U.S. has about 3.9 gigawatts of installed geothermal capacity, mostly in the West. That’s about 0.4% of current U.S. energy production, but the amount of available energy is much larger, according to federal and international engineering assessments.

And converting abandoned oil and gas wells for enhanced geothermal systems could significantly increase the amount of energy available and its geographic spread.

One example is happening in Beaver County, in the southwestern part of Utah. Once a struggling rural community, it now hosts multiple geothermal plants that are being developed to both demonstrate the potential and to supply electricity to customers as far away as California.

Those projects include repurposing idle oil or gas wells, which is relatively straightforward: Engineers identify wells that reach deep, hot rock formations and circulate water or another fluid in a closed loop to capture heat to generate electricity or provide direct heating. This method does not require drilling new wells, which significantly reduces setup costs and environmental disruption and accelerates deployment.

There are as many as 4 million abandoned oil and gas wells across the U.S., some of which could shift from being fossil fuel infrastructure into opportunities for clean energy.

Challenges and trade-offs

Geothermal energy is not without technical, environmental and economic hurdles.

Drilling is expensive, and conventional systems need specific geological conditions. Enhanced systems, using hydraulic fracturing, risk causing earthquakes.

Overall emissions are low from geothermal systems, though the systems can release hydrogen sulfide, a corrosive gas that is toxic to humans and can contribute to respiratory irritation. But modern geothermal plants use abatement systems that can capture up to 99.9% of hydrogen sulfide before it enters the atmosphere.

And the systems do use water, though closed-loop systems can minimize consumption.

Building geothermal power stations does require significant investment, but its ability to deliver energy over the long term can offset many of these costs. Projects like those undertaken by Fervo Energy show that government subsidies are no longer necessary for a project to get funded, built and begin generating energy.

Despite its challenges, geothermal energy’s reliability, low emissions and scalability make it a vital complement to solar and wind – and a cornerstone of a stable, low-carbon energy future.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/694654/original/file-20251006-56-n1yweb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C486%2C4804%2C2402&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-08 08:59:01.745418

Rural Texas grapples with pros, cons of data centers",JAYME LOZANO CARVER TEXAS TRIBUNE,,,,,"https://www.sanmarcosrecord.com/article/31485,economic-boom-or-environmental-disaster-rural-texas-grapples-with-pros-cons-of-data-centers","“What will we have to give up to make sure these data centers can succeed?” she said.
Data centers have been around since the 1940s, housing technology infrastructure that runs computer applications, internet servers, and stores the data that comes from them.
These newer sprawling data centers have been sold to communities as a boon to their economic development.
The campus would span 5,800 acres in nearby Carson County and include 18 million square feet for data centers.
“This is a concern in other states,” said Ding, who has researched the environmental impact of data centers.","Kendra Kay loved growing up in the quiet of West Texas.

She enjoyed the peacefulness brought in by the open lands. She appreciated how everyone in her community had a purpose and contributed to their way of life. She never wanted the busy noise that came with living in a bustling big city.

“That’s why we live here,” Kay, an Amarillo resident, said.

Now, Kay and others who have chosen the simpler life are worried that the emerging data center industry that has set its eyes on towns across the Panhandle and rural Texas might upend that agrarian bliss.

“What will we have to give up to make sure these data centers can succeed?” she said.

Data centers have been around since the 1940s, housing technology infrastructure that runs computer applications, internet servers, and stores the data that comes from them. More recently, data centers are powering artificial intelligence and other internet juggernauts like Google, Amazon and Meta.

These newer sprawling data centers have been sold to communities as a boon to their economic development. Rural Texas has become a prized spot for the businesses rushing into the state.

Virginia is the only state with more data centers than Texas, which has 391. While most are concentrated in North Texas and other major metro areas, they are increasingly being planned in rural areas.

Affordable property rates, wide open spaces, and welcoming local officials have made remote areas attractive. However, the people who live in those areas have grown worried about what incoming centers — which can sit on thousands of acres of land — mean for their lands, homes, and especially, their limited water supply.

From the Panhandle to the Rio Grande Valley, Texas’ water supply is limited. The strain is particularly acute in rural West Texas and other areas of the state that face regular drought. Data centers, especially those used for artificial intelligence, can use an extraordinary amount of water. The state does not yet require most data centers to report their water usage.

And with new, bigger data centers coming to the state regularly, there are unanswered questions on where the data centers will get the water they need to stay cool.

“These new data centers are enormous,” said Robert Mace, executive director of the Meadows Center. “I don’t know where you get the water to do that in a state that’s already water-stressed, not only from drought, but also rapid population growth in both the population and industry.”

The concern already exists in the Texas Panhandle, where droughts are common and groundwater supply is declining. There are four data centers planned for the region, including in Amarillo, Turkey, Pampa and Claude. Outside the Panhandle is no different, as AI campuses are expanding in the Permian Basin and 30 data centers are planned for Sulphur Springs, a small town in East Texas. Those plans have residents just as worried.

In Amarillo, the City Council is considering a water deal with Fermi America, a company cofounded by former U.S. Energy Secretary and Texas Gov. Rick Perry. The campus would span 5,800 acres in nearby Carson County and include 18 million square feet for data centers.

Perry said in June that the project is part of a national push to stay competitive in the global energy and technology sectors.

A group of residents, including Kay, see the deal as a threat. They protested the deal in front of the Potter County courthouse in late September.

“We’re ready for more community conversations about the use of this and with Fermi,” Kay said.

Trent Sisemore, a former Amarillo mayor who Fermi tapped to lead community engagement, said the data center will offer good jobs. The Panhandle was also chosen, the company said ealier, because of its proximity to natural gas pipelines, high-speed fiber and other infrastructure.

“The deployment brings tremendous growth and economic stability to our community,” Sisemore said.

Part of Amarillo’s water supply comes from the Ogallala Aquifer, which is also the main water supply for farmers and ranchers in the region, and it is being drained at rates faster than it can be replenished. Agriculture production is the lifeblood of the High Plains, and the success of the region depends on the success of farmers and ranchers. Organizers of the protest at the Potter County courthouse have stressed that incoming data centers are dangerous because of the ripple effect that could happen in a region already under water restrictions.

Kay pointed to similar communities, such as Lenoir, North Carolina and Henrico County, Virginia, where there is a constant expansion of data centers pushing into rural areas. The expansions bring the likelihood of noise and water pollution, along with a jump in electricity prices with it.

“We would never move somewhere that’s more busy and loud,” Kay said. “We like our quiet streets.”

“It’s exciting when it comes to data centers” Economic success in Ector County, which includes Odessa, has long been dependent on oil rigs. For local officials, a 235-acre data center in Penwell is a chance to diversify the economy. The abundance of natural gas, untapped land and untreated water, makes the region ideal, said County Judge Dustin Fawcett.

“It’s exciting when it comes to data centers,” said Fawcett. “Not only are we using that produced water, we’re also using the excess natural gas we have, so we get to be more efficient with the products we’re mining.”

With one planned near Odessa, where water supply has been a consistent problem for both quantity and quality, some residents aren’t so sure.

“We don’t have an abundance of water out here,” said Jeff Russell, an Odessa resident and former vice president of the Odessa Development Corporation. “We have an abundance of bad water, but we don’t have an abundance of good water.”

Fawcett said as officials look into these agreements with data centers, they don’t want to pull water from the municipal supply — they want to tap into brackish and produced water, which is a byproduct of oil and gas extraction. He hopes that data centers can help them get closer to harnessing produced water on a large scale instead of shooting it back into the earth.

Just like the Panhandle, there are a slew of data centers either planned or already in dry West Texas. Sweetwater and El Paso have projects in the works, while small towns like Snyder are actively promoting their land as a good site for interested businesses.

Yi Ding, an assistant professor at Purdue University in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, said some states have started introducing regulations that prevent data centers from using drinking water. Texas doesn’t, which could become a problem in the near future.

“This is a concern in other states,” said Ding, who has researched the environmental impact of data centers. “You don’t want data centers competing for water used in people’s daily lives.”

While state planners don’t have a concrete way of tracking how much water data centers are using in Texas or how much will be needed in the future, some centers are already looking to make their systems more efficient. This includes using different cooling methods, such as gels, which would decrease the amount of water they use. However, Ding compared it to a theory that says techniques can be improved over time, but it opens the door for more consumption.

“When something becomes more efficient, people use it more,” Ding said. “So total water consumption doesn’t significantly drop, unless there’s a significant paradigm shift in terms of cooling.”

Sisemore, who is Fermi’s ambassador to Amarillo, said they want to use water efficiently and protect the resource, and will be using a system that continuously circulates cooling fluid, which uses less water.

“If there’s better technology, that’s what we’re going to use,” Sisemore said.

“Wealth here is the water” Will Masters has spent the last decade working on ways to replenish the Ogallala Aquifer. His efforts focus on conservation and using other methods, such as playa lakes, to restore the groundwater that’s been drained for more than 50 years.

The Panhandle area sits on one of the deepest parts of the aquifer, which means it likely has more water than regions further south. Masters, who lives in Amarillo, wants to ensure the Panhandle doesn’t push its geographical luck.

“Wealth here is the water,” said Masters, one of the founders for Ogallala Life, a nonprofit in the region. “If the water is not here, this area is impoverished.”

When Amarillo residents held their protest last month, it was to both fight against data centers coming to the city and inform others of the potential risks facing their water supply — including the risks to the Ogallala Aquifer. Masters said the idea of accepting the water being drained more in exchange for a limited amount of jobs is a bad deal.

“City leaders are trying to find a way to keep their cities alive,” Masters said. “So we have developers coming in with ideas to bring in money and jobs, temporarily, but it’s causing more problems.”

Amarillo Mayor Cole Stanley said the council’s priority is protecting the city’s water and to get a good deal if they decide to sell any of it to Fermi for its data center, which will sit about 35 miles north of the city’s limits in Carson County.

The company has asked for 2.5 million gallons of water a day, and there’s talks it could go up to 10 million gallons. By comparison, Stanley said the city uses 50 million gallons a day.

“We’ll charge them more than a regular customer because they’re outside the city and require them to put in their own infrastructure,” Stanley said. “Then we’ll be the beneficiary of the additional jobs that pay well, new residents who build homes and put in additional businesses. It’ll be really good economically for the growth of Amarillo.”

Stanley acknowledged there will be challenges.

“The cons are how fast do you grow? Can those growing pains be forecasted?” he said in an interview with The Texas Tribune. “Can we plan strategically so we’re ready for that amount of growth?”

Stanley said he has spoken with residents and heard their concerns. At the same time, he said Fermi America will need to lead the conversation since it’s outside city limits. His role comes later, he said, as the business finalizes its plans.

“Fermi America is going to need to step up and hold their own forums and engage with those citizens directly,” Stanley said. “Just like any business deal would be handled. It would be very unfair for me to take a lead in any of those conversations, not knowing who the players are or what the full potential is.”

Sisemore, the community lead for the project, said the U.S. is being outpaced by China when it comes to coal, gas and nuclear generation. He said the next war will be won because of AI, and this is an opportunity for the community to help America win it.

He said he understands where the trepidation from residents is coming from — comparing it to when people were concerned about Bell Helicopter, a company focused on producing military aircraft, came to Amarillo. Sisemore wants to help inform them by bringing in experts to give them more information.

“Everybody has a right to their opinion, and we can all learn from each other,” Sisemore said.

Town halls are expected to begin in November.

And in the White House, one senior policy advisor has held high-ranking positions at big oil firms including Shell.
The Guardian has contacted the American Petroleum Institute, the top US fossil fuel lobby firm, for comment.
Fossil fuel donors poured $96m into Trump’s 2025 presidential campaign and affiliated action committees, and contributed $11.8m to Trump’s second inauguration.
The current Trump administration has also been completely unabashed about doing the bidding of the oil sector, said Zibel.","Donald Trump has placed dozens of people with ties to the fossil fuel sector in his administration, including more than 40 who have directly worked for oil, gas or coal companies, according to a new analysis.

The report from Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy and ethics non-profit that has been critical of the Trump administration, alongside the Revolving Door Project, a corporate watchdog, analyzed the backgrounds of nominees and appointees within the White House and eight agencies dictating energy, environmental and climate policy. That includes the Environmental Protection Agency, the interior and energy departments and others.

The analysis comes as Trump wages broad attacks on climate and energy policies and on renewable energy. The president’s so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act, for instance, opened swaths of federal land to drilling and mining and enshrined the rapid phaseout of incentives for renewable energy. The administration has also launched an unprecedented assault on climate science, for instance with an energy department report on climate change that experts derided as full of misinformation. The report was created to justify the planned overturning of a key legal finding that forms the basis of virtually all US climate regulations.

“With the firehose of terrible, bad things that have happened on the environment front … it’s important to remind the public that these aren’t just actions from the amorphous, ginormous thing that is the Trump administration writ large,” said Toni Aguilar Rosenthal, report author and senior researcher at the Revolving Door Project. “It is often specific actors coming from specific moneyed interests that are carrying out this disastrous deregulatory agenda.”

The authors identified 111 employees whom they deemed “fossil fuel insiders and renewable energy opponents”. That includes 43 people who were directly employed by coal, oil or gas companies. Among them are well-known senior officials such as energy secretary Chris Wright, the former CEO of fracking company Liberty Energy.

The list also includes lesser-known administration members. The energy department’s efficiency and renewable energy office – which recently told workers to avoid using terms such as “climate change” and “emissions – for instance, is led by a former fracking executive. And in the White House, one senior policy advisor has held high-ranking positions at big oil firms including Shell.

Another 12 Trump officials, the authors found, have ties to fossil fuel-funded rightwing thinktanks, the report found. Among them: former employees and fellows of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative group that has fought renewable energy and made what it calls “the moral case for fossil fuels”, as well as the anti-environmentalist group Americans for Prosperity, which is backed by the fossil fuel moguls the Koch brothers.

A total of 29 other Trump officials are former corporate executives from polluting sectors whose business interests are tied up with fossil fuels, such as chemicals, automaking and mining, the report says. Other officials have ties to utility companies that sell fossil fuels or elected officials who have pushed pro-coal, -oil and -gas policies.

Reached for comment, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said: “It’s totally pathetic and transparent that The Guardian is regurgitating a press release from a self-described anti-Trump group and calling them a ‘consumer advocacy nonprofit’ in order to attack White House staff.”

Trump has castigated critics of his administration and warned of a crackdown against progressive non-profit organizations.

The Guardian has contacted the American Petroleum Institute, the top US fossil fuel lobby firm, for comment.

The researchers found that 32 employees at the Department of the Interior alone have ties to polluting energy, making it the most compromised federal agency. That includes interior secretary Doug Burgum, the former governor of North Dakota who has long accepted oil funding and been a conduit between fossil fuel industry donors and Donald Trump’s campaign. Burgum himself owns land that he leases to oil company Continental Resources, the report notes. That firm is run by major Trump donor and ally Harold Hamm, whose business interests Burgum has often supported.

Fossil fuel donors poured $96m into Trump’s 2025 presidential campaign and affiliated action committees, and contributed $11.8m to Trump’s second inauguration. Since entering office, his administration has not only enshrined pro-fossil fuel policies and rules, but also crafted tax breaks and tariff carveouts benefitting the industry.

In addition to oil-tied nominees and appointees, the authors identified several Trump administration higher-ups who were appointed or nominated to powerful positions with little or no subject matter expertise.

“These people may not be tied to fossil fuels so directly, but their inexperience is dangerous,” said Alan Zibel, a co-author and the research director at Public Citizen, speaking broadly about the administration’s links to fossil fuels interests. “It’s reasonable to think they will be pushovers, or easy marks, for the oil industry’s agenda.”

Trump’s nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency’s office of general counsel, Sean Donahue, for instance, has scant legal experience, having worked in the first Trump administration EPA for three years, then briefly for a regional law firm in Buffalo, New York, and then for a solar energy company.

“He has never tried a case to verdict, never taken a deposition, never signed a pleading and never argued a motion,” said the senator Sheldon Whitehouse in May.

Asked for comment about Donahue by the publication Inside Climate News in April, Molly Vaseliou, an EPA spokesperson, defended his nomination. ​​“President Trump made a fantastic choice in selecting Sean to lead EPA’s Office of General Counsel,” she said. “His years of public service to the American people at the federal and state government level is a boon to the agency.”

In another example, one White House aide working on energy policy, Jarrod Agen, came to the role after working for Mike Pence, the former vice-president, and defense company Lockheed Martin. Agen does not appear to have direct energy industry or policy experience, the report says.

In her statement, Kelly of the White House said: “Secretary Wright, Secretary Burgum, and Jarrod Agen are all exceptionally qualified to deliver on the American people’s mandate to ‘Drill, Baby, Drill’ and unleash our nation’s energy potential – which is what President Trump was overwhelmingly elected to implement, even if The Guardian doesn’t like it.”

Trump oversaw a massive slew of anti-environmental actions during his first term. During his second term, equipped with rightwing plans like the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, he has overseen a far broader and harsher crackdown on climate rules and renewable energy.

The current Trump administration has also been completely unabashed about doing the bidding of the oil sector, said Zibel.

“There’s no shame,” he said. “They are proud and willing to go out there and tout the fact that they are doing favors for the oil and gas industry, mining industry, the coal industry.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c59bcba0dfd45a884c0d418382fab45eb9831428/373_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f30af528cc495a48f2233b2f81a35af0",N,,2025-10-08 08:59:06.865965

Power and climate policy analyst Shankar Sharma has written a strongly worded letter to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC), questioning India’s environmental credibility ahead of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) World Conservation Congress scheduled to be held in Abu Dhabi from October 9–15.

Referring to a recent Down to Earth report announcing the unveiling of India’s first Red List of Endangered Species at the global forum, Sharma said the move “rings hollow” when juxtaposed with the country’s continuing clearance of projects in ecologically fragile regions.

“Whether the successive governments in our country have made honest and diligent efforts to conserve critical elements of nature in the last 50-55 years is the question haunting environmentalists,” Sharma wrote. “If not, what is the purpose of unveiling India’s Red List at an international event?”

Citing data from the ministry’s own Parivesh portal, he noted that the MoEF&CC had approved 87% of proposals for environment clearance between 2014 and 2020, including over 270 projects in and around protected areas and biodiversity hotspots. “If this rate of environmental clearance is to continue, the country is likely to lose most of its original forests of enormous ecological significance within a few decades,” he warned.

Sharma pointed to findings from an IIT Kharagpur study that revealed a steady decline in India’s forest health despite claims of increased green cover. Only 16% of forests, the study found, retain high strength and resilience — a statistic Sharma said should “alarm any responsible government.”

He also cited the Forest Survey of India’s 2023 report, which showed that more than 46,000 sq km of forest became non-forest land over the past decade, and that the forest cover of eight mountain states had declined in just two years. “The destruction of forest wealth in ecologically sensitive areas clearly establishes the true health of our forests, which are the abode of wildlife,” he said.

The analyst’s letter draws special attention to the controversial 2,000 MW pumped storage project (PSP) proposed in the Sharavati Lion-Tailed Macaque (LTM) Wildlife Sanctuary in Karnataka — a project that has sparked massive public protests and opposition from scientists, conservationists, and even political leaders across parties.

“Even in 2025, the National Board for Wildlife is considering a ghastly project proposal to divert about 400 acres of thick tropical rainforest lands within and around the Sharavati LTM Sanctuary,” Sharma wrote. “There are many benign and better alternatives.”

He highlighted that the sanctuary zone harbours at least 77 species listed in the IUCN Red List, including endangered lion-tailed macaques, and cited multiple scientific objections raised by researchers from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) and retired forest officials.

In his earlier submission to the Ministry and expert committees, Sharma reported that public hearings in September 2025 saw massive and unanimous opposition to the Sharavati project, with more than 10,000 people attending and not a single voice in support. Political figures including former BJP MLA Haratalu Halappa, JD(U) leader Mahima J. Patel, and a state cabinet minister have all opposed the project.

“It is hard to imagine how our ministers can feel proud to represent India in IUCN’s Conservation Congress under such a deplorable policy regime,” Sharma said. “Unless MoEF&CC demonstrates its commitment by rejecting forest diversion proposals within protected areas, all tall claims will remain empty rhetoric.”

He urged the Ministry to “permanently reject” clearances for projects within natural forests and sanctuaries until India achieves its National Forest Policy target of 33% forest and tree cover.

“The ongoing approval process for the Sharavati PSP will be seen as a red flag for conservation of nature in our country,” Sharma cautioned, calling on the government to show “commitment and integrity” in protecting India’s biodiversity.

In that capacity, she has observed firsthand the impact that skyrocketing power prices have had on many of the city's most vulnerable residents.
What's being done about skyrocketing energy prices?
If things continue on their current path, the problem of electricity shortages and skyrocketing energy prices will only get worse.
With reducing data centers' power usage looking unlikely, America must bring more energy production online — and fast.","A new analysis by Bloomberg has uncovered the extraordinary impact that power-hungry data centers already have had on the electricity bills of millions of ordinary Americans, and the news is not good.

Over the past five years, Americans who live in areas near data centers have seen their electricity bills increase by as much as 267%, Bloomberg found.

""It's killing my pockets,"" said Antoinette Robinson, a resident of East Baltimore, Maryland, per Bloomberg.

What's happening?

As massive new data centers used to power artificial-intelligence models and cloud computing have sprouted up across the U.S. and around the world, they have consumed larger and larger amounts of electricity, outpacing new sources of electricity production.

According to basic economic principles, when demand goes up faster than supply, prices increase. As a result, millions of Americans, many of whom already were struggling to make ends meet, have seen their electric bills skyrocket.

""Without mitigation, the data centers sucking up all the load is going to make things really expensive for the rest of Americans,"" said David Crane, the CEO of Generate Capital, per Bloomberg. Crane warned the strain on power supplies in certain markets could result in brownouts as soon as the next year or two.

In 2023, data centers consumed 4.4% of all electricity produced in the U.S., according to a Department of Energy study. The same study projected that, by 2028, that figure could reach 12%, with data centers consuming as much as 580 terawatt-hours per year.

By way of comparison, in 2019, the entire country of Canada consumed a total of 530 terawatt-hours of electricity, according to the International Energy Agency. That year, Canada ranked sixth out of all nations in terms of energy consumption.

Why does data-center power consumption matter?

While many experts have warned of the coming data-center power crunch, Bloomberg's analysis has shown that, for many Americans, the electricity shortages have already become a harsh economic reality.

Nicole Pastore, who has seen her own electricity costs go up by 50% in just the past year, serves as a judge overseeing rental disputes in Baltimore. In that capacity, she has observed firsthand the impact that skyrocketing power prices have had on many of the city's most vulnerable residents.

""It's utilities versus rent,"" Pastore explained, per Bloomberg. ""They want to stay in their home, but they also want to keep their lights on.""

Many hard-hit residents wonder why they should have to, in effect, subsidize the country's AI boom, while already-wealthy tech companies rake in the resulting profits.

""They can say this is going to help with AI, but how is that going to help me?"" asked Kevin Stanley, an East Baltimore resident who is unable to work because of his glaucoma, according to Bloomberg. ""How's that going to help me pay my bill?""

What's being done about skyrocketing energy prices?

If things continue on their current path, the problem of electricity shortages and skyrocketing energy prices will only get worse. As tech companies in the U.S. race to keep pace in the fierce competition to dominate artificial intelligence, even more massive — and more power-hungry — data centers are in the works.

With reducing data centers' power usage looking unlikely, America must bring more energy production online — and fast. Meanwhile, policymakers could force tech companies to pay more for their own energy use and the strain they place on power grids, rather than pushing those costs onto consumers.

Unfortunately, recent policy changes have turned the U.S. away from cleaner, renewable sources of energy and toward dirtier, extracted fuels, which has hurt both the prospects for new electricity production and the environment.

According to S&P Global, the worldwide waiting list for the turbines used in gas-fueled power plants is currently seven years long, not nearly fast enough to meet rising demand.

By comparison, renewable-energy facilities such as solar arrays and wind farms can be brought online much more quickly and at much lower environmental costs.

To make a difference, you can help push for a return to policies that favor cleaner, renewable-energy production by contacting your elected representatives and voting for candidates who share your energy priorities.

Additionally, by installing solar panels on your home, you can drop your own electricity bill to practically zero while also reducing demand on already-maxed-out power grids.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1KgRtWcSPHYPnxWFIrDyow--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/fc7770651f181966c6cf084cc2ccaacc,N,,2025-10-08 11:01:36.108413

Rewiring America has a tool you can use to find contractors for a range of projects that qualify for the clean energy tax credits.","If you’ve been considering energy-efficient upgrades to your home, now may be the time — as in , right now. A raft of tax breaks designed to incentivize energy improvements are about to be switched off.

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit and the Residential Clean Energy Credit, which help homeowners save hundreds or even thousands of dollars on heat pumps, solar panels and other clean-energy changes, were originally set to end in 2032 and 2034, respectively, but the One Big Beautiful Bill Act accelerated their expiration to Dec. 31, 2025.

“The clock is ticking, and it’s really important for folks to start the process,” says Zach Pierce, head of policy at Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrifying homes and communities.

Claiming the credits requires more than just buying energy-efficient equipment and materials — they also must be installed by the end of the year, says Tim Steffen, director of advanced planning at Baird, a wealth management firm in Milwaukee. Depending on where you live, finding contractors who are available to do the work in time could be a challenge.

Here’s what to know to increase your chances of beating the deadline to claim these valuable tax breaks, including how the y work, what types of upgrades qualify, which upgrades to prioritize and how to line up installation.

How do the credits work?

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit is worth up to $3,200. You can claim 30 percent of the cost of qualified energy-efficient improvements, up to $1,200, for “building envelope components” (doors, windows, insulation, etc.) and up to $2,000 for heat pumps and biomass stoves and boilers.

The Residential Clean Energy Credit is for solar, wind and geothermal systems. It’s equal to 30 percent of the total purchase and installation cost, with no limit on the dollar amount.

Depending on the upgrades you make, you can claim both credits, Steffen says. And if you claimed either or both in the past, you can claim them again for any upgrades you made this year.

You must submit Form 5695 when you file your federal tax return to claim the credits. Tax credits reduce your tax liability dollar for dollar. These particular credits are nonrefundable: If the credit amount you qualify for is more than what you owe in taxes, you won’t receive the difference as a refund.

Another expiring energy tax break is the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit. It’s worth up to 30 percent of the cost of installing an electric vehicle charger at your home, up to $1,000. It ends June 30, 2026.

“For folks who went out and got a new EV or used EV, they can take their time to get the charger,” Pierce says.

What upgrades are eligible for the credits?

To qualify for the home energy tax credits, the equipment you install must be new and meet the standards listed below. (For good measure, you can ask manufacturers whether the materials or systems you’re considering buying qualify for the tax credits, Steffen says.)

Qualified expenses for the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit

Building envelope components

Exterior doors: Must meet Energy Star requirements.

Exterior windows and skylights: Must meet Energy Star Most Efficient certification requirements.

Insulation and air-sealing materials: Must meet International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) standards.

Home energy audits

An energy audit entails hiring a professional who uses specialized equipment, such as infrared cameras, to examine your home and create a report with personalized recommendations for energy-efficiency improvements. “It’s like a physical for your home,” Pierce says. It must be conducted by a qualified home energy auditor. Contact your utility provider or local government energy office to find one in your area.

Residential energy property

Qualified expenses must meet the Consortium for Energy Efficiency’s highest-ranking level for energy-efficient performance. The cost of upgrading your breaker box and other electrical components to support the following appliances and systems also qualifies for the credit.

Biomass stoves and boilers

Central air conditioners

Electric or natural gas heat pumps

Electric or natural gas heat pump water heaters

Natural gas, propane or oil water heaters

Natural gas, propane or oil furnaces or hot water boilers

Electric panel upgrade to support residential energy property

Qualified Expenses for the Residential Clean Energy Tax Credit

Battery storage technology: Must have a capacity of at least 3 kilowatt hours.

Geothermal heat pumps: Must meet Energy Star program requirements at the time of purchase.

Solar panels: Solar roofing tiles and solar roofing shingles qualify.

Solar water heaters: Must be certified by the Solar Rating & Certification Corporation or a comparable entity endorsed by the government of the state in which the water heater is installed.

Fuel cells: Must have a power output of at least one-half kilowatt of electricity using an electrochemical process and an electricity-only generation efficiency greater than 30 percent.

Wind turbines: No special requirements.

For more details about claiming these credits, see the IRS Instructions for Form 5695 or consult your accountant.

Which upgrades should you prioritize?

Pierce recommends getting a home energy audit and using the report to identify which energy-efficiency upgrades to prioritize.

Home energy audits cost, on average, $437, according to the home improvement marketplace HomeAdvisor. But most qualify for the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, which offsets up to $150 of the cost. (In addition, many utility companies offer rebates for home energy audits.)

If you can afford to purchase and install solar panels, now is an opportune time to do it, before the 30 percent tax credit expires at the end of the year. The average 12-kilowatt home solar system costs $29,649 to install without the credit, according to solar marketplace EnergySage, but the average payback period is only 6 to 12 years.

To see if your home is a good candidate for solar panels, enter your address into Google’s Project Sunroof. This tool uses Google Earth imagery to determine how many hours of usable sunlight your house receives each year, the recommended size of a solar installation for your roof and the estimated net energy savings over 20 years.

Line up installation ASAP

Don’t wait to find a contractor. Many are already booked solid through the end of the year, says Emily Walker, director of content and insights at EnergySage. You may need to do some digging to find one available in your area.

You can get quotes from prescreened solar and heat pump installers at EnergySage.com. Rewiring America has a tool you can use to find contractors for a range of projects that qualify for the clean energy tax credits. You can also shop around for contractors on marketplaces like Angi, HomeAdvisor, Thumbtack and Yelp.","https://aarp.widen.net/content/ev6nuwfaj2/jpeg/108145_Act%20Fast,%20These%20Energy%20Tax%20Breaks%20Are%20Going%20Away.jpg?crop=true&anchor=0,0&q=80&color=ffffffff&u=0bjybw&w=1140&h=655",N,,2025-10-08 13:08:34.086246

Off With Their Heads

The latest cull, according to an article in Reuters, has been dubbed the “kill list.” Quite an apt description for an administration which has no time for renewable energy projects – describing wind turbines as windmills – climate change science or previous President Biden’s embrace of green energy.

It has, since the first day of Trump’s return to office in January, been advocates of a fossil fuel first policy dubbed, “Drill, Baby, Drill.”

The kill list includes major carbon removal and clean hydrogen efforts that had been approved by the Department of Energy under the Biden administration.

So, which companies’ projects are heading to the Guillotine?

Occidental

One of the projects set to be ditched is the South Texas Direct Air Capture Hub, a facility that Occidental Petroleum’s (OXY) 1PointFive subsidiary planned to develop in Kleberg County, Texas.

Direct Air Capture (DAC) pulls CO₂ directly from the atmosphere, which can then be stored underground or reused. The proposed plant would have pulled 500,000 tonnes of CO₂ from the air every year to combat global warming.

The original government support for this project would have led to $500 million or more being given in total grants as it developed over time. Occidental shares were up slightly in pre-market trading.

General Motors

General Motors (GM) was awarded $500 million last year to convert its Lansing Grand River Assembly Plant in Michigan to EVs. The grant came from a federal Domestic Manufacturing Conversion Grant program. These grants aimed to support U.S. production of efficient hybrid, plug-in electric hybrid, plug-in electric, and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles. GM had described the move as underscoring its “commitment to U.S. manufacturing leadership.”

A theme, which President Trump has been equally as enthusiastic about and one of the fundamental reasons behind his tariff hikes. GM shares were flat in pre-market trading.

Stellantis/Samsung

Fellow car maker Stellantis (STLA) has two projects on the block. A $335 million grant to convert the shuttered Belvidere Assembly plant in Illinois to build mid-size electric trucks, and $250 million to convert its Indiana Transmission Plant in Kokomo to a gigafactory producing EV batteries. It was part of the StarPlus energy joint venture between Stellantis and electronics group Samsung (SSNLF). Stellantis shares were 0.6% higher in pre-market trading.

“We have to find a balance between sustainability, security and affordability.” Solar and solar investments remain affordable The issue of affordability and investment was picked up in the second panel discussion.
These investments in storage could help alleviate a major stumbling block for the energy transition, a lack of available grid capacity.","Indeed, the outlook is relatively positive for the solar and wind sectors, in particular, with the DNV report estimating that these technologies, both standalone and co-located with battery energy storage systems (BESS), will account for 32% of the global power mix by 2030. This will grow to more than 50% by 2040, despite a 55% growth in total electricity demand compared to today’s figures.

Energy security rises ‘to the top of concerns’

However, uncertainties over energy security loom large over many countries; moderating a panel on the relationship between the energy transition and energy security issues, DNV chief communications officer Ulrike Haugen described the situation as “moving from one vulnerability to the next one”.

“Clearly, if we think about energy security, it has risen in the last few years to the top of concerns,” explained Frans Everts, president-director of Shell Netherlands and one of the speakers on the panel. “One of our scenarios is an ‘archipelago world’, which describes a world of blocs and interests, with national interest driving scenarios. Countries and nations – and groups of nations – focus on their own self-interests, and there is a driving force of competitiveness.”

“We are witnessing a world that is fragmenting into power blocs,” agreed fellow panellist Tom Middendorp, chair of the International Military Council on Climate and Security.

“Countries are scrambling for influence over markets and control over critical resources; not just oil and gas but clean tech supply chains,” he added. “The energy transition itself has become a new arena of strategic competition … that race brings innovation, but new dependencies and fault lines.

“Strategic competition over resources is intensifying, supply chains and markets are repeatedly disrupted by shocks … and uncertainty is no longer an exception, I’m afraid it’s the new normal.”

Insulating oneself from a reliance on global supply chains has been a hallmark of many countries’ policies this year, most notably an increased demand for manufacturing capacity in the US and the imposition of tariffs on solar products imported from overseas.

The DNV report suggests that the growing importance of energy security for many national governments could disrupt priorities within the energy transition, noting that policies from “security-focused governments” are likely to result in 9% more nuclear capacity being installed by 2060, due to its perception as a reliable source of power.

“We came from a decade where the focus was on setting targets for climate and energy … and I think what we see is that in the long term, energy security and the push to climate neutrality should go hand in hand,” added the third panellist, Niels Redeker, deputy director of the climate division of the Dutch Ministry of Economy and Climate.

“Competitiveness and geopolitical developments have added strategic autonomy questions, so the issue is becoming more complex,” he continued. “We have to find a balance between sustainability, security and affordability.”

Solar and solar investments remain affordable

The issue of affordability and investment was picked up in the second panel discussion. Karin van Selm, CEO of wholesale Europe, Africa and Asia at Rabobank, suggested that there remains considerable interest in clean energy investments, particularly as the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) for energy sources such as solar continues to fall.

“There’s a lot of appetite and capital available for the energy transition; Rabobank has already been involved in renewable project structures for over 30 years,” said van Selm.

This is reflected in DNV’s latest figures, which show that investments in solar and wind are expected to grow from US$110 billion and US$60 billion in the last decade, respectively, to a mammoth US$900 billion and US$540 billion, respectively, by 2044.

“The issue we’re obviously seeing is the predictability of policy at the moment,” continued van Selm, suggesting that a lack of capital is not the limiting factor in delivering clean energy investments, but some of the political uncertainty that is making new power generation projects less bankable.

“It’s not the business case – I think the business case is very much there – but if we look at what has happened over the last period, the unclarity of the policy across the world – the US really changing last-minute –immediately had an impact on the business model that we thought was predictable a few years ago.”

Strikingly, in his opening remarks, Eriksen noted that while the sheer volume of capital invested into electrification is likely to increase, these investments will account for a smaller portion of Europe’s total finance.

“Over the years, DNV has consistently found that electricity expenditures are progressively becoming a smaller portion of GDP,” he said, noting that electricity spending accounted for 3.6% of global GDP in 2024, and is expected to halve to 1.8% in 2060.

“This pattern is likely to be mirrored at microlevels in households too … we expect energy costs to become an even smaller proportion of household spending.

Grids and batteries to work in tandem

The DNV report notes that many of these investments will be made in the storage space, with capital committed to batteries and pumped hydro storage having grown seven-fold in the decade to 2025 to US$50 billion a year. Looking ahead, the analyst expects solar-plus-storage projects to receive as much investment as standalone PV in 2029, and these projects will receive US$150 billion a year as early as 2030.

These investments in storage could help alleviate a major stumbling block for the energy transition, a lack of available grid capacity.

While DNV expects grid investments to double by 2050, a lack of available grid capacity continues to hamper renewable power deployment – the report notes that without the current absence of grid capacity, Europe’s operational solar capacity would be 16% higher by 2035 – and Manon van Beek, CEO of TenneT and another panellist, said that securing permitting is the main priority for her as a grid operator.

“We need permits and we need them at speed, so we need space to build,” she said. “A project in our world is 10-12 years, two years of which are construction. I’m very much in favour of a democratic process, but we need to get this done right first time.”

Ray See, executive president of the Americas at CATL, suggested that the future of the world’s grids could see an increased reliance on large-scale transmission infrastructure and small-scale storage deployments working in tandem, calling storage an “important intermediary to balance the grid.”

“There are baby steps that countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia are doing, where they start off with the distributed, behind-the-meter [system],” he added, suggesting that this kind of project could be easier to deploy than the “centralised power generation” of large-scale grid systems.

“All this, coupled with all these financing structures that allow low interest rates, [means] a lot of entrepreneurs and industrial players could be looking at behind-the-meter to be deployed first, and then gradually, as they see the benefits, the market can grow.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dnv.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 08:00:31.355016

Solar power helps insulate residents from the rising costs of natural gas and other fossil fuels while delivering cleaner air.
For homeowners, the clean energy revolution doesn't have to stop at the grid.","A wave of clean energy is about to roll out across Mississippi. Six new solar farms — representing more than $1.8 billion in private investment — are in the works across the state, reported WLBT3, marking one of the biggest renewable energy pushes Mississippi has ever seen.

Together, these projects could generate more than 1,400 megawatts of power, enough to light up hundreds of thousands of homes for decades to come. Furthermore, they're designed to reduce reliance on dirty energy sources, lower energy costs, and provide long-term stability to the state's power grid. Facilities are planned in Hinds, Holmes, Lowndes, Lee, Union, Jasper, and Pontotoc Counties, with individual investments ranging from $175 million to $650 million.

Beyond clean energy, these solar farms are expected to create nearly 1,300 temporary construction jobs and around 30 long-term service roles. Local governments and school districts stand to benefit as well, with tens of millions in new property tax revenue projected over the coming decades.

Supporters argue that the benefits go beyond jobs and revenue. Solar power helps insulate residents from the rising costs of natural gas and other fossil fuels while delivering cleaner air. ""There's no pollution. There is no off-gassing or anything of that nature. There [are] no compressor stations or anything of that nature,"" said Louie Miller of the Mississippi Sierra Club. ""Solar is not anything to be worried about.""

Other solar sites in Mississippi have already shown what's possible. In Forrest County, for instance, property values near an existing farm nearly doubled over seven years, while tax revenue from the site grew more than tenfold. Similar gains are now within reach for communities across the state.

For homeowners, the clean energy revolution doesn't have to stop at the grid. Adding solar panels to your home can slash monthly electricity bills (potentially to as little as zero) and make it easier to operate other energy-efficient appliances, such as heat pumps. Tools like EnergySage can help you compare vetted local installers and save up to $10,000 on solar installation. And if you're looking to pair solar with heating and cooling upgrades, Mitsubishi can connect you with affordable heat pump options.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Mississippi-solar-farmsimage-rec6TYOiX05IXYfx8-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 08:59:11.733276

That’s the message Energy Secretary Chris Wright routinely delivers as the former chief of fracking firm Liberty Energy barnstorms media outlets and industrial sites alike to champion fossil fuels.

Wright has emerged as a key spokesperson and emissary for the Trump administration’s oil, gas and coal agenda. In any setting, he rattles off a laundry list of data-centric talking points to downplay the rise of clean energy and threat of warming temperatures.

He speaks with on-camera poise and an arcane knowledge of the energy sector that comes from decades in the field. Wright also peppers in culture war messaging and unwavering support for President Donald Trump alongside the data he cites. He often says Trump administration energy policy “is getting rid of nonsense and bringing back common sense.” Recently, he’s said Trump deserves a “hero of the climate award.”

Meanwhile, his argument that renewables and batteries provide no real value to the electricity grid is applauded by fossil fuel supporters and decried by clean energy advocates.

“They raise the system cost of electricity,” Wright said at a New York Times event in September. “If they could deliver reliably at peak demand times, they’d be value added.”

His comments often win support on social media from conservatives like Alex Epstein, the head of a think tank promoting fossil fuels who pushed for cutting wind and solar subsidies on Capitol Hill.

DOE spokesperson Ben Dietderich told POLITICO’s E&E News that wind and solar have “only increased costs and made the energy grid less reliable.” He added that “the production of dispatchable energy sources such as coal, oil, gas and nuclear have been hindered by regulations, costly permitting burdens, and environmental activism.”

Wright has drawn fire from climate advocates for arguing that hurricanes are not increasing in intensity, Arctic sea coverage loss is no big deal and winters aren’t windy. Critics say his numbers on renewables are wrong or misleading.

Wright “seems to have a really loose grasp of the facts … and a clear bias toward fossil fuels,” said John Rogers, associate director of Energy Analytics at the environmental group Union of Concerned Scientists.

Here are fact checks for four of Wright’s core electricity arguments:

‘We can deliver AI and stop the rise in electricity prices’

Wright made this statement last week on CNBC.

“The ultimate impact of AI should be able to make our grid more secure and actually lower the average delivery cost,” he said.

Electricity prices have risen more than 6 percent since last year. And many experts say higher U.S. electricity prices are all but guaranteed in the foreseeable future, driven in large part by surging demand from data centers that are likely to use eye-popping amounts of electricity to power artificial intelligence computing.

A recent report from the widely respected consultancy Rhodium Group says data centers could use roughly one-seventh of all U.S. electricity demand in 2040. That’s roughly triple the current data center demand in the U.S.

Ben King, a director at Rhodium’s Energy and Climate practice and lead author on the report, said “generationally high levels of demand growth,” along with cuts to renewable tax credits and deregulation at EPA, is likely to push up electricity bills 3-6 percent annually through the end of this decade.

That’s a stark contrast to falling electricity bills that the group forecast prior to the Trump administration.

“Over the past three or four years, additions of wind, solar, and batteries have been somewhere between 85 and 95 percent of new stuff on the grid,” King said. “As you look at meeting capacity needs, the clearest place to do that is by adding these resources that are already in the pipeline.

“The policy actions [under Trump] have made it more difficult to build that stuff,” he said.

Meanwhile, a new report from the Center for Energy & Environmental Analysis, a think tank, says electric and gas utility bills in data-center-heavy Virginia could rise by more than $1,100 on average by 2040.

Mike Jacobs, a senior manager for energy at Union of Concerned Scientists, said rising gas prices, along with coal plant bailouts and higher construction costs in part due to tariffs, are fueling higher electricity bills.

“The growth in demand from data centers driven by AI is growth the industry has not seen in anybody’s career,” Jacobs said. “The supply chain and the ability to build new power plants to keep up with that growth won’t be sufficient to lower prices and most likely will not keep up.

“Unfettered data center growth will raise prices,” he said.

But Wright also has defenders. Mario Loyola, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation and an administration official in Trump’s first term, said renewable subsidies, state-level renewable portfolio standards, sluggish permitting and other factors have created a “toxic stew that is killing investment in the power sources that we need.”

Like Wright, Loyola says the U.S. needs more coal and gas plants to produce electricity reliably and cheaply.

“It’s pretty clear that the leadership at the Department of Energy understands what the problem is,” he said. “It will take some time for the interagency process to produce a strong, whole-of-government approach.”

‘There are not oil and gas subsidies’

Wright says the Trump administration opposes renewables because it opposes subsidies. “The wind subsidies and solar subsidies are 33 years old, so it’s about time for industries to walk on their own,” he told the New York Times event.

But do fossil fuels get subsidies? Wright doesn’t think so.

“There are not oil and gas subsidies,” he said. “You can rapidly expense your drilling costs, which you can for all manufacturing.”

Wright was likely referring to a tax perk for “intangible drilling costs,” or IDCs. It’s one of many fossil fuel subsidies outlined in a recent report by the environmental group Oil Change International.

The report says the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Republican legislation that cut short renewable subsidies, plussed up subsidies for fossil fuels, including through a bigger IDC deduction. The law’s expansion of the 45Q carbon capture tax credit for enhanced oil recovery will cost taxpayers more than $1.4 billion annually, the report says.

All told, the report says fossil fuels get at least $30 billion annually in U.S. federal subsidies.

Collin Rees, U.S. program manager at Oil Change International and author of the report, said Wright is denying fossil fuel subsidies exist to sidestep “a debate on the merits.”

“He’s now out there attacking this entire idea,” Rees said. “Fossil fuel subsidies are designed to, and do in actuality, flow to increase the profits of the biggest oil and gas companies on the planet, and they have for over 100 years.”

A report from the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense, dated 2014, says the IDC carve-out is more than just a typical expense for businesses.

“In fact IDC deduction is not the same, or designed with the same purpose, as the [research and experimental] deduction available to other industries,” it says. “At this point in the technological development of the industry, the IDC deduction only serves to subsidize the business generally by allowing certain taxpayers to avoid the capitalization rules applying to other taxpayers.”

Meanwhile, the Trump administration is implementing a wide range of policies to boost coal production and use through direct grants and new tax cuts.

The OBBB provided a new 2.5 percent tax credit for metallurgical coal. Just five days after speaking at the New York Times event, Wright announced $625 million in DOE grants to keep coal plants running with new pollution controls — or even to reboot closed plants.

Rees says those policies are subsidies. Others say they’re just some money to help coal after years of strict coal regulations under recent Democratic presidents.

“Given that both the Obama and Biden administrations imposed massive costs on the coal industry as part of this kind of religious movement in opposition to coal and greenhouse gas emissions, this is a partial offset for that,” said Benjamin Zycher, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. “So I wouldn’t call it a subsidy. I call it a reduction in a negative subsidy.”

Critics of the fossil fuel subsidy argument also say it’s a red herring. That’s because renewables get a lot more help from the government.

“It’s really renewables [and] unconventional energy that get massive subsidies,” Zycher said. “The argument of fossil fuel subsidies is really a way to distract attention from the massive subsidies that renewables get and the distortions those produce for the electric power system.”

A 2023 report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the data-crunching arm of DOE, said 46 percent of all energy subsidies were tied to renewable energy, while 35 percent of all energy subsidies were for consumption, including the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.

Renewables provided ‘2.6% of global energy last year’

Wright has touted the statistic in arguing that wind and solar subsidies should be eliminated.

“$5 trillion of … subsidized and mandated expenditures on wind, solar and batteries. Congratulations. 2.6 percent of global energy last year,” he said in late September duringa Foreign Press Centers briefing in New York.

Wright also cites the statistic in claiming that renewables are expensive and unreliable — an assertion challenged by the industry. “The more we load our grid with intermittent generation, the worse the grid performs during times of maximum stress and demand,” Wright wrote in the New York Post in June.

Conservatives often point to warnings, including from the U.S. grid monitor, that fossil fuel plant retirements are threatening the grid.

It is true that wind and solar accounted for roughly 3 percent of U.S. primary energy consumption last year, according to the EIA. That’s partly because transportation, which is dominated by oil, is a significant portion of energy use.

But with delivered energy — which counts energy that reaches an end user — solar’s share rises to roughly 7 percent.

In the electricity sector, wind and solar provided roughly 17 percent of U.S. power in 2024 after a decade of growth. And electricity is projected to constitute a growing share of U.S. energy because of electric vehicles and other factors, according to data analysis firm Ember.

There also are many documented cases of wind and solar helping keep power on during peak demand periods with support from linked batteries.

In one example, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the grid operator serving most of the state, said in June that solar growth made this summer “uneventful” for the grid, an improvement from the past when officials warned about outages during peak demand.

“Rising solar and battery output in ERCOT clearly enabled a summer of triple-digit heat without the close calls of previous summers and with lower prices to boot,” the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas wrote in a research note in January about similar effects from solar and batteries in summer 2024.

Unsubsidized renewables are now the most cost-competitive form of generation, particularly as new gas plants face a shortage of turbines, according to a June report from Lazard.

The levelized cost of electricity — the focus of Lazard’s analysis — has been criticized as not providing a full picture of costs to back up renewables. But federal data shows that the top four states producing wind and solar power are among the cheapest states for electricity. A POLITICO analysis found the majority of states tapping high amounts of renewables had electricity prices below the national average.

The Solar Energy Industries Association, which has accused Wright of lying on social media, says every dollar of federal subsidy for the industry saves Americans almost $3, because of lower electricity costs and federal and state tax revenue. Solar can be brought online faster than new gas and nuclear plants to meet AI demand, industry supporters say.

“When Sec. Burgum and Sec. Wright choke off supply, they’re the ones responsible for raising Americans’ energy prices. Every time a family sees that spike on their utility bill, they’ll know exactly who is to blame,” SEIA President and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper said in an emailed statement.

‘People that live near wind farms don’t like them’

Wright has argued this point in explaining why the Trump administration has targeted wind power, including by reducing funding at the DOE and blocking Biden-era projects approved by the Interior Department.

“Wind is the opposite of natural gas. People that live near wind farms don’t like them. People that live far away, love them … people that live in oil fields, love it. People that live far away, hate it,” he said at an event hosted by The New York Times in September.

Wright added that opposition in rural communities to wind power is at a “fever pitch,” citing project cancellations and local bans on wind.

The secretary is correct that opposition to wind power locally has been growing, according to some analyses. A report from Columbia University’s law school in June found that 459 counties and municipalities in 44 states had adopted “severe” local restrictions on siting renewables by the end of last year, a 16 percent increase from 2023.

“While 2024 was a year of record-breaking success for the deployment of utility-scale renewables in the United States … recent studies suggest that installations could have been significantly higher absent restrictive zoning and local opposition,” the school’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law said.

However, oil and gas projects have also garnered local opposition in recent years, including protests against the Mountain Valley pipeline and outcry against hydraulic fracturing in Pennsylvania. In Colorado, many local officials have rejected fossil fuel development, including for a planned gasoline storage facility near an elementary school that prompted parents to threaten lawsuits.

Additionally, some polling suggests that public opposition to oil and gas development overall may be greater than for renewables.

The Pew Research Center reported this June that Americans’ support for wind and solar power is higher than for any other resource, even though support for renewables has dropped among Republicans since Trump’s first term. The same survey found majority support for development of offshore wind farms, including among GOP or GOP-leaning adults.

Other polling organizations, including Gallup, have similarly found that more Americans support development of renewables and alternative energy than production of oil, gas and coal.

“The public’s continued general preference for developing alternative energy may help explain its tepid support for fracking and offshore drilling,” Gallup said in April.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/10/97/dbeb6f4d4ae599fe3ceadaedc6ab/u-s-congress-70265.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 08:00:42.285239

Gavin Newsom signed a bill aimed at streamlining the approval of new geothermal power production projects. But Newsom vetoed the second bill the industry had pinned its hopes on, making it only a partial win for geothermal boosters.

What happened: Newsom signed AB 531, by Assemblymember Chris Rogers, which will allow geothermal power plants to get certified through the California Energy Commission streamlined opt-in process. He rejected its companion bill, Assemblymember Diane Papan’s AB 527, which would have provided a California Environmental Quality Act exemption for many exploratory wells that geothermal developers drill to determine if the site is a good fit for a power plant.

Background: California’s tectonic activity has given the landscape abundant geothermal activity close to the surface, making it an optimal place for geothermal development. California in 2023 produced about two-thirds of the nation’s geothermal electricity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Ammonia is one of the world’s ‘big four’ chemical products. It is the main feedstock for nitrogen-based fertilisers and it is also used in refrigeration, explosives, textiles, and pharmaceuticals.

Its production accounts for about 1.5% of total-energy related emissions and the vast majority is currently made by combining hydrogen with nitrogen in the Haber-Bosch process.

According to the International Energy Agency, ammonia is one of the most emissions-intensive commodities produced by heavy industry, nearly twice as emission intensive as crude steel production and four times as intensive as that of cement on a direct emissions basis,

To fully decarbonise its production, companies are also exploring green ammonia. However this comes with its own challenges including high production costs, infrastructure gaps, and a lack of economic incentives.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2025/09/shutterstock_2297911471.jpg",N,,2025-10-08 09:57:57.756238

PALMER, Mass. — On a recent hot autumn day, a dozen black cows took respite in the shade cast by a 10-foot-tall series of solar panels set above 13 acres of hayfields at Burgundy Brook Farm.

Farm owner Tom Roberts grazes cattle and grows timothy and other forage grasses beneath the solar array. Roberts receives rent from the developer and owner of the solar project, but doesn’t tap into the solar energy produced by the two-megawatt (MW) system, himself. Half of the electricity generated by the panels on his family’s property is sold through renewable energy credits to roughly 175 low-income homes while a hospital buys the other half.

“The cash flow keeps the farm progressing in the right direction,” said Roberts, whose western Massachusetts farm spans more than 400 acres.

The community solar system on Roberts’ farm is one of 20,691 solar arrays, both residential and commercial, now operating in Massachusetts, where policy makers have established the Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target, (SMART) program to encourage solar expansion. Through the program, the state compensates homeowners and businesses for producing solar electricity.

Massachusetts has recently revamped and expanded incentives under the SMART program, now dubbed SMART 3.0, to keep the solar market growing even in the face of moves by the Trump administration discouraging solar and other renewable energy expansion. The state said it will be accepting applications for new SMART projects starting Oct. 15.

State leaders have vowed to invest $1 billion over 10 years in new technologies to mitigate harmful climate change. Massachusetts additionally passed legislation at the end of last year to promote non-gas heating, expand access to electric vehicles, tackle rising energy costs, and other measures favoring renewable energy growth.

Massachusetts is one of many states nationwide with programs that encourage renewable energy development to meet robust greenhouse gas reduction goals. And like Massachusetts, many other states are sharpening their clean energy strategies to navigate the anti-renewable energy policies of the Trump administration.

In just the first several months since taking office, Trump’s White House has moved to cancel billions of dollars allotted to clean energy projects, frozen permitting for wind projects and gutted vital federal tax credits incentivizing renewable energy projects. The federal tax credits – a tool often used to spur development of new technologies – have been instrumental in reducing the upfront costs of building new clean energy projects.

An analysis by Rhodium Group, an independent research provider, estimated that under a worst-case or high-emissions scenario, clean energy deployment would be half what was expected under the Biden administration through 2035.

“States are recognizing … we need to step up and fill this void of leadership to make sure that we’re meeting energy demand and doing so in a way that’s environmentally responsible but moreover more affordable,” said Jacob Weinberg, a spokesman for the Solar Energy Industries Association.

“Hungry for solutions”

Electricity prices are rising at more than double the rate of inflation, and prices are only forecast to keep climbing as power-sucking new technologies leave states “hungry for solutions”, according to Kelly Trombley, senior director of state policy at the nonprofit Ceres, which works with businesses to advocate for clean energy policies.

“State governments recognize the political liability of high energy prices, and they also see the projected loads coming from not just data centers, but increased manufacturing and [vehicle] electrification,” she said.

The Trump administration has said it sees US coal plants as a partial solution, recently announcing $625 million in investments to reinvigorate and expand the US coal industry. But many state leaders are not in agreement, and neither are energy analysts.

The governors of Arizona and North Carolina have each issued recent executive orders creating task forces to determine how their states will keep utility costs affordable, maintain clean energy leadership, and meet economic development and environmental goals.

California, meanwhile, passed a six-bill package addressing affordability, including authorizing the state to participate in a regional western energy market and public financing for transmission infrastructure, as well as for expediting renewable energy on to the grid.

“State governments recognize the political liability of high energy prices, and they also see the projected loads coming from not just data centers, but increased manufacturing and [vehicle] electrification.” – Kelly Trombley, Ceres

Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo, a Republican, wrote to US Department of Interior (DOI) Secretary Doug Burgum in August expressing concern that federal policies were preventing or delaying major solar energy projects.

The governors’ office has since had “productive discussions” with DOI officials, “and it is clear that the administration is attentive to Nevada’s commitment” to advancing these projects, said John Meny, the governor’s press secretary.

“If you want new power resources, renewables are the answer. They are also the most cost-effective,” Dennis Wamsted, energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said. Investment bank Lazard released a report in June which found that unsubsidized wind and solar are the lowest cost sources of energy generation.

“Solar and wind are still going to get built because you can’t build anything else right now,” he continued, noting there’s a five to seven year wait for natural gas turbines because of manufacturing bottlenecks.

“What reality looks like”

For the first half of 2025, solar and battery storage accounted for 82% of all new power generation added to the grid, as developers raced to qualify for tax credits before they expire on December 31. While battery storage devices do not generate their own energy, they amplify wind and solar energy by storing it and releasing it later, including when the sun isn’t shining or the wind isn’t blowing.

Solar developer BlueWave, which installed the solar system on the Burgundy Brook Farm, owns and operates nine solar arrays on a variety of vegetable, fruit, hay and livestock farms in the Northeast. Through the “dual-use” systems, farmers can continue to grow crops and graze livestock on land where elevated solar panels work to generate power.

Dual use solar provides additional benefits Roberts said he wasn’t anticipating. “By giving the hay crop underneath it some periodic shade throughout the day, we’ve seen an increase in the quality and the quantity of the grass, because it doesn’t seem to get burned out as quick by the hot sun,” he said.

BlueWave plans to build 10 to 20 more in the state over the next few years.

Last year, the company projected to build 60 such systems across the Northeast and Illinois, but now is hesitant to forecast how many will move forward.

“We’re still trying to figure out what reality looks like from here on out,” said Gabrielle Hayes, sustainable solar development manager at BlueWave.

The Burgundy Brook Farm solar array took five years to become operational, largely because of the wait for grid connection, Hayes said. Insufficient transmission capacity often leads to delays that also drive up soft costs.

While new transmission systems are costly and take a long time to build, new technologies—like high performance conductors—can greatly expand the existing capacity of transmissions systems, and therefore hasten clean energy deployment, according to Trombley.

“That’s helpful, because we have all of this clean energy waiting in the interconnection queue,” she said. State legislation requiring utilities to evaluate the costs and benefits of grid enhancement technologies was a “big trend this year that we fully expect to see this coming year,” she added.

New Mexico, Oregon, South Carolina, Virginia and Massachusetts were among states passing such legislation in the past year.

Similarly, battery storage can expand clean energy transmission by storing solar and wind energy and releasing it when the power is most needed.

Federal tax credits, albeit reduced, will remain for storage for another 10 years, and states are moving to take advantage of them. This year, Massachusetts and New Jersey became the latest of more than a dozen states to announce storage procurement plans. Massachusetts will add an initial 1,500 MW of battery storage this year and ultimately 5,000 MW by 2030, while New Jersey will add 1,000 MW by 2030.

“Storage and basically anything that increases flexibility, like grid enhancement, can really support clean energy and affordability,” Trombley said.

Battle in the courts

Just how much state level action and market forces can overcome anti-renewable federal policies remains to be seen. Progress will likely vary by state or region – and by the governor’s political affiliation. The Trump administration recently cut an additional $7.6 billion for clean energy projects, but only in states led by Democratic governors.

“We’re still trying to figure out what reality looks like from here on out.” – Gabrielle Hayes, BlueWave

Massachusetts is taking many steps to keep the ball moving, but offshore wind, now stymied by the Trump administration’s special animus for wind power, is a cornerstone of the state’s net zero plan.

While the state has taken a “thoughtful approach to balancing renewable energy and land conservation,” with SMART and permitting and siting revisions, “I think we were really hopeful about the energy supply that was going to come from offshore wind,” said Vick Mohanka, chapter director of the Massachusetts Sierra Club.

“In the big picture, we also see a world where we have diesel generators fueling data centers. We see natural gas peaker plants. We see a [federal] bipartisan acceptance of an all of the above energy approach,” that is perpetuating fossil fuels, he said.

Just how much clean energy will be added to the grid after the federal tax credits sunset in December will also be determined by how hard state leaders fight the administration’s anti-renewable agenda, Mohanka and other advocates said.

At least 19 states have filed multiple lawsuits challenging the Trump administration’s renewable energy policies, including a lawsuit against the administration’s freeze on wind.

And on Oct. 6, a group of labor unions, nonprofits and solar companies sued the Trump administration over its cancellation of grants aimed at expanding solar energy to low-income communities.

“The battle here is going to have to be in the courts,” said Larry Chretien, executive director at the Green Energy Consumers Alliance.

Back on Burgundy Brook Farm, Roberts said he is so happy with the solar project that he is considering adding another to additional farm property he owns in a neighboring town.

“It’s been a very good fit,” Roberts said. “Nobody wants fossil fuel and coal and nuclear, and solar seemed like a pretty green way to go about it.”

Coal ash at the site is contaminating nearby groundwater at levels exceeding protection standards, and federal rules require any utilities facing such a situation to formulate plans to clean up the problem. The investor-owned utility recently released an updated third-party assessment that details various ways AES can correctly manage the waste and comply with federal regulations.

Groundwater monitoring beginning in 2019 at the site’s coal ash ponds found high levels of arsenic, lithium and molybdenum at levels that require corrective actions. The pollutants must be cleaned up, but the report by Ohio-based firm Haley Aldrich says they pose “no adverse impacts on human health or the environment.”

While the report outlines many potential solutions, some environmental advocates say there is no silver bullet and that each potential solution will have some drawbacks.

“The bottom line is that we need to stop groundwater contamination and make sure the coal ash is secured the next time the White River floods,” Indra Frank, coal ash advisor with Hoosier Environmental Council, said.

Cleaning up coal ash

AES officials say the company will use certain criteria to determine the most effective way to clean up the coal ash. Potential remedies must protect human health and the environment, protect groundwater, reduce or eliminate future releases of contaminants, and remove the existing contamination.

Once AES identifies solutions that meet the above criteria, it will then evaluate them on their short- and long-term effectiveness as well as how easy each solution will be to implement.

The Haley Aldrich report outlines potential solutions AES can choose from, such as capping the ponds with cement or building walls in the ponds to contain the contaminants and water treatment systems.

AES, as a requirement under the federal coal ash rule, opened up a public comment period so residents and stakeholders can submit their opinions on the proposed solutions. These comments will be considered before the utility chooses what to do.

One option that Frank supports but which does not appear in the report would be containing all the coal ash into one wall-lined pond rather than putting it into multiple ponds as is currently being done.

Coal ash at Harding Street

The Harding Street station began coal-burning operations in 1931 and continued through February 2016 when the facility stopped burning coal. However the ash from the prior decades of burning remains on site.

That ash, also called coal combustion residuals, is stored in multiple ponds, or watery impoundments to the south of the main plant. Coal ash contains, among other things, contaminants such as mercury, cadmium and arsenic that can contaminate waterways, groundwater, drinking water and the air.

The ash stored at Harding Street is deeper than the water table in some places, mixing with the groundwater. The depth of the pond means contaminants in the coal ash are able to mix with the groundwater.

The assessment will help AES focus on two main goals. The first is preventing any more coal ash pollution from reaching the groundwater. The second involves determining what to do with the groundwater that is already contaminated.

AES has created an online portal for the public to write their comments on the coal ash clean up plan. Comments can entered at aesindiana.com/harding-street-cma-meeting or emailed to aesindianapuvlicaffairs@aes.com.

In 2024, renewable power capacity globally rose by about 15% year on year, reaching almost 4,500 gigawatts.

The bulk of that growth came in Asia where China remains the powerhouse of renewable energy investment, pushing huge scale in both capacity additions and grid modernisation.

In the first half of 2025 alone, China added 268 gigawatts of renewable capacity (for context the total electricity generating capacity from all sources on the island of Ireland is approximately 17 gigawatts).

Europe was the second largest contributor to renewable energy growth in 2024 adding 12.3% capacity year on year with Germany, Spain, France and Italy leading the way.

Business Bulletin

There is clear evidence from these case studies that countries and regions with strong access to financing, streamlined regulatory frameworks and investment incentives are those who are achieving most success in the green transition.

Ireland & carbon targets

Ireland is forecast to fall well below its 2030 target of a 51% reduction in carbon emissions and clearly needs to act faster to meet both National and EU targets.

Tax policy and tax incentives can play an important role in incentivising investment into green projects and reducing carbon emissions.

In the past, we have used tax policy to regenerate urban and rural areas, create financial services and manufacturing hubs, build hotels and student accommodation, and reduce the consumption of plastic bags.

When used appropriately, tax policy can drive investment quickly into the right sectors of the economy and change social behaviours overnight.

Inflation Reduction Act & the European Green Deal

Although the sitting US president is busy dismantling the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) measures introduced by the Biden administration, after the IRA was introduced into law in 2022, there was clear evidence that it was driving clean energy investment in the US.

Groups like Audi, ENEL and BMW had all announced plans to invest in manufacturing facilities in the US and cited the IRA and its incentives to foster domestic production of clean energy equipment as the catalyst for these decisions.

The European Green Deal (seen as the EU’s version of the IRA) has introduced pro green tax measures (such as plastic taxes and the carbon border adjustment mechanism) and in July 2025, the Commission recommended the use of tax incentives such as accelerated depreciation and targeted tax credits to promote investment in clean technologies, renewable energy and energy-efficient machinery.

The evidence is out there that these types of tax policy can foster investment, and the EU Commission is clearly promoting the use of tax policy to aid the green transition.

Our pre-Budget recommendations

Under the banner of supporting the green transition, the following recommendations for Budget 2026 were included in KPMG’s pre-budget submission:

Increases to the tax-free lump sum payable on retirement when some or all of the lump sum is derived from approved ESG funds.

The introduction of a tax exemption for interest earned by individuals on “green” bonds.

The reintroduction of a tax deduction to companies who invested their own cash in renewable energy projects and a broadening of the relief to include investments in energy-efficiency projects such as retrofitting of commercial buildings.

Increases in the R&D tax credit rate for expenditure incurred on R&D carried out on green technologies.

The introduction of a super-deduction (for instance 150% of expenditure incurred) on energy-efficient equipment, EV charging stations and onsite renewable energy installations.

Changes to BIK and VAT rules to ensure that individuals are motivated to buy electric vehicles and use bicycles or public transport where possible.

Meeting EU targets

Although we welcome the changes announced in this year’s Budget, we would encourage the Department of Finance to consider what new measures can be introduced, as given our current trajectory, we are unlikely to meet our EU targets.

While there are costs associated with the introduction of new tax reliefs, those costs must be measured against the financial penalties that would be imposed if EU-mandated targets are not met in the future.

A report issued by the Fiscal Advisory Council and Climate Change Advisory Council in March of this year estimated those costs to be between €8bn and €26bn.

These costs (and the other costs for businesses and individuals of climate change) should not be ignored in arriving at a balanced budget.

Many conservative states have learned limiting energy sources doesn't make sense. Wind accounted for around 59% of electricity generation in Iowa in 2023 and renewable energy accounts for around 30% of electricity generation in Texas.

The cost of electricity is lower in those states than in Indiana, where only 16.1% of utility-scale net electricity generation in Indiana is renewable.

Companies looking to expand or relocate also increasingly demand clean, affordable energy access. If we can’t supply the resources for that demand, those businesses will choose a state that can supply such energy, like Illinois or Michigan.

Including more choices of energy sources is not just a solid strategy — it’s common sense.

Letters: Pro-development Republicans are Indiana's real extremists

Across Indiana, renewable projects are already lowering consumer costs, attracting new businesses and creating jobs.

As with all newer technologies, the cost of renewable energy production continues to fall. Economies of scale, automation and the use of more efficient materials in both wind and solar manufacturing continue to lower the cost of production.

Building renewable energy, though, is not about replacing other forms of energy. It is about building a balanced, diversified portfolio that ensures Indiana families and businesses can depend on affordable, reliable power for decades to come.

Just as no savvy investor puts all their money into a single stock, no wise state puts all its energy bets into a small number of sources.

Opinion: Solar belongs on rooftops, not Indiana farmland

With that, we must determine the proper balance between individual property rights and community development. A cornerstone of both our democracy and our economy is that an individual owns his or her land and may develop it as they desire, so long as it does not infringe upon the rights of others.

A personal bias against renewables does not constitute infringement, yet many counties have passed severe restrictions against renewable energy development.

Our state is better when we embrace innovation while staying true to our values. We must commit to building a grid capable of meeting today’s demands that is ready for tomorrow’s opportunities.

That means modernizing infrastructure, supporting innovation and scaling up our energy development through renewables.

For anyone who hasn’t been taking refuge under a rock, world trade is going through some serious convulsions.
Times have certainly changed as the EU now prepares to dive into the same protectionist waters.
The coming years will see the EU grow increasingly protectionist – which will bring knock-on effects, such as making the Union’s diversification drive on trade harder.
His work centres on European industrial policy, digital infrastructure, competition, trade and EU/China relations.","In a bid to prop up the bloc’s crisis-stricken steel industry, the European Commission on Tuesday proposed heavy tariffs on non-EU steel imports – levies that will kick in much earlier, as the quota for foreign steel is almost halved.

The measure smacks of Trumpism. True to its open trade leanings, the Commission’s proposal includes nods to free trade agreement partners and promises to clear the proposal with the World Trade Organization. But there’s no disguising that at its heart, it is a protectionist play to safeguard a vital European industry. What’s more, it’s not the only one.

For anyone who hasn’t been taking refuge under a rock, world trade is going through some serious convulsions. Donald Trump’s aggressive trade policies have cast the international commercial system as we know it into existential doubt.

This is serious business for the EU. The Union is highly dependent on trade for its economic welfare, and the US is the most important export market for EU businesses. In fact, the EU-US trade relationship is the largest in the world.

Unleashing a flood of sectoral and across-the-board tariffs, Trump has struck at the core of the relationship, driving fear into the hearts of export-leading industries in Europe.

At the same time, Europe is facing increasing import competition from cheap Chinese goods. The long-held fears of Chinese manufacturing overcapacity are reaching “fever pitch” as goods that are shut out of the US through steep tariffs start landing on EU shores instead.

This reality is leading to a fundamental rethink in EU economic and trade circles. Rather than maintain its free trade course, Europe must protect its home market from distortions from abroad, goes the thinking. The new trade measure on steel products is the latest, and starkest, proof of this.

In the same vein, the Commission is planning a stronger emphasis on “Made in Europe” requirements for public procurements in the bloc, as championed by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in her State of the Union speech.

Not long ago, the Union vehemently opposed similar “Made in the US” requirements for tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, with European politicians blasting them as protectionist. Times have certainly changed as the EU now prepares to dive into the same protectionist waters.

Taken in isolation, these measures may be welcomed by EU industry. The bloc’s steel sector really is on its knees, shedding almost 100.000 jobs in the last 15 years. Building EU-made preference into public contracts can also boost the competitiveness of European firms and secure more resilient homegrown value chains.

But these measures are also splintering the global economy. As visualised by a downward spiral by the US economist Charles Kindleberger, it was the tit-for-tat responses to the protectionist policies of others that sunk the global economy in the inter-war years of the last century.

One nation starts the ball rolling – in the 1930s, the US led by Herbert Hoover – and the rest respond with measures of their own. While the world has mostly refrained from responding to Trump’s trade fire with fire of their own, the latest EU measure is something new and marks a fundamental change in how the bloc views trade and market access.

The coming years will see the EU grow increasingly protectionist – which will bring knock-on effects, such as making the Union’s diversification drive on trade harder.

Friendly third countries, such as Korea, Japan and South Africa, and their industries, naturally view the policy shift in the Union with apprehension. What are the benefits to closer commercial ties with the EU if the Union narrows access to the Single Market? Even close allies and geographical neighbours like Norway and Iceland are left unscathed. They dread the sting of another upcoming trade wall, this one on ferro alloys, an input in the steel value chain.

Rebalancing who’s able to trade freely in the Single Market and under what conditions is necessary in the name of economic security. But the EU should be mindful of contributing to, and possibly exacerbating, the fracturing of the world economy. It surely will not lead to anything good.

A new report titled North America Range Cooker Market (2025-2033) revealed key insights highlighting market trends for induction range cookers. According to the findings, the compound annual growth rate for induction cookers is ""expected to grow at a significant CAGR of 8.5% from 2025 to 2033.""

Grand View Research noted numerous factors contributing to the significant growth, highlighting advancements in smart and energy-efficient kitchen appliances. As a result, induction range cookers are not only appealing due to their power savings but also due to their health benefits. Unlike gas stovetops, induction ranges do not emit any harmful indoor pollutants.

Another reason homeowners are opting for induction stoves is their speed. Induction stoves heat up faster than gas ranges, making cooking times more efficient. The flat burners also make for easier cleanup, saving you time in the kitchen.

Switching to an induction stovetop can be affordable. Homeowners can get up to $840 off the cost of an induction range thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act. While many of the tax credits under the IRA are expiring by the end of 2025, the rebates for induction stoves are still available. Thus, taking advantage of these tax credits sooner rather than later can be the difference between saving thousands of dollars on home upgrades.

For renters or homeowners who may not want a major kitchen renovation, there are still ways to bring induction burners into your home. A plug-in induction burner, for example, is a great, inexpensive option for avoiding the hazards of gas stoves. Starting at just $50, a plug-in burner is also a simple way to try out induction for the first time.

Other ways you can electrify your home and save money include installing solar panels and upgrading your HVAC system. Switching to solar energy can bring your energy bills down to $0 or nearly $0.

For homeowners looking to go solar, EnergySage provides a free service that allows you to compare quotes from local installers, saving you up to $10,000 on your installation.

If purchasing panels isn't in your budget, you can still go solar by leasing panels. Palmetto's LightReach solar panel leasing program lets you install panels for no money down, allowing customers to lock in low energy rates.

Another way to improve your home's energy efficiency and save money is by upgrading your HVAC to a heat pump. On average, households can save nearly $400 per year on energy costs thanks to a heat pump. If you're looking to make the switch, Mitsubishi can help you find an affordable option for your home.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Kitchen.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 11:02:03.409590

The bipartisan pipeline safety reauthorization bill will help ensure the continued safe and secure movement of American energy.

The bill reauthorizes the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration’s (PHMSA) pipeline safety program for five years and authorizes $1.65 billion in funding. The legislation includes key measures to reduce pipeline-related fatalities and injuries, advance the development of new pipeline safety technologies, enhance safety inspections and enforcement efforts, and promote education for local communities on PHMSA’s work.

The PIPELINE Safety Act of 2025 also requires PHMSA to update parts of its regulations to account for new pipeline materials, gases, and operating practices. The bill also takes precautions against cybersecurity vulnerabilities that threaten America’s energy infrastructure integrity.

“America’s energy independence requires a strong and secure pipeline infrastructure,” said Senator Young. “The PIPES Act will reauthorize the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to ensure our pipeline ecosystem is safe and efficient, allowing the U.S. to meet our energy demands of today and tomorrow.”

“Americans have made it clear that they need safe, affordable, and dependable energy. PHMSA has no small task, overseeing over 3 million miles of oil, natural gas, and other hazardous liquid pipelines across this country, a significant portion of which are located in Texas. As the energy capital of the world, millions of jobs in Texas depend on the safe and reliable movement of energy,” said Senator Cruz. “The PIPELINE Safety Act of 2025 ensures oversight of the pipeline system is governed by appropriate, data-driven, and cost-effective standards. I am proud to partner with Ranking Member Cantwell and Senators Young and Peters on this bipartisan effort and hope to see it become law.”

“We just had the deadliest two-year period in pipeline safety since 2015. Clearly, we need a more proactive approach to the safe transportation of our nation’s energy products, including the 46,000 miles of pipeline in Washington state,” said Senator Cantwell. “This bill does just that by increasing civil penalties by 50 percent, eliminating gaps in hydrogen and carbon dioxide pipeline requirements, and requiring permanent cybersecurity standards for pipeline operators.”

“Pipeline safety is critical to protecting both our environment and our economy,” said Senator Peters. “That’s why I’m proud to introduce this commonsense, bipartisan bill to strengthen the safety and security of our nation’s pipelines and help prevent accidents before they occur.”

Background:

PHMSA is responsible for overseeing the safe transportation of oil, natural gas, and other hazardous liquids by pipelines across the United States.

,North Carolina American Energy ,2025-10-08 07:06:42+00:00,Kansas City Star,There's no national energy emergency. But a quiet revolution is underway in KC | Opinion,"Edward Mazria, Emily Curiel",,,,,https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/article312401860.html,"Across Missouri, Kansas and the American heartland, the public’s health and well-being are being sacrificed to serve corporate interests.
Let’s be clear: There is no national energy emergency, no electricity capacity crisis and no critical reliance on foreign energy.
Such devastation demands critical access to scientific information, urgent upgrades to our buildings and infrastructure, and an unwavering commitment to phasing out all remaining coal plants.
According to the Energy Information Administration’s State Energy Data System, total energy consumption in residential and commercial buildings declined a stunning 22% in Kansas and 12% in Missouri from 2005 to 2023.
Our aging, expensive coal plants are not just a liability — they are an opportunity.","Across Missouri, Kansas and the American heartland, the public’s health and well-being are being sacrificed to serve corporate interests. This is driven by a deceptive narrative that invents an energy crisis, scapegoats artificial intelligence data centers and demands a continued reliance on fossil fuels and coal plants. However, the facts are now coming to light — and they tell a much different story.

A calculated disinformation campaign is trying to sell us a crisis that doesn’t exist. Let’s be clear: There is no national energy emergency, no electricity capacity crisis and no critical reliance on foreign energy. Politicians and the media can repeat slogans such as “Drill baby, drill” and “beautiful, clean coal,” but that doesn’t make them real. The truth is that America produces more energy than it uses, and is the world’s largest oil and natural gas producer and the top exporter of gasoline and natural gas. The emergency is pure fiction.

So, why the hype? It’s a tool to justify gutting the federal rules that protect our families. The guise of a fake emergency has been used to weaken dozens of clean air and water regulations. These changes include limiting the ability of federal agencies to track pollution and climate data, and discontinuing a new database for predicting extreme precipitation. These actions present a contradiction: While the stated goal is to provide the “cleanest air and water on the planet,” championing “beautiful, clean coal” is a claim as absurd as a doctor prescribing cigarettes for your health.

This isn’t just a debate in Washington, D.C. It’s an assault on our communities — a fiction that creates so-called “sacrifice zones” across America’s heartland. A map of toxic pollution from coal plants reveals a grim truth: The highest concentration of harm is right here in Missouri, Kansas, across the Midwest and down to Texas. It’s been well documented that these plants pump mercury, acid gases and carcinogens into our air, leading to higher rates of asthma, developmental problems in children and increased cancer risk for everyone living nearby.

Unprecedented storms, dangerous heat

While some local progress has been made, the Kansas City area remains flanked by massive polluters in two states, including Evergy’s Iatan plant in Missouri and the La Cygne Generating Station in Kansas. Together, these aging facilities contribute to premature deaths and illnesses across the region annually. Meanwhile, utilities in both Missouri and Kansas consistently lobby regulators to pass the high maintenance costs of these aging plants onto customers. Nationally, pollution from coal-fired power plants was responsible for approximately 460,000 premature deaths in the U.S. between 1999 and 2020. The hidden societal cost of this pollution is just as staggering, totaling up to $500 billion each year.

Compounding this, the heartland is grappling with unprecedented weather and storms every year, feeling the direct impact of a destabilized climate. The immense climate costs hit home and are now a year-round threat, demonstrated by the intense storms of summer 2024 and 2025 that caused repeated flash flooding across the Kansas City metropolitan are, the powerful derecho of 2023 that left thousands without power, and the dangerous heat domes that regularly push temperatures to life-threatening levels. The year 2025 has also seen a series of catastrophic events nationwide, from deadly floods across the Midwest and South to devastating flash floods in Texas that killed more than 100 people.

This policy of sacrificing public health is mirrored by one of intentional ignorance, as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Billion-Dollar Disasters database — which documents nearly $3 trillion in escalating damages — is being retired and key federal scientists are being laid off. This dismantling of data and expertise comes as a catastrophic toll ravages the heartland, bringing loss of life, adverse health impacts, destroyed homes, flooded cropland and contaminated water supplies. Such devastation demands critical access to scientific information, urgent upgrades to our buildings and infrastructure, and an unwavering commitment to phasing out all remaining coal plants.

Quiet revolution of innovation, sustainability

But there is good news that directly refutes this narrative of fear. Since 2005, a quiet revolution has been unfolding in the U.S. building sector and architecture, design and planning communities — a story of efficiency, innovation and sustainability that goes largely unrecognized. The U.S. building sector has cut its electricity use by an impressive 10.7%, even while adding 70 billion square feet of new buildings. This sector includes America’s massive digital infrastructure, with 5,426 data centers — 10 times the number in China — and about half of the world’s largest hyperscale computing facilities. To grasp the scale of this achievement: It’s like building 44 new cities the size of Chicago yet still cutting the building sector’s power consumption.

This isn’t magic. It’s the result of better architecture and planning, building codes, smarter renovations, and improved equipment and appliances. This trend is especially important in the Kansas City region, which spans two states and has become a major national hub for energy-intensive data centers. According to the Energy Information Administration’s State Energy Data System, total energy consumption in residential and commercial buildings declined a stunning 22% in Kansas and 12% in Missouri from 2005 to 2023. While the states lack clean energy mandates, Kansas City has set its own goal to be carbon-neutral by 2040.

The evidence reveals a clear path forward. Our aging, expensive coal plants are not just a liability — they are an opportunity. Instead of spending billions propping up these polluting relics, we can transform their sites, along with their vital grid and infrastructure connections, into hubs of American innovation, powered by renewable energy farms.

This defines the heartland’s future: a win-win-win that turns sacrifice zones into innovative enterprise zones with high-paying jobs in technology and construction, lower energy bills for families and businesses and cleaner air for our children. The choice, then, is simple: We can cling to a past built on fear and fiction, or we can embrace a future built on facts and innovation.

Federal tax credits for electric vehicles expired on Sept. 30, ending a $7,500 subsidy that had made cleaner cars more accessible to American buyers for more than a decade.

Introduced in 2008, the tax credits were meant to bridge the cost difference between gasoline and electric powered vehicles. The policy was extended under the Inflation Reduction Act until 2032, until the Trump administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” terminated it seven years early.

The termination arrives at a critical moment for the global automotive industry. China has surged ahead in battery production and electric vehicle, or EV, sales, while the European Union nations have established strict emission standards. Without similar federal commitments, the United States may lose ground in an industry expected to dominate transportation and energy markets.

In the final months of the subsidy, dealerships reported record sales as Americans rushed to secure credits before they disappeared. July and August marked the strongest months in U.S. history for EV sales, underscoring how tightly adoption has been linked to financial incentives. With the program ended, growth is expected to slow, raising concerns about both climate goals and industrial competitiveness.

“The loss of the tax credits for electric vehicles is likely to slow down the uptake of electric vehicles across the United States, and it is disappointing for those who want the U.S. to continue to move toward a clean energy future,” Daniel Esty LAW ’86, a professor of environmental law and policy at Yale Law School, said.

Esty, who previously served as commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, emphasized that states will now carry greater responsibility. States such as California, New York and Connecticut have already announced independent EV incentive programs, while others have adopted zero-emissions vehicle mandates. But Esty warned that without federal coordination, state-by-state efforts risk producing uneven results.

He said European governments are pursuing coordinated approaches that combine subsidies with renewable energy mandates. In Asia, China has paired consumer rebates with industrial policy, giving domestic automakers a dominant share of the global EV market. These strategies contrast sharply with U.S. retrenchment at the federal level.

American automakers, meanwhile, face increasing uncertainty. Shifting regulations and tariffs under the Trump administration have left other manufacturing policies open to reversals. Without confidence in expected demand, manufacturers may cut back on innovation or shift investment overseas.

“It’s very clear that U.S. automakers are disappointed by the administration’s policies broadly. They’re disappointed by the loss of the tax credits for electric vehicles. They’re unhappy with the tariffs that have been put in place,” Esty said.

EV incentives have had measurable effects on consumer behavior. Electric vehicles still carry higher upfront costs than gasoline-powered cars, and credits helped close that affordability gap for households.

Sales data from Autovista Group confirms the link. In the months before expiration, EVs accounted for more than 12 percent of new car purchases, a record high for the U.S. market. Much of that surge is attributed to consumers seeking to benefit from the subsidy before it disappeared.

“There’s evidence that a meaningful share, from 10 percent to 30 percent, of the EVs that were being sold were purchased because of the incentives,” Stephanie Weber, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Colorado Boulder, said.

Weber explained that automakers are already adjusting. Honda canceled a planned electric SUV this summer, citing reduced expectations for U.S. demand. General Motors and Volkswagen have similarly scaled back production schedules. Esty said that these decisions suggest that American companies are bracing for a weaker market than international competitors, who continue to expand under stronger government support.

Policy differences extend beyond subsidies. California has retained its right to impose stricter vehicle emissions standards, a move joined by 11 other states. But the elimination of federal penalties for failing to meet national efficiency standards has diluted the pressure on automakers at the national level.

Industry observers note that the absence of a unified policy creates uncertainty, which can chill investment. While international rivals benefit from stability, U.S. firms face a stop-and-start approach that complicates planning.

“We are going to see fewer new products than we might have otherwise,” Weber said. “Some automakers have actually canceled EV models that they had previously announced. For example, Honda canceled plans for a large electric SUV in July, anticipating a decrease in U.S. demand.”

Kenneth Gillingham, a Yale professor of environmental and energy economics, emphasized that the impact of EV subsidies cannot be understood in isolation. His research shows that in coal-heavy regions, EV adoption can actually prolong fossil fuel reliance unless accompanied by electricity-sector reforms. Consequently, subsidies alone are not enough to maximize climate benefits.

“This means a few things. One is that we should plan on carbon pricing at the social cost of carbon if that is at all possible politically. It also means that if we want EV adoption to reduce emissions as much as possible, we also need policies reducing emissions from the electricity sector,” Gillingham said.

He added that the repeal of subsidies may deepen divides in access to cleaner transportation. States that maintain their own programs or have cleaner grids are positioned to benefit first, leaving households in coal-heavy regions with fewer options and higher emissions. The result is that clean air and cost savings may increasingly be concentrated among wealthier communities.

Looking ahead, Gillingham stressed that policy uncertainty has broader implications beyond emissions. Automakers, utilities and investors rely on predictable signals when deciding where to put resources. Without them, the U.S. risks losing momentum in both innovation and industrial leadership at a time when international competitors are moving decisively.

Gillingham noted that consumer interest in EVs will persist. Battery prices are continuing to fall, operating costs remain lower than gasoline vehicles, and states are introducing new subsidy programs. Still, without federal backing, the pace of adoption is likely to flatten, leaving the United States less prepared for a transportation sector that is rapidly electrifying worldwide.

“It is always the case in energy and environmental policy that incentives matter,” Esty said. “And when an important incentive, like the tax credits that were in place, disappears, it slows down the progress for getting people to consider electric vehicles.”",https://yaledailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/EVtaxcred_tk_AlexHong_contributing-photog-scaled-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-08 03:58:31.711357

Dive Brief:

Bosch has started volume production of hydrogen fuel cell modules for commercial trucks, the company said Thursday.

Electric truck maker Nikola Corp will be the pilot customer for the fuel cell modules.

Bosch is planning to invest nearly $2.8 billion in fuel cell development and manufacturing from 2021 to 2026.

Dive Insight:

Hydrogen-powered fuel cells are a viable alternative power source for electric commercial trucks, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Fully-electric trucks, on the other hand, require a large, heavy battery with long charge times, making them less ideal for commercial use, according to consulting firm McKinsey & Company.

By 2030, Bosch expects one in five new trucks weighing six tons or more globally to feature a fuel-cell powertrain.

The first fuel cell modules produced by Bosch in Germany will be used for the Nikola Tre FCEV Class 8 truck. Bosch also plans to manufacture fuel cell stacks in China and eventually at its U.S. factory in Anderson, South Carolina.

Fuel cells combine hydrogen and oxygen to generate electric power, so electric trucks can be equipped with a much smaller battery that provides additional power during acceleration in conjunction with the fuel stack. Additional energy is stored in the battery via regenerative braking, just like in an electric car.

Unlike diesel-powered trucks, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles also produce zero tailpipe emissions. Water is the only byproduct of a fuel-cell vehicle.

“A hydrogen engine can do everything a diesel engine does, but on top of that, it is carbon neutral. It also allows a fast and cost-effective entry into hydrogen-based mobility,” Bosch Mobility Chair Markus Heyn said in a statement.

Nikola’s hydrogen fuel cell Class 8 truck will have a max range of 500 miles and produce 536 horsepower, according to the company. The fuel cell modules in the Nikola Tre FCEV deliver 200 kW of power when combined with a 164 kWh battery pack. The liquid hydrogen is stored onboard in pressurized tanks, and refilling the tanks takes about 20 minutes.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/gXv4Pcs5LmNcCF6A9UM4PzYrylsaR_jPgfeFIGMRNFw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9uaWtvbGEucG5n.webp,N,,2025-10-08 04:59:25.070287

Destroying chargers is a common form of EV vandalism.
EV vandalism can deter people from making their next car an electric vehicle, and they'll miss out on the benefits an EV has to offer.
Since gas-powered cars constantly release planet-warming gases, gas cars will never be able to pay off their production debt.
Commenters were frustrated with the rise of EV vandalism and the lack of consequences.","A Redditor found a public electric vehicle charger destroyed and shared the concerning scene on r/Elektroautos, simply asking, ""Why?""

This unfortunate discovery can be day-ruining for EV drivers.

The charging station's cords have been sliced off the machine, rendering it useless. For drivers, this can be a big inconvenience, and for the charger's owner, it's a financial burden to replace.

Destroying chargers is a common form of EV vandalism. While some vandals may be motivated by the valuable copper in chargers, others have a negative perception of EVs. This anti-EV sentiment can manifest as someone with a gas-powered vehicle parking in EV-designated spots, keying cars, or slashing tires.

EV vandalism can deter people from making their next car an electric vehicle, and they'll miss out on the benefits an EV has to offer.

Charging an EV costs far less than gas — EV drivers save ""up to $2,200 a year for a fully electric vehicle, and $1,500 for a hybrid electric vehicle,"" according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

Regular maintenance is also more cost-effective, as EVs typically don't require oil changes, spark plug replacements, and other repairs that gas-powered cars need.

Not only are EVs better for your wallet, but they're also far more sustainable than their gas-powered counterparts. While a gas-powered car releases around five tons of carbon dioxide each year, EVs produce no tailpipe pollution at all.

This helps the EV pay off its lifetime carbon debt (the pollution released during production). Since gas-powered cars constantly release planet-warming gases, gas cars will never be able to pay off their production debt.

Charging at home is even better than charging at public stations — even if you don't have solar panels for free electricity — since it can be done more cheaply and overnight while you sleep. While all EVs and plug-in hybrids come with a Level 1 charging adapter that works on a standard wall outlet for about 30-40 miles of charge overnight, Qmerit is a great place to look if you want to upgrade to a fast Level 2 charger that can get you from empty to 80% in four to 10 hours.

Commenters were frustrated with the rise of EV vandalism and the lack of consequences.

Dick Urquhart, the founding father and first club president at CCNC, called the land on which the club is located the Royal Dornoch Golf Village.
“The connection that Pinehurst and the area and CCNC have to Donald Ross and Dornoch Scotland means a lot,"" said Sutton.
Royal Dornoch captain Gary Bethune took the loss with a large dose of sportsmanship.
“It’s something we want to build on,” said Royal Dornoch General Manager Neil Hampton.","On the heels of a contentious Ryder Cup, a different scenario played out recently at The Country Club of North Carolina (CCNC). The focus for the American and European amateur golfers on hand in the Sandhills of Pinehurst was instead on fun and friendship.

Two teams of 12 players played a Ryder Cup format match over three days at the Dogwood and Cardinal Courses of CCNC as part of the annual competition between The Country Club of North Carolina – one of the top private clubs in an area known as the “Home of American Golf” -- and Royal Dornoch, the heralded Scottish club home to a course that sits No. 2 in Golf Digest’s ranking of courses outside the United States. The matches have been contested, home and away, since 2011.

CCNC, which opened in 1963, is the only club in the U.S. with a reciprocal relationship with Royal Dornoch Golf Club, the birthplace and home of legendary golf architect Donald Ross, whose work is embraced by golfers throughout the Pinehurst region – from a handful of courses at the Pinehurst Resort to popular facilities like Mid Pines and Pine Needles. Dick Urquhart, the founding father and first club president at CCNC, called the land on which the club is located the Royal Dornoch Golf Village.

On the wall of CCNC’s Dornoch Grill, a prominently displayed framed scroll reads: ‘With this message of greeting goes our hope that Dornoch, Sutherland and Dornoch, North Carolina may continue to have close and increasingly friendly relations for many years to come.’ It was signed and sealed by Royal Dornoch GC captain W.B. Alford in 1971, and the annual match is a byproduct of that lasting relationship.

CCNC General Manager and Chief Operating Officer Jim Sutton said the competition is an important tradition that goes back to the vision of the founders of the club.

“The connection that Pinehurst and the area and CCNC have to Donald Ross and Dornoch Scotland means a lot,"" said Sutton. ""What’s fun each year is the camaraderie. It’s really just all about golf. It’s been great to host these guys. The connection with Donald Ross having been born in Dornoch and then coming here to the States to work (and) doing a lot of his best work in Pinehurst. There's a fraternal connection and, even though we are separated by a lot of distance, the spirit of the game is alive in both destinations.”

The eagerly anticipated match between CCNC and Royal Dornoch didn’t finish with a final score as close as the at-times contentious and controversial Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black in New York. The team from CCNC won the match prize, the Roly Bluck Putter, on their home turf by a score of 18.5 to 6.5.

Royal Dornoch captain Gary Bethune took the loss with a large dose of sportsmanship.

“It is played in the friendliest manner you could imagine,” he said. “There's a lot of banter. There's some alcohol involved, which can fuel the banter. Each match just gets better and better. The camaraderie amongst the guys is lovely.""

But he also offered some words of caution, with a laugh, about next year’s match at Royal Dornoch: ""They have a chance, but it’s a small one.”

The event is one of many around the U.S. that’s played in the spirit and format of the Ryder Cup – a team golf competition intended to foster rivalry and camaraderie.

But perhaps none have ties that run quite as deep in the golf world as the CCNC-Royal Dornoch matches. Some connections are even tangential. Consider, for example, that the designer of CCNC’s Dogwood Course, prominent North Carolina golf architect Ellis Maples, is the son of Frank Maples, who served as Donald Ross’ course construction supervisor and was superintendent of Pinehurst No. 2.

The historical ties are why the team from Royal Dornoch isn’t just eager to try and reclaim the title in the U.K. in 2026 but to return to the U.S. and Pinehurst region in 2027.

“It’s something we want to build on,” said Royal Dornoch General Manager Neil Hampton. “We've got so many players that want to be part of it. Not just to come to CCNC, which is one of mainstays but Pinehurst itself and soak up the atmosphere here and see what golf means to everybody in America and what Donald Ross has given everybody in America. We are so happy that we share Mr. Ross with everybody, and he's left his legacy that we can come and enjoy too.""",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68e5c59200f7944e0e7efeff/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-10-08 04:59:30.569504

The Business Sustainability Collaborative at NC State works to integrate environmental and social responsibility into business, education, and industry partnerships.

Yinka Thomas discussed B Corps, which are companies that demonstrate high social and environmental performance.

“Their vision is to build an inclusive, equitable, and regenerative economic system for all people and the planet,” Yinka Thomas said.

Before entering academia, Yinka Thomas began her career as a product designer at the toy company LeapFrog, where she led the design team for several educational products.

She described this work as one of the most rewarding parts of her career, but said she now wishes she had thought more deeply about what happened to the products after they left consumers’ hands.

After leaving LeapFrog, Yinka Thomas has been working in academia for the past 20 years. She has taught and researched business sustainability. Through her work, she helps students and companies understand how business can drive positive social and environmental change. She also highlighted B Academics, a summer program that gives students the opportunity to work virtually with companies pursuing B Corps certification.

Yinka Thomas noted that B Corps are not only creating positive social and environmental change, but also showing strong financial performance and resilience. She encouraged students to take part in that impact.

“Join me as a disruptor, whether it’s through B Academics and working with B Corps or by pursuing whatever sustainability issue or movement you’re passionate about,” Yinka Thomas said.

Kelly Harer, Elon’s Associate Director of Sustainability, spoke about the university’s ongoing efforts to engage the campus community in sustainability initiatives.

“It’s important for folks to understand there are many ways to work toward sustainability,” Harer said.

Harer emphasized the importance of building community around sustainability and of teaching people how to incorporate sustainability into their daily lives.

Elon will continue its celebration of Sustainability Week with events throughout the week. According to Elon’s Office of Sustainability, the week also highlights ongoing efforts to reduce the university’s environmental impact and promote a culture of sustainability.

The Section 32 Mine is within Navajo Allotment Land, and the Section 33 Mine is privately owned. Mining at Section 32 and 33 Mines occurred between 1960 and 1969, producing a total of 24,360 tons of ore, 20,117 tons from Section 32 Mine and 4,243 tons from Section 33 Mine. The mines were deep, dry underground mines accessed by vertical mine shafts.

Ore from the mines was moved to the Section 32 and 33 Mines Transfer Station south of the main mining area, and then hauled off site on the unpaved road to the west to County Route 19. Ore was transported approximately 50 miles from the site to the Ambrosia Lake uranium mill located to the east and north of Grants, New Mexico.

The mines were “dry mines,” meaning that the mined ore was above the water table and did not require water to be pumped out.

Cleanup Results to Date

In 2009 and 2012, EPA conducted assessments of the site, and then in 2012 completed a “removal action” and reclamation work at the Section 32 portion of the site, including the Section 32 and 33 Mines Transfer Station. The work consolidated all the waste from Section 32 in an on-site repository that remains covered and fenced. In 2019, EPA conducted a Removal Site Evaluation field investigation and report later that same year. In 2022 EPA collected additional data at the Section 32 and 33 Mines site, the haul road, and the former transfer station to aid the development of the Engineering Evaluation and Cost Analysis (EE/CA).

Action Memorandum: Selection of the Removal Action

On September 30, 2025, the EPA Region 9 Superfund Director signed the Action Memorandum for the Section 32 and 33 Mines site. The selected removal action involves excavating waste from the Site and disposing of it off-site in a planned mine waste repository at the Red Rocks Landfill property near Thoreau, New Mexico. The repository will be permitted by the State of New Mexico to permanently hold the uranium mine waste rock so that human and environmental health are protected. This action meets the goals laid out in the Navajo Abandoned Uranium Mines Ten-Year Plan.

Next Steps: Permitting, Design, and Removal

The removal action selected in the Action Memorandum will remove about 70,000 cubic yards of waste from the Section 32 and 33 Mines site. To complete this selected action, the Northwest New Mexico Regional Solid Waste Authority, the Red Rocks Landfill operator, will work with the State of New Mexico to obtain the necessary permits to operate and permanently manage a mine waste rock repository on their property. Once the permits are obtained from the State, the removal work will begin. Excavation and transport of waste could take up to 18 months, with the entire removal action process estimated to take 3-6 years, including permitting, construction, operation, and closure of the new repository at the Red Rocks Landfill property.

Community Involvement

Community members have an opportunity to become involved in the cleanup activities and help shape cleanup decisions. EPA and NNEPA meet regularly, in coordination with chapter officials, with residents and other community members about work at the Section 32 and 33 Mines site.

Who is the Community?

The community includes people in both rural areas and more populated areas around Prewitt, Casamero Lake, Smith Lake, and Borrego Pass. Many people graze livestock near mine sites. The Section 32 and 33 Mines are located in the Casamero Lake chapter.

EPA and NNEPA Community Involvement Activities

EPA and NNEPA works with community leaders such as the council delegates, chapter, grazing and land board officials, responsible company liaisons, as well as community members for all outreach activities and information sessions which are conducted with cultural sensitivity. To keep the community informed, EPA and NNEPA has done the following:

Developed fact sheets and flyers

Conducted interviews for a Community Involvement Plan

Attend chapter meetings to share information on cleanup progress

Held open house meetings and workshops to share and receive input on cleanup alternatives

Worked with chapter officials and family members to gain access to mine sites

Attended local chapter meetings to share site investigation information

Partnerships

EPA and NNEPA continue to work and strengthen relationships with a number of organizations focused on uranium and radiation, including:

Navajo Nation Abandoned Mine Lands Program

Indian Health Service Community Uranium Exposure-Journey to Healing

Indian Health Service Radiation Exposure Screening and Education Program

Office of Navajo Uranium Workers

Navajo Birth Cohort Study

Navajo Nation Department of Health Community Health Representatives

Bureau of Indian Affairs

Indian Health Service

Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry

Nuclear Regulatory Commission

Department of Energy

University of New Mexico

Northern Arizona University

Others as suggested by community members and local officials

Cleanup Progress Timeline

Before 2009, the buildings and aboveground structures were removed prior to EPA’s initial assessment, presumably by the owners/operators.

2025

On September 30, 2025, EPA Region 9 signed the Action Memorandum for the Section32 and 33 Mines site. The cleanup plan selected in the Action Memorandum entails removing uranium mine waste rock from areas on Navajo Nation and private land adjacent to Navajo communities and transporting it to a newly created off-site repository at the Red Rocks Landfill property east of Thoreau, New Mexico. This action will remove about 70,000 cubic yards of waste from the mine sites.

2024

Develop Community Involvement Plan for Section 32 and Section 33 mine sites.

2012

Section 32 mine was backfilled and 3 mine shafts were closed

A total of 34,686 cubic yards of waste from 15 areas on-site were combined into a stockpile on Section 32 mine including:

Waste from Section 32 and 33 Mines Transfer Station

Waste from closing mine shafts

Waste Piles

The stockpile:

Covers 2 acres and is up to 30 feet high

Is surrounded by a rock-lined drainage ditch

Includes a rock-lined runoff detention basin at the southwest corner

Was sprayed with soil stabilizer and dust control agents

No work was performed on Section 33 mine

The Indiana Citizen

October 7, 2025

State Rep. Pat Boy, a Michigan City Democrat who championed social, economic and environmental justice, has announced that she will be retiring from the Indiana General Assembly on Oct. 17, after serving three terms.

Boy was first elected to the Indiana House of Representatives in November 2018. She won the Democratic Party nomination in a three-way primary battle that year and then swept her Republican opponent, Dan Granquist, in the general election with 60% of the vote. However, in subsequent elections, GOP challengers ate into her winning margins with Boy winning just 51% of the vote in the November 2024 contest against Republican Joel Florek.

Prior to becoming a state legislator, Boy served on the Michigan City Common Council for nearly 15 years.

In a press release from the Indiana House Democratic Caucus, Boy said she had made the “bittersweet decision” to retire and focus on her family.

“Although I am stepping away from elected office, my heart will always be with the people I had the privilege to serve,” Boy said in her statement. “I wish my colleagues in the General Assembly continued success and thank them for their friendship and partnership throughout the years. I will be spending more time with my family and my cat, tending to my long-neglected garden and staying engaged in the community that has given me so much.”

In the Indiana House, Boy served on the Environmental Affairs Committee and the Elections and Apportionment Committee, and was the ranking Democrat on the Natural Resources Committee. Her work in helping Michigan City residents protect a wetland inspired her successful run for a seat on the common council in 2004 at the encouragement of many of her neighbors.

Boy authored several unsuccessful bills focused on the environment, including legislation requiring the reporting of certain spills into bodies of water, allowing a property tax deduction for maintaining a qualified wetlands area, and establishing a grant program for greenhouse gas emissions inventory and regulating coal combustion residuals. She also filed bills which sought to require lead testing in schoolchildren, increase the minimum wage, mandate all elections be conducted by mail, and repeal the state’s right to work law.

None of the legislation Boy introduced was passed into law until the 2025 session, when two of her bills were signed by Republican Gov. Mike Braun. Her bill expanding the definition of emergency medication to include overdose reversal drugs and removing the supplemental registration fee for electric vehicles from motor driven cycles passed with strong bipartisan support.

“This work has been both challenging and deeply rewarding,” Boy said in her statement. “I am especially proud of the work we have done together to protect Indiana’s natural environment, strengthen public health and safety, and give a voice to those who too often go unheard. Sometimes those attempts were unsuccessful, but they called attention to those issues. Getting two of my bills signed into law this past session, HEA 1376 and HEA 1380, was a milestone that reminded me how collaboration and persistence can lead to real results for our communities.”

House Democratic leader Phil GiaQuinta, D-Fort Wayne, credited Boy with “creating a better state” for all Hoosiers.

“It has been a pleasure to work alongside Rep. Boy for the past seven years,” GiaQuinta said in a statement. “During that time, she fought for vulnerable Hoosiers, worked to protect Indiana’s environment and enhanced public health and safety throughout our state.”

Boy, a college graduate with a bachelor’s degree in English, has been a strong proponent of education, believing “education is never wasted,” according to her biography. She was a union worker and, with her husband, owned a small secretarial/data management business from 1988 until just after his death in 2016.

The experience of caring for her husband, who became a quadriplegic after a car accident, taught Boy about the “desperate need” for Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security, according to her biography. She credited the Affordable Care Act with helping her and her husband manage his medical bills and keep them from declaring bankruptcy.

Boy is a member of the League of Women Voters and the LaPorte County Chapter of the NAACP.

In contrast to recent years, Boy has so far been the only state lawmaker to leave the General Assembly in 2025.

Last year, three lawmakers – Democratic Reps. David Vinzant and Wendy Dant Chesser, and Democratic Sen. La Keisha Jackson – were elected in a party caucus to fill the vacant seats of former legislators. Vinzant was defeated in the November 2024 election by his caucus opponent, Mark Spencer. In 2023, five lawmakers – Republican Reps. Lori Goss-Reaves and Alex Zimmerman, and Republican Sens. Randy Maxwell, Greg Goode and Cyndi Carrasco – were caucused into the legislature.

Also, three representatives did not run for re-election in 2024. Republicans Randy Lyness, of West Harrison, and Denny Zent, of Angola, retired last year after their terms ended while Democrat Ryan Hatfield, D-Evansville, decided to forgo another run for the legislature in order to enter the race for Vanderburgh County Circuit Court Judge, which he won.

The process and date for selecting an individual to serve the remainder of Boy’s term has not been announced.

According to a list obtained by Reuters, the Department of Energy (DOE) is reviewing awards across a wide array of sectors, from auto manufacturing to direct air capture hubs. Among the proposed cancellations are two major direct air capture (DAC) hub awards given during the Biden administration, including one involving oil company Occidental.

Other high-profile projects under threat include:

A $500 million grant to General Motors to convert its Lansing Grand River plant in Michigan for EV production.

$335 million for Stellantis to convert the shuttered Belvidere, Illinois plant to build mid-size electric trucks.

$250 million for Stellantis to repurpose its Indiana Transmission plant to produce EV components.

Smaller awards such as $32 million to Hyundai Mobis (for plug-in hybrid components), $89 million to Harley-Davidson (EV motorcycles), $80 million to Blue Bird (electric school buses), and $75 million to Cummins (zero-emission powertrains).

$208 million for the Volvo Group to upgrade EV production capacity in plants across Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania.

Last week, the DOE moved to cancel another $7.56 billion across 321 financial awards in 223 clean-energy projects, citing concerns that many do not offer sufficient returns to taxpayers or align with national energy priorities.

There was a strong alignment between the projects that were targeted last week and states governed by Democrats or that voted Democratic in recent elections. White House budget director Russ Vought flagged that the climate-related funding would be terminated in 16 Democrat-led states, including California and New York.

Critics argue these moves reflect political motivations, rather than purely economic judgments. “This is yet another blow by the Trump administration against innovative technology, jobs and the clean energy needed to meet skyrocketing demand,” said Jackie Wong of the Natural Resources Defense Council.

This wave of rescissions builds on even earlier efforts by this administration. In May 2025, the DOE cancelled 24 clean energy projects totaling over $3.7 billion, focused heavily on carbon capture, industrial decarbonization, and hydrogen infrastructure.

Among those earlier cuts were $331 million for a carbon-reduction olefins project at Exxon’s Baytown, $500 million to Heidelberg Materials in Louisiana, and $375 million to Eastman Chemical in Texas.

DOE maintains that these decisions are driven by a new internal policy launched in May 2025. The policy, “Ensuring Responsibility for Financial Assistance”, requires case-by-case reviews, additional documentation from awardees, and stricter economic viability standards.

The optics of cutting direct air capture and carbon capture projects may create tension with the fossil fuel sector’s interest in carbon reinjection and enhanced oil recovery. DAC projects, in particular, have found support from oil and gas companies, because captured CO? can be channeled into existing fields.

About the Lawsuit

Dow and certain of its executives are charged with failing to disclose material information during the Class Period, violating federal securities laws.

On July 24, 2025, the Company disclosed a 2Q 2025 non-GAAP loss per share of $0.42, much larger than the approximate $0.17 to $0.18 per share loss expected by analysts, and net sales of $10.1 billion, representing a 7.3% year-over-year decline and missing consensus estimates by $130 million, “reflecting declines in all operating segments” due in part to “the lower-for-longer earnings environment that our industry is facing, amplified by recent trade and tariff uncertainties.” Further, the Company disclosed that it was cutting its dividend in half, from $0.70 per share to only $0.35 per share, citing the need for “financial flexibility amidst a persistently challenging macroeconomic environment.”

On this news, the price of Dow’s shares fell $5.30 per share, or 17.45%, to close at $25.07 per share on July 24, 2025.

The case is Sarti v. Dow Inc., No. 25-cv-12744.

The newest developments include plans for hundreds of housing options with apartments, homes and a hotel, in addition to the opening of a data center and an expansion to Merck Animal Health’s facility.

De Soto is a town of about 6,500 people, so the planned hiring of 4,000 people at Panasonic, in addition to new housing and other businesses coming to town, means at least an additional 60% of people spending time at local businesses and using roads and other town infrastructure. Some residents are coping with the changes to the town’s character and desire for more information about environmental impacts from new development.

De Soto Mayor Rick Walker said he is confident Panasonic will meet its obligations and this his opinion about the project hasn’t changed.

“It was good for the city when we first saw it. It’s still good for the city,” he said. “I mean, it’s a generation worth of improvements that were built in a span of three years, and that’s just completely unimaginable that we would have been able to do that. But it’s happened and it’s here and no regrets, no second thoughts.”

The $4 billion Panasonic plant was expected to reach full production by March 2027 but reports suggest that goal has been delayed due to the dropping electric car sales and federal policies that don’t support green energy.

Sarah King, Panasonic Energy chief people officer, and Panasonic spokesperson Alison Klooster did not respond directly to questions about when full production would begin but said they are still planning to reach the original planned output.

“I think it’s something similar to how we opened in July, like yeah, I believe our initial goal was quarter one of 2025. It was a few months later, but we did open and we’re up and running,” Klooster said.

Many factors are at play, making it difficult to provide a specific timeline, she said. Hiring sustainability and construction timing are some of those factors, Klooster added.

She said the plant just sent out its millionth battery last month.

“People want things to happen on different timelines sometimes, but it’s happening on the timeline that we can sustain in the community and make sure that we make a lasting, positive impact,” Klooster said.

The factory has hired just over 1,200 employees, including production workers and support staff, and is still on track for 4,000 total employees, King said.

It’s also dependent on apprenticeship programs and time needed to get workers ready, she said.

“We’re finding that these programs are so strong that people are able to actually come in and get to work faster than what we really thought that they were going to be,” she said.

King said employees are still being hired from within a 50-mile radius of De Soto.

Panasonic’s impact

De Soto’s 2023 Panasonic development agreement included a tax increment financing district for the company, which uses property tax collected from the increased value of the development to pay for costs associated with needed infrastructure improvements.

The agreement provided about $229 million for public infrastructure projects like roadway construction, water treatment storage, sewer treatment and fire safety projects.

Most of the infrastructure projects included in the agreement are either almost done or will be done in early 2026, Walker said.

The agreement also noted that in order to receive the tax increment financing funding, Panasonic must invest at least $1 billion and operate the facility that employs 2,500 full-time employees.

Walker said he’s spoken with Lt. Governor David Toland and others from the Kansas Department of Commerce about what De Soto projects mean for the greater Kansas economy. De Soto remains a key part in attracting business to Kansas, he said.

“When you’re sitting on the sidelines and you’ve adjusted maybe to Panasonic coming and then another big project comes, that seems like whiplash,” Walker said. “But these projects have been a long time coming.”

De Soto City Council President Rob Daniels said community response to all the developments is mixed, but most residents acknowledge that change was coming.

Development on the former Sunflower Ammunition Plant was going to happen with or without Panasonic, Daniels said.

“You don’t spend a billion dollars or more cleaning up a site for it to sit and be nothing,” he said.

He said the development is good for the community, and also noted that EV sales slowing doesn’t mean the industry is dying off.

All these projects are to the benefit of the community, whether it’s getting a new community center without having to raise taxes or continuing to lower the city’s portion of property tax bills, he said.

Future data center

The city council recently approved a development agreement with Mount Sunflower LLC for a $3.1 billion data center at Flint Commerce Center south of Kansas Highway 10, which runs through De Soto’s south side.

The four buildings would total approximately 1.14 million square feet with construction targeted to start this spring, Walker said. The project won’t be completed until around 2035.

The project will use industrial revenue bonds, which enable property tax abatements and construction sales tax exemptions.

The center itself won’t bring a lot of jobs, but construction will bring workers to the area, which will increase retail activity, Walker said.

The city will also receive franchise fees from the center’s electricity use once it is up and running, he said.

Walker said that although data centers are not the right fit for everywhere, this spot was already appropriately zoned and will be a “less intense use” than previously envisioned. Originally, the plan was to have another 8 million square feet in addition to the already existing building, with possibly 1,000 employees and truck docks, he said.

The data center will ultimately be around 100 employees and will have significantly less traffic and noise impacts than previously planned for, he said.

Residents spoke at a city council meeting in August expressing concerns about the project’s environmental impacts, especially water use.

Martin Boyda, a resident of Kansas City, Kansas, said he has concerns about the water and electricity usage necessary for a data center.

He said he has wondered if the city has the infrastructure necessary to make this center possible. He also said he is an avid user of the river and has concerns about ecological impacts of increased water being pulled from it.

“We hear about the millions of gallons a day that these data centers use, and that brings concern to me, and it would be nice to get some information about whether we have the capacity ecologically to support a situation like this,” he said.

Walker said Kansas is one of the greener power producing states in the country, making it a better place for this type of center. He also said this project would have less storm water runoff because of less impervious surfaces with this development. The city will work with the Kansas Department of Health and Environment throughout the process to ensure they are abiding by state environmental standards, Walker said.

“Data centers are a necessary part of the infrastructure,” Walker said. “There are environmental issues associated with it, but it’s true for any development, and I think that given what this project brings, the environmental concerns can be planned in the process, mitigated. We rely on our planning process, along with KDHE and their permitting to ensure that we’re not creating an adverse impact for our community.”

Residents have shared concerns about the electricity and water needed for the data center, but the facility will not make residents’ bills higher, he said.

Walker said the city will work to make sure the facility is using best practice for efficient water use, but also said it is in their best interest to use less in order to spend less.

Evergy has planned for the power necessary, and the Kansas Corporation Commission has instituted rules that say heavy users that put strains on the system will pay more, Walker said.

The city has the capacity to provide the water necessary without causing adverse impacts on the area, he said.

De Soto resident Dally Holloway said with all the growth in De Soto, many residents feel as if they weren’t getting clear answers about what was happening. More people started wanting more information about development, she said.

“They don’t seem to like the idea of a multibillion dollar corporation that we don’t even know who it is receiving what citizens feel is tax-free opportunities to build on land without citizen input,” Holloway said.

Pam and Doug Ebert, De Soto residents and owners of the Cedar Lane Bed and Breakfast, described their feelings toward recent development as “cautiously pleased.”

More people and more businesses coming to town is a plus, but there’s a way to expand while keeping the small town-feel and keeping any strain off the existing community, they said.

Doug Ebert said he is glad to see other industries go into the area in case EV sales slow. His other concerns are about increased traffic in town, but said the additional money for road upkeep and other ancillary businesses coming to town are a positive.

“Well, when you’ve got more people working in an area, the infrastructure around that area does get built up,” he said.

Other development

Merck Animal Health announced earlier this year a $895 million expansion with plans to create 200 new jobs.

Merck will invest $860 million in its existing facility and another $35 million its research and development lab. It’ll be about 200,000 square feet once expanded.

Walker said Merck has submitted construction documents to city staff for them to review and seem to be on track to get permits completed for construction to start in the spring, he said.

De Soto is also continuing to plan for GRATA Development’s Limestone project. The mixed-use project has gone through the first step after the city council approved an incentive package and new zoning for the area.

The project includes a new hotel with 75% tax abatement for 10 years, and around 100 homes part of a reinvestment housing incentive district. The additional homes will help with the city’s limited housing supply, Walker said. The project also includes a 350-unit multifamily residential development that will also receive 75% tax abatement for 10 years, according to the meeting agenda.

De Soto resident Toni Caldwell said she tries to look at development from both sides — but ultimately is sad to see the changes coming to town. She also has concerns about transparency surrounding the projects, traffic and tax abatements, she said.

Caldwell said she knew the town was struggling economically, and had problems keeping up with infrastructure needs. That’s something that Panasonic has helped with, she said, but she still has concerns about its environmental impacts.

She said it’s disappointing to see changes to the community she’s lived in for so long but that she knows change was inevitable with the open land.

“You really have to look at both sides of it, and it’s hard to do when it’s a community you love and it’s changing, and so it makes it very difficult,” she said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-84/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_0135-1024x5631759844938.jpg?h=69549390&itok=_KiExzUG,N,,2025-10-07 22:02:42.307873

Nightpeak Energy’s 150-MW Bocanova Power battery array in Brazoria County achieved commercial operation late this summer. The battery project is capable of two-hour duration and helping respond to the Houston area’s peak capacity needs.

""This battery storage project will enhance grid reliability in the Alvin area while continuing to support integrating renewable energy,” Cary Perrin, president and CEO of the Northern Brazoria County Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement. “I believe we need energy storage now more than ever for its pivotal role in reducing strain on the grid while meeting fast-growing power demand in Texas and Brazoria County.""

The project uses Tesla's Megapack 2 XL battery storage systems manufactured in Lathrop, California. The facility operates under a long-term power purchase agreement with an investment grade power purchaser.

Texas is the nation’s leader in new battery storage and has tripled its installed capacity to more than 9 GW in just the past two years, according to reports. Energy storage helps balance the intermittency of renewable energy assets on the grid and offers added dispatchable power on the Electric Reliability Council of Texas system, which has been vulnerable to outages and peak demand challenges in the past.

“Unprecedented AI data center and manufacturing growth has only accelerated the need for dispatchable capacity resources,” said Paris Hays, Co-founder and CEO/CDO, Nightpeak Energy. “Nightpeak now owns and operates 240 MW of battery storage and natural gas generation facilities, with more energy infrastructure projects on the way in Texas and in the Western U.S.""

The News

The Trump administration’s recent decision to rescind nearly $8 billion in funding for innovative energy projects could drive tech and fossil fuel companies to look outside the US for technologies both industries are keen to make use of.

The cuts affected more than 300 projects that received funding from the Department of Energy under the Biden administration, and overwhelmingly targeted projects located in majority-Democrat states.

One of the major casualties of the cuts was carbon removal: About $50 million in funding was rescinded for a range of projects tinkering with different methods for pulling CO2 from the atmosphere. That may come as little surprise, given President Donald Trump’s clear disinterest in mitigating climate change. But while the administration may be skeptical about the merits of such projects for their climate bona fides, carbon removal is nonetheless a growing global industry, driven in large part by interest from high-emissions industries like tech and oil. If the US no longer welcomes it, the carbon removal companies involved seem willing and able to look for a home elsewhere.

One company affected by the cuts was the California startup CarbonCapture Inc., which saw about $16 million withdrawn from three carbon removal projects it was involved in. CarbonCapture was an early beneficiary of the race by tech companies to buy carbon removal credits as a way of erasing their historic emissions, signing a deal with Microsoft back in 2023. But without the federal funding, those three projects — one each in California, Illinois, and Louisiana — are now “dead,” CEO Adrian Corless told Semafor. Even before the cuts, because of the Trump administration’s volatile approach to energy policy, Corless had already made a decision to relocate the company’s biggest-ever pilot plant from Arizona to Canada.

“What happened last week reinforced that we made the right decision and that for the foreseeable future, the US isn’t going to be where we focus our business,” he said. “The US developed itself into, by far, the leader in carbon removal over the past eight or so years. Now it would appear that [the Trump administration] is quite comfortable ceding that leadership role and just stepping away from it.”

Tim’s view

The DOE funding cuts are the latest sign the administration is willing to put its animosity toward Democrats and anything that smacks of climate action above opportunities to lead in promising new industries.

Wind and solar energy were targeted early on, along with electric vehicles. The latest cuts go further, yanking support for low-carbon hydrogen, virtual power plants, and electric grid improvements in addition to carbon removal. The VPP and grid cuts will work against the administration’s goal of lowering retail power prices. And the hydrogen and carbon removal cuts will hurt nascent technologies that serve the long-term interests of the oil and gas industry. Capturing, transporting, and storing carbon are natural extensions of oil companies’ traditional engineering skillsets. Captured carbon can also be used to push more oil out of wells.

AD

Tech companies including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, meanwhile, have committed to buying millions of dollars in carbon removal credits as a cornerstone of their climate strategies, which haven’t changed despite the shifting political winds in the US. Carbon removal is also one of the few corners of cleantech where China has yet to dominate, Corless said, leaving an opening for other countries to seize. Altogether, carbon removal could evolve into a $1.2 trillion industry by 2050, according to a McKinsey forecast.

“What’s most at stake with these funding cuts is American competitiveness, and the economic benefits that come with being a leader in carbon management,” said Ben Rubin, executive director of the Carbon Business Council, an advocacy group. “An increasing number of companies are looking to other regions to deploy.”

Room for Disagreement

The administration didn’t offer a rationale for how it chose the specific projects to have their funding canceled, but it’s reasonable to be skeptical of how much of a climate benefit carbon removal will be able to make. Out of roughly 9 billion tons of CO2 that need to be removed annually from the atmosphere until 2050 to keep temperatures in line with the Paris Agreement, only about 2 billion are currently being removed, mostly by nature-based solutions like reforestation. Tech-heavy approaches like direct air capture, the method employed by CarbonCapture Inc., account for well below 1 million tons per year. One high-profile DAC project currently produces more CO2 than it captures.

And although Energy Secretary Chris Wright warned that more project cancellations are forthcoming, for now some of the carbon removal projects most closely linked to Big Oil, including projects being run by Chevron and Occidental Petroleum, haven’t faced the ax. And the 45Q tax credit for carbon capture was actually expanded, not eliminated, in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Notable

The Trump administration’s interference with wind projects is “very damaging,” the head of Shell’s US division said. “However far the pendulum swings one way, it’s likely that it’s going to swing just as far the other way,” Colette Hirstius, president of Shell USA, told the Financial Times.

The World

at a Glance

The price of gold topped $4,000 per ounce for the first time on Tuesday, a reflection of the unease plaguing both investors and central banks.

Gold is widely seen as a safe haven asset during turbulent times, and analysts attribute the latest surge to a desire among financiers to move away from US assets, even as stocks have hit new highs: The country’s government shutdown, delaying the release of official government economic data, has particularly heightened anxiety. Billionaire investor Ray Dalio compared the current environment to the inflation-heavy early 1970s, calling gold an “excellent diversifier,” although Bank of America warned of “uptrend exhaustion.”

Jewelry companies have begun raising the alarm over possible price increases afflicting already-weary consumers.

This year has been defined by global trade turbulence, yet more goods are set to move across borders in 2025 than in 2024, according to new World Trade Organization estimates.

After US President Donald Trump unveiled sky-high tariffs in April, the WTO forecast that global trade would contract by 0.2%; but many duties have since come down, while purchases of AI-related equipment — semiconductors, computers, cloud servers — have propped up cross-border commerce.

The world’s trading system “has been knocked, it’s been battered, but it is showing very strong resilience at the core,” WTO chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said at a recent Semafor event. Still, the organization slashed its 2026 outlook, forecasting the world’s economy will cool.

Israel marked the anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks that triggered the conflict that has reshaped the Middle East.

The country has won since major victories against regional enemies, including Iran and Hezbollah, but at a huge cost: 67,000 Palestinians have been killed, famine has taken hold in Gaza, and Israel is increasingly isolated.

Other countries’ politics have been affected, too. Zohran Mamdani is likely to be the next mayor of New York City in large part because of his support for Palestinian rights, while governments across Europe have accelerated support for a Palestinian state.

A truce may finally be close, with Israeli and Hamas leaders nearing a ceasefire at talks brokered by US President Donald Trump.

US President Donald Trump met Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Tuesday, with the countries at loggerheads over trade and Trump’s comments about annexing the country’s northern neighbor.

Canada is the only G7 country not to have reached a trade deal with the US this year; a North American free trade agreement protects Ottawa from some tariffs, but it is still subject to punishing steel duties, among others.

Carney promised to be tough on Trump but Canadian firms are shedding jobs and exports are down. The Canadian leader must walk a tightrope: Trump is deeply unpopular north of the border after repeatedly suggesting making Canada the “51st state.” Polls found that 60% of Canadians say they can never fully trust the US again.

AI-powered science is advancing so quickly that it may soon make a discovery worthy of a Nobel Prize without human intervention, scientists predicted.

The Nobel Turing Challenge was established in 2016 to offer a prize for a machine that can achieve a discovery equivalent to the most cutting-edge human research. For a discovery to count, the AI has to oversee the entire project, from hypothesis generation to experiment design to data analysis. Machines are already assisting human researchers in almost every step of that process, but being truly autonomous is still a leap forward.

“It’s almost certain” that AI will reach that level eventually, one researcher told Nature: “The question is if it will take 50 years or 10.”

The Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded for research that showed the impact of quantum mechanics on everyday-sized objects.

Quantum effects were known at the level of atoms, but in the 1980s John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret, and John M. Martinis showed that at very low temperatures, the strange behavior — such as particles moving directly through apparently impassable barriers — could be demonstrated in objects large enough to be held in the hand.

The discovery paved the way for quantum computing and other quantum technologies, and opened the door to several multi-billion-dollar industries. One winner of yesterday’s Physiology prize is yet to be contacted, as he is off the grid, “living his best life” hiking in Idaho.

US President Donald Trump agreed to meet his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva after a “very good” call, marking a thaw in relations that were at their worst in decades.

Trump slapped a 50% tariff on Brasília — despite the US having a trade surplus with Brazil — over what he called a “witch hunt” against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally convicted over a coup plot. Analysts said the call pointed at Trump breaking with Bolsonaro, who doesn’t have a clear path back to the presidency.

Lula welcomed the shift, calling on former spats to be forgotten: “Neither the American nor the Brazilian people can suffer because of our mistakes,” he told TV Mirante.

A Sudanese militia leader was found guilty of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Darfur region 20 years ago, in a conflict that became a prelude to the country’s present-day disaster.

Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman was a leader of the Janjaweed militia, which killed hundreds of thousands of members of Darfur’s non-Arab population in the early 2000s, sparking one of the world’s gravest and most enduring humanitarian crises.

After the war, many Janjaweed fighters joined the Rapid Support Forces, one of the warring parties in Sudan’s current civil war. The RSF is once again besieging Darfur, putting millions of lives at risk, with the conflict sparking the first declaration of famine globally in years.

Renewable energy surpassed coal as the world’s primary source of electricity in the first half of 2025, according to new data from the energy think tank Ember. Solar power led the charge, covering 83% of the increase in electricity demand.

Ember described the moment as a “crucial turning point,” whereby clean power can keep pace with rapidly growing energy needs, particularly as the world faces the huge increase in power necessary to fuel the AI boom.

However, the think tank warned that there are significant regional differences behind the numbers; new data from the International Energy Agency revised renewable energy growth in the US by 2030 down by half. It also suggested that the pace of renewables adoption in China — the current largest renewables growth market globally — could temper, the Financial Times reported.

Renewables are expected to boom elsewhere, however: Pakistan imported enough solar panels in 2024 to generate around a third of the country’s current power generation capacity, the BBC said. And in Africa, solar panel imports are up 60% in the year to June compared with the same period last year.

OpenAI inked a deal with chip designer AMD to collaborate on AI data centers, in a challenge to semiconductor giant Nvidia.

The deal, which caused AMD’s stock to soar, reflects the tech sector’s intensifying quest for computing power and ultimately banks on a “near-limitless demand for AI,” WIRED wrote: Running AMD’s processors will match the energy needs of 5 million American homes. The US has become “one big bet on AI,” as optimism over the sector props up the economy, one analyst wrote.

Driving that bet is OpenAI, whose CEO Sam Altman has proven to be a prolific dealmaker. The company also has agreements with firms including Nvidia and Oracle — pacts that have raised fears of an AI bubble.

Israel and Hamas began indirect negotiations through Arab mediators in Egypt Monday on a Gaza peace plan, raising the possibility of a potential end to the brutal war on the eve of its two-year anniversary.

Hamas said it agrees to parts of a 20-point US peace plan, including the release of all remaining Israeli hostages, but has not acknowledged other demands, including full disarmament and its permanent exclusion from governing the enclave.

Though US President Donald Trump ordered Israel to halt its attacks, it continued to pound Gaza Monday. Trump has also threatened “complete obliteration” of Hamas if it insists on staying in power.

Even as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu looks to take credit for the emerging deal, it has become clear that Trump was “the one calling the shots,” The New York Times wrote. On Sunday night, the president exhorted negotiators to “MOVE FAST,” adding that he expected the first phase of the deal to unfold this week.

A US judge blocked the government from deploying troops to Oregon state, spotlighting the growing role of the courts in the country’s politics.

The latest order, issued late on Sunday, comes as the Trump administration looks to deploy military forces to Democrat-led cities nationwide: The White House says they are necessary to combat alleged lawlessness; Democrats argue their constituents are being targeted.

The latest decision came on the eve of the Supreme Court beginning a new term that analysts say will include significant new tests of presidential power, including over the administration’s use of tariffs, attempted curbs on birthright citizenship, and efforts to fire officials from independent government agencies.

France’s prime minister resigned less than a month after taking office, plunging the country deeper into a seemingly intractable political crisis.

Sébastien Lecornu — President Emmanuel Macron’s seventh premier — quit following widespread criticism over his new cabinet, which was largely unchanged from that of the prior government.

His departure showcases the short-term challenge facing Macron’s ministers, who have repeatedly failed to pass a budget in the face of far-right and far-left opposition, and the longer-term fear over the rise of the country’s main nationalist, anti-immigration party, which is topping opinion polls.

The impasse has left investors wary: A recent Deutsche Bank survey pegged France as the country most likely to face a government bond crisis.

Japanese stocks surged after the country’s ruling party chose its next leader — and likely next prime minister — amid growing investor buoyancy over prospects for one of the world’s largest economies.

The LDP, which has ruled Japan largely uninterrupted since World War II, put Sanae Takaichi on track to be the country’s first female prime minister.

She inherits a dizzying array of challenges, including a fast-aging population and worries over Chinese aggression. Yet economists note the country has removed major barriers to business, manufacturers are feeling more upbeat, and monetary policy is normalizing: The Nikkei 225 index hit a record following Takaichi’s selection. “We are bullish on Japan,” Apollo’s chief economist wrote.

China and India agreed to restart direct flights after a five-year hiatus, the latest sign of thawing relations between the world’s most populous nations. New Delhi said flights between Kolkata and Guangzhou would restart this month for the first time since border clashes in 2020.

The decision comes just months after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made his first visit to Beijing in seven years, with the countries’ leaders drawing closer, particularly after US President Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on India, upending what had been a burgeoning bilateral partnership. Those levies were “one of the biggest shocks that India has ever got,” an expert said, forcing New Delhi to seek new allies.

Discoveries about how our immune systems avoid attacking our own bodies — research which helped create new pathways for treating autoimmune diseases — won the 2025 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.

T-cells are designed to attack proteins in pathogens, but those proteins are often similar to our body’s own proteins. Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi discovered that the immune system has “self-tolerance” safeguards which prevent it from attacking our own cells.

Crucially, the findings also helped create new cancer treatments: Cancer cells use the body’s self-tolerance to hide, and immunotherapy is designed to take the brakes off and allow the immune system to attack those cells.

Japan is on track to have its first female prime minister.

A former economic security minister who cites Margaret Thatcher as her hero, Sanae Takaichi was elected to lead Japan’s governing LDP, which has ruled the country almost continuously since World War II but is mired in an array of crises.

Among her top priorities is tackling inflation — a relatively new problem given Japan’s decades of falling prices — making her selection a worrying one for investors: Takaichi will likely push for aggressive spending and looser monetary policy in a bid to boost the economy.

She will also pull Japan’s politics further to the right, mirroring a trend of resurgent populist conservatism worldwide, The Wall Street Journal wrote.

The world’s major oil producers agreed to raise output again, a move that raised fears of a supply glut and could further dampen prices.

OPEC+ is looking to reclaim market share lost to US shale producers and maintain discipline within the group — some members stand accused of violating quotas — while the group’s heavyweight member, Saudi Arabia, is likely hoping that lower prices will please US President Donald Trump.

Still, the increase was a relatively small one, a careful step taken “after witnessing how nervous the market had become,” one analyst said.

“The real test will come when fundamentals and politics shift again.” High geopolitical volatility makes predicting the market’s future even more difficult than usual, a Reuters columnist argued.

US President Donald Trump is considering a bailout of at least $10 billion to help the country’s soybean farmers survive a boycott from China.

The humble soybean has become a flashpoint in the trade war between the world’s two largest economies after Beijing ceased all purchases from the US.

The possible aid from Washington reflects China’s leverage in talks with the US, similar to how Beijing used rare-earth export curbs to extract trade concessions from Washington, analysts said.

China is now reportedly pushing for the White House to roll back national-security restrictions on Chinese investments in the US.

Birds of different species can understand each other’s alarm calls warning of cuckoos.

Brood parasites such as cuckoos lay their eggs in other birds’ nests, tricking the hosts into caring for their offspring at the expense of their own.

Research found that 21 bird species across four continents all make similar “whining” vocalizations when they spot a brood parasite, and when played recordings of other species’ calls, they all recognize them and react by mobbing the invader.

One researcher told New Scientist that the calls, referring to external objects in the world rather than internal states such as fear or excitement, “could be the first stepping stone towards language” and that animal communication and human language were on a spectrum.

A controversial musical depicting the Spanish conquest of Mexico has ignited a transatlantic debate over Latin American history and identity.

Centering on conquistador Hernán Cortés and his Nahuatl translator, Malinche ostensibly celebrates mestizaje, or racial mixing, but has been accused of promoting “outdated, racist notions” regarding Aztec rituals, and the idea that colonization benefited indigenous people.

Foreign Policy called the show, currently playing in Mexico City, an “obscenely romanticized” “anti-Hamilton,” while conservatives complained that a historical priest was initially portrayed in drag.

Malinche’s producer, for his part, hoped the debate would “bring people to come and judge” for themselves.

The brouhaha points to real wounds: Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum declined to invite Spain’s king to her inauguration after he failed to apologize for the conquest.

The US military struck another alleged narcotics vessel off the coast of Venezuela Friday, killing four, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said.

The strike — at least the fourth such attack — brings the total number of alleged smugglers killed by the US in recent weeks to at least 18.

Hegseth wrote on X that he directed the lethal strike, carried out in international waters, on a “vessel transporting substantial amounts of narcotics — headed to America to poison our people.”

It came after the White House informed Congress this week that the country was engaged in “armed conflict” with drug cartels, which the administration has designated as terrorist organizations, The New York Times reported.

The strikes have raised tensions with Caracas, which fears a full-scale invasion, as President Donald Trump reportedly weighs strikes inside the country.

Critics have questioned the legality of the campaign, with one commentator accusing Trump of emulating “the worst excesses” of US policy in Latin America.

Hamas said it agreed to release all remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza under a framework proposed by US President Donald Trump, stating that it “affirms its readiness to immediately enter into negotiations” to discuss the details.

Earlier on Friday, Trump set a new weekend deadline for Hamas to agree to a peace deal on the enclave’s future, calling it the militant group’s “last chance.” Hamas’ statement suggested the group is seeking changes to the proposal, however, and that a deal has not yet been agreed to.

If no deal is reached by 6:00 pm Sunday Eastern time, “all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas,” Trump wrote in a social media post earlier on Friday.

The Trump administration’s 20-point plan, backed by Israel, demands an immediate ceasefire, the return of all hostages, the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, and the disarmament of Hamas — a condition the group has previously rejected. Hamas said on Wednesday that it was reviewing the proposal.

The plan also provides for a transitional authority run by an international group chaired by Trump, with members including former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.

Venezuela said it had detected five US fighter jets flying near its Caribbean coast, which Caracas said amounted to “provocation,” in the latest clash between the countries.

Tensions have been rising between the US and Venezuela for months, and Washington recently struck alleged drug trafficking boats off the coast of Venezuela.

Fears are growing among Venezuela’s leadership that the true goal of the US deployment is toppling the autocratic regime of President Nicolás Maduro, though some warn a military intervention could further destabilize the country. “Anyone who cares about democracy and human rights wants the Maduro dictatorship to end,” an expert at the Council on Foreign Relations said, but this strategy is “very unlikely” to make that happen.

Japan will on Saturday elect its new leader, with a millennial minister poised to become prime minister of the rapidly aging nation.

Shinjiro Koizumi, who at 44 would become Japan’s youngest leader in a century, is competing with four other candidates to head the ruling Liberal Democratic Party — which has governed Japan for most of the past 70 years — after the resignation of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba following two major election losses. Agriculture minister Koizumi, who bills himself a consensus builder, faces his toughest challenge in Sanae Takaichi, a conservative hardliner who would become the country’s first female ruler if she wins. But experts fear neither candidate offers Japan a clear vision to solve an array of challenges at home and abroad.

Munich airport shut down overnight after a series of drone sightings, the latest disruption to European airspace after similar events in Oslo and Copenhagen.

Thousands of passengers on dozens of flights were affected, with some having to sleep in the airport. The sightings follow a series of Russian incursions into NATO airspace, but Moscow denied responsibility for the Munich drones. Still, European leaders suggested the Kremlin was behind earlier drone sightings, and called for strengthened defenses.

Russia appears to be stepping up its hybrid warfare: British officials said Moscow-backed cyberattacks and sabotage were on the rise, and the Kremlin regularly targets UK satellites. A former British intelligence chief said this week that Britain may be “already at war with Russia.”

A woman was named Archbishop of Canterbury for the first time in the role’s 1,400-year history.

Sarah Mullally will become the spiritual leader of the Anglican Church in January, a year after her predecessor resigned in a safeguarding scandal.

The first archbishop was appointed in 597 AD, but the role took on extra significance when Henry VIII broke with Rome in 1534.

While Anglicanism is on the decline in Britain, it is growing worldwide — nearly 60% of adherents are in Africa, where followers are much more religiously conservative than in Britain.

The communion, already tested by divisions over attitudes towards LGBTQ+ people, will be strained further by Mullally’s appointment: Many African Anglican churches refuse to ordain female priests.

Taylor Swift released her 12th original album, The Life of a Showgirl, which is expected to break new records to further cement the pop queen’s dominance.

Swift has been “pop’s alpha figure for more than a decade,” The New York Times noted, and in the 18 months since her last release, The Tortured Poets Department, Swift has reached new heights of success — and fame. Her Eras Tour was the most lucrative in history, she bought back ownership of her early albums’ master recordings, and she got engaged.

Anticipation for Showgirl has been “off the charts,” Forbes reported, with more than 5 million pre-saves on Spotify — the most ever — and it is “almost a foregone conclusion” that Swift will become the first female artist to break 100 million career album sales.

Two people have died and three others are in a serious condition after a car ramming and knife attack outside a synagogue in Manchester, UK, on Thursday. The suspect is also believed to have been killed after being shot by police, the BBC reported.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer returned early from a meeting of European leaders in Copenhagen to chair the government’s emergency response group, saying that he was “appalled” by the incident. Security is being stepped up at Jewish sites across the country.

The attack, which took place on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, comes amid a sharp rise in anti-Semitic assaults in the US and Europe as the Israel-Hamas war nears the two-year mark.

France and Germany have seen a surge in incidents, while two staff at the Israeli embassy in Washington DC were shot dead in May, and an attack injured 12 in Colorado weeks later.

Israeli naval ships intercepted a flotilla attempting to deliver aid to Gaza and detained several activists, including Greta Thunberg.

The “Global Sumud Flotilla” of more than 40 vessels set sail in September, intending to breach Israel’s naval blockade of the enclave, where the UN says a humanitarian catastrophe is underway. Israel said several vessels were taken to port, citing what it called a violation of a “lawful naval blockade,” but flotilla organizers said their boats had been illegally boarded and targeted with water cannon and drones.

The boats have become an international cause célèbre: They were escorted part-way by Italian and Spanish naval ships, and their interception has been met by protests in several European countries.","https://img.semafor.com/33dc6ed1c78c4801bde04c54a95e9011937726c0-12288x8192.jpg?rect=0,871,12288,6451&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format",N,,2025-10-08 00:59:06.992378

Nanette Barragán (CA-44) Oct. 3 introduced the Stop the Trump Electricity Price Hikes Act, legislation to reverse the Department of Energy’s action that announced the mass termination of clean energy awards on Oct.1. The cancellations, which target Democrat-led states, are a blatantly partisan and illegal attempt by Donald Trump to go after Democrat-led states during the Republicans’ government shutdown.

The bill would reinstate all financial assistance awards terminated by the Department of Energy (DOE) under the Trump Administration’s political purge of over 300 clean energy projects. These cancellations total more than $7.5 billion in funding that was lawfully approved by Congress and threaten thousands of jobs across the country.

“Trump’s Administration is gutting clean energy projects, eliminating good-paying jobs, and driving up electricity costs for families already struggling with higher bills,” said Rep. Barragán. “Electricity prices have already soared this year from the Administration’s attacks on clean energy. Instead of working to lower costs, this Administration is pulling the plug on projects that would deliver cheaper, cleaner power for households. This is a direct attack on working American families and our clean energy future.”

The bill responds directly to DOE’s Oct. 1 action, which terminated funding for projects across 16 states — including grid reliability and modernization initiatives, solar energy development, advanced battery technologies, major hydrogen hubs, and university-led research and innovation programs.

Among the projects targeted is the ARCHES Hydrogen Hub in California, an initiative for clean hydrogen development that was expected to create thousands of union jobs and reduce pollution from the Port of Los Angeles.

Conrad Schneider, Senior Director, U.S., at Clean Air Task Force said:

“DOE is slashing funding to American companies, investors, and communities across the U.S.

“Over the last several years, the U.S. has rightly invested in innovative energy projects that have supported economic growth and workforce development, strengthened global leadership, catalyzed additional investment in local economies, while positioning the country to meet rising energy demands and lowering electricity bills for consumers and businesses. Today’s move jeopardizes the investments and benefits that companies and investors have made. These sweeping funding cuts will have far-reaching consequences – with virtually no region unscathed.

“The federal government plays an essential role in addressing gaps that stall the commercialization of energy breakthroughs by providing grants and loans to accelerate innovative projects. By abruptly canceling funding for several hundred energy projects, the U.S. risks ceding American energy leadership and signals that U.S. innovation is not a priority.”

The awards cited by DOE were issued by the Offices of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Grid Deployment (GDO), Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC), Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) and Fossil Energy (FE).

The tax credit created as part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act “allowed homeowners to upgrade their electric fuse boxes as well as put solar panels on their roof, and it was a sort of uncapped tax credit of up to 30%,” said Quentin Scott, federal policy director at the Chesapeake Climate Action Network.
He said the tax credit will expire Dec. 31.
But, Scott said, the passage of the legislation dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” by President Donald Trump will phase out the tax credit by the end of the year.

The tax credit created as part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act “allowed homeowners to upgrade their electric fuse boxes as well as put solar panels on their roof, and it was a sort of uncapped tax credit of up to 30%,” said Quentin Scott, federal policy director at the Chesapeake Climate Action Network.

He said the tax credit will expire Dec. 31.

For homeowners who were on the fence about converting to solar, “that really cut down their initial cost by one third, which was exciting,” Scott said.

But, Scott said, the passage of the legislation dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” by President Donald Trump will phase out the tax credit by the end of the year.

So his advice to homeowners is to make the move — and fast.

“As long as they are able to get a contractor to start the work and complete that work before the end of this calendar year, they are able to file for this tax credit and get those discounts,” he said.

One caveat, Scott said, is that projects “have to be 100% completed and placed in service,” to qualify for the credit.

Scott said one impact of the expiration of incentives like the one for solar installation for homeowners is that “energy costs are going to go up because there’s less diverse energy being added to the grid.”

Another reason that homeowners would want to act quickly is the concern over potential delays in the supply chain, as well as the availability of contractors when it comes to scheduling and completing the work.

NEW YORK — In a year marked by withdrawals from global climate agreements, funding suspensions for clean energy projects and other measures that reverse the United States’ federal climate policy, sustainable investors are trying to find a way forward with Republicans steering both Congress and the White House.

Last month, sustainability nonprofit Ceres used Climate Week NYC as an opportunity to help find potential areas of bipartisan collaboration on investors’ environmental concerns and ability to consider ESG risks. Looking to find areas of common ground around protecting investors’ “freedom to invest” their funds, Ceres hosted a Sept. 24 mainstage session at the Nest Climate Campus, with bipartisan and center-right business advisories and advocacy groups.

Andrea Strimling Yodsampa, CEO of bipartisan climate nonprofit Deploy/US, said that climate and clean energy “have been misbranded as progressive issues,” but there is an opportunity to engage center-right groups and Congressional leaders, as well as investors and business leaders, who can help engage the current administration on the issue.

“There is no path to durable policy without bipartisan support,” Yodsampa said on one of the panels. “It has been a fact for a while, and I think that the environmental movement — which I come from — is starting to really wake up to that in a different way right now, given the current realities, and that’s a really good thing.”

Ceres CEO Mindy Lubber said “the risk has never been so clear,” as the U.S. is seeing climate impacts on insurance markets, water shortages and heat waves and severe weather events causing billion dollar impacts at increasing frequency.

However, Lubber added that there are also opportunities in this time. Former Republican Representative Carlos Curbelo, now principal at advisory firm Vocero, said that the conversation on climate risks has focused too much on the concept of “sacrifice” and what people would have to give up to support the climate fight. “As the conversation has become more about opportunity, it has become so much easier for conservatives and Republicans to embrace these issues,” Curbelo said.

“Over the years, we’ve learned that this can, and really should be, a conversation about opportunity,” Curbelo said on another Ceres-hosted panel. “And if we really embrace that and understand that what we’re talking about is making people safer, making people more prosperous, giving people more personal agency and independence.”

Brandon Arnold, executive vice president of center-right think tank the National Taxpayers Union, said laws that ban financial institutions from participating in state markets based on their ESG considerations have cost taxpayers in Oklahoma and Texas.

A federal judge issued a permanent injunction on Oklahoma’s Energy Discrimination Elimination Act last year, after groups within the state had begun flagging rising municipal borrowing costs as a result.

More than 100 anti-ESG bills were introduced in state legislatures this year, but only 11 passed through June. A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction on one of them, a Texas law targeting proxy advisers, after Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis — the world’s largest proxy advisers — sued Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to halt its implementation.

“People should be free to engage in ESG investing as individuals, as private companies and so forth, [and] they shouldn’t be forced to do so as a pension recipient,” Arnold said. “We need to kind of take the government’s thumb off the scales here, allow markets to function properly, allow individuals and businesses to operate as they see fit.”

State finance officials on both sides of the aisle were accused by BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, of “politicizing” the management of public pension funds, after Republican and Democrat officials sent dueling letters to U.S. financial institutions over the summer. Republican officials urged BlackRock and 24 other institutions to stop framing climate change as a long-term risk, while Democrat officials called for the firm and 17 other institutions to reaffirm their commitment to managing climate and other long-term risks.

Under SB 221, state agencies must conduct a greenhouse gas assessment for all fossil fuel projects, as well as for projects involving stationary combustion devices, construction and mobile engine operation, and ecological functions.
The draft document defines greenhouse gas emissions as gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases that are released into the atmosphere.
It also provides for how agencies should calculate emissions from a project based on size and project type, as well as providing both qualitative and quantitative perspectives on the secondary impacts that greenhouse gas emissions would have on the human environment.

The effort comes out of Senate Bill 221, which directed the Department of Environmental Quality to develop new guidance on greenhouse gas emission assessments in a way that prevents industry and development from becoming bogged down in regulation and litigation.

Signed by Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte, SB 221 was carried by Sen. Wylie Galt, R-Martinsdale, and drew bipartisan support from both chambers.

“Our next steps will be to develop that guidance document that will outline exactly how we will do greenhouse gas assessments for fossil fuel activities, as well as what parameters we’ll look at for non-fossil fuel activities,” Sonja Nowakowski, director of DEQ, said when the bill was signed. “These will be very open and transparent processes, and we look forward to engaging with the public and getting everyone’s input as we move forward.”

In 2025, the bill was among a suite of laws the Montana Legislature passed in response to the state Supreme Court’s decision to uphold a youth-led constitutional lawsuit that found the state could not limit analysis of greenhouse gas emissions during the environmental review process.

In a 6-1 decision in Held v. Montana, the Supreme Court affirmed the Lewis and Clark District Court order that Montana’s constitutional guarantee of a “clean and healthful environment” includes a stable climate system.

The ruling was widely panned by Republican officials across Montana. Legislative leaders told the courts to “buckle up” in response to the decision, and brought a number of bills aimed at changing the judicial system as well as addressing the Held decision and reforming the Montana Environmental Policy Act.

“In the Held v. Montana court case, they tried to twist MEPA into something it was never meant to be — a tool to deny permits and block development,” House Speaker Brandon Ler, R-Savage, said at a signing ceremony of legislation in response to Held on May 1. “With the signing of this MEPA reform package, we’re making it clear that Montana’s environmental policy is about reform decision making, not weaponizing and litigation.”

The department published its draft guidance document on Oct. 1 and is now seeking “substantive public comments” through the end of the month.

Agencies will use the document as a framework for gathering and evaluating greenhouse gas emission data and potential impacts to Montana’s environment while conducting environmental assessments and environmental impact statements required by MEPA.

Under SB 221, state agencies must conduct a greenhouse gas assessment for all fossil fuel projects, as well as for projects involving stationary combustion devices, construction and mobile engine operation, and ecological functions.

The draft document defines greenhouse gas emissions as gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases that are released into the atmosphere.

It also provides for how agencies should calculate emissions from a project based on size and project type, as well as providing both qualitative and quantitative perspectives on the secondary impacts that greenhouse gas emissions would have on the human environment.

Plaintiffs argued that Congress only permitted the EPA to repurpose uncommitted funds, not to revoke awards that had already been announced. Moreover, claimants asserted that program termination violated the Inflation Reduction and Administrative Procedure acts and sought declaratory and injunctive relief to restore the program.

Plaintiffs—Rhode Island AFL-CIO, Rhode Island Center for Justice, Solar United Neighbors, Sunpath Solar, 2KB Energy Services, Black Sun Light Sustainability, and a local homeowner—claimed the cancellation caused significant financial harm to communities and small businesses that had relied on promised grants.

In 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which granted $27 billion to the newly created Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF). From the fund, the Act carved out $7 billion for competitive grants administered through the EPA “to enable low-income…communities to…benefit from zero-emission technologies, including distributed technologies on residential rooftops, and…other greenhouse gas emission reduction activities.”

The program become known as the Solar for All program, and in April 2024 the EPA announced awards that would reach over 900,000 low-income homes. However, the program came to an abrupt halt with the passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act in July 2025, which eliminated the GGRF and Solar for All.

Following the program’s termination, Zeldin wrote on social media:

In this episode, Louie sits down with Ben DeAngelo, Principal and Founder of Operation Future and former Director of the Office of Climate Adaptation and Sustainability at the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Fresh from launching his new consultancy, Ben reflects on his decades-long federal career, as well as key milestones in the climate fight — from helping craft the landmark 2009 Endangerment Finding to coordinating the EPA’s first adaptation strategy.

He shares his fresh perspective from outside government, including why municipal bonds might be a sleeping giant for local adaptation finance, how non-federal actors are keeping the climate agenda alive despite political headwinds, and why private actors may have more latitude to innovate on climate then their peers in the public sector.

Plus, he unpacks what’s next for Operation Future — and how he plans to stay in the fight.

Kaufman, Anna Demeo",,,,,https://www.latitudemedia.com/news/theres-a-second-doe-project-cancellation-list/,"Sources who spoke with Latitude Media said there’s ongoing confusion about the nature of this new list, and the status of the projects on it.
DOE itself has not confirmed the list’s authenticity; the office did not respond to a request for comment from Latitude Media.
The Grid Deployment Office was second-worst hit, at 45 awards totaling $3.3 billion, up from 25 awards on the initial list.
The Advanced Energy Research Projects for Energy Office — which Energy Secretary Chris Wright applauded at the department’s conference earlier this year — had just a single project on the smaller cancellation list last week.
The list does not include awards managed by the Office of Science, the Nuclear Energy Office, or the Loan Programs Office.","The Department of Energy may be planning to cancel even more awards, according to a leaked document reviewed today by Latitude Media.

Last week, the agency confirmed its plans to cancel 321 individual awards, totalling $7.5 billion and spanning six offices across the agency. But a spreadsheet currently circulating in Washington, D.C. shows 351 additional projects that the Trump administration has earmarked for termination, totaling just under $16 billion in funding.

There’s significant overlap between the two lists: 297 of last week’s 321 cancelled awards are also named in the new spreadsheet. The new list’s 647 awards total nearly $24 billion. However, there are 24 awards, mostly under the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, that appear solely on the first list and not on the second.

Sources who spoke with Latitude Media said there’s ongoing confusion about the nature of this new list, and the status of the projects on it. Every project on the list has “terminate” in the “latest status” column. However, companies whose projects appear on the second list but not the first — such as those developing the biggest Direct Air Capture Hubs in the country — have told Latitude that they have not received official notice from the agency of a change in their project’s status, but were aware of the list.

DOE itself has not confirmed the list’s authenticity; the office did not respond to a request for comment from Latitude Media.

By the numbers

The new list greatly expands the impact across key offices — and the additional cuts target offices that got off fairly easy on the first list.

The Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains saw the most dramatic increase in cuts, from six awards to 45 awards, totaling nearly $4.3 billion. The cuts span major manufacturing companies like Honeywell and General Motors, as well as smaller companies building much-needed materials for the energy transition, such as the advanced conductor company TS Conductor.

The Grid Deployment Office was second-worst hit, at 45 awards totaling $3.3 billion, up from 25 awards on the initial list. Many of the recipients of these awards are either major utilities — such as Southern California Edison and Exelon — or state and local organizations like the Minnesota Department of Commerce. Several of these are located in red states, such as the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority and the State of Louisiana Department of Natural Resources.

Meanwhile, the Office of Fossil Energy (formerly Fossil Energy and Carbon Management) will now cancel more funding than the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy: 151 FE awards totaling $2.1 billion, versus 340 EERE awards totaling $1.8 billion.

The Advanced Energy Research Projects for Energy Office — which Energy Secretary Chris Wright applauded at the department’s conference earlier this year — had just a single project on the smaller cancellation list last week. The wider list includes five ARPA-E awards, totalling more than $46 million.

The list does not include awards managed by the Office of Science, the Nuclear Energy Office, or the Loan Programs Office.

OCED in DOE’s cross-hairs

The Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations was particularly hard hit. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law included $21 billion for the office over ten years. Around $12.3 billion worth of OCED awards are now on the cancellation list. Those include funding for some of the office’s largest projects, including the Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs, which were on the first list, and many of the Direct Air Capture Hubs, which appear only on the second.

In an official statement, the Carbon Removal Alliance and the Carbon Business Council acknowledged the cancellation of the two largest DAC Hub awards — Project Cypress in Louisiana, and the South Texas DAC Hub, operated by Occidental subsidiary 1PointFive — which follow a handful of smaller awards that appeared on last week’s cancellation list.

However, companies on the list don’t appear to have been given forewarning. Vikrum Aiyer, Head of Global Policy at Heirloom, which is involved in Project Cypress, told Latitude this morning that the company is “not aware” of a decision from DOE. Heirloom continues to “productively engage with the administration in a project review,” he added.

Climeworks confirmed that the list was circulating, but said it had also not received any official notice from DOE. 1PointFive didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

The company is grappling with a series of challenges — from supply chain disruptions and the looming loss of US EV tax credits to an ongoing, nearly eight-month search for a new chief executive following Peter Rawlinson’s abrupt departure in February.

The broader EV market was also under pressure on early Tuesday.

Despite the wide rollout of Tesla’s Full Self-Driving version 14.1 and just hours before the unveiling of the cheaper Model Y variant, Tesla shares were down about 3% in early trading before pairing losses later in the session.

Rivian declined 1.3%, while Chinese EV maker Nio fell nearly 4%, extending a multi-day slide across the sector.

Lucid said on Monday it produced 3,891 vehicles and delivered 4,078 in the quarter, while more than 1,000 additional units were pre-produced and will soon be assembled at its Saudi Arabian assembly plant.

Those vehicles will be counted as fourth-quarter production. Analysts had expected stronger results, and the shortfall triggered fresh selling pressure.

According to a research note from Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Andres Sheppard and first obtained by PriceTarget, consensus for the July–September period was estimating 4,286 EVs delivered and 5,175 vehicles produced.

As reported earlier this Tuesday, Lucid recently began recruiting for a second production-shift team lead at its Arizona factory as part of efforts to increase output.

The company aims to meet its revised 2025 guidance of 18,000 to 20,000 vehicles, cut in August from a prior 20,000-unit target.

To hit that range, the company would need to meaningfully raise production rates in the final months of the year.

The cheaper entry-level variant of the Lucid Gravity model is set to begin production before the year’s end at the Casa Grande, Arizona, plant.

Demand in Europe continues to remain minimal.

September registrations in Germany dropped to a new 18-month low, while sales figures in the Netherlands and Norway stood at three and zero, respectively.

As reported this week, Interim Chief Executive Officer Marc Winterhoff said recently that the company’s Gravity SUV has an average selling price of “about $120,000,” in the US.

The first units of the model are planned to be delivered in Europe in the first days of 2026. Production of European-focused has already begun, the management told EV and other media outlets in early September.

Winterhoff, who succeeded Peter Rawlinson in February, also said late last month that he is “not aware of any ambitions right now to take [Lucid] private,” addressing speculation about a potential buyout by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.

The PIF and its affiliates have injected roughly $8 billion into Lucid and committed to purchase up to 100,000 vehicles over time. Currently, PIF owns about 58% of the EV maker.

Lucid announced plans for a 1-for-10 reverse stock split in July and executed it in early September after shareholders’ approval.

A further drag on sentiment is the upcoming change in US federal EV tax-credit rules, which could weigh on industrywide sales in the fourth quarter.

They waited patiently through the slide presentation by the four EPA representatives from Denver. The hearing was held to present the revised portion of the permit for the two wells on Jody and Bonnie Field's property west of Valier. At an earlier hearing, attendees had objected to the potential migration of the wastewater to the permit's quarter mile radius from the wells. The EPA took the objections back to the drawing board and revised the permit to expand migration of the wastewater to a 2.1-mile area. The short comment period first set by the EPA was expanded to October 13, at the request of Pondera County commissioners. A court reporter recorded the hearing and a transcription will be available at http://www.regulations.gov

At the end of the EPA presentation, attendees were given five minutes each to speak their mind. Thirty people exercised their right to free speech. Some came armed with facts, clear they had done their research. All spoke passionately and from their hearts. Water is a passionate subject. The three Pondera County commissioners – Zane Drishinski, Tom Kuka and Jim Morren, spoke against the permit. Members of the Golden Triangle Resource Council spoke against, as well as a representative of Glacier Two Medicine Alliance. They talked about failed injection wells in Texas, Florida and Ohio. Some people spoke about the possibility of earthquakes causing well failure. The mayor of Roundup asked that the EPA require a constant monitoring system of the wells in case of failure.

To their credit, the four EPA representatives listened intently. They were young, with expertise in their fields. They were not seasoned. And they had no idea about life in rural Montana. They used population numbers (600 within Valier town limits) to decide how much drinking water is needed in Pondera County and didn't take into account that livestock need water too. They claimed that the Madison Aquifer in this area is contaminated, thus the migration of wastewater really didn't matter in the long run. After all, at the rate of the migration flow, their calculations showed it would take 10,000 years to know if there was contamination. Several speakers denied the Madison aquifer is contaminated and listed towns south of Great Falls that have drilled into that aquifer for their drinking water. There are 70 EPA documents online with technical information and everyone is encouraged to read these. Find them at http://www.regulations.gov and search for EPA ro8-06-2025-0852. The large amounts of technical information there are beyond the scope and size of this article. Everyone is encouraged to take the time to read at least some, if not all of these documents.

The real question on everyone's minds was what's in the water. Montana Renewables claims the wastewater is wash water from grain, animal fat from rendering and ""other contaminants"" but is safer than what has been and is still being injected into the other 25 injection wells in Pondera County. Pondera County commissioners say: prove it! County Sanitarian Corrine Rose has asked Montana Renewables to allow her to take a sample and have it tested. Montana Renewables has refused, saying the wastewater content is proprietary. It's understandable that they would not want someone from another county dipping into their wastewater and taking it somewhere else to test. They would lose chain of custody, not knowing who would touch it and how it would be transported or what possible contamination could occur. In a reverse situation, it's probable that the City of Conrad would take the same stance if someone from another county proposed the same ask. However, it seems reasonable that Montana Renewables could provide test results of the wastewater and give it to Pondera County Commissioners after they signed a non-disclosure agreement that would safeguard the proprietary nature of the water. Neither side will budge on this issue. EPA's Frasier stated that the EPA has studied the chemistry of the wastewater, indicating they found no problem with it.

Another bone of contention is the probable expansion of injecting this wastewater into other wells in Pondera County, making these two wells the first of many. Two more permit requests have already been submitted by Montalban Oil and Gas Operations, the company doing the actual injecting.

Montana Renewables has received a $1.67 billion federal loan guarantee to build a water treatment plant. Several speakers asked why the plant wasn't already being built. Montana Renewables has stated that they plan to build a treatment plant, but using injection wells is the interim plan until that can happen. A preliminary engineering report is one of the first steps -- a two-year cycle. Next is a two-year cycle for grant applications, then securing an engineering firm, contractors, etc. There are a lot of federal and state regulations to satisfy before ground can be broken for a treatment plant. An Alderwoman from Belt spoke about the ten years it took for that city to complete their treatment plant.

After the Oct. 13 deadline for comments is past, the EPA will make its final decision on the permit and open its last public hearing on this matter.

NEW YORK (AP) — Tesla rolled out new, cheaper versions of two of its electric car models on Tuesday in hopes the offerings will help revive flagging sales but investors dumped its stock anyway.

The new Model Y, costing just under $40,000 with a stripped-down interior, comes in a brutal year for Tesla as it tries to attract more customers despite an aging lineup, stiff competition from foreign EV makers and anti-Elon Musk boycotts targeting the company.

The reaction from the stock market after the news broke suggests the new models are not expected to help much.

“Investors were looking for something truly different, not an iteration of a old product,” said Edmunds analyst Ivan Drury, speaking as Tesla stock dropped sharply in the last minutes of trading. “I can’t imagine this will bring levels back to what they want.”

Tesla also announced a cheaper version of its Model 3 for under $37,000. For New York residents taking advantage of a state rebate, the price was below $35,000.

Tesla has talked about a cheaper car to appeal to more cost-conscious consumers for years, though the two new “standard” models are priced well above the $25,000 price tag promised. They come as customers are widely expected to hold off from purchases over the next several months due to the recent expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles.

Tesla stock fell 4.5% to $443.09 on Tuesday after closing the day before up more than 5% on anticipation of the new model announcement.

Compared to previous models, the new Model Y comes with a shorter 321-mile driving range, fewer audio speakers and a fabric interior, not microsuede. The model also lacks a panoramic glass roof and a touchscreen in the second row.

This model faces stiff competition in the $40,000 range for EVs from vehicles including Ford’s Mustang Mach-E, Chevrolet’s Equinox EV and Hyundai’s Ioniq 5.

The new Model Y, costing just under $40,000 with a stripped-down interior, comes in a brutal year for Tesla as it tries to attract more customers despite an aging lineup, stiff competition from foreign EV makers and anti-Elon Musk boycotts targeting the company.

The reaction from the stock market after the news broke suggests the new models are not expected to help much.

“Investors were looking for something truly different, not an iteration of a old product,” said Edmunds analyst Ivan Drury, speaking as Tesla stock dropped sharply in the last minutes of trading. “I can’t imagine this will bring levels back to what they want.”

Tesla also announced a cheaper version of its Model 3 for under $37,000. For New York residents taking advantage of a state rebate, the price was below $35,000.

Tesla has talked about a cheaper car to appeal to more cost-conscious consumers for years, though the two new “standard” models are priced well above the $25,000 price tag promised. They come as customers are widely expected to hold off from purchases over the next several months due to the recent expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles.

Tesla stock fell 4.5% to $443.09 on Tuesday after closing the day before up more than 5% on anticipation of the new model announcement.

Compared to previous models, the new Model Y comes with a shorter 321-mile driving range, fewer audio speakers and a fabric interior, not microsuede. The model also lacks a panoramic glass roof and a touchscreen in the second row.

This model faces stiff competition in the $40,000 range for EVs from vehicles including Ford’s Mustang Mach-E, Chevrolet’s Equinox EV and Hyundai’s Ioniq 5.

Key Elements of the Proposed Rule Retail Food Refrigeration – Remote Condensing Unit Systems and Supermarket Systems.
EPA proposes extending the compliance date to January 1, 2028, for refrigerated centrifuges and refrigerated laboratory shakers within the IPR sector.","Key Takeaways

What Happened? On October 3, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a proposed rule providing regulatory relief from certain requirements of the Agency’s 2023 Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) Technology Transitions Rule (TTR), which implements subsection (i) of the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act of 2020 (AIM Act), 42 U.S.C. § 7675(i). The proposed rule addresses topics raised in four administrative petitions and other stakeholder requests regarding specific regulatory requirements. The proposed relief includes extended compliance dates and more lenient global warming potential (GWP) thresholds for acceptable refrigerants.

Who Is Affected? The proposed rule potentially affects manufacturers, importers, and users of residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump systems, retail food refrigeration equipment for remote condensing units and supermarkets, chillers and industrial process refrigeration equipment used in semiconductor manufacturing, refrigerated transport intermodal containers, refrigeration systems in cold storage warehouses, refrigerated laboratory centrifuges and refrigerated laboratory shakers, and condensing units used for residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pumps.

What Should You Do? Stakeholders affected by the proposed rule should carefully review the proposal and consider submitting comments to the docket (Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0005). Comments are due on or before November 17, 2025.

Key Elements of the Proposed Rule

Retail Food Refrigeration – Remote Condensing Unit Systems and Supermarket Systems. The 2023 TTR established restrictions on the use of HFCs in new remote condensing unit systems (starting January 1, 2026) and new supermarket systems (January 1, 2027). The GWP limit in the 2023 TTR is 150 for systems with refrigerant charge capacities greater than or equal to 200 pounds, and 300 for systems with refrigerant charge capacities less than 200 pounds or for the high temperature side of cascade systems, irrespective of the total charge capacity.

Food retailers and a trade association raised concerns about the limited number and types of refrigerant substitutes that EPA had previously determined would be available for use in remote condensing unit systems and supermarket systems by the respective January 1, 2026, and 2027 compliance dates. As a result of these concerns, EPA proposes an interim GWP limit of 1,400 starting January 1, 2026, for new remote condensing units and starting January 1, 2027, for new supermarket systems. Starting January 1, 2032, the GWP limit for remote condensing units and supermarket systems would revert to 150 or 300, depending on the system. EPA did not propose changes to the 150 GWP limit for systems with a refrigerant charge of200 pounds or more, nor to the 300 GWP limit for systems with a refrigerant charge of less than 200 pounds or for the high-temperature side of a cascade system.

EPA also requests comment on whether the expansion of cooling capacity in BTU/hour (e.g., 25 percent) would be allowable during a remodel of a supermarket system without triggering the requirements at 40 C.F.R. § 84.54(e). EPA is requesting comment to address stakeholder concerns that 40 C.F.R. § 84.54(e)(2) and (3) may result in supermarkets having to replace legacy systems before the end of their useful life.

Chillers and Industrial Process Refrigeration Equipment Used in Semiconductor Manufacturing. EPA proposes extending the compliance date for certain chillers used for industrial process refrigeration (IPR) and certain IPR equipment used to manufacture semiconductors (i.e., semiconductor manufacturing and related equipment or SMRE) with charge sizes of 100 pounds or less from January 1, 2026, or January 1, 2028, as applicable, to January 1, 2030. SEMI, the global trade association for the semiconductor supply chain, challenged the 2023 TTR and petitioned EPA to reconsider the compliance dates that affect SMRE for the IPR and chillers for IPR subsectors. (Beveridge & Diamond represents SEMI in challenging the rule and petitioning for administrative reconsideration.)

In addition to delaying the compliance dates, EPA stated that it “understands that IPR and Chillers for IPR used in the semiconductor manufacturing industry may operate at one temperature while being designed to reach lower temperatures” and that “the lowest temperature at which equipment is designed to operate determines whether it is subject to use restrictions.” EPA requests comment on the charge size threshold applicable to SMRE and whether to exempt SMRE from 40 C.F.R. § 84.54, although EPA notes that it is not proposing to exempt this equipment.

Refrigerated Transport – Intermodal Containers. In response to a petition from an intermodal container manufacturer, EPA proposes adjusting the lower bound temperature exclusion threshold of -50 °C to -35 °C, and changing the location where that temperature is measured from the temperature of the refrigerant entering the evaporator (for direct heat exchange systems) or the temperature of the fluid exiting (for chillers) to the “box temperature.” In addition, the petitioner requested that EPA clarify that the temperature measurement be based on the lowest temperature at which the equipment is “designed to reach and maintain.” EPA clarified this means that if a refrigerated transport intermodal container has the capacity to achieve a box temperature below -35 °C, it would not be subject to the TTR restrictions even if at times the container is operated at temperatures at or above -35 °C.

Other Aspects of the Proposal

Condensing Units – Residential and Light Commercial Air Conditioning and Heat Pump Subsector. EPA proposes to retain current requirements regarding the treatment of certain condensing units used in air conditioning and heat pump systems in the residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump subsector.

Cold Storage Warehouses. EPA proposes to adjust the GWP threshold for cold storage warehouses from 150 or 300, as applicable, to 700 starting January 1, 2026, with a later adjustment to the GWP threshold of either 150 or 300, depending on charge size or whether it is part of the high temperature side of a cascade system, starting January 1, 2032.

Industrial Process Refrigeration in Certain Laboratory Equipment. EPA proposes extending the compliance date to January 1, 2028, for refrigerated centrifuges and refrigerated laboratory shakers within the IPR sector.

Compliance Date Extension for Residential and Light Commercial Air Conditioning and Heat Pump Systems. To address concerns about supply chain issues related to R-454B, EPA proposes to remove the installation deadline for residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump systems, provided that specified components of such systems were manufactured or imported prior to January 1, 2025.

According to Reuters, the DOE review is part of a larger evaluation of roughly $12 billion in federal awards that could be canceled or suspended as the government contends with a partial shutdown. These funds were part of the Biden administration’s broader push to modernize legacy auto plants and secure American leadership in EV production.

Background: The 2024 Retooling Initiative –

Back in July 2024, we reported the Biden administration announced an ambitious funding package through the DOE, aimed at converting “at-risk” combustion engine plants into EV manufacturing hubs. The goal was to help maintain union jobs, stimulate economic activity in long-time auto towns, and strengthen the U.S. manufacturing base as EV demand continued to grow.

Under the plan, Stellantis was promised $585 million — including $335 million to convert its shuttered Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois into an EV assembly site and $250 million for its Indiana Transmission Plant in Kokomo to begin producing electric drive modules.

These projects were touted as central to preserving 15,000 existing jobs and creating roughly 3,000 new positions across eight states.

Why The Funding May Be Revoked –

On October 7, 2025, new reports indicated that the DOE is now reconsidering those 2024 awards. The potential revocation is tied to a wider reassessment of federal spending amid ongoing fiscal uncertainty in Washington, D.C. If rescinded, the decision could delay or derail critical plant modernization efforts in both Michigan and Illinois.

The timing is particularly challenging for Stellantis, which has begun shifting away from its aggressive all-electric roadmap in recent months. The automaker has canceled the all-electric Ram 1500 REV and its long-range REV XL, scrapped the all-electric Jeep® Compass (J4U) program, and repositioned the upcoming Chrysler C6X crossover as a hybrid instead of a full EV. Internal supplier sources have also suggested that the high-performance 800-volt Dodge Charger Daytona SRT Banshee has been canceled, further underscoring Stellantis’ evolving EV strategy.

What’s At Stake –

If the DOE follows through with the revocation, both automakers could lose critical federal support at a time when the industry faces mounting costs, slower-than-expected EV adoption, and intense political scrutiny. The move could also undercut the Biden administration’s efforts to showcase its investment in clean energy manufacturing ahead of the 2026 election cycle.",https://moparinsiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/MG_4425-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-10-07 19:02:01.302870

The report comes at a time when the federal government is cutting investment in energy efficiency and electricity demand is rising.
That confluence has sharpened the need for energy savings measures, experts say.
“Electric savings will help the region continue meeting a substantial portion of annual electric load via energy efficiency,” Acadia said.
“State energy efficiency programs make a major contribution to the energy system as a low-cost resource, yet face a pivotal juncture in the northeast region,” Dickerson said.","Energy efficiency efforts in six New England states and New York are saving customers billions of dollars on utility bills and reducing peak demand on the region’s electric grid, according to analysis published Monday by Acadia Center.

The report comes at a time when the federal government is cutting investment in energy efficiency and electricity demand is rising. That confluence has sharpened the need for energy savings measures, experts say.

A September report from conservation advocate CLASP highlighted the potential for efficiency to help meet global emissions targets, particularly appliance efficiency where improvements could deliver about 20% of the total reduction in energy demand required to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

Acadia’s report focuses on investment levels and projected benefits from efficiency programs in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont. And it calls for improvements to efficiency data reporting that could unlock further energy savings.

“It is more important than ever for policymakers, advocates, program administrators, and consumers to understand the value and evolving role of energy efficiency resource acquisition and shape the future trajectories of the programs to meet the emerging needs of the region,” Jamie Dickerson, senior director of climate and clean energy programs at Acadia, said in a statement.

The report examines data in each state’s three-year energy efficiency plan, annual program reports and other filings. Acadia’s analysis shows the seven states are poised to invest almost $10 billion in efficiency overall, with New England programs alone generating an estimated $19.3 billion in lifetime benefits. New England and New York expect to realize 700 trillion Btu in lifetime savings across all fuels, including 20 TWh of lifetime electricity savings from efficiency investments in New England.

“Electric savings will help the region continue meeting a substantial portion of annual electric load via energy efficiency,” Acadia said. “Combining both electricity and combustible fuel savings, the New England states are projected to avoid 368 TBtu of lifetime energy use, and this projected total rises to 703 TBtu with the inclusion of New York State.”

Despite the savings, Acadia warned efficiency investment is under pressure.

“State energy efficiency programs make a major contribution to the energy system as a low-cost resource, yet face a pivotal juncture in the northeast region,” Dickerson said. “Consumer affordability is front of mind for consumers and policymakers with rising energy prices. Other energy resources are rising in cost, yet cuts to ratepayer funded programs — which reduce system costs — have been threatened and implemented by leading states.”

Massachusetts will lose out on $1.49 billion in lifetime benefits following a February decision to cut $500 million from efficiency program budgets, Acadia said. Similarly, Rhode Island efficiency programs face possible cuts of 30% that would lose the state about $92 million in benefits, according to the report.

Looking ahead, Acadia recommended that the New England states and New York “come together to better standardize metrics utilized for program measurement, evaluation, and reporting.”

“Major differences in reporting data persist, and the overall power and impact of energy efficiency in the northeast is limited without that alignment,” according to the report. “With more universal reporting methodologies and benefit cost tests, programs in the region would collectively be more powerful, the ability to understand the value and design of programs would be substantially improved, and new opportunities for states to learn from one another would be unlocked.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/YvXL1wURvG0koea-QwZu7pymwwzhXC5Sg82_RmVHSVQ/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9mcmlkZ2UuanBn.webp,N,,2025-10-07 22:01:43.516484

“the next Model T moment” – Ford Have regulatory changes lately benefited the auto industry?","A few years ago, the American auto industry dreamed of a fully electric future. After the administration rolled back some federal incentives for electric vehicles, talk of rapid full electrification unsettled and faded into the background.

The near-term outlook does not look very optimistic: analysts expect that the expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit will lead to a sharp drop in sales in the coming quarters and perhaps years.

Meanwhile, the global auto industry keeps moving forward: manufacturers continue to invest in an electric future, even if it hasn’t aligned with earlier expectations. At the same time, regulatory prospects for gasoline-powered cars in the U.S. and abroad remain murky, and companies strive not to fall behind the growth of the Chinese EV market.

“They’ve softened their stance on a fully EV future. I truly believe that Ford, GM, Stellantis and many other manufacturers will still actively move toward EVs. But they are now pursuing this path more cautiously than a few years ago.”

– Daniel Ives, Wedbush Securities

Economic and Regulatory Challenges

In August, the expiration of the $7,500 EV tax credit led to a substantial spike in sales in the third quarter – the demand rushed to buy cars before the credit ended. Tesla, Ford and General Motors posted record EV sales volumes, with GM in the United States even showing a doubling compared with the previous year.

After the peak, demand, as analysts expect, will return to more moderate levels, and a recovery could take a long time.

Although EVs accounted for about 10% of total vehicle sales last quarter, Ford executives expect their share of the U.S. market to fall to around 5% from about 7% last year. GM’s Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson also noted that demand for EVs is likely to “decline sharply.”

“Demand for electric vehicles will decline sharply.”

– Paul Jacobson, GM

Nevertheless, despite pessimistic forecasts, Ford announced in August a $5 billion investment in EV production, calling it its “next Model T moment” – a nod to the historic turning point in the mass adoption of internal-combustion engine vehicles.

“the next Model T moment”

– Ford

Have regulatory changes lately benefited the auto industry? Partly. Changes in regulatory requirements have reduced the pressure: specifically, the July bill partially rolled back penalties for emissions-exceedance, and emissions-regulation requirements have become less stringent than in previous years.

California and eight other states – Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington – were crafting plans to limit sales of gasoline cars by 2035. Together that accounts for roughly a quarter of U.S. sales. However, Congress is considering the possibility of scrapping these requirements for individual states, which could face lawsuits and drag on for years. Europe and China are also pushing their own strict emission rules, adding further pressure on the EV market.

Manufacturers are looking to boost their stock prices with EV plans. Tesla maintains a significant advantage in market capitalization even as it produces fewer cars than other giants. And this isn’t new: investors continue to look to the future of technologies such as autonomous solutions and service-based models.

Instead of one full replacement of ICE, hybrids – combining electricity and the traditional engine – are increasingly discussed. Such trends allow manufacturers to retain their value proposition and continue to scale production without abandoning existing engines.

“There is still an aggressive impulse toward EV. But the internal combustion engine is not a four-letter word anymore.”

– Daniel Ives

Leaders of American manufacturers emphasize: we are returning to basics and understand that demand for gasoline cars may remain substantial even beyond rapid electrification. Regulatory steps and economic factors continue to shape the industry’s path – from full electrification to measured hybrid solutions.

GM notes that despite the $7,500 credit, customers do not always react as quickly as government programs expected. The company still expects long-term growth in demand for EVs and is working to meet it at a pace that will form over time.

“Let this play out and we’ll understand where natural demand for EVs will go and how to meet it.”

– Paul Jacobson, GM

EVs as a Future Prospect

Manufacturers see in electric vehicles not only an environmental step but also an economic one: EV production is less labor-intensive and less complex in terms of the engine, which could boost profitability. They also expect battery costs to fall, making electric vehicles more affordable for consumers.

Ford said it plans to offer an EV pickup at around $30,000 – a significantly lower price compared with models like the F-150 Lightning, which start around $55,000. The new line of affordable EV pickups is slated to arrive by 2027.

Ford executives emphasize that the world is gradually changing and that this is precisely the turning point for the company and the entire industry. It means manufacturers are weighing their path to electrification, preserving the ability to adapt to different demand scenarios and regulatory requirements.

Despite certain regulatory and economic hurdles, the industry continues to move forward: technological innovations, falling battery costs, and new affordable EV models form the foundation for broader EV adoption in the future.",https://mezha.net/eng/kd_image_generate/us-auto-industry-faces-ev-sales-decline-after-federal-tax-credit-ends/344016.jpg?ver=0.0.4,N,,2025-10-07 20:59:41.655513

But it would also be great if Landry placed just as much emphasis on holding Smitty’s Supply accountable instead of the kid glove treatment they’ve been afforded so far.","This story was originally published by the Louisiana Illuminator.

It’s downright mystifying at times the lengths some officials will go to paint a rosy picture in the most dire circumstances. Sure, there are times when a dose of positivity will help folks through a tough situation, but there comes a point when reality must be confronted.

That’s where Gov. Jeff Landry seemingly found himself last Sunday after new aerial drone video footage from photographer Eric McVicker revealed the sorry state of the cleanup at Smitty’s Supply Inc. in Tangipahoa Parish – more than five weeks after the Aug. 22 explosion and fire. The video showed an adjacent large pond covered in petroleum products that leaked from the plant, and it pans over to show an oily slick extending into the nearby Tangipahoa River.

That petrochemical runoff has flowed some 40 miles downriver toward Lake Pontchartrain, though officials say that body of water has not been affected so far.

The governor was so moved by what he saw on McVicker’s footage that he posted his own video from the Governor’s Mansion to express his dissatisfaction with remediation efforts.

“They’re not going fast enough,” he said about the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-led effort.

Landry said he arranged a call with EPA Regional Administrator Scott Mason, Louisiana Environmental Quality Secretary Courtney Burdette and state Conservation and Energy Secretary Dustin Davidson.

“Starting tomorrow morning, things are getting ready to start changing on the cleaning up of that site,” the governor said Sunday.

But when the governor led a news conference Wednesday in Tangipahoa Parish, his tone had softened considerably. In response to reporters’ questions about the enhanced response measures Landry had promised, he came to the EPA’s defense.

“While I know it’s real easy to throw popcorn from the stands and it’s easy to make criticisms when you’re not on the ground, I will tell you that this incident is a unique incident. It falls between regulatory bodies,” Landry said.

Questions aren’t criticism, governor. It’s what journalists do in situations when officials can’t or won’t provide information the public needs.

Case in point: The EPA withheld information about the hazardous product inventory at Smitty’s Supply for five weeks, saying it needed company clearance first. The agency made the info public a day after the Illuminator published a report revealing why it had been kept secret. So far, there’s been no explanation as to why it took so long to reveal what neighbors of the facility have been desperate to learn for health and safety reasons.

The lack of information from Smitty’s Supply since the explosion is conspicuous. No one from the company has taken part in news conferences, and they’ve not responded to our questions about its role in the cleanup.

The EPA said last month it has $39 million in environmental remediation funds available to respond to the disaster but that it will need more. Smitty’s Supply is not currently paying for the cleanup but will be responsible for the cost, according to federal officials.

Tangipahoa President Robby Miller told AN17 Local News Wednesday it’s been apparent for several weeks that more resources are needed to tackle the cleanup, and he said the EPA responded with more equipment in recent days.

“If I have a real complaint about the EPA, our federal government, it’s how long it takes them to get things done,” Miller said. “We all recognized three weeks ago that we needed more frac (pump) trucks, we needed more vacuum trucks. Then it took about a week to convince people to come see that we really did. Then it took about a week for them to get that all put together, and it all happened to kind of culminate … Monday. ”

“It was just good timing on the governor making that statement at the same time all that work was happening,” the parish president added.

The governor will want to take credit for getting the EPA to bring more forces to bear for Tangipahoa cleanup. That’s fine. It’s what politicians do, regardless of whether they actually deserve it.

But it would also be great if Landry placed just as much emphasis on holding Smitty’s Supply accountable instead of the kid glove treatment they’ve been afforded so far.",https://thelensnola.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/5C5A8382.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 19:02:12.532805

(CNN) — The Trump administration is eyeing cutting funds for two major climate pollution projects in Texas and Louisiana, including one in House Speaker Mike Johnson’s district, according to a list of potential cuts obtained by CNN.

Days after announcing nearly $8 billion in cuts to federal energy funding, the Energy Department is considering billions more in reductions to federally funded energy projects, including two $50 million grants in Texas and Louisiana for direct air capture hubs — systems that could pull climate pollution out of the atmosphere like a vacuum.

One of the hubs, Project Cypress, is located in Johnson’s district.

It is unclear whether all the projects on the list will be terminated, or when the cuts will be officially announced. As of Tuesday, some companies involved in the projects hadn’t heard directly from the federal government.

“Market rumors have surfaced, but we have not received any official decision by DOE,” Christoph Gebald, co-CEO of the carbon removal company Climeworks, told CNN in a statement. Climeworks is one of the companies involved in the Cypress project.

Direct air capture uses chemicals to remove climate pollution from the air. Once removed, planet-warming CO2 can be stored underground or used in industrial materials like cement.

There has been a lot of work done on hubs to accelerate the development of technologies to remove CO2 from the atmosphere in states that are major producers of oil and gas, like Texas and Louisiana, with some viewing them as a lifeline for the polluting fossil fuel industry.

Louisiana’s Republican Gov. Jeff Landry has been supportive of the project, and state officials have urged Louisiana lawmakers on Capitol Hill to protect the projects from any cuts.

Energy Department spokesperson Ben Dietderich didn’t directly comment on the individual projects or the future of their funding, but said the department’s review of projects is ongoing.

“No determinations have been made other than what has been previously announced,” Dietderich told CNN in a statement. “As Secretary Wright made clear last week, the Department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration.”

A spokesperson for Speaker Johnson did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.

Groups supporting the projects blasted the potential move, saying it could kill jobs and hurt US competitiveness in a rapidly growing industry.

“It’s a huge economic boon,” said Erin Burns, executive director of carbon removal group Carbon180.

“Local economies were poised to benefit from billions of dollars in economic investment and thousands of in-demand jobs, and in the face of potential cuts, state and local leaders worked to educate the Department of Energy on the negative impacts of withdrawing support for the DAC Hubs,” Giana Amador of the Carbon Removal Alliance and Ben Rubin of the Carbon Business Council said in a joint statement.

In an interview with CNN on Thursday, Energy Sec. Chris Wright said the Energy Department was considering cancelling federal grants for projects from both red and blue states — after White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought suggested on X that the administration was cancelling projects in largely blue states.

Wright said the Energy Department’s funding cuts were not tied to the ongoing government shutdown, nor targeted at blue states.

“We’ve announced project cancellations before that in both red and blue states, and as this fall goes on, you’ll see cancellations in red and blue states,” Wright told CNN’s Kaitlin Collins.

“The projects are under review and most of the decisions have not been released yet,” Wright said, adding a full list would be released “in the next few weeks.”",https://keyt.b-cdn.net/2023/08/nc312-combined-commercial-slate-860x484.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 19:02:17.711753

In good news for California’s industrial sector, yesterday evening Governor Gavin Newsom signed AB 1280 into law. Authored by Assemblymember Robert Garcia (D–Rancho Cucamonga), the bill will help modernize California’s manufacturing sector by expanding incentive programs for the deployment of clean industrial equipment through the California Energy Commission’s Industrial Decarbonization and Improvement of Grid Operations grant program (INDIGO) and the IBank’s Climate Catalyst Fund. The bill was sponsored by Industrious Labs and Earthjustice.

“We thank Governor Newsom for signing AB 1280 to help California manufacturers shift to zero-emissions equipment like heat pumps and thermal energy storage,” said Adrian Martinez, Director of Earthjustice’s Right To Zero campaign. “This legislation is a critical early step in modernizing California’s industrial sector — and next year, we hope to see Governor Newsom and the Legislature invest funds from cap and invest in the INDIGO program to ensure we keep pace with the rest of the world in the big shift to clean industrial equipment. In the end, it’ll deliver better health to Californians from the cradle to old age.”

“Investing in clean manufacturing is a golden opportunity for California,” said Teresa Cheng, California Director at Industrious Labs. “Industry is a major source of pollution, but it’s also a pillar of our economy, and it can be part of the solution. We have the tools to cut industrial pollution and keep manufacturing jobs here in the state. What’s missing is implementation — and AB 1280 delivers that. State investment is critical to keeping California’s manufacturing sector competitive and a leader in adopting clean technology.”

Today, California’s industrial sector emits one-fifth of the state’s climate pollution. But nearly half of all emissions from the manufacturing sector can be eliminated by replacing fossil-fueled equipment with more efficient zero-emissions equipment that is already commercially available. The legislation will make it easier for manufacturers to afford these upgrades by providing grants from INDIGO and loans through California’s Green Bank — an effort that finances projects that promote sustainability.

Manufacturers that receive funds through the program will be required to meet strong labor standards and the program will prioritize projects in areas that experience the worst industrial pollution. The legislation enjoyed especially robust support from labor in California.

“Governor Newsom’s signature on AB 1280 is a major win for working families,” said Vince Sugrue, State Legislative Director for Sheet Metal Workers Local Union No. 104. “This bill helps ensure that California continues to invest in high-road, middle-class careers while accelerating our state’s clean energy transition. By putting skilled labor at the center of the solution, we’re building a cleaner, fairer future that uplifts workers and communities alike.”

The bill’s twin benefits of modernizing manufacturing while cleaning California’s air earned it broad bipartisan support from manufacturers, environmental justice and climate groups, and the state building and construction trades.

California has the largest manufacturing sector in the United States. It’s a huge driver of the state’s economy — contributing about $400 billion annually in GDP — and it is also a major source of pollution.

But the project is now about to open 2,700 miles away, in Alberta, Canada. The company started considering new locations shortly after the inauguration, as the political climate around climate projects quickly changed.

“We were looking for regions where we felt we could get support for deployment,” says CarbonCapture CEO Adrian Corless. “Canada was an obvious choice given the existence of good government programs and incentives that are there.”

CarbonCapture makes modular direct air capture technology (DAC), units that remove CO2 from the air. In late March, reports came out that the Department of Energy (DOE) was considering cancelling grants for two other large DAC projects, including one in Louisiana that involved the company. By the end of May, by the time the DOE’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations announced that it was cancelling $3.7 billion in other grants, the startup had already signed an agreement with Deep Sky Alpha, a facility in Canada that is simultaneously deploying and testing multiple direct air capture projects to help the industry grow.

The startup had already self-funded its planned project in Arizona and built the modules for the site. Because it didn’t rely on government funding for the project, it could have moved forward in the U.S. But it saw that it would be harder to move from the pilot to later commercial projects in Arizona. Now, it’s planning to build its first full commercial project in Canada as well. (The company wouldn’t disclose the cost for either project.)

“We just didn’t see a pathway in the U.S. to be able to show that linkage between doing a commercial pilot, starting to generate [carbon dioxide removal] credits and selling them, and then being able to raise the capital for something that’s much larger,” Corless says.

Canada offers an investment tax credit of 60% for direct air capture equipment, plus an additional 12% for projects in Alberta, the heart of Canada’s oil and gas industry. The country also has strong support for R&D and first-of-a-kind deployments for early-stage companies, and multiple programs supporting climate tech specifically.

The Canada Growth Fund, for example, is a $15 billion fund designed to advance decarbonization. And while Mark Carney, Canada’s prime minister, has taken steps backward on climate policy, he’s also said that he wants the country to be the “world’s leading energy superpower” both for conventional energy and clean energy.

The situation in the U.S. is very different. Trump recently called climate change a “con job” in a speech to the United Nations. When Chris Wright, the energy secretary, recently canceled another $13 billion for renewable energy projects, he said, “if you can’t rock on your own after 33 years, maybe that’s not a business that’s going places,” despite the fact that fossil fuels have gotten subsidies from the U.S. for three times as long. Fossil fuel subsidies are now nearly $35 billion a year, or as much as $760 billion if you include health and environmental costs.

Direct air capture tech arguably hasn’t been hit quite as hard as other forms of climate tech, like offshore wind power. When the “One Big Beautiful Bill” gutted other funding, from tax credits for EVs to solar panels, it left in place some credits that facilities can earn for capturing carbon as they operate. But the Department of Energy recently cut multiple grants that would have helped new DAC projects get built. One of the large projects CarbonCapture was supporting—the Louisiana facility previously under review—lost funding, and the company just received official notice of its cancellation.

Corless says that the startup is still carefully watching what happens in D.C.—and the company still hasn’t made any announcements about whether it might move its whole company, not just particular projects. Right now, it’s headquartered in L.A. with around 50 employees. It also has a small factory for its equipment in Arizona, next to the site where it had planned to build its first carbon capture facility.

Moving the first project to Canada happened quickly. Five weeks ago, the site in Alberta was an empty field. Four weeks ago, the company shipped the modules it had built in Arizona to Canada. Construction crews have been finishing the final touches, and the company plans to begin commissioning the system next week. Deep Sky Alpha already had some key infrastructure in place, including access to solar power to run the equipment. The pilot will ultimately be able to capture 2,000 tons of CO2 a year, which will be buried underground.

It’s possible that other companies might follow CarbonCapture’s move. “I think that there definitely are going to be several companies that are looking at the same data that we’re looking at,” Corless says. “And I think that it’s not lost on the Canadian government that they have an opportunity as well to step up and potentially take a leadership role in this space, which the U.S. has really owned for the last five years.”

“The U.S. does have a real advantage, even without DOE support,” says Erin Burns, director at the nonprofit Carbon180. “But it’s very likely that uncertainty around DOE programs will weaken that edge. Some projects will move abroad. Some that might have thrived here will not. Others will achieve only a fraction of their potential. Each outcome is a setback on its own. Together they add up to millions, possibly billions, in lost investment and slower American innovation.”","https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2025/10/03-91416600-climate-tech-startup.jpg",N,,2025-10-07 19:02:21.069165

One of the projects is located in the district where Mike Johnson’s words as Speaker of the House are heard.

Following the announcement of sweeping cuts to federal energy funding, the Department of Energy is weighing further multibillion-dollar reductions within the budget. Specifically, two $50 million grants for DAC hubs in Texas and Louisiana – systems that could pull greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, acting like a vacuum.

One such hub is Project Cypress, located in Johnson County.

It remains unclear whether all projects on the list will be shut down, or when the decision will be officially announced. As of now, some companies involved in the projects have not received direct notice from the federal government.

“There have been market rumors, but we have not received any official decision from the Department of Energy.”

– Christoph Gebald, co-founder of Climeworks

Direct air capture involves using chemical processes to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The captured CO2 can be stored underground or used in industrial materials, such as cement.

The DAC sector has already done much to advance CO2 removal technologies in states where oil and gas production is significant – notably Texas and Louisiana. Some observers see this as a path to preserving competitiveness in the transition to clean technologies, while others warn of potential risks to jobs and financial stability.

Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry, a Republican, expressed support for the project, and regional officials urged lawmakers to protect DAC hubs from potential cuts.

A Department of Energy spokesperson declined to comment on specific projects, but confirmed that the review is ongoing.

“No decisions have been made, other than what was previously announced,”

– Ben Dietrich, official spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Energy

A spokesperson for Speaker Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.

Support groups for DAC hubs criticize the move, warning that it could destroy jobs and threaten U.S. leadership in the rapidly growing clean-tech sector.

“This is a huge economic advantage.”

– Erin Burns, Executive Director of Carbon180

In a joint statement by the Carbon Removal Alliance and the Carbon Business Council, it was noted that regions were ready to receive billions of dollars in investments and thousands of jobs, and local leaders urged the government to clarify the negative consequences of withdrawing support for DAC hubs.

In an interview with our publication, the head of energy affairs said that the grant review concerns projects in various states, and the full list of decisions will be announced in the next several weeks. He also stressed that the cuts do not indicate a government delay and are not aimed solely at specific regions.",https://bucket-bykvu.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/eng/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/12100453/cropped-favicon_96x96_black-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-07 19:01:40.566589

Even if AI growth projections overshoot, energy demand will increase at a scale the power sector hasn’t seen in a generation.
The real test is whether we can scale fast enough while ensuring energy remains reliable and affordable for ratepayers while continuing to improve emissions intensity throughout our energy system.
Enbridge sits at the center of North America’s energy system, with a proven record of delivering energy where it matters most.
Yet even with a diverse mix of energy sources—and robust domestic energy supply—planning for AI’s resource use remains challenging.","Here’s a fundamental truth: there is no AI without energy. And as the technology grows, its demand for energy, and carbon footprint, may never again be as small as it is today.

Against this backdrop, debates over which energy source should power AI miss the point. AI’s appetite for energy—relative to what the grid has available today—will demand every tool available. Even if AI growth projections overshoot, energy demand will increase at a scale the power sector hasn’t seen in a generation. The real test is whether we can scale fast enough while ensuring energy remains reliable and affordable for ratepayers while continuing to improve emissions intensity throughout our energy system.

Market participants are focused on how best to balance these considerations, and at a pace that will support America’s competitive advantages. Governments are also engaging. The U.S. will need new chip factories, new data centers, and, most critically, vast new sources of energy, along with the infrastructure to deliver where it’s needed. Recent reforms outlined in Winning the Race: America’s AI Action Plan aim to accelerate permitting and expedite infrastructure deployment, with the recognition that tomorrow’s energy system will look very different from the one we have today.

Bridging policy ambition with practical delivery requires companies capable of moving energy at scale, making infrastructure essential to the task. Enbridge sits at the center of North America’s energy system, with a proven record of delivering energy where it matters most. Its assets are strategically linked to major population hubs and positioned near the fast-growing data center clusters that will anchor the digital economy.

Being able to move the energy is only one part of the need. A diverse portfolio of energy businesses and capabilities—from natural gas transmission and storage, to gas utilities and renewable power operations—is crucial if we want to deliver a mix of energy sources that support clean energy ambitions while also ensuring continuous baseload power.

Here’s what that looks like in action: Earlier this year, Enbridge announced that it is developing and will be operating the 600 MW Clear Fork Solar project near San Antonio for a customer. On the Gulf Coast, advanced optimization projects, including a $50 million expansion of the Southeast Supply Header pipeline across Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama are meeting the growing power needs of a major electric utility serving data centers. There’s also the expansion of the Texas Eastern Transmission system to support Homer City Redevelopment generating facility in Pennsylvania, which, when fully operational, will be the largest natural gas-fired power plant in the U.S. dedicated entirely to data centers and AI.

This mix of energy sources and innovation will help to match immediate energy needs with long-term growth projections.

Our approach to the energy evolution must include lowering the emissions intensity of its operations, helping customers transition from higher-emitting fuels to lower-carbon options, and building more efficient and lower carbon infrastructure. Since 2020, Enbridge has reduced GHG emissions intensity from operations by 40%.

Yet even with a diverse mix of energy sources—and robust domestic energy supply—planning for AI’s resource use remains challenging. Google recently offered data that punctuates this point: a median prompt to its Gemini model consumes 0.24 watt-hours—about the same as running a laptop for 17 seconds or a microwave for one second. In June, Sam Altman noted in a blog on AI’s growth that the average ChatGPT query consumes about 0.34 watt-hours of electricity, roughly what a high-efficiency lightbulb uses in a couple of minutes. Numbers like these sharpen public understanding of AI’s energy appetite, but they also expose Jevons paradox—the dynamic where gains in efficiency lower costs, only to spark even greater demand. For energy providers, that means data-driven planning and experience will be essential. Data centers will need partners that can deliver capacity, reliability and sustainability alike—baseload natural gas, renewables, storage and infrastructure built to meet real demand and support round-the-clock operations.

The paradox also makes clear what’s at stake: as AI expands, innovation will rise or fall on the availability and deliverability of dependable and flexible energy systems. Meeting this moment will require unprecedented coordination between policymakers, hyperscalers, and energy providers.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-artificial-intelligence-laptop-genai-cognitive-computing.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 19:02:29.841994

Dive Brief:

General Motors Co. is moving its electric BrightDrop commercial vans under the Chevrolet brand, the automaker announced in a press release Aug. 29.

The decision will make it more convenient for commercial customers to visit a Chevrolet dealer for sales, service and maintenance needs, according to GM.

GM launched BrightDrop in January 2021 with the goal of developing commercial EVs for logistics purposes and to help companies decarbonize their fleet operations. BrightDrop customers include FedEx, Ryder and DHL.

Dive Insight:

BrightDrop is similar to Ford Motor Co.’s new business unit Ford Pro. When it launched BrightDrop, GM initially planned for it to operate independently as a wholly owned subsidiary, while the company continued to develop commercial EVs and expand its logistics business offerings.

But in November 2023, GM announced that BrightDrop would become part of its commercial products and services unit Envolve, in order to bring together the automaker’s digital offerings to BrightDrop customers. Envolve serves thousands of commercial and government customers, according to GM.

“Integration into the Chevrolet portfolio will expand [BrightDrop’s] reach and accessibility and offer more customers additional tools to help achieve their productivity and carbon-neutral goals,” Sandor Piszar, vice president of GM Envolve, said in the release.

All Chevrolet dealers will have the opportunity to sell BrightDrop vans, as long as the dealers meet GM’s commercial EV requirements. Once certified, participating dealers can maintain and service BrightDrop EVs, creating an opportunity for additional revenue while allowing customers to keep their vehicles on the road.

“With the addition of BrightDrop to the Chevrolet lineup, we are combining advanced EV technology with the dependability and widespread accessibility that only Chevrolet can offer,” Chevrolet VP Scott Bell said in the release. “This move strengthens our EV offerings and reaffirms our role as a leading commercial brand that enables businesses large and small to get work done.”

Brightdrop currently offers two electric vans, the Zevo 400 and the Zevo 600, which offers additional cargo volume. The vans are built on GM’s Ultium EV platform.

The new terminations list also includes both of the largest direct air capture hub awards.
The $3.5 billion direct air capture hub program was intended to jump-start a domestic industry capable of vacuuming carbon dioxide from the sky.
The more expansive list would make major cuts to Republican states and districts, including through the hydrogen hub cancellations.
The Southern States Energy Board, which is composed largely of Republican states, would get hit with $100 million in grant cancellations, according to the list.","The Department of Energy is planning to cancel hundreds of additional clean energy grants authorized in the Biden administration, including the five remaining federally funded hydrogen hubs and two direct air capture projects, according to a list obtained by POLITICO’s E&E News that is circulating among lobbyists and Capitol Hill staff.

The compendium marks more than 600 grants totaling more than $20 billion as “terminate.” It appears to include all of the more than 300 grants canceled last week.

“I understand this is the full list that was sent to Office Management and Budget a few weeks ago,” said an energy lobbyist granted anonymity to speak freely. “Last week, they basically just pulled out most, if not all, the blue state projects, and that’s what they announced as cuts.”

“It shows the much bigger list, which will definitely impact a lot more states, … a lot more red states and red districts,” the lobbyist said.

Seven people familiar with internal operations at DOE confirmed the authenticity of the list, which also includes two dozen grants canceled earlier in the year.

DOE has not confirmed the list, and it’s unclear if the cancellations are final.

“The Department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration,” DOE spokesperson Ben Dietderich said in a statement. “No determinations have been made other than what has been previously announced.”

Last week, spurred on by an announcement from OMB Director Russ Vought, DOE scrapped $7.56 billion in financial awards, including for two hydrogen hubs on the West Coast and nearly half of the direct air capture awards approved by the Biden administration. Vought’s announcement noted states where the projects were located, all of which voted for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential election.

The new list includes more than $4.5 billion in canceled funding for the other five hydrogen hubs authorized by DOE under Biden. Those are the HyVelocity hub in the Gulf Coast; the Midwestern and mid-Atlantic hubs; an Appalachian hub known as ARCH 2; and the Heartland hub in the Dakotas, Montana, Wisconsin and Minnesota, which had backing from Interior Secretary Doug Burgum when he was governor of North Dakota before joining the Trump administration.

The hubs were intended to demonstrate production and transport of clean fuel around the country with funding from the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law.

Unlike the nixed funding last week, the cancellations on the new list include hydrogen projects focused on natural gas tied to carbon capture that were backed by some Republicans. The Appalachian hub, for example, is backed by Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.).

Most of the hubs did not respond to requests for comment, but the Midwest hub — which was allocated $1 billion — said it has not received a notice of canceled funding.

The hydrogen developments were funded by DOE’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, a new branch of the department that was launched by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law and has since drawn the ire of Republicans.

The new terminations list also includes both of the largest direct air capture hub awards. The potential loss of some $500 million in matching funds for each hub could put at risk the developments by Occidental Petroleum in Texas and a Battelle-led consortium in the Louisiana congressional district of Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson.

Occidental and Battelle didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

The $3.5 billion direct air capture hub program was intended to jump-start a domestic industry capable of vacuuming carbon dioxide from the sky. To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, scientists have concluded that the world will need to massively increase the deployment of direct air capture and other carbon removal technologies while also rapidly reducing new emissions from oil, gas and coal.

Trade associations representing the carbon removal industry slammed the Trump administration’s potential move to cut off funding for the Texas and Louisiana hubs, which would each be the world’s largest direct air capture projects.

The apparent decision would enable “other countries to take up leadership of the industry, and claim the job creation and economic benefits of carbon removal,” the Carbon Business Council and Carbon Removal Alliance said in a joint statement.

Following the cancellations last week, Wright said more would be coming.

“As this fall goes on, you’ll see cancellations in red and blue states,” he told CNN. “We’ve got to save Americans money.”

The cuts last week targeted Democratic states but also hit some Republican House districts. The more expansive list would make major cuts to Republican states and districts, including through the hydrogen hub cancellations.

“The question is whether or not those red state projects are ‘safe,’ or if they’re just delaying killing the red state projects until after the budget fight is over,” said one energy lobbyist, granted anonymity to speak freely.

The Southern States Energy Board, which is composed largely of Republican states, would get hit with $100 million in grant cancellations, according to the list.

The new list also includes dozens of new cancellations for grants issued by the Grid Deployment Office, which aims to boost the U.S. electricity grid, and the Office of Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, which funds new mineral projects. Grid expansion and U.S. mineral development are big priorities for the Trump administration.

Among the hundreds of new proposed cancellations, DOE also plans to cut a $28 million grant to Ford and several grants totaling roughly $565 million for General Motors, according to the list. Volvo would also see roughly $226 million in grants canceled, the list says.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/6d/8a/53ed1190489a9217e8acadd93701/senate-energy-35474.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 18:02:44.593729

Then in 2018, Congress passed a law that exempted air emissions from animal waste on farms from CERCLA reporting requirements.
The environmental groups’ news release said the ammonia and hydrogen sulfide released by “factory farms” can cause health problems like respiratory diseases, eye and nasal irritation, nausea and death.
“EPA has a responsibility under EPCRA to ensure that information is disclosed to the public,” Hunter Foster said in the release.
“Factory farms emit dangerous amounts of hazardous chemicals — willful ignorance of the data will not change the truth.” The appeal from environmental groups was filed Oct. 3.","Environmental groups are appealing a federal court’s decision to uphold a rule exempting livestock and poultry operations from reporting significant releases of air pollutants.

The environmental groups allege the rule is unlawful and that exposure to ammonia and hydrogen sulfide from these operations is responsible for more deaths annually than exposure to air pollution from coal plants.

The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, which intervened in the case, celebrated the court ruling in its favor and said the rules were “onerous and unnecessary” by requiring producers to file “complex, overreaching reports.”

In August, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia denied the environmental groups’ request for summary judgment and instead granted judgment on behalf of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Cattlemen.

EPCRA and CERCLA

Two laws are at play in the case. The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, or EPCRA, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA, which require certain entities to notify EPA and local officials of a “potentially dangerous” release of a hazardous substance, according to EPA.

EPA has attempted to change the rule, as it relates to animal waste at farms, in the past, according to the court’s filed memorandum of opinion. Then in 2018, Congress passed a law that exempted air emissions from animal waste on farms from CERCLA reporting requirements.

In 2019, EPA filed a final rule to exempt animal waste emissions from EPCRA requirements in order to match the regulations to the recently changed CERCLA rules.

The environmental groups alleged EPA relied “unlawfully” on the congressional changes to CERCLA as justification for changing the rules in EPCRA that let “the industrial animal industry off the hook.”

The opinion from U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly said the EPA rule was “consistent with the best reading” of EPRCA regulations and provides an explanation for exempting animal waste air emissions.

Kelly wrote that to remain consistent with statutory text, EPA had “no leeway to consider the public’s right to access information” and “no discretion to consider environmental effects” when issuing the 2019 rule.

Environmental groups say reporting requirements protect communities

In a joint news release about the decision to appeal the federal court’s decision, the environmental groups said the pollution reporting requirements at hand “are designed to guarantee that communities and emergency responders have access to information necessary to protect themselves from harmful exposure to these extremely hazardous substances.”

A recent peer-reviewed study from the University Michigan found that communities with the highest concentrations of animal feeding operations, like cattle feedlots, dairy farms and hog farms, have elevated levels of harmful fine particulate matter.

According to the study, fine particulate matter was 28% higher in census tracts with high concentrations of cattle feeding operations and 11% higher in census tracts with hog farms.

The environmental groups’ news release said the ammonia and hydrogen sulfide released by “factory farms” can cause health problems like respiratory diseases, eye and nasal irritation, nausea and death.

Kelly Hunter Foster, senior attorney at Waterkeeper Alliance, said people have a “right to know” when hazardous air pollution is released near their homes, schools or work.

“EPA has a responsibility under EPCRA to ensure that information is disclosed to the public,” Hunter Foster said in the release. “Its mandate is to protect human health and the environment, not to create loopholes that allow polluters to hide the truth and put communities and ecosystems at risk.”

In a news release about the court’s opinion, National Cattlemen’s Beef Association said EPCRA and CERCLA regulations were intended to address “massive, severe” environmental contaminants and chemical spills. Instead, the association said, the laws were “weaponized” by animal rights groups targeting “family farms and ranchers.”

Kaitlynn Glover, the association’s executive director of natural resources, said the environmental laws should not “govern” cattle farmers.

“This decision affirms that family cattle producers should not have to file reports for a natural, biological process under a law meant for significant chemical contaminants,” Glover said in the release. “NCBA stepped up to protect family farms and ranches through this litigation and we are pleased that the federal district court has brought clarity to this decades-long discussion.”

Tarah Heinzen, the legal director for the involved environmental group Food & Water Watch, said the Trump Administration’s “see no evil approach will not stand in court.”

“Trump’s EPA is suppressing critical pollution data required to keep frontline communities safe and hold polluters accountable,” Heinzen said in the release. “Factory farms emit dangerous amounts of hazardous chemicals — willful ignorance of the data will not change the truth.”

MONROE, La. – A recent economic impact study shows that the University of Louisiana Monroe (ULM) is one of the largest economic drivers in Northeast Louisiana, contributing $617.6 million in added income each year to the region’s economy.

The study, conducted by Lightcast and reflecting FY 2023–24, highlights the significant role ULM plays in workforce development, community vitality, and long-term economic growth.

Key findings include:

10,464 jobs supported across the region, meaning 1 out of every 18 jobs in Northeast Louisiana is connected to ULM or its students.

$457.7 million in added income from alumni impact, as graduates’ higher earnings fuel local businesses and industries.

$108.2 million from university operations spending, equivalent to the purchase of 2,290 new cars each year.

$32 million from student spending, as students attracted to ULM invest directly into the local economy.

$16.6 million from spin-off companies launched by ULM-related entrepreneurship.

$1.8 million from visitor spending and $1.3 million from research activity, further diversifying regional economic benefits.

Beyond its measurable financial impact, the study found that ULM provides exceptional returns for all stakeholders:

Taxpayers gain $2.40 in added revenue and savings for every $1 invested.

Students gain $5.30 in lifetime earnings for every $1 invested in their ULM education.

Society gains $6.60 in added income and social savings for every $1 invested.

A Strong Return on Investment

The report also highlights ULM’s exceptional return for students, taxpayers, and society:

Students: For every $1 invested, students gain $5.30 in lifetime earnings, with an annual return rate of 20.7%.

Taxpayers: For every $1 of public funding, taxpayers receive $2.40 in added tax revenue and savings, an annual return of 6.1%.

Society: Louisiana gains $6.60 in added income and social benefits for every $1 invested in ULM, totaling more than $1.4 billion in long-term benefits

Beyond Economics

ULM also enhances quality of life through programs, outreach, and partnerships. For example, its Mobile Dental Hygiene Unit provides care to underserved rural communities while training future healthcare professionals, and its Visual and Performing Arts programs add cultural value through numerous musical performances, plays, and art shows and exhibits.

“The University of Louisiana Monroe is more than an educational institution—it is a powerful economic engine that sustains jobs, strengthens families, and builds the future of Northeast Louisiana,” said ULM President Dr. Carrie L. Castille. “This study underscores the vital role ULM plays not only in educating students, but in uplifting every community in the entire region.”

SEIA is the leading voice for a secure and resilient solar and storage industry.
In December, SEIA is hosting a half-day virtual symposium on cybersecurity and reliability for the solar and storage industry.","Solar and energy storage are the lowest-cost, fastest-to-build technologies available to help meet rising electricity demand. The market is quickly responding to this reality. Solar and storage accounted for 84% of new grid capacity additions in 2024, and according to SEIA’s and Wood Mackenzie’s latest Solar Market Insight Report, these technologies made up 82% of new capacity added in the first half of 2025.

Power demand is rising fast, and solar and storage will continue to dominate through 2030 because they are available right now, while new gas, nuclear, and other fuels are years away from making a dent.

As solar and battery storage become more prevalent and the grid becomes increasingly digitally connected, cybersecurity must be a top priority to defend against nation states, hacktivists, criminal organizations, and other threats from obtaining unauthorized access or launching disruptive attacks against critical energy systems.

SEIA is leading the way to ensure that the industry continuously develops and implements best practices, from manufacturing “smart from the start” to operating projects and systems securely.

Threats against critical infrastructure from both state and non-state cyber actors have become more frequent and increasingly sophisticated. Since 2021, Chinese advanced persistent threat groups are targeting critical infrastructure and critical service sectors, including the telecommunications, transportation, lodging, water, and power sectors. In addition, cyber actors attributed to Russia and Iran continue to target critical infrastructure, including the energy sector.

Threats to the solar and storage industry are not just theoretical. Past history of publicly disclosed cyberattacks against solar energy systems shows that the threat actors have the capability and interest in targeting these critical systems. There are emerging areas of vulnerability that the solar industry is working to address to mitigate financial, reputational, and operational risks to the energy sector.

Much like the rest of the energy sector, solar and storage supply chains were not originally designed with security in mind. With many global sources and complex interdependencies, components that enable remote connectivity and digital control must be reliable and secure. While details are still scarce, recent reporting on the potential presence of undocumented communications devices in solar and storage technologies sourced from China underscores the need for policy, technical, and organizational approaches to address the cybersecurity of our energy supply chains.

An important element of bolstering the security of the energy supply chain is to reshore more of it to the United States. Global supply chains not only create digital risks, but also geopolitical ones. Reshoring production of solar modules, inverters, and batteries offers a way to reduce exposure to potential foreign interference, while strengthening domestic jobs and energy independence.

Though cybersecurity is an ever-evolving practice, some protections are evergreen. These include changing default passwords and using strong, unique passwords, removing operational technology (OT) connections from the internet, securing remote access, properly segmenting critical OT systems from enterprise IT networks, implementing and exercising incident response plans, manual backups, and network monitoring, and using a risk-based approach to manage and mitigate vulnerabilities. As the need for strong cybersecurity measures for the electric sector has grown, industry, government, and other stakeholders have worked to develop and disseminate new resources and tools.

For instance, SEIA, along with partners at the North American Reliability Corporation (NERC), Sandia National Laboratories, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the National Nuclear Security Administration, developed a comprehensive list of security recommendations for large-scale solar inverter-based resources and behind-the-meter distributed energy resources (DERs) to support secure and reliable energy delivery.

Similarly, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) partnered with DOE to develop cybersecurity baselines for electric distribution systems and DERs. The baselines will be followed by Implementation Strategies and Adoption Guidelines to support distribution system stakeholders in developing cybersecurity requirements.

SEIA is the leading voice for a secure and resilient solar and storage industry. In December, SEIA is hosting a half-day virtual symposium on cybersecurity and reliability for the solar and storage industry. This event will feature key insights and practices from leading experts to ensure solar and storage are the most reliable and secure energy sources on the grid.",https://seia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AdobeStock_1618415466-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-10-07 22:01:36.959378

Last month, community members, environmental leaders, and public officials boarded a bus for an unforgettable journey through San Antonio’s Southside—a place where pollution, policy failure, and resilience intersect. The Environmental Justice Bus Tour was more than a ride; it was a call to building partnerships for real solutions because it is way past time.

For decades, communities near the former Kelly Air Force Base have endured the long-term effects of environmental contamination. From toxic groundwater plumes to noise and air pollution from nearby industry, residents in the 78211 zip code face serious health risks and environmental hazards—often with little accountability or support.

This tour was designed to connect decision-makers directly to these frontline stories—so they could hear, see, and feel what residents experience daily. It was never about assigning blame—it was about truth-telling, witnessing, and honoring those who spent a lifetime trying to make that change.

What We Saw

Under the Overpass: Our first stop brought us into the noise and chaos of truck traffic, cement dust, and the voices of neighbors like Victor San Miguel, who spoke of day-to-day life amid industrial pollution. KSAT was there to cover the story.

Toxic Vapors in Homes: We examined homes built over a contaminated aquifer, where chemicals like TCE and PCE rise into living spaces—especially during Texas’s brutal heatwaves.

Air Quality Gaps: We reviewed maps that revealed the disturbing truth that air monitors are not located where pollution is situated.

The Impact of Industry: From metal shredders to silica sand dust, trains and fire-prone recycling centers, industrial facilities are pressing up against homes and playgrounds, often with tiny buffers or protection and little to no regulation to control the situation.

The Community Speaks

Along the way, residents and advocates told their stories inside a rented bus.

Diana Lopez, Debra Ponce, Sondra Garcia, and Victor San Miguel shared the history of grassroots organizing since the 1990s.

Cheyenne Rendon, Dee Dee Belmares, Sharron Brown, Judith Temple, and Larry Garcia gave voice to today’s fight against unregulated shredders, against more peaker plants, against the placement of diesel generators beside neighborhood homes, and for accountability.

We also heard from scientists, nonprofit leaders, and neighborhood association leaders who joined in the conversation, many of whom have worked unpaid for years to protect their communities.

Deceleration was also there to provide this coverage.

What We’re Asking For

A pause on new toxic or heavy industrial permits in this small, already impacted area. These neighborhoods have carried the burden of toxic industry for too long.

More vigorous enforcement of existing codes, fire safety, and emissions monitoring.

Long-term health protections and transparent cleanup plans for residents living near contaminated sites.

Inclusion of community voices in city and county planning processes that affect their future.

Hope in Action

The Environmental Justice Bus Tour highlighted not only the problems but also the powerful coalition rising to meet them. From UTSA’s air monitoring projects to City-led tree planting and grassroots-led code reform, the seeds of justice are already in the ground. Now we need to nurture them.

This Was Just the Beginning

Environmental justice isn’t a moment—it’s a movement. And after this tour, more people are paying attention. Our community is organized, and they are speaking for themselves. They are asking for a seat at the decision-making table that affects them, because the science is clear and the need is urgent.

Now we’re asking our leaders to take this information back with them—and use it to make better-informed decisions rooted in policy, investment, and courage. Our collective work will move forward because our community is counting on us to do so.

We're at the point now where renewable energy and energy efficiency are by far the cheapest forms of energy available,” Darin said.
According to a report from the International Renewable Energy Agency, 91% of new renewable energy projects built in 2024 were cheaper than their fossil fuel counterparts.
Renewable energy investments Federal government investments into renewable energy will continue to take a hit, according to a report from E2, a nonpartisan business analysis group.
“The primary driver of Illinois’ clean energy boom is Illinois’ policies.","Illinois officials pledged to take on new green energy projects and step away from fossil fuel reliance, but the state has hit a major roadblock in that pledge – the federal government.

In 2021, Illinois became the first state in the Midwest to pass legislation creating a roadmap for the state to ban coal and other fossil fuels, while dedicating over $1 billion to rapidly boost the state’s wind, solar and nuclear energy production.

By 2030, the state’s existing coal plants would have to emit zero carbon emissions or be shut down. By 2050, the state would mandate only clean energy sources for electricity.

""We can't outrun or hide from climate change – not to the north, where the Boundary Waters burn; not to the south, where [Hurricane] Ida swallows lives and livelihoods in the blink of an eye,"" Pritzker said in a statement when he signed the bill into law.

Four years and a new president later, hopes for a cleaner electrical grid in Illinois are looking darker.

Sierra Club Illinois Director Jack Darin said Illinois and the federal government have two different, conflicting energy goals, and the state will have to rely on itself to accomplish its green energy goals.

“We're doing what we can to attract those projects and those good jobs here to Illinois, but yes, it absolutely gets harder when the federal government is trying to chase them out of the country,” Darin said. “Illinois is on its own in building our clean energy future.”

President Donald Trump’s administration has reversed much of the green energy work done under President Joe Biden. In June, Trump canceled nearly $250 million in grants going toward Illinois companies for green energy projects. Tax credits for installing solar panels or purchasing electric vehicles are set to be eliminated under Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill.

Environmental advocacy group Prairie Rivers Network’s Director of Energy and Community Resiliency Amanda Pankua said the federal government is making it harder to invest in clean energy for companies and consumers.

“We know that clean energy is the cheapest and often the quickest way to get new, clean, non-polluting, cheap electricity onto the grid. And this administration is rolling back incentives to make that happen,” Pankua said.

Trump’s cuts are also affecting state programs. Trump pulled around $130 million from Illinois’ Solar for All program, which helped low-income residents install rooftop solar panels and other related programs.

Pankua said tax credits like this are the “bread and butter” of transitioning people to green energy. She added without it, moving toward green energy will be harder.

While Illinois has pledged to shut down coal plants over the next several decades, the U.S. Department of Energy is looking to keep those same plants running longer.

The DOE announced last week a $625 million investment in recommissioning old coal plants, developing new wastewater management systems to extend the life of coal plants and funding coal plant technology improvements.

Reenergizing coal energy production will help save jobs and lower energy costs while being more reliable than green energy, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in a press release.

“These funds will help keep our nation’s coal plants operating and will be vital to keeping electricity prices low and the lights on without interruption,” Wright said in a press release.

The DOE hasn’t yet announced which projects will receive money and whether funding will be grants or loans.

Darin said the Trump administration has it backward and green energy is the cheaper, safer energy source, not coal.

“These steps would be a giant step backward on climate action, but also a huge increase in costs to consumers. We're at the point now where renewable energy and energy efficiency are by far the cheapest forms of energy available,” Darin said.

According to a report from the International Renewable Energy Agency, 91% of new renewable energy projects built in 2024 were cheaper than their fossil fuel counterparts.

Renewable energy investments

Federal government investments into renewable energy will continue to take a hit, according to a report from E2, a nonpartisan business analysis group.

Over 10,000 jobs in clean energy and $14 billion in renewable energy investments have been canceled or downsized in the U.S. since January over uncertainty about changes to energy policy from the federal government, according to the report.

In Illinois, electric bus producer Lion Electric’s plans for a facility in Joliet and electric vehicle manufacturer Stellantis NV’s plan for a battery and large parts hub in Belvidere will be delayed for years.

E2 estimates the two projects’ cancellation and delays account for over $3 billion in investments lost and nearly 2,500 jobs lost.

With a loss of interest from the federal government, Illinois will have to fill the gaps left by the Trump administration.

“The primary driver of Illinois’ clean energy boom is Illinois’ policies. However, we're not immune,” Darin said. “When Trump is raising rates to prop up fossil fuel companies in other states. It does have an impact on prices here in Illinois.”

Environmental activists hope Illinois can fill some of those gaps with legislation in the October veto session.

The new Model Y, costing just under $40,000 with a stripped-down interior, follows a slump in Tesla sales covering most of the past year due to anti-Elon Musk boycotts targeting the company. The company is also offering a cheaper version of its Model 3 for under $35,000.

The company is under intense pressure to lift sales but is facing big challenges. In addition to anti-Musk backlash, it is contending with a likely hit to demand after a federal tax credit worth as $7,500 for EV purchases expired at the end of September.

Tesla stock fell more than 2.5% to $441.08 in late afternoon trading Tuesday. It had closed Monday up more than 5% after the company teased fans with cryptic postings on social media about an imminent product announcement.

The stock has been trading near all-time highs even though both sales and profits have plunged in recent quarters.

Compared to previous models, the new Model Y comes with a shorter 321-mile driving range, fewer audio speakers and a fabric interior, not microsuede. The model also lacks a panoramic glass roof and a touchscreen in the second row.

The new Model 3 has also cut down on the driving range, ambient lighting and other features.

News that Entergy was set to power Meta’s flagship 2GW “Hyperion” data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana, first broke late last year.
To power the data center, Entergy plans to construct three gas-fired power plants, with a combined capacity of 2.26GW.
To serve the data center, Entergy will build several new transmission lines, including a $1.2 billion 100-mile 500kV project, slated for completion in December 2026.
According to Data Center Map, it has 23 operational facilities.","“We’re seeing interest in things as small as 100-plus megawatts all the way up to gigawatt-scale projects,” he said to Bloomberg. The company is engaged with a “fairly robust pipeline of other hyperscalers.” According to the utility, the interest is based on the region's ample land access, a willing government, and reduced hurricane risk compared to the Gulf Coast.

At present, Entergy, which supplies power to customers across Arkansas, Mississippi, and Texas, has a data center pipeline of between five to 10GW. According to May, the utility is confident that it can meet the power demands of any interested hyperscaler. “As I like to say, ‘Use all you want, we’ll make more,’” he said.

News that Entergy was set to power Meta’s flagship 2GW “Hyperion” data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana, first broke late last year. The campus is planned for construction on 2,250 acres between the municipalities of Rayville and Delhi, about 30 miles (48.2km) east of Monroe. Renderings of the campus suggest up to nine buildings are being planned, with construction expected to be completed in phases through 2030.

To power the data center, Entergy plans to construct three gas-fired power plants, with a combined capacity of 2.26GW. The utility obtained approval to construct the facilities from the Louisiana Public Service Commission in August.

Two of the units are expected to come online in 2028, with the third facility, built at Entergy Louisiana's existing Waterford site in St. Charles Parish, expected to commence operations in late 2029.

To serve the data center, Entergy will build several new transmission lines, including a $1.2 billion 100-mile 500kV project, slated for completion in December 2026. In addition, the utility will construct two substations, six customer-owned substations, and eight new 230kV transmission lines.

In June, the utility broke ground on the first substation. The Smalling Substation is being constructed in Richland Parish and will be entirely funded by Meta. When completed, it will span 55 acres and connect to high-voltage power lines that bring energy from across the region and deliver it to the Meta site. Meta has offered to offset most of the costs for Entergy's customers, with the company set to pay the full annual revenue for the plants for 15 years.

However, the project has faced opposition, with environmental groups arguing that Entergy did not follow the correct procedure when proposing the new gas-fired plants, which could result in significant costs for ratepayers.

At present, Louisiana is a relatively small data center market. According to Data Center Map, it has 23 operational facilities. However, due to the sector's growth, the state has increasingly positioned itself as a potential hub for large AI-focused facilities.",https://media.datacenterdynamics.com/media/images/GettyImages-1986221985.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 17:06:29.943612

Infratil Newsletter – September 2025

Infratil Investor Day

We had a fantastic turnout from institutional investors and analysts at Infratil’s Investor Day in Sydney on 18 September. As Chair Alison Gerry said in her welcome, with Infratil now in the S&P/ASX 200 index and more than 40% of our investment portfolio in Australia, we are actively trying to grow our Australian shareholder base - which is part of the reason for hosting this event in Australia.

The theme of our Investor Day was ‘Portfolio Set for Growth’ with CEO Jason Boyes talking about our plans to prioritise further investment in the fast-growing digital and renewable energy sectors while simplifying our current portfolio.

You can watch Jason’s presentation, as well as those from four of our portfolio companies and the Morrison management team online at https://infratil.com/for-investors/investor-days/.

One of the key slides from Jason’s presentation sets out how we are thinking about the role of the various businesses within the ‘pillars’ of our portfolio and the potential to grow Infratil’s market cap to NZ$20 billion over the next five years.

We are prioritising capital towards assets that will drive long-term shareholder value and looking at divesting businesses unlikely to scale under our ownership. This is expected to result in a smaller number of larger, high conviction assets in in Pillar 1 & 2. Pillar 3 businesses are those that we will look to grow over the next three to five years.

On 18 September we announced a strategic review of Australian medical imaging business Qscan, with our 57% shareholding last valued at NZ$460 million. This follows on from our announcement in August that we had sold our 50% stake in RetireAustralia for NZ$328 million, with the transaction due to be completed by the end of 2025.

Further announcements are expected this financial year as we progress toward our $1 billion divestment target. Proceeds from divestments are expected to be reinvested into existing or new opportunities that align with our growth ambitions. CDC and Gurīn Energy’s Project Vanda are two existing candidates that we have noted for this potential reinvestment.

CDC confirms step-up in demand for future-proof capacity

CDC CEO Greg Boorer told our Sydney Investor Day audience that he hates going to sleep because it means he can’t be talking to someone about growing the business. “I’m more confident than ever that we can sell every megawatt that we can build”, he said, noting that global customers are tracking CDC’s build programme very closely.

On 24 September he proved that his customer focus is getting results, with CDC announcing it had secured approximately 100MW of new contracted capacity. To put this in context, this new demand equates to just over a quarter of CDC’s existing operating capacity in June. This keeps CDC on track to double its FY25 earnings by FY27, with approximately 95% of the required forecast lease revenues now under contract.

The announcement also underscores the strong, ongoing demand in the Australasian data centre market. CDC noted that contract sizes are getting larger with a “tsunami” of demand from hyperscale and AI customers. They are now CDC’s largest customer segment, contributing about three times the revenue they did just four years ago.

The contract announcement is hot on the heels of CDC confirming that it plans to build its first data centre in Western Australia. The new campus is to be built in Maddington, about 20 kilometres from central Perth. CDC said the decision to build in Western Australia reflects the region’s increasing importance for national and regional security, with its connectivity and proximity to Southeast Asia another potential benefit. The region also has an abundance of renewable energy.

Some of the technology trends that are helping differentiate CDC’s data centres from other providers are shown in the slide below. CDC’s data centres have been built to handle very high floor loadings, so even their oldest data centres can accommodate increasingly heavy computing technology. CDC recirculates water in a ‘closed loop’ for cooling purposes, which means minimal water use, and this is helping expedite consenting for new CDC sites in areas where water supply is limited.

Slide 19 – Infratil Investor Day: CDC Update

Longer tax credits for Longroad Energy

In mid-August Longroad Energy received updated regulatory guidance on when wind and solar projects qualify for tax credits in the United States. At our Sydney Investor Day, the Longroad team said they now had about 6GW of projects qualified, with scope to add more to this before July 2026. More importantly, about half of Longroad Energy’s current tax credits are for battery project spend, and these tax credits will continue to be available on battery investment into the 2030’s.

The other positive aspect of their presentation is the soaring demand for electricity, as shown on the slide below, with approximately 40GW of new capacity being added annually over the last five years and about 80GW per year forecast from 2025 to 2045. This growth is driven by new data centres, industrial growth and electrification. Longroad Energy is targeting growth in its operating portfolio from 5.5GW in 2025 to 10GW by 2028.

Longroad has just confirmed construction of their seventh renewable energy project in Texas, which is set to deliver energy for Meta. This is a clear example of the convergence between our two growth thematics: renewable energy and digital infrastructure.

Longroad Energy CEO Paul Gaynor said, “1000 Mile is Longroad’s largest solar project to date and its output will advance Meta’s target to support its data center operations with 100% clean energy.” It is estimated that the 1000 Mile project will reduce regional emissions by approximately 475,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent annually.

Slide 12 – Infratil Investor Day: Longroad Update

Gurīn Energy poised for growth

Gurīn Energy’s CEO Assaad Razzouk was recently recognised in Singapore’s The Peak magazine Power List for his efforts to drive energy transition in Asia. The potential demand for renewable energy across the region is estimated at more than 250GW by 2030, reflecting population and data centre demand growth, together with government net zero targets.

Gurīn Energy has already identified 8GW of mixed mid and late-stage projects in various Asian markets out to 2030, with 5.5GW owned by Gurīn Energy. Presenting at Infratil’s Investor Day, the Gurīn Energy team detailed their work to develop these solar and battery projects across the Philippines, Japan, South Korea and Singapore (see slide below). Each project requires consideration of varying local conditions as part of Gurīn Energy’s environmental and social screening framework.

The Vanda Solar and Battery Project would be among the largest planned solar-plus-storage projects in the world and is a joint venture between Gurīn Energy and Gentari International Renewables. The project has been granted an import licence from Singapore and the next key milestone is an export licence from Indonesia.

Gurīn Energy’s involvement in Project Vanda would be transformational for the business and financial close is expected in 2026. Construction would begin in 2027 with Phase 1 expected to be operational in 2028.To date, about 90% of the necessary land has been acquired and total capex is expected to be US$2-3 billion, with US$500 million of equity required.

AI agent and sustainability initiatives grab global attention for One NZ

Despite the wider challenges posed by the New Zealand economy, One NZ is continuing to deliver steady performance. One NZ CEO Jason Paris said “We are competing well and have good trading momentum. We are attracting and retaining high value customers through our differentiated One NZ Satellite and One Wallet propositions. Our IT modernisation programme is on track, and we continue to deploy AI across every part of our business.”

The team’s commitment to moving fast in trialling AI means One NZ is working together with global AI providers as a test bed for solutions. Following recent storms, for example, AI agents were monitoring the network and automatically reducing the power usage on cellsites in areas where power supply had been affected. AI is also being used to develop a customer experience score that identifies customers having network issues and how these can be resolved, all before the customer needs to contact One NZ.

One NZ is also making strong progress in sustainability, winning the ‘Medium Company of the Year Award’ in the Global Sustainability Awards in September.

New wings soar at Wellington Airport

Early August saw the unveiling of a new terminal centrepiece, a 15-metre artwork sculpture representing the local bird spirit Manu Muramura, in Wellington Airport.

Wellington’s international passengers have consistently tracked ahead of 2024 levels in recent months, with August numbers up more than 5% on last year. Monthly domestic passengers have also lifted in recent months, with August numbers down just 1% from last year despite a larger reduction in capacity.

International flights are set to get a further boost with Qantas’ plans to add more summer capacity into Wellington, including plans to introduce one of their new A220-300 aircraft on the Brisbane route from early next year. Wellington Airport is also working to open up new routes with a Memorandum of Understanding signed with China’s busiest airport in September. Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport hosted more than 76 million passengers in 2024 and the new agreement includes a focus on developing the aviation market between the two regions.

Other recent developments

Infratil CEO Jason Boyes was interviewed by Australian stockbroking firm Bell Potter in early September. You can watch the interview on Bell Potter’s YouTube channel.

In September, Qscan announced the acquisition of ClinRad’s four clinics providing x-ray, CT and ultrasound services in Brisbane. This expands Qscan’s footprint to more areas with strong growth opportunities.

Auckland Radiology opened its new purpose-built flagship clinic in Remuera, Auckland, in August. With more space and advanced diagnostic imaging equipment, the clinic will help improve patient outcomes and reduce delays in treatment.

A few months ago, the New Zealand Youth Choir were named “Choir of the World” at the prestigious Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod in Wales. We’re pleased to share this video celebrating their achievement and acknowledging our support

“The primary driver of Illinois’ clean energy boom is Illinois’ policies.","Illinois officials pledged to take on new green energy projects and step away from fossil fuel reliance, but the state has hit a major roadblock in that pledge – the federal government.

In 2021, Illinois became the first state in the Midwest to pass legislation creating a roadmap for the state to ban coal and other fossil fuels, while dedicating over $1 billion to rapidly boost the state’s wind, solar and nuclear energy production.

By 2030, the state’s existing coal plants would have to emit zero carbon emissions or be shut down. By 2050, the state would mandate only clean energy sources for electricity.

""We can't outrun or hide from climate change – not to the north, where the Boundary Waters burn; not to the south, where [Hurricane] Ida swallows lives and livelihoods in the blink of an eye,"" Pritzker said in a statement when he signed the bill into law.

Four years and a new president later, hopes for a cleaner electrical grid in Illinois are looking darker.

Sierra Club Illinois Director Jack Darin said Illinois and the federal government have two different, conflicting energy goals, and the state will have to rely on itself to accomplish its green energy goals.

“We're doing what we can to attract those projects and those good jobs here to Illinois, but yes, it absolutely gets harder when the federal government is trying to chase them out of the country,” Darin said. “Illinois is on its own in building our clean energy future.”

President Donald Trump’s administration has reversed much of the green energy work done under President Joe Biden. In June, Trump canceled nearly $250 million in grants going toward Illinois companies for green energy projects. Tax credits for installing solar panels or purchasing electric vehicles are set to be eliminated under Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill.

,EVs,2025-10-07 19:31:32+00:00,The Tech Portal,Tesla launches cheaper 'Standard' Model Y and Model 3 as US tax credits end,"Ashutosh Singh, Soumyadeep Sarkar",,,,,https://thetechportal.com/2025/10/08/tesla-launches-cheaper-standard-model-y-and-model-3-as-us-tax-credits-end/,"In the United States, the Model Y Standard starts at $39,990 (~ 10% less expensive than the prior base model), while the Model 3 Standard begins at $36,990.
In certain states with additional incentives (like New York), buyers may see even lower prices, with the Model 3 Standard potentially dropping to $34,990 and the Model Y Standard to $37,990.
Meanwhile, the Model Y Standard comes with a slightly stronger 300-horsepower rear-wheel-drive motor and matches the same 321-mile estimated range.
For example, the Model Y Standard features a redesigned front look, smaller 18-inch wheels, and a simplified interior with cloth seats and manual seat adjustments.
Actually, the monthly lease for the Model Y increased to $529–$599, while Model 3 lease rates grew to $429–$759 to offset the loss of federal subsidies.","With the US ending tax benefits for electric cars, Tesla has launched more affordable versions of two of its most popular electric vehicles, the Model Y and Model 3, introducing the new ‘Standard’ models. In the United States, the Model Y Standard starts at $39,990 (~ 10% less expensive than the prior base model), while the Model 3 Standard begins at $36,990. In certain states with additional incentives (like New York), buyers may see even lower prices, with the Model 3 Standard potentially dropping to $34,990 and the Model Y Standard to $37,990. These models come after the federal $7,500 EV tax credit expired.

Despite the lower price tags, the company claims that the new Model 3 and Model Y retain strong performance and an impressive driving range. The Model 3 Standard is powered by a 286-horsepower rear-wheel-drive motor and offers an estimated range of 321 miles on a single charge when equipped with 18-inch wheels. Meanwhile, the Model Y Standard comes with a slightly stronger 300-horsepower rear-wheel-drive motor and matches the same 321-mile estimated range. Both vehicles use a 69.5 kWh battery pack and can charge at a maximum rate of 225 kW using Tesla’s Supercharger network.

However, to reach these lower prices, the Elon Musk-led EV giant has made several design and feature adjustments. For example, the Model Y Standard features a redesigned front look, smaller 18-inch wheels, and a simplified interior with cloth seats and manual seat adjustments. It also replaces the panoramic glass roof found in higher-priced models with a more standard closed roof. From a production point of view, the new Model Y is about 20% cheaper to make than the previous version, with the company expected to produce around 250,000 units annually in the US by 2026. Also, the Model 3 Standard has undergone similar changes, with some updates to the interior and exterior to keep costs down while maintaining the car’s core performance and range.

The timing of this launch is closely linked to the recent expiration of the federal EV tax credit at the end of September 2025. The change has already affected Tesla customers, with lease prices increasing by up to $120 per month for older models. Actually, the monthly lease for the Model Y increased to $529–$599, while Model 3 lease rates grew to $429–$759 to offset the loss of federal subsidies.

This latest effort becomes even more critical for the company, as it is facing a challenging year. Its stock has fallen about 25% since early 2025, with Q1 profits dropping 71% to $19.3 billion in revenue, and Q2 deliveries falling 13% to 384,122 vehicles. The company, which recently revealed a potential $1 trillion payout for Elon Musk, is continuing to face significant legal scrutiny. Tesla was recently sued by the family of a teenager killed in a crash involving the Cybertruck door design. Last month, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) also launched a preliminary investigation into 174,000 Tesla Model Y cars from 2021 due to reported issues with their electronic door handles.",https://thetechportal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/tesla-new-model-y.webp,N,,2025-10-07 16:01:19.733396

With DOE’s investment and DOI’s leasing action, that foundation just got stronger.
Thank you for choosing reliability over rhetoric, production over pretense, and American energy over dependence.
Emily Arthun is President & CEO of the American Coal Council.","Every so often Washington makes a decision that isn’t about political buzzwords or rhetoric, instead it’s about whether the lights stay on and whether a paystub shows up on a Friday. This is one of those moments. The Department of Energy’s $625 million commitment to reinvigorate America’s coal fleet, paired with the Department of the Interior’s decision to open 13.1 million acres for coal leasing while streamlining approvals and right-sizing royalties, tells the country—plainly—that reliable, affordable, plentiful power is back at the center of national policy. On behalf of producers, transporters, suppliers, utilities, and the hundreds of thousands of men and women whose craft keeps America powered, the American Coal Council says: thank you.

For years, we were told that “something else” would seamlessly replace baseload power. But reality is a stubborn thing, and peak demand is unforgiving. During unrelenting summer heat or frigid winter snaps hard, press releases don’t turn turbines and hashtags don’t boil water. Actual baseload megawatts do. The Department of Energy’s investment recognizes this truth. By directing $350 million to recommission and retrofit coal units, DOE is turning near-term reliability from a talking point into dispatchable capacity. By targeting rural affordability and flexibility—funding wastewater upgrades that extend plant life and co-firing options that add operational agility, DOE is giving operators the tools they need to perform when the grid needs them most. This is not theory. It is steel, wire, boilers, and crews—standing ready at 6 p.m. on a windless January evening and at 3 p.m. on a hot August weekday when factories and data centers are pulling hard.

Interior’s action is the complementary half of the same common-sense equation. Power plants cannot run on optimism; they run on fuel secured through lawful leases, workable permits, and predictable timelines. Opening 13.1 million acres for coal leasing, guided by Executive Orders 14261 and 14241, moves coal from the “constrained input” column to the “accessible resource” column—exactly where it belongs in a nation intent on reindustrialization. When Secretary Doug Burgum signed the policy initiative to expand leasing, reduce the royalty rate to a market reality of 7%, and cut red tape on reviews, he sent an unmistakable message: we will produce energy here at home, with American workers and American standards, and we will do it on a schedule that aligns with real-world demand.

This is energy policy that respects the American worker. From Freedom and Falkirk in North Dakota to expansions at Warrior Met, Skyline, Spring Creek, and West Antelope III, Interior’s leasing posture translates into shifts on the mine plan, trains on the rail, barges on the river, and megawatts on the wire. It also translates into the morning routines of families whose livelihoods depend on this industry: lunches packed on a kitchen counter, kids on a bus, a mortgage paid, a pew filled on Sunday. When Washington gets energy right, it strengthens the very communities that anchor this country.

The administration’s emphasis on recovering critical minerals from mine waste is another example of practical stewardship. Through Secretary’s Order 3436, Interior’s push—with USGS and state partners—to map deposits and fast-track projects for uranium, zinc, germanium, tellurium, and rare earths recognizes that the future of defense, manufacturing, and energy security runs through American resourcefulness. Coal communities know the terrain, the geology, and the logistics better than anyone. Enlisting their expertise to extract additional value from legacy sites turns yesterday’s tailings into tomorrow’s strategic inputs—and it does so while remediating lands with the people who know them best.

We also welcome the clarity and regulatory certainty that come with streamlining approvals. Energy projects fail not because they are impossible but because the calendar gets weaponized. A maintenance upgrade that should take months becomes a multi-year odyssey; a routine expansion sinks under the weight of duplicative reviews and shifting standards. Interior’s move to accelerate leasing decisions and use commonsense approaches under NEPA is not a “giveaway.” It is an admission that the public interest is not served by paralysis. The public interest is served by good projects built well, observed by real inspectors, and delivered on time.

DOE’s investment framework mirrors that realism. Funding for wastewater systems is not glamorous, but it is the difference between a plant that limps toward retirement and a plant that earns another decade of dependable service. Support for dual-fuel retrofits and natural-gas co-firing does not “replace” coal; it gives operators the flexibility to meet the moment without walking away from the backbone of baseload. In short, the Department’s program honors the craft of the people who run these plants—the engineers who balance heat rates and emissions profiles, the maintenance crews who crawl boilers in August, the operators who manage frequency and voltage when the grid sways.

Americans have learned, the hard way, that you can’t command the weather, you can’t legislate inertia, and you cannot build an AI economy on wishful thinking. Algorithms sleep when the power fails. Semiconductor furnaces do not “wait” for wind. Hospitals cannot postpone a January night. The choice before us was never “old versus new.” It was “real versus rhetorical.” By aligning leasing, permitting, and investment with the grid we actually live on, DOI and DOE choose the real. That choice protects consumers from spiraling bills and rolling blackouts. It protects industry from the whiplash of scarcity pricing and curtailments. And it protects national security by anchoring energy in American hands.

To the men and women in hard hats and coveralls who make this all work: today’s actions are an affirmation of your place in America’s future. Miners in the high plains and the hollows, dispatchers in control rooms, electricians and mechanics who keep the systems tight and true—you have been told for a decade that you are the past. The truth is simpler: you are essential. You were essential when polar air snapped pipelines and coal carried the load. You were essential when a summer heat wave pushed reserve margins thin and coal units stood up and took the weight. You will be essential tomorrow as we build steel, pour concrete, and power the data centers that will define the next economy.

To our partners across the value chain—railroads and barge lines, port operators, equipment manufacturers, service providers, and utilities—these decisions offer something we have been missing: predictability. Predictability is the hidden currency of capital planning. It lets a mine invest in a new section, a plant invest in a turbine overhaul, a utility file an integrated resource plan that treats firm power as more than a contingency. Predictability also strengthens environmental performance, because operators can adopt better technology on a timetable that makes sense instead of on a roulette wheel of delays and litigation.

We are grateful to Secretary Burgum and the Department of the Interior for opening the acreage, restoring competitiveness through a fair royalty rate, and cutting through the procedural fog that too often chokes good projects. We are grateful to Secretary Chris Wright and the Department of Energy for funding the practical, near-term upgrades that translate into reliability and affordability for families and businesses. And we appreciate the complementary work by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and DOE Undersecretary P. Wells Griffith to align policy across agencies so that producers, utilities, and communities get one clear message: America intends to produce energy—responsibly, abundantly, and at home.

The American Coal Council believes in an “all-that-works” strategy that earns its keep. Coal has carried the baseload for generations because it is engineered to do so—because it is stockpiled on site, resistant to weather shocks, and dispatchable when it counts. That truth does not erase other sources; it anchors them. It provides the firm foundation on which innovation stands. With DOE’s investment and DOI’s leasing action, that foundation just got stronger.

We measure policy not by the decibels of its announcement but by the steadiness of its results: bills that don’t wreck a family budget, factories that don’t idle on hot afternoons, winter nights that pass without incident, and small towns that hum with work. By that measure, these decisions are wins—wins for consumers, for workers, for national security, and for an American future that builds instead of imports, that competes instead of concedes, that keeps faith with the people who make and move the power that keeps us free.

So yes—thank you. Thank you for choosing reliability over rhetoric, production over pretense, and American energy over dependence. Now let’s get to work.

A major U.S. investment plan could mark the start of a new chapter for one of Detroit’s most storied automakers.","Stellantis is reportedly preparing a massive $10 billion investment plan, with a focus squarely on the United States — its most profitable and strategically vital market.

According to multiple reports, the automaker may soon announce about $5 billion in new investments, adding to a similar amount earmarked earlier in the year. The plan would target key manufacturing states, such as Michigan and Illinois, signaling a renewed commitment to domestic production, job creation, and product expansion after years of focusing on lower-cost markets.

Rebuilding the American Core –

Under CEO Antonio Filosa, who took over in May, Stellantis appears to be recalibrating its strategy to rebuild brand strength in the U.S. and reestablish its industrial footprint. The company is expected to channel the funds into reopening plants, launching new models, and expanding its workforce. The Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois, which has been idle since February 2023, is said to play a central role, with Stellantis already pledging to return roughly 1,500 employees to work there.

Filosa’s approach contrasts with that of former CEO Carlos Tavares, who aggressively relocated production and engineering operations to cost-efficient regions, such as Mexico, and heavily invested in Europe, where profitability remains weaker. Filosa’s new roadmap appears to prioritize the U.S., where demand for trucks, SUVs, and muscle cars continues to drive profits.

Reviving Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep® –

Sources indicate that Stellantis is intent on revitalizing the Jeep® brand — long considered the company’s crown jewel in America — after recent declines in market share. The Dodge brand could also see renewed attention, with whispers suggesting potential investment in a new HEMI®-powered Dodge Charger model to complement the all-electric Charger Daytona and upcoming twin-turbo HURRICANE Dodge Charger SIXPACK cars. Meanwhile, Chrysler may receive long-overdue product expansion, a move previously hinted at by CEO Christine Feuell at the Chrysler Carlisle Nationals earlier this year.

If realized, these efforts could reinvigorate Stellantis’ reputation among American consumers and restore confidence in the automaker’s domestic operations.

Political and Economic Timing –

The timing of this investment wave also aligns with broader industry trends. With President Donald Trump’s administration incentivizing U.S. manufacturing and threatening steep tariffs on imported vehicles, Stellantis’ move could help curry favor with the administration while safeguarding its North American supply chain.

Chairman John Elkann has reportedly met with President Trump to discuss U.S. manufacturing commitments, including plans for a new midsize pickup — potentially bound for Belvidere. That vehicle would likely compete in a red-hot segment dominated by the Toyota Tacoma and Ford Ranger.

Navigating Tariff Risks –

Stellantis is reportedly lobbying the government to ease proposed 25% tariffs that could impact its Ram Heavy Duty pickups, currently built in Mexico. Shifting some production back to the U.S. would not only mitigate that risk but also strengthen Stellantis’ “Made in America” image.

While the exact projects remain under review, one thing is clear — Stellantis is preparing to double down on its American roots.

“This demonstrates the critical role that vehicle batteries can play in powering the nation’s grid, accelerating American energy independence and dominance.
Their partnership launched last summer with vehicle-to-home (V2H) capability, a less-complicated function than sharing stored energy with the local grid.
The program marks a milestone for distributed power plants in America, demonstrating how large EV batteries can stabilize the grid, provide backup power to homes, and lower overall energy costs.
“Enabling customers to not only power their homes, but send power directly back to the grid in times of need, helps customers with financial incentives, utilities with more power capacity, and society through more grid reliability and sustainable energy practices.","The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Or, in this case, three pickup trucks.

Sunrun, the largest provider of residential solar, battery energy storage, and home-to-grid power plants in the United States, has activated the nation’s first vehicle-to-grid (V2G) distributed power plant in partnership with Maryland’s largest utility, Exelon subsidiary Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BGE).

Starting in July, enrolled Ford F-150 Lightning trucks (yes, all three!) dispatched energy to the grid during peak summer demand hours from 5 to 9 p.m. on weekdays. Participating customers received a payment based on the amount of energy shared, up to a maximum of $1,000 for the ‘dispatching season,’ which ran through the end of September.

“This demonstrates the critical role that vehicle batteries can play in powering the nation’s grid, accelerating American energy independence and dominance. It’s great to see our partnership with BGE and Ford move to this commercial stage,” observed Sunrun CEO Mary Powell. “In addition to showing how electric vehicles (EVs) can power homes, add electrons to the grid, and help utilities meet peak electricity demand, this program also creates extra income opportunities for customers.”

While certainly small to start and slow to progress, the pilot promises incredible potential, as Powell recognizes, and could represent the future of resiliency, both for homeowners and electric utilities.

How We Got Here

BGE was awarded grant funding from the U.S. Department of Energy to create an EV virtual power plant (VPP) and partnered with Sunrun to develop and administer the program. Their partnership launched last summer with vehicle-to-home (V2H) capability, a less-complicated function than sharing stored energy with the local grid.

“This program is a significant proof of concept — no other market player has done this — and the goal is to expand these programs all around the country,” said Powell at the time. “This exciting partnership lays the foundation for the power grid of the future, where electric vehicle owners can contribute to grid resiliency and utility price stability for everyone.”

In June, Maryland’s Public Service Commission unanimously voted to adopt a comprehensive suite of V2G interconnection rules, becoming the first state to do so and paving the way for broader adoption. The rules were established by the Vehicle-Grid Integration Council (VGIC), an advocacy group dedicated to advancing EVs and associated technologies, including smart charging.

This summer, Ford and Sunrun pushed the envelope further in the name of pioneering V2G energy dispatch, activating the nation’s first residential bidirectional EV distributed power plant. Using the tandem’s co-developed Home Integration System, pilot participants sent energy from their all-electric pickup truck batteries to their homes and the grid. When paired with the Home Integration System and Sunrun’s Charge Station Pro, Ford’s F-150 Lightning can deliver up to 9.6 kW of power.

The program marks a milestone for distributed power plants in America, demonstrating how large EV batteries can stabilize the grid, provide backup power to homes, and lower overall energy costs.

“Vehicle-to-grid technology lets electric vehicles do more than just drive—they can actually help power our homes and communities,” confirmed Divesh Gupta, director of clean energy solutions at BGE. “By sharing stored energy with the grid when it is needed most, these vehicles make our energy system more reliable, more efficient, and even help lower electricity costs for customers.”

“When we enacted the DRIVE Act in 2024, it was exactly this type of innovation and collaboration that we hoped to unlock,” added Maryland State Delegate David Fraser-Hidalgo. “I am excited to see this milestone reached, as we hope to see these types of customer-centered solutions scale up to meet our state’s electricity needs.”

Overcoming Technological Hurdles

EVs have long been acknowledged as a potential ‘new’ power source for electric utilities. Researchers in the late 1990s theorized that compensation for dispatching to the grid would help offset ownership costs, and the EV’s battery life would not be noticeably impacted by such use. If only 25% of the United States adopted electric vehicles with bidirectional chargers, they found, grid operators would have access to a staggering 660 gigawatts (GW) of capacity.

It’s no surprise, then, that the vehicle-to-grid space has attracted attention from companies outside of Sunrun and Ford, including microinverter monolith Enphase, which has products participating in dozens of virtual power plants across the country.

“The battery in your car is 10 times the size of a normal stationary battery that you put on the side of the home. The value of that as a flexible asset to the grid is huge,” Andy Newbold, Enphase’s senior director of corporate communications, told Factor This.

Enphase recently unveiled its new IQ Bidirectional EV Charger architecture, featuring V2H and V2G capabilities. The charger connects to the EV’s direct current (DC) port, enabling homeowners to charge their vehicle, power their home, and share energy with the grid through the Enphase app. The offering has been a long time coming, slowed by the reluctance of various stakeholders to agree on technical standards.

“The automakers needed to come together and set universal standards, otherwise you’d have to build a different charger for every car,” Enphase’s Newbold explained. “That happened over the past year. We’re not fully there yet, but it’s close. That’s why we [now] actually have demonstrated a product.”

“I think vehicle to home is a no-brainer. Makes a lot of sense, and it’s not something that would be happening every day,” he added. “When it comes to vehicle-to-grid, there are still things to figure out: the automaker standards, the utility standards, how these resources are allowed [to be used] on the grid, stuff like that.”

Newbold expects to see much of the mess sorted out over the next six to eight months.

“And then I think a lot of really compelling products will hit the market, and homeowners are gonna have their minds blown, to be honest.”

Customer Adoption

With most technological roadblocks cleared, customer adoption remains the most formidable hurdle to a future powered by car batteries. Participation in a program like the one between BGE, Sunrun, and Ford, for example, asks an awful lot of the consumer: likely upgrading one’s home service to accommodate charging an EV, acquiring the vehicle and a bidirectional charger, downloading apps and enrolling, then actually following through with participation.

“You’ve got to meet them where they’re at,” recommended Ben Brown, chief executive officer of VPP and energy management platform Renew Home. “That means having a cool home and having your EV charged when it needs to be charged. These things are like non-negotiables.”

Brown envisions a future of what he calls ‘comfortable demand response,’ in which the needs of participating customers are met without worry.

“It’s really around delivering in the moments that matter most,” he continued. “Being able to make sure that when someone needs their EV charged by 9 am that it is absolutely charged by 9 am. It’s making sure that if there’s a moment in time we’re anticipating that [temperatures] might be getting uncomfortable, that you’re anticipating that before it actually happens.”

Bill Crider, the senior director of Ford’s global charging and energy services arm, suggests a customer’s wallet might be the quickest way to their hearts. Considering BGE is in PJM territory, home to some of the most headline-catching electricity price spikes in recent memory, he’s likely onto something.

“Educating customers that their electric vehicles have the potential to save—and even earn—them money all while parked at home is a game-changer,” Crider said. “Enabling customers to not only power their homes, but send power directly back to the grid in times of need, helps customers with financial incentives, utilities with more power capacity, and society through more grid reliability and sustainable energy practices. It’s a win-win for everyone.”

When will you benefit from all the winning? If you live outside BGE’s service area, it might be a minute, but pilots are popping up all over the place, and some are tapping into even bigger batteries.

Hirono: “If this Administration is successful in eliminating the USGS EMA, the costs will far exceed any short-term savings—eroding our global leadership in climate research and our ability to anticipate, mitigate, and respond to environmental threats.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI), a member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, sent a letter to U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Doug Burgum urging him to reconsider the Trump Administration’s decision to eliminate funding for the U.S. Geological Survey’s (USGS) Ecosystems Mission Area (EMA), which supports critical research that helps our country in facilitating conservation management, as well as understanding and responding to environmental threats. The USGS EMA funds research facilities that employ and serve communities in Hawaii and throughout the Pacific, including Guam, the Northern Marianas, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Palau, and American Samoa.

“By zeroing out funding for the EMA, the President’s fiscal year (FY) 2026 budget proposal poses a direct threat to that critical science and the communities that depend on it,” wrote Senator Hirono. “In Hawaii and throughout the Pacific Region, the USGS EMA funds a significant amount of research that advances our understanding of the natural environment, directly benefits our communities, and supports the next generation of scientists.”

In her letter, the Senator stressed the importance of Secretary Burgum’s support for the EMA facilities, citing uncertainty and chaos surrounding government funding that has ensued since Trump took office in January.

“We cannot rely on Congress alone to fix this problem,” continued Senator Hirono. “Even if Congress disagrees with the ‘savings’ that defunding EMA provides and appropriates funding, there is no guarantee that this Administration will follow the rule of law. Currently, this Administration is freezing funding for a variety of programs and agreements across the executive branch to align with the President’s priorities, sometimes providing funding that needs to be dispersed within weeks, and other times completely clawing back the funding that Congress has appropriated.”

Senator Hirono also listed examples of facilities in Hawaii and across the Pacific region that would be impacted by a reduction in EMA funding, including the Pacific Islands Climate Adaptation Science Center (PI-CASC) at the University of Hawaii at Manoa; the Pacific Islands Ecosystem Research Center (PIERC); and the Hawaii Cooperative Fishery Research Unit (HCFRU). The President’s budget would also eliminate eight other regional CASCs across the country, as well as the national CASC.

“These are just a few examples of how devastating these decisions are for Hawaii and the Pacific Region, but these impacts will play out in communities across the country,” concluded the Senator. “If this Administration is successful in eliminating the USGS EMA, the costs will far exceed any short-term savings—eroding our global leadership in climate research and our ability to anticipate, mitigate, and respond to environmental threats.”

The full text of the letter is available here and below.

Dear Secretary Burgum:

I write to express my deep concerns about this Administration’s decision to eliminate funding for the U.S. Geological Survey’s Ecosystems Mission Area (EMA). This short-sighted decision will have a lasting negative impact on Hawaii and throughout the Pacific Region. I urge you, as the Secretary of the Department of the Interior, to change course and fully support this mission area.

According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the EMA “provides science that directly benefits the health, safety, and prosperity of the American people by providing trusted and timely information to help address the Nation’s toughest management and conservation issues impacting public lands and the surrounding communities that benefit from them.” By zeroing out funding for the EMA, the President’s fiscal year (FY) 2026 budget proposal poses a direct threat to that critical science and the communities that depend on it.

In Hawaii and throughout the Pacific Region, the USGS EMA funds a significant amount of research that advances our understanding of the natural environment, directly benefits our communities, and supports the next generation of scientists. For example, the Pacific Islands Climate Adaptation Science Center, or PI-CASC, is hosted at the University of Hawaii Manoa and is comprised of 13 federal and university staff and research fellows and, supports over 25 student researchers each year. This center, which serves Hawaii, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, and American Samoa, not only provides critical information to natural and cultural resource managers and decisionmakers on climate impacts but also supports students who will go on to become our country’s next generation of scientists. The President’s budget does away with the PI-CASC, eight other regional CASCs located throughout the country, and the national CASC. Further, for the first time since the CASCs were established in 2010, your department has failed to renew in a timely manner contracts with three of the regional centers that expire in 2025—the Northeast CASC, the South Central CASC, and PI-CASC.

Defunding USGS EMA will also result in the shuttering of the Pacific Islands Ecosystem Research Center, or PIERC. This center employs 26 people and 21 federally funded research staff and performs critical work to protect biological resources in Hawaii and throughout the Pacific Islands. This work includes researching the brown tree snake to ensure it does not spread from Guam to other islands while also managing brown tree snake populations within Guam. PIERC staff are also working to save the remaining populations of Hawaiian native forest birds, which are critically important to native ecosystems and Hawaiian culture, as they face extinction. PIERC also serves as a lead organization in the fight to arrest addressing Rapid Ohia Death, which has killed millions of native Ohia trees throughout Hawaii. Finally, PIERC is aiding in the effort to restore ecosystems following increasingly frequent wildfire events throughout the Hawaiian Islands.

Other important USGS work in Hawaii that will abruptly end should EMA be eliminated includes the Hawaii Cooperative Fishery Research Unit (HCFRU), which supports 2 federal employees and 10-22 students each year to support the priorities of the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR). Specifically, HCFRU teaches and trains students and DLNR staff on monitoring non-commercial fisheries, managing fisheries, and protecting public health from fish poisoning. At a time when interest in increasing domestic food supply in Hawaii is so high, ending this federal support is inappropriate. Additionally, the USGS National Wildlife Health Center Field Station in Honolulu, which is made up of 3 staff, specifically works with the Department of Defense and the State of Hawaii to control movement of marine and terrestrial invasive species in Hawaii, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas. Given the geopolitical significance of the region and the susceptibility of island ecosystems to invasive species, this loss of decades of expertise and experience would be detrimental to natural resource managers. It would also be a waste of $2 million, which was allocated in 2024 to complete state-of-the-art laboratory facilities to serve wildlife health needs for Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.

We cannot rely on Congress alone to fix this problem. Even if Congress disagrees with the “savings” that defunding EMA provides and appropriates funding, there is no guarantee that this Administration will follow the rule of law. Currently, this Administration is freezing funding for a variety of programs and agreements across the executive branch to align with the President’s priorities, sometimes providing funding that needs to be dispersed within weeks, and other times completely clawing back the funding that Congress has appropriated. There are reports that FY2025 Congressionally appropriated funds for USGS EMA programs will be rescinded. Furthermore, for the CASCs specifically, even if federal funding is provided by Congress and your department makes the funds available, the three regional centers with expired contracts will not be able to continue operations without signing new agreements. Your support for EMA and within this DOI mission areas like PIERC, PI-CASC, and the CFRUs is needed now.

These are just a few examples of how devastating these decisions are for Hawaii and the Pacific Region, but these impacts will play out in communities across the country. The President’s FY26 budget claims that the important research funded by the USGS EMA is best supported by states. With no plan in place for how states will successfully continue the work, one can assume gaps will form, setting our country back by years, if not decades, and making us vulnerable to competing foreign entities in the region. In the short term, resource managers will have less information on which to base decisions. Long-term, our pipeline of next generation scientists will be weakened reducing the United States’ standing as a global leader and eroding our nation’s influence.

If this Administration is successful in eliminating the USGS EMA, the costs will far exceed any short-term savings—eroding our global leadership in climate research and our ability to anticipate, mitigate, and respond to environmental threats. I urge you to reverse these ill-conceived cuts and restore full funding and support for the EMA.

Sincerely,

The company is under intense pressure to lift sales but is facing big challenges. In addition to anti-Musk backlash, it is contending with a likely hit to demand after a federal tax credit worth as $7,500 for EV purchases expired at the end of September.

Tesla stock fell more than 2.5% to $441.08 in late afternoon trading Tuesday. It had closed Monday up more than 5% after the company teased fans with cryptic postings on social media about an imminent product announcement.

The stock has been trading near all-time highs even though both sales and profits have plunged in recent quarters.

Compared to previous models, the new Model Y comes with a shorter 321-mile driving range, fewer audio speakers and a fabric interior, not microsuede. The model also lacks a panoramic glass roof and a touchscreen in the second row.

Dive Brief:

A first-of-its-kind hydrogen- and battery-powered microgrid project is up and running in the remote California town of Calistoga, according to a Sept. 25 announcement by Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Energy Vault.

The Calistoga Resiliency Center provides backup power to the town of 1,600 by using hydrogen fuel cells to charge lithium-ion batteries on a site that was too small to allow for wind or solar power generation, the companies said.

Frank Wolak, president and CEO of the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association, said in an interview that interest in hydrogen fuel cells has grown over the past year or two as data centers and other large-load customers seek alternatives to diesel generators.

Dive Insight:

The community of Calistoga has yet to call on the resiliency center as backup, but tests show it can power the town for at least 48 hours, according to Jeremy Donnell, senior manager of microgrid strategy implementation at PG&E.

The company says it believes the hybrid system is the very first of its kind. The 293-MWh microgrid system replaced a diesel generator that PG&E deployed in Calistoga in 2019-2020 to provide backup generation in the event of a public safety power shutoff, Donnell said in an interview.

Developer Energy Vault came up with the hybrid battery/hydrogen fuel cell design in response to PG&E's request for a solution that could eliminate the diesel generator while occupying the same footprint and for no more than twice the cost.

The project mostly draws energy from on-site hydrogen fuel cells that are hooked up to a 130-foot liquid hydrogen storage tank, Donnell said. A third-party vendor refills the tank with hydrogen; the site lacks the space needed for hydrogen production or for wind or solar generation to charge batteries.

PG&E doesn't anticipate replacing its other diesel generators with fuel cells because the company isn't conducting as many broad-scale public safety power shutoffs as it used to, Donnell said. But the project yielded valuable information about how to connect similar projects to the company's grid, he added.

Wolak said large-load customers like data centers are exploring fuel cells as they seek reliable power solutions with greater duration than lithium-ion batteries and lower emissions than fossil fuel generators.

In addition to remote sites like Calistoga, fuel cells could also be used in urban settings where space is limited, and where nearby residents may object to diesel generator noise and emissions, he said.

Growing demand for natural gas has also, somewhat unexpectedly, driven new interest in fuel cells, Wolak said.

Many fuel cells can use natural gas in the place of hydrogen, and since the gas is not burned, it does not produce on-site emissions. Building out the nation's gas distribution systems means more sites could have access to natural gas and could use fuel cell technology without the need for relatively high-cost hydrogen fuel, he said.

Fuel cells also got a boost from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Wolak said. While the bill cut tax credits for many other sources of renewable generation, it preserved a tax credit for hydrogen storage infrastructure and renewed a fuel cell tax credit that had been set to expire.

“You will see a lot more storyboarding around the fuel cell given this combination of power demand growth everywhere, and ... an uplift from the tax credits,” he said. “Watch this space, you will see more.”

Headlines have been circulating major news outlets around the impending closure of the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility, a $2.2 billion project that began construction in 2010 and has been providing electricity since 2014, dubbing the solar project a “failure” and a “boondoggle.”

At first reaction, the closure of the Ivanpah plant may appear a worrying signal for the cost efficacy of solar technologies. California utility Pacific Gas & Electric, the primary buyer of the plant’s output, announced early this year it would end its offtake agreement with the plant. Initially, PG&E was scheduled to buy power from Ivanpah through 2039, but it has pulled out due to a lack of cost efficacy.

“Ivanpah is yet another failed green energy boondoggle, much like Solyndra,” Jason Isaac, chief executive officer of the American Energy Institute, an American energy advocacy group, told Fox News.

The project was built with $1.6 billion of its construction cost backed by loan guarantees from the U.S. Department of Energy. Now shuttering operations more than a decade ahead of schedule, the project is no doubt a financial failure.

But Ivanpah’s struggles are not an indication of the lack of bankability of solar, and rather a testament to how rapidly clean energy technologies are advancing and becoming more efficient and cost-effective.

The important distinction here, which may be missed in the headlines, is that Ivanpah Solar facility is not solar photovoltaics, but rather a concentrated solar power (CSP) plant, an entirely different technology with different costs for construction, operations and maintenance.

The Ivanpah facility is comprised of 173,500 software-controlled mirrors called heliostats, which direct sun rays into the facility’s three collection towers. The towers, over 400 feet in height each, contain liquid that is heated and converts to steam, pushing a turbine and creating electricity.

According to PG&E’s analysis, the CSP plant struggled from high operating costs and lower-than-expected production led the utility to withdraw from its agreement. The CSP plant also relied on natural gas to sustain operations, working against its progress toward decarbonizing the grid.

About 0.06% of the global fleet of solar technology is CSP, according to SolarPACES. The rest is photovoltaic (PV), the namesake of our publication. Unlike CSP, a PV plant directly converts sunlight into electricity by exciting electrons within a PV material, typically silicon, and collecting them in a conductive junction.

Since Ivanpah was installed in 2014, the cost of solar photovoltaics has fallen by more than 90%. Rapidly falling costs, fast project deployment cycles, emissions-free power and the ability to distribute solar into the built environment have all supported the staggering growth of PV.

In 2014, when Ivanpah began operations, solar PV was less than 1% of the US energy mix. Now, it leads among all technologies in terms of new-build capacity added each year and has grown to over 12% of the total energy mix. It is forecast by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to surpass wind as the top renewable energy source in 2025 and shortly after surpass coal as the second-highest capacity contributor to the US grid.

Cost efficacy

While Ivanpah represents a failure in cost effectiveness, solar PV is among the most cost-effective technologies available today. Analysis from Lazard found that solar and wind energy projects have a lower levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) than nearly all fossil fuel projects – even without subsidy (including the federal Investment Tax Credit).

LCOE is a measure of cost-efficiency of generation sources across technology types. The metric is based on lifetime costs divided by energy production and calculates the present value of the total cost of building and operating a power plant over an assumed lifetime.

Lazard’s analysis found that unsubsidized utility-scale solar, without tax credits, ranges from an LCOE of $0.038/kWh to $0.078/kWh. Utility-scale solar with energy storage co-located ranges from $0.05/kWh to $0.131/kWh, while natural gas peaker plants are far more expensive at $0.138/kWh to $0.262/kWh.

Lazard’s analysis found that utility-scale solar plats are cheaper than the lowest-cost marginal cost of fossil fuel, meaning that even the most cost-effective combined cycle natural gas plants that are already built and operating are more expensive electricity generators than new-build solar and wind.

What’s more, Lazard found that gas, coal and nuclear projects are more sensitive to the cost of capital, suggesting that the higher-for-longer interest rate environment further supports renewable energy investment.

“On an unsubsidized dollar per megawatt-hour basis, renewable energy remains the most cost-competitive form of generation. As such, renewable energy will continue to play a key role in the buildout of new power generation in the US,” said the report. “This is particularly true in the current high power demand environment, where renewables stand out as both the lowest-cost and quickest-to-deploy generation resource.”

Duke Energy plans to burn coal for two to four years longer than previously estimated, which will result in millions of tons in additional greenhouse gases over the next decade when combined with other proposed changes to the utility’s fuel mix.

The utility would significantly increase battery storage—by 56 percent—but also deploy fewer renewables.

The details are laid out in more than 100 pages of the utility’s biennial Carbon Plan, released Oct. 1 and submitted to the North Carolina Utilities Commission.

Duke cited the state’s growing energy demand, driven by data centers and large manufacturers, coupled with the Trump administration’s fossil-fuel friendly energy policy as reasons for the changes. This includes the rollback of federal air regulations, increased support for the coal industry and the end of renewable power subsidies.

State policy, too, shaped the plan. Senate Bill 266, now law after the state legislature in late July overrode Gov. Josh Stein’s veto, allowed Duke to eliminate its interim goal of a 70 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2035. Instead, the utility is only subject to a goal of net zero by 2050.

Under its previous plan, Duke projected it would shutter its remaining coal-fired power plants no later than 2035. Last year the utility retired the Allen Steam Station on Lake Wylie, where the first battery storage goes online next month.

But unfettered by the interim carbon reduction goal, several of those retirement dates have been extended to the mid-to-late 2030s, depending on the plant.

Belews Creek, in Stokes County, would burn coal as late as 2040, four years longer than planned, when Duke projects a small nuclear reactor could come online.

Belews Creek emitted 5.5 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2022, according to data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Carbon dioxide equivalent is a unit of measurement to evaluate the impact of different greenhouse gases.

Some units at the Cliffside and Marshall plants would burn coal for an extra two years, until 2033 and 2034.

These plants, and several others, can burn coal and natural gas, further increasing emissions of potent planet-warming gases, carbon dioxide and methane.

“We continue making progress on coal retirements while balancing regulatory approvals and increased load growth,” Duke Energy spokesman Bill Norton said. “Regulators have made clear that replacement generation must be online and serving customers prior to further coal plant retirements.”

CleanAIRE NC, a nonprofit environmental group based in Charlotte, issued a statement expressing “serious concerns about Duke Energy’s proposed plan, which continues to prioritize fossil fuel expansion, delays coal retirement, and lacks meaningful engagement with the communities most vulnerable to environmental and economic harm.”

Duke acknowledges that coal is risky. It is more expensive and considerably more polluting than natural gas. Nationwide, mining has declined, both in the number of workers and the amount of coal produced.

Even though the Trump administration is opening public lands in the western U.S. for coal mining, Duke has outfitted its plants to burn low-sulfur coal sourced from Central Appalachia, where production is waning.

Norton said Duke “continues to plan for an orderly retirement of coal as a necessary means to protect reliability in light of the increasing challenges in the operation of these end-of-life assets.”

The utility plans to continue to expand its natural gas fleet, which requires more than 100 miles of new pipeline in North Carolina. The pipelines, compressor stations and the plants themselves leak and emit tons of methane, a greenhouse gas that, while shorter-lived in the atmosphere, is 86 times more potent at warming the planet than carbon dioxide over 20 years.

Meech Carter, clean energy campaigns director for the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters Foundation, said gas infrastructure additions are “driven by the expansion of data centers and artificial intelligence, allowing big technology companies and Duke Energy to profit at ratepayers’ expense.”

The extent of data centers’ effects on energy demand remains unclear. Analysts with Duke University’s Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment & Sustainability posit that targeted, timed reductions in power demand could ease the strain on the grid without massive power-plant buildouts.

Duke has reined in its plans for solar power, compared to the previous Carbon Plan. It had originally projected to add 8,200 megawatts by 2031; the new proposal reduces the megawattage to 7,900 and extends the date to 2033.

The utility previously projected it would add 3,600 megawatts of onshore and offshore wind within the next decade. But the new energy mix eliminates wind power until at least 2040, reflecting President Donald Trump’s rejection of that energy source.

The Trump administration recently canceled $679 million for offshore wind projects. None were in North Carolina, but a nearby wind logistics port in Norfolk, Virginia, lost more than $39 million in federal funding.

Duke also plans to request permission from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to increase power and extend licenses for existing nuclear plants.

After a lengthy public hearing process, the state utilities commission must issue an order on the plan—approving it as is or requiring amendments—by Dec. 31, 2026.",https://cardinalpine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2025/10/shutterstock-787594231.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 15:04:51.051523

This project will create at least 101 new, full-time jobs over the next three years.

The company has entered into a 15-year lease at 33 Powell Avenue in Hazleton. Relocating into a larger facility will allow the company to increase production to meet demand while also providing enough space for the development of new, innovative products at the Hazleton facility.

“Pennsylvania is attracting companies from across the nation thanks to the work my Administration is doing to improve our business environment, build more shovel-ready sites, and invest in our communities — today’s announcement is another clear example of that,” said Governor Shapiro. “When companies want to grow, they look to our Commonwealth. With a strategic location near major markets, and a talented, skilled workforce, Pennsylvania has so much to offer and we remain committed to making strategic investments to further boost our economy and create more good-paying jobs for Pennsylvanians.”

The Shapiro Administration has successfully won major deals and recruited businesses to move to Pennsylvania. Companies like Excelitas Technologies(opens in a new tab), which relocated its headquarters from Massachusetts to Pittsburgh and will create at least 250 new jobs, and Adare Pharma(opens in a new tab), which is bringing 115 new jobs to its relocated headquarters in Northeast Philadelphia, are joining a growing list of businesses choosing Pennsylvania as the best place to expand and innovate.

Mint-X received a funding proposal from the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development (DCED) that includes a $300,000 Pennsylvania First Grant. The company also received a $1,592,686 Pennsylvania Industrial Development Authority (PIDA) loan from DCED for the project.

“This project is boosting Luzerne County’s rich manufacturing industry, and creating over 100 new, good-paying jobs for the region,” said DCED Secretary Rick Siger. “We’re thrilled Mint-X has chosen Pennsylvania to grow, and the Shapiro Administration will continue to support projects like this one that create more opportunities for Pennsylvanians and help revitalize communities.”

Mint-X, founded in 2008, manufactures and distributes the world’s only Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered and patented rodent-repellent trash bags. The company produces its branded Mint-X bags and also produces private label bags with its integrated Mint-X technology for Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, Target, Costco, and Dollar General.

“We are very excited to move our operation to Northeastern Pennsylvania, and we’re grateful for the warm welcome we’ve already received from the Commonwealth,” said Jeff Dussich, CEO, Mint-X. “We spent more than a year searching for a new home for our manufacturing facility. The strong labor pool and strategic location near the intersection of I-80 and I-81 ultimately made Hazleton the perfect place for us.”

""NEPA Alliance is proud to partner with Mint-X on this strategic expansion into Luzerne County,"" said Stephen Ursich, Vice President, NEPA Alliance. ""By supporting innovative companies like Mint-X, we’re helping to bring high-quality jobs to our region and reinforcing NEPA’s role as a hub for industrial growth. We thank Governor Shapiro and DCED for their leadership in making projects like this possible.""

Since taking office, the Shapiro Administration has secured over $25.6 billion in private sector investments, creating over 12,500 jobs. In July, Governor Shapiro announced(opens in a new tab) the Commonwealth had secured an initial $20 billion investment from Amazon, the largest single private investment in the state’s history.

From day one, Governor Shapiro has worked to spur economic development in Pennsylvania, creating the 10-year Economic Development Strategy, securing historic funding for site development, main streets, small businesses, and more, and speeding up the Commonwealth’s permitting, licensing, and certification processes.

The Shapiro Administration is delivering real results — and building on that momentum.

Administrative Updates

Executive Order Updates

The Trump Administration has continued to release wide-ranging executive orders (EOs). For the latest updates, see our ""Trump's 2025 Executive Orders: Updates and Summaries"" tracking chart.

An EO titled ""Unlocking Cures for Pediatric Cancer with Artificial Intelligence,"" issued on Sept. 30, 2025, seeks to drive innovation in the prevention and treatment of childhood diseases. The EO directs the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Commission – in coordination with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary, Assistant to the President for Science and Technology (ASTP) and Special Advisor for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Crypto – to develop ways to incorporate the use of advanced technologies such as AI to support the improved diagnosis, treatment, cure and prevention of childhood cancer. The EO calls for an expansion of pediatric cancer research using existing federal funding for projects that prioritize improved data infrastructure, enhanced data analysis and improved clinical trial designs through incorporation of AI.

Regulatory Updates

VA Releases M-25-21 AI Compliance Plan

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has released its M-25-21 AI Compliance plan, becoming the first agency to make its plan public under the Trump Administration's management memo M-25-21, which required agencies to outline how they will govern and deploy AI by Oct. 1, 2025. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) plans have not yet been released. The VA's plan says certain use cases, including AI tools for clinical documentation and predictive analytics, will inform adoption in its new electronic health record system. While all agencies were due to submit similar strategies, no other HHS agencies' plans have been publicly released so far.

ARPA-H Announces Funding Under POSEIDON Program

The Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H) announced on Sept. 30, 2025, that four research and development teams would receive a total of $147 million in funding awards under its Platform Optimizing SynBio for Early Intervention and Detection in Oncology (POSEIDON) program. Funding will support the development of sensitive and specific first-in-class, at-home, over-the-counter, synthetic Multi-Cancer-Early Detection (MCED) tests to identify more than 30 stage 1 solid tumors using only breath or urine samples.

According to the National Cancer Institute, more than two million new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2025. Currently, there is not a recommended screening test for nearly 60 percent of diagnosed cancers, such as brain, pancreatic and ovarian cancer. Current multi-cancer detection (MCD) tests can't accurately identify stage 1 solid tumors, which is critical to effectively diagnosing and treating cancers. Additionally, the cost of late-stage, non-curative cancer treatment is two to three times higher than early-stage, potentially curative treatment. POSEIDON has the potential to make significant, lasting healthcare and economic contributions to the future of cancer care for all Americans.

If successful, the over-the-counter, at-home MCED test device kit will be fully integrated into clinical care through electronic health record and telemedicine-capabilities. The kit aims to ensure that individuals will connect with a healthcare professional via a telemedicine call within 96 hours and will receive their results either virtually or in-person at the clinician's discretion. In cases of a positive result (e.g., presence of cancer), individuals will be connected to the nearest medical center for an official diagnostic work-up and continued care.

POSEIDON's emphasis on translation and market penetration ensures the resulting tests will be available to all Americans if they so choose. Further, POSEIDON's commercial focus is reflected in each team's structure, which requires that all teams have a clearly defined commercial entity responsible for bringing these cutting-edge technologies to the market.

CMS Projects Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plans Expected to Remain Stable in 2026

CMS announced on Sept. 26, 2025, that average premiums, benefits and plan choices for Medicare Advantage (MA) and Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plans are projected to remain stable in 2026. CMS released its projections in advance of the upcoming Medicare Open Enrollment Period, which begins Oct. 15, 2025, and runs through Dec. 7, 2025.

The average MA plan is expected to decrease from $16.40 to $14 in 2026, including MA plans that provide prescription drug coverage and special needs plans (SNPs). CMS projects that 34 million beneficiaries will be enrolled in an MA plan in 2026, a decrease from 34.9 million beneficiaries in 2025. MA enrollment is expected to represent about 48 percent of all individuals enrolled in Medicare. The total number of MA plans available nationwide will decrease from 5,633 in 2025 to 5,600 in 2026.

The average standalone Part D plan premium is projected to decrease from $38.31 in 2025 to $34.50 in 2026. The average Part D total premium for MA plans with prescription drug coverage is projected to decrease from $13.32 in 2025 to $11.50 in 2026.

CMS Releases IPAY 2028 Final Guidance

CMS released the final Initial Price Applicability Year (IPAY) 2028 guidance for the next round of Medicare drug price negotiation on Oct. 1, 2025. The guidance details the requirements and parameters for the third cycle of Medicare drug price negotiation. CMS will select up to 15 additional drugs under Part D or Part B that are eligible for drug price negotiation. Under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), IPAY 2028 will include drugs or biological products payable under Part B as eligible for negotiation.

Notably, CMS chose not to finalize changes related to fixed combination drugs that it had proposed in the draft IPAY 2028 guidance. However, CMS notes its ""intent to address this program's integrity risk and that it is continuing to consider the appropriate policy to implement in rulemaking beginning initial price applicability year 2029."" In the draft guidance, CMS proposed changing its interpretation of when a combination drug would qualify as a single source drug, which may have resulted in certain drug formulations being subject to Medicare negotiation, but CMS opted against finalizing the change in the final guidance.

DEA Proposes Adjusted Manufacturer Quotas for Certain Ingredients

President Trump, Major Pharmaceutical Company Make MFN Drug Pricing Announcement

President Donald Trump and a major pharmaceutical company announced on Sept. 30, 2025, the first agreement to provide prescription drugs to U.S. patients at a significantly reduced price. The announcement, which took place following President Trump's efforts to implement a most-favored-nations (MFN) drug pricing framework to align the cost of prescription drugs in the U.S. with other developed nations, is expected to be the first of several as companies seek to meet key aims of the Trump Administration's drug pricing strategy. As part of the agreement, the company will offer prescription drugs within its portfolio at reduced prices through a direct-to-consumer platform to be called TrumpRx, with discounts as high as 85 percent off the list price. In addition, the company will price newly approved medications in the U.S. at a price point aligned with that of comparable markets around the world. The company also committed to spending an additional $70 billion to move manufacturing and production of pharmaceutical products back to the U.S. The Trump Administration, following the company's announcement, will not assess tariffs on the company's pharmaceutical imports for three years. The agreement will also ensure that state Medicaid programs may access MFN prices on products made by the manufacturer.

Separately, a trade association representing leading pharmaceutical manufacturers announced its members also plan to invest $500 billion in U.S. infrastructure over the next decade. The trade association will also create a website to highlight direct purchasing options available through individual companies.

Two Mandatory Payment Models at OMB: GLOBE and GUARD

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is currently reviewing two mandatory payment models focused on drug pricing: Global Benchmark for Efficient Drug Pricing (GLOBE) and Guarding U.S. Medicare Against Rising Drug Costs (GUARD). These models would likely adjust how payments are made for prescription drugs under Medicare, with the goal of addressing costs and incentivizing value-based care. Specifics on methodology remain to be seen and it is currently unknown when additional information on the models may be released.

With the current federal government shutdown, the review process for these models has been halted. Until the shutdown ends, agencies and industry participants are essentially in a holding pattern regarding these two potential payment models. Further, the recent announcement of TrumpRx may factor into forward movement.

Federal Employee Unions Challenge Administration For Intent to Carry Out Additional Firings During the Government Shutdown

In a new lawsuit filed on Sept. 30, 2025, unions representing federal, state, county and municipal employees challenged the Trump Administration's threats to conduct additional RIFs while the federal government is shut down. The lawsuit, in part, centers upon guidance issued by the OMB in advance of the shutdown authorizing agency leaders to carry out additional firings of federal employees. The lawsuit seeks an injunction, with the unions claiming that the actions are ""contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious"" and arguing that the OMB has exceeded its statutory authority by authorizing the RIFs while the government is in a shutdown. The lawsuit also seeks to invalidate actions taken during the shutdown.

New Medication Abortion Case Filed

Legal efforts to limit access to medication abortion continue, with a new case being transferred from Texas to a federal court in Missouri. The case is the next step in a multi-year battle over access to mifepristone following the U.S. Supreme Court's previous decision that a group of physicians and medical organizations lacked legal standing to sue because they could not show they would be directly harmed by the policy. The case demands that the federal government restore previous restrictions on mifepristone and follows HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy's announcement on Sept. 25, 2025, that HHS would open a new investigation into the safety of mifepristone.

The Scoop

The Trump administration is considering cancelling an additional $12 billion in funding for clean energy projects beyond what it announced last week, according to a list of targeted projects reviewed by Semafor.

The “kill list,” as it was described to Semafor by a source who reviewed it, would amount to an escalation of the Trump administration’s assault on clean energy. It’s also a signal that the Trump administration is using the government shutdown as a pretext for accelerating its broader policy agenda, as it looks to turn the page on the Biden era during which the US embraced green energy projects as a way to combat climate change.

The list includes major carbon removal and clean hydrogen efforts that had been approved by the Department of Energy under the Biden administration, such as projects led by major oil and gas companies like Chevron and Occidental.

The projects on this list, combined with a tranche of cancelled funding announced last week and an earlier group of cancelled projects announced in May, bring the total of DOE funding targeted for cuts to nearly $24 billion. However, it’s not clear whether, or when, the full list of cancellations will be enacted, or if President Donald Trump is instead looking to use them as leverage in negotiations over the shutdown.

As the government shutdown drags on, the US Office of Management and Budget has also threatened to withhold back pay for furloughed federal workers. An OMB spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.

Know More

The new list of potential cancellations follows a pattern of cuts announced last week that especially took aim at the carbon removal industry. They risk undermining a nascent sector that, aside from its climate benefits, has drawn significant investment from the fossil fuel industry and tech companies.

“If confirmed, the elimination of the megaton carbon removal projects will be a massive setback for American climate and industrial policy,” Erin Burns, executive director of the advocacy group Carbon180, told Semafor. “These projects were never just about carbon — they were about jobs, investment, and the chance to lead in a global climate economy. Cutting them leaves communities in limbo and undermines years of progress.”

Notable

Projects being cut by the Department of Energy focus on Democrat-led states, but will cost jobs and income in Republican ones, too, according to Heatmap.

The World

at a Glance

Israel marked the anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks that triggered the conflict that has reshaped the Middle East.

The country has won since major victories against regional enemies, including Iran and Hezbollah, but at a huge cost: 67,000 Palestinians have been killed, famine has taken hold in Gaza, and Israel is increasingly isolated.

Other countries’ politics have been affected, too. Zohran Mamdani is likely to be the next mayor of New York City in large part because of his support for Palestinian rights, while governments across Europe have accelerated support for a Palestinian state.

A truce may finally be close, with Israeli and Hamas leaders nearing a ceasefire at talks brokered by US President Donald Trump.

US President Donald Trump met Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Tuesday, with the countries at loggerheads over trade and Trump’s comments about annexing the country’s northern neighbor.

Canada is the only G7 country not to have reached a trade deal with the US this year; a North American free trade agreement protects Ottawa from some tariffs, but it is still subject to punishing steel duties, among others.

Carney promised to be tough on Trump but Canadian firms are shedding jobs and exports are down. The Canadian leader must walk a tightrope: Trump is deeply unpopular north of the border after repeatedly suggesting making Canada the “51st state.” Polls found that 60% of Canadians say they can never fully trust the US again.

The Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded for research that showed the impact of quantum mechanics on everyday-sized objects.

Quantum effects were known at the level of atoms, but in the 1980s John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret, and John M. Martinis showed that at very low temperatures, the strange behavior — such as particles moving directly through apparently impassable barriers — could be demonstrated in objects large enough to be held in the hand.

The discovery paved the way for quantum computing and other quantum technologies, and opened the door to several multi-billion-dollar industries. One winner of yesterday’s Physiology prize is yet to be contacted, as he is off the grid, “living his best life” hiking in Idaho.

US President Donald Trump agreed to meet his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva after a “very good” call, marking a thaw in relations that were at their worst in decades.

Trump slapped a 50% tariff on Brasília — despite the US having a trade surplus with Brazil — over what he called a “witch hunt” against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally convicted over a coup plot. Analysts said the call pointed at Trump breaking with Bolsonaro, who doesn’t have a clear path back to the presidency.

Lula welcomed the shift, calling on former spats to be forgotten: “Neither the American nor the Brazilian people can suffer because of our mistakes,” he told TV Mirante.

A Sudanese militia leader was found guilty of committing war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Darfur region 20 years ago, in a conflict that became a prelude to the country’s present-day disaster.

Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman was a leader of the Janjaweed militia, which killed hundreds of thousands of members of Darfur’s non-Arab population in the early 2000s, sparking one of the world’s gravest and most enduring humanitarian crises.

After the war, many Janjaweed fighters joined the Rapid Support Forces, one of the warring parties in Sudan’s current civil war. The RSF is once again besieging Darfur, putting millions of lives at risk, with the conflict sparking the first declaration of famine globally in years.

Renewable energy surpassed coal as the world’s primary source of electricity in the first half of 2025, according to new data from the energy think tank Ember. Solar power led the charge, covering 83% of the increase in electricity demand.

Ember described the moment as a “crucial turning point,” whereby clean power can keep pace with rapidly growing energy needs, particularly as the world faces the huge increase in power necessary to fuel the AI boom.

However, the think tank warned that there are significant regional differences behind the numbers; new data from the International Energy Agency revised renewable energy growth in the US by 2030 down by half. It also suggested that the pace of renewables adoption in China — the current largest renewables growth market globally — could temper, the Financial Times reported.

Renewables are expected to boom elsewhere, however: Pakistan imported enough solar panels in 2024 to generate around a third of the country’s current power generation capacity, the BBC said. And in Africa, solar panel imports are up 60% in the year to June compared with the same period last year.

OpenAI inked a deal with chip designer AMD to collaborate on AI data centers, in a challenge to semiconductor giant Nvidia.

The deal, which caused AMD’s stock to soar, reflects the tech sector’s intensifying quest for computing power and ultimately banks on a “near-limitless demand for AI,” WIRED wrote: Running AMD’s processors will match the energy needs of 5 million American homes. The US has become “one big bet on AI,” as optimism over the sector props up the economy, one analyst wrote.

Driving that bet is OpenAI, whose CEO Sam Altman has proven to be a prolific dealmaker. The company also has agreements with firms including Nvidia and Oracle — pacts that have raised fears of an AI bubble.

Israel and Hamas began indirect negotiations through Arab mediators in Egypt Monday on a Gaza peace plan, raising the possibility of a potential end to the brutal war on the eve of its two-year anniversary.

Hamas said it agrees to parts of a 20-point US peace plan, including the release of all remaining Israeli hostages, but has not acknowledged other demands, including full disarmament and its permanent exclusion from governing the enclave.

Though US President Donald Trump ordered Israel to halt its attacks, it continued to pound Gaza Monday. Trump has also threatened “complete obliteration” of Hamas if it insists on staying in power.

Even as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu looks to take credit for the emerging deal, it has become clear that Trump was “the one calling the shots,” The New York Times wrote. On Sunday night, the president exhorted negotiators to “MOVE FAST,” adding that he expected the first phase of the deal to unfold this week.

A US judge blocked the government from deploying troops to Oregon state, spotlighting the growing role of the courts in the country’s politics.

The latest order, issued late on Sunday, comes as the Trump administration looks to deploy military forces to Democrat-led cities nationwide: The White House says they are necessary to combat alleged lawlessness; Democrats argue their constituents are being targeted.

The latest decision came on the eve of the Supreme Court beginning a new term that analysts say will include significant new tests of presidential power, including over the administration’s use of tariffs, attempted curbs on birthright citizenship, and efforts to fire officials from independent government agencies.

France’s prime minister resigned less than a month after taking office, plunging the country deeper into a seemingly intractable political crisis.

Sébastien Lecornu — President Emmanuel Macron’s seventh premier — quit following widespread criticism over his new cabinet, which was largely unchanged from that of the prior government.

His departure showcases the short-term challenge facing Macron’s ministers, who have repeatedly failed to pass a budget in the face of far-right and far-left opposition, and the longer-term fear over the rise of the country’s main nationalist, anti-immigration party, which is topping opinion polls.

The impasse has left investors wary: A recent Deutsche Bank survey pegged France as the country most likely to face a government bond crisis.

Japanese stocks surged after the country’s ruling party chose its next leader — and likely next prime minister — amid growing investor buoyancy over prospects for one of the world’s largest economies.

The LDP, which has ruled Japan largely uninterrupted since World War II, put Sanae Takaichi on track to be the country’s first female prime minister.

She inherits a dizzying array of challenges, including a fast-aging population and worries over Chinese aggression. Yet economists note the country has removed major barriers to business, manufacturers are feeling more upbeat, and monetary policy is normalizing: The Nikkei 225 index hit a record following Takaichi’s selection. “We are bullish on Japan,” Apollo’s chief economist wrote.

China and India agreed to restart direct flights after a five-year hiatus, the latest sign of thawing relations between the world’s most populous nations. New Delhi said flights between Kolkata and Guangzhou would restart this month for the first time since border clashes in 2020.

The decision comes just months after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made his first visit to Beijing in seven years, with the countries’ leaders drawing closer, particularly after US President Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on India, upending what had been a burgeoning bilateral partnership. Those levies were “one of the biggest shocks that India has ever got,” an expert said, forcing New Delhi to seek new allies.

Discoveries about how our immune systems avoid attacking our own bodies — research which helped create new pathways for treating autoimmune diseases — won the 2025 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.

T-cells are designed to attack proteins in pathogens, but those proteins are often similar to our body’s own proteins. Mary Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi discovered that the immune system has “self-tolerance” safeguards which prevent it from attacking our own cells.

Crucially, the findings also helped create new cancer treatments: Cancer cells use the body’s self-tolerance to hide, and immunotherapy is designed to take the brakes off and allow the immune system to attack those cells.

Japan is on track to have its first female prime minister.

A former economic security minister who cites Margaret Thatcher as her hero, Sanae Takaichi was elected to lead Japan’s governing LDP, which has ruled the country almost continuously since World War II but is mired in an array of crises.

Among her top priorities is tackling inflation — a relatively new problem given Japan’s decades of falling prices — making her selection a worrying one for investors: Takaichi will likely push for aggressive spending and looser monetary policy in a bid to boost the economy.

She will also pull Japan’s politics further to the right, mirroring a trend of resurgent populist conservatism worldwide, The Wall Street Journal wrote.

The world’s major oil producers agreed to raise output again, a move that raised fears of a supply glut and could further dampen prices.

OPEC+ is looking to reclaim market share lost to US shale producers and maintain discipline within the group — some members stand accused of violating quotas — while the group’s heavyweight member, Saudi Arabia, is likely hoping that lower prices will please US President Donald Trump.

Still, the increase was a relatively small one, a careful step taken “after witnessing how nervous the market had become,” one analyst said.

“The real test will come when fundamentals and politics shift again.” High geopolitical volatility makes predicting the market’s future even more difficult than usual, a Reuters columnist argued.

US President Donald Trump is considering a bailout of at least $10 billion to help the country’s soybean farmers survive a boycott from China.

The humble soybean has become a flashpoint in the trade war between the world’s two largest economies after Beijing ceased all purchases from the US.

The possible aid from Washington reflects China’s leverage in talks with the US, similar to how Beijing used rare-earth export curbs to extract trade concessions from Washington, analysts said.

China is now reportedly pushing for the White House to roll back national-security restrictions on Chinese investments in the US.

Birds of different species can understand each other’s alarm calls warning of cuckoos.

Brood parasites such as cuckoos lay their eggs in other birds’ nests, tricking the hosts into caring for their offspring at the expense of their own.

Research found that 21 bird species across four continents all make similar “whining” vocalizations when they spot a brood parasite, and when played recordings of other species’ calls, they all recognize them and react by mobbing the invader.

One researcher told New Scientist that the calls, referring to external objects in the world rather than internal states such as fear or excitement, “could be the first stepping stone towards language” and that animal communication and human language were on a spectrum.

A controversial musical depicting the Spanish conquest of Mexico has ignited a transatlantic debate over Latin American history and identity.

Centering on conquistador Hernán Cortés and his Nahuatl translator, Malinche ostensibly celebrates mestizaje, or racial mixing, but has been accused of promoting “outdated, racist notions” regarding Aztec rituals, and the idea that colonization benefited indigenous people.

Foreign Policy called the show, currently playing in Mexico City, an “obscenely romanticized” “anti-Hamilton,” while conservatives complained that a historical priest was initially portrayed in drag.

Malinche’s producer, for his part, hoped the debate would “bring people to come and judge” for themselves.

The brouhaha points to real wounds: Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum declined to invite Spain’s king to her inauguration after he failed to apologize for the conquest.

The US military struck another alleged narcotics vessel off the coast of Venezuela Friday, killing four, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said.

The strike — at least the fourth such attack — brings the total number of alleged smugglers killed by the US in recent weeks to at least 18.

Hegseth wrote on X that he directed the lethal strike, carried out in international waters, on a “vessel transporting substantial amounts of narcotics — headed to America to poison our people.”

It came after the White House informed Congress this week that the country was engaged in “armed conflict” with drug cartels, which the administration has designated as terrorist organizations, The New York Times reported.

The strikes have raised tensions with Caracas, which fears a full-scale invasion, as President Donald Trump reportedly weighs strikes inside the country.

Critics have questioned the legality of the campaign, with one commentator accusing Trump of emulating “the worst excesses” of US policy in Latin America.

Hamas said it agreed to release all remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza under a framework proposed by US President Donald Trump, stating that it “affirms its readiness to immediately enter into negotiations” to discuss the details.

Earlier on Friday, Trump set a new weekend deadline for Hamas to agree to a peace deal on the enclave’s future, calling it the militant group’s “last chance.” Hamas’ statement suggested the group is seeking changes to the proposal, however, and that a deal has not yet been agreed to.

If no deal is reached by 6:00 pm Sunday Eastern time, “all HELL, like no one has ever seen before, will break out against Hamas,” Trump wrote in a social media post earlier on Friday.

The Trump administration’s 20-point plan, backed by Israel, demands an immediate ceasefire, the return of all hostages, the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, and the disarmament of Hamas — a condition the group has previously rejected. Hamas said on Wednesday that it was reviewing the proposal.

The plan also provides for a transitional authority run by an international group chaired by Trump, with members including former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.

Venezuela said it had detected five US fighter jets flying near its Caribbean coast, which Caracas said amounted to “provocation,” in the latest clash between the countries.

Tensions have been rising between the US and Venezuela for months, and Washington recently struck alleged drug trafficking boats off the coast of Venezuela.

Fears are growing among Venezuela’s leadership that the true goal of the US deployment is toppling the autocratic regime of President Nicolás Maduro, though some warn a military intervention could further destabilize the country. “Anyone who cares about democracy and human rights wants the Maduro dictatorship to end,” an expert at the Council on Foreign Relations said, but this strategy is “very unlikely” to make that happen.

Japan will on Saturday elect its new leader, with a millennial minister poised to become prime minister of the rapidly aging nation.

Shinjiro Koizumi, who at 44 would become Japan’s youngest leader in a century, is competing with four other candidates to head the ruling Liberal Democratic Party — which has governed Japan for most of the past 70 years — after the resignation of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba following two major election losses. Agriculture minister Koizumi, who bills himself a consensus builder, faces his toughest challenge in Sanae Takaichi, a conservative hardliner who would become the country’s first female ruler if she wins. But experts fear neither candidate offers Japan a clear vision to solve an array of challenges at home and abroad.

Munich airport shut down overnight after a series of drone sightings, the latest disruption to European airspace after similar events in Oslo and Copenhagen.

Thousands of passengers on dozens of flights were affected, with some having to sleep in the airport. The sightings follow a series of Russian incursions into NATO airspace, but Moscow denied responsibility for the Munich drones. Still, European leaders suggested the Kremlin was behind earlier drone sightings, and called for strengthened defenses.

Russia appears to be stepping up its hybrid warfare: British officials said Moscow-backed cyberattacks and sabotage were on the rise, and the Kremlin regularly targets UK satellites. A former British intelligence chief said this week that Britain may be “already at war with Russia.”

A woman was named Archbishop of Canterbury for the first time in the role’s 1,400-year history.

Sarah Mullally will become the spiritual leader of the Anglican Church in January, a year after her predecessor resigned in a safeguarding scandal.

The first archbishop was appointed in 597 AD, but the role took on extra significance when Henry VIII broke with Rome in 1534.

While Anglicanism is on the decline in Britain, it is growing worldwide — nearly 60% of adherents are in Africa, where followers are much more religiously conservative than in Britain.

The communion, already tested by divisions over attitudes towards LGBTQ+ people, will be strained further by Mullally’s appointment: Many African Anglican churches refuse to ordain female priests.

South Africa secured investments from China and India to boost its car manufacturing in a bid to salvage one of the industries hardest hit by Washington’s steep tariffs.

US President Donald Trump imposed 30% levies on South African goods over what he claims are laws that discriminate against white South Africans. The rates have pummeled the auto sector, with US-bound exports dropping 90% in the second quarter compared to the previous year. Pretoria warned the sweeping tariffs could cost Africa’s most industrialized economy as many as 100,000 jobs.

Meanwhile, analysts warn that Washington’s levies, as well as the expiry of a sub-Saharan Africa-US free trade deal, will push African nations even closer to Beijing’s sphere of influence.

Taylor Swift released her 12th original album, The Life of a Showgirl, which is expected to break new records to further cement the pop queen’s dominance.

Swift has been “pop’s alpha figure for more than a decade,” The New York Times noted, and in the 18 months since her last release, The Tortured Poets Department, Swift has reached new heights of success — and fame. Her Eras Tour was the most lucrative in history, she bought back ownership of her early albums’ master recordings, and she got engaged.

Anticipation for Showgirl has been “off the charts,” Forbes reported, with more than 5 million pre-saves on Spotify — the most ever — and it is “almost a foregone conclusion” that Swift will become the first female artist to break 100 million career album sales.

Two people have died and three others are in a serious condition after a car ramming and knife attack outside a synagogue in Manchester, UK, on Thursday. The suspect is also believed to have been killed after being shot by police, the BBC reported.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer returned early from a meeting of European leaders in Copenhagen to chair the government’s emergency response group, saying that he was “appalled” by the incident. Security is being stepped up at Jewish sites across the country.

The attack, which took place on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, comes amid a sharp rise in anti-Semitic assaults in the US and Europe as the Israel-Hamas war nears the two-year mark.

France and Germany have seen a surge in incidents, while two staff at the Israeli embassy in Washington DC were shot dead in May, and an attack injured 12 in Colorado weeks later.

Israeli naval ships intercepted a flotilla attempting to deliver aid to Gaza and detained several activists, including Greta Thunberg.

The “Global Sumud Flotilla” of more than 40 vessels set sail in September, intending to breach Israel’s naval blockade of the enclave, where the UN says a humanitarian catastrophe is underway. Israel said several vessels were taken to port, citing what it called a violation of a “lawful naval blockade,” but flotilla organizers said their boats had been illegally boarded and targeted with water cannon and drones.

The boats have become an international cause célèbre: They were escorted part-way by Italian and Spanish naval ships, and their interception has been met by protests in several European countries.

At least two people died and dozens were arrested in Morocco, the latest site of Gen Z protests that have rocked countries worldwide.

Though the North African country has for years avoided mass demonstrations owing to the government’s ironfisted rule, protests have erupted in recent days over what demonstrators say is misplaced spending.

Rabat has prioritized readying the country to host matches for the 2030 Men’s soccer World Cup at the expense of greater investment in social services, demonstrators say. “The right to health, education and a dignified life is not an empty slogan,” the protest’s organizers said.

The demonstrations mirror recent Gen Z-led protests in Nepal and Madagascar that have forced rulers to resign.

European leaders backed a plan to build a so-called drone wall to bolster the continent’s defenses, aiming to send a clear message to Moscow after multiple Russian incursions into NATO airspace. The continent is scrambling to build the necessary capacities to defend against drones, highlighting not only its lagging technology but also how rapidly warfare has shifted to the use of unmanned aircraft. According to NATO, the Russian army is now capable of making drones for a few thousand dollars that Europe can only shoot down with missiles that cost millions of dollars apiece. Moscow’s ongoing hybrid war makes a drone wall necessary, Finland’s prime minister argued: “Russia will continue and we have to be ready.”

US President Donald Trump signed a NATO-like security guarantee for Qatar, part of efforts to reassure the emirate after an Israeli strike on Hamas leaders in Doha last month.

The executive order pledges to take all measures, including US military support, to defend the Gulf state, though its legal and practical value is in question. Such agreements have historically required the approval of the US Senate, and the announcement was met with criticism from some of Trump’s conservative supporters.

The move was ostensibly made to reassure Washington’s Gulf allies following the Israeli strike — Saudi Arabia has already reached a mutual-defense pact with nuclear-armed Pakistan — but Politico nevertheless called it a “shocking departure from the administration’s America First approach.”","https://img.semafor.com/c6d61dd4ac81560309cef3da87e183fabb71b979-5582x4000.jpg?rect=0,535,5582,2931&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format",N,,2025-10-07 15:03:37.375632

1. Global solar and wind generation overtake coal for the first time

Solar and wind outpaced the growth of global electricity demand in the first half of 2025, vaulting renewables toward overtaking coal worldwide for the first time on record, according to analysis published Tuesday by the research outfit Ember. This year’s growth resulted in a small overall decline in both coal and gas-fired power generation, with India and China seeing the most notable reductions, despite the United States and Europe ratcheting up fossil fuel usage. “We are seeing the first signs of a crucial turning point,” Malgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, a senior electricity analyst at Ember, said in a statement. “Solar and wind are now growing fast enough to meet the world’s growing appetite for electricity. This marks the beginning of a shift where clean power is keeping pace with demand growth.”

Wind and solar installations matched 109% of new global demand for power in the first half of 2025.Ember

That growth is projected to continue. Later on Tuesday morning, the International Energy Agency released its own report forecasting that renewable capacity will double over the next five years. Solar is predicted to make up 80% of that growth. But, factoring in the Trump administration’s policies, the forecast roughly cut in half previous projections for U.S. growth. Domestic opposition to renewables runs beyond the White House, too. Exclusive data gathered by Heatmap Pro and published in July showed that a fifth of U.S. counties now restrict development of renewables.

2. Trump orders controversial Alaska mining road to move forward

President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday directing federal agencies to push forward with a controversial 211-mile mining road in Alaska designed to facilitate production of copper, zinc, gallium, and other critical minerals. The project, which the Biden administration halted last year over concerns for permafrost in the fast-warming region, has been at the center of a decadeslong legal battle. As part of the deal, the U.S. government will invest $35.6 million in Alaska’s Ambler Mining District, including taking a 10% stake in the main developer, Trilogy Metals, that includes warrants to buy an additional 7.5% of the company. The road itself will be jointly owned by the state, the federal government, and Alaska Native villages. “It’s a very, very big deal from the standpoint of minerals and energy,” Trump said in the Oval Office.

It’s just the latest stake the Trump administration has taken in a mineral company. In July, the Department of Defense became the largest shareholder of MP Materials, the company producing rare earths in the U.S. at its Mountain Pass mine in California. The move, The Economist noted at the time, marked the biggest American experiment in direct government ownership since the nationalization of the railroads in World War I. Last week, the Department of Energy renegotiated a loan to Lithium Americas’ Thacker Pass project in Nevada to take a stake in what’s set to become the largest lithium mine in the Western Hemisphere when it comes online in the next few years. The White House’s mineral shopping spree isn’t over. On Friday, Reuters reported that the administration is considering buying shares in Critical Metals, the company looking to develop rare earths production in Greenland. In response to the news, shares in the Nasdaq-traded miner surged 62% on Monday. Partial nationalization isn’t the only approach the administration is taking to challenging China’s grip over global mineral supplies. Last month, as I reported for Heatmap, the Defense Logistics Agency awarded money to Xerion, an Ohio startup devising a novel way to process cobalt and gallium.

3. Tesla set to roll out a cheaper Model Y — plus a surprise

Tesla looks poised to unveil a cheaper, stripped-down version of its Model Y as early as today. In one of two short videos posted to CEO Elon Musk’s X social media site, the electric automaker showed the midsize SUV’s signature lights beaming through the dark. The design matches what InsideEVs noted were likely images of the prototype spotted on a test drive in Texas. The second teaser video showed what appears to be a fast-spinning, Tesla-branded fan. “Your guess is as good as ours as to what will be revealed,” InsideEVs’ Andrei Nedelea wrote Monday. “Our money is on the Roadster or a new vacuum cleaner design to take on Dyson.”

The new products come amid an historic slump for Tesla. As Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin reported, the company’s share of the U.S. electric vehicle sales sank to their lowest-ever level in August despite the surge in purchases as Americans rushed to use the federal tax credits before they expired thanks to Trump’s landmark One Big Beautiful Bill Act law. Yet Musk has managed to steer the automaker’s financial fate through an attention-grabbing maneuver. Last month, the world’s richest man bought $1 billion in Tesla shares in a show of self confidence that managed to rebound the company’s stock price. But Andrew Moseman argued in Heatmap that “the bullish stock market performance is divorced not only from the reality of the company’s electric car sales, but also from, well, everything else that’s happened lately.”

4. Heavy duty trucks come in for tariffs

On Monday, Trump warned that medium and heavy-duty trucks imported to the U.S. will face a 25% tariff starting on November 1. The president announced the trade levies in a post on Truth Social on the eve of a White House visit by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, whose country would feel the pinch of tariffs on imported trucks. As the Financial Times noted, Trump had threatened to impose 25% tariffs on some trucks in late September but “failed to implement them, raising questions about his commitment to the policy.”

5. Fusion faces serious supply chain challenges

Fusion startups make a lot of bold claims about how soon a technology long dismissed as the energy source of tomorrow will be able to produce commercial electrons. Though investors are betting that, as Heatmap’s Katie Brigham wrote last year, “it is finally, possibly, almost time for fusion,” a new report from the University of Pennsylvania’s Kleinman Center for Energy Policy shows that supply chain challenges threaten to hold back the nascent industry even if it can bring laboratory breakthroughs to market. Tritium, one of two main fusion fuels, has a half life of just 12.3 years, meaning it does not exist in significant quantities in nature. Today, tritium is primarily produced by 30 pressurized heavy water fission reactors globally, but only at a total of 4 kilograms per year. As a result, “tritium availability could throttle fusion development,” the report found. That’s not the only bottleneck. “The fusion industry will require specialized components that don’t yet have well-established supply chains, like superconducting cables and the aforementioned advanced materials, and shortages of these components would delay development and inflate costs.”

THE KICKER

Scientists mapped the RNA — the molecules that carry out DNA’s instructions — of wheat and, for the first time, identified when certain genes are active. The discovery promises to accelerate plant breeders’ efforts to develop more resilient varieties of the world’s most widely cultivated crop that use less fertilizer, resist higher temperatures, and survive with less water as the climate changes. “We discovered how groups of genes work together as regulatory networks to control gene expression,” Rachel Rusholme-Pilcher, the study’s lead author and a researcher at Britain’s Earlham Institute, said in a statement. “Our research allowed us to look at how these network connections differ between wheat varieties, revealing new sources of genetic diversity that could be critical in boosting the resilience of wheat.”

Rather than trying to build a full-scale reactor that can produce net energy via a self-sustaining fusion reaction right off the bat, Shine uses a particle accelerator to drive a series of small-scale fusion reactions. When high-energy ions connect with fuels, such as tritium or deuterium, they undergo a fusion reaction that produces high-energy neutrons and specialized isotopes more often generated for use in industry via fission.

Piefer, who has a PhD in nuclear engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, started up his company by making neutrons for materials testing in the aerospace and defense industries. Unlike other forms of radiation, such as X-rays, neutrons can penetrate dense materials such as metals, hydrogen-containing fuels, or ceramics, making it possible to spot hidden flaws. An otherwise invisible crack in a turbine blade, for example, could still block or scatter neutrons, while contamination from water or oil would absorb neutrons — making these faults clear in a radiographic image.

Scientists also use neutrons to test nuclear fission fuel by identifying contamination and verifying uranium enrichment levels. According to Piefer, Shine produces the neutrons used to test half of all fission fuel today. “Fusion actually already enables the production of 50% of the fission fuel in this country,” he told me.

My mind was blown. I didn’t understand how fusion — a famously expensive endeavor — could be an economically viable option for these applications.

Piefer understood. “I’ll sit here in one breath and I’ll tell you fusion is way too expensive to compete making electricity, and in another breath that it’s much cheaper than fission for making isotopes and doing testing,” he said. As Piefer went on to explain, if the goal isn’t net energy, you can strip the fusion reactor of a good deal of complexity — no superconducting magnets, complicated structures to produce tritium fuel, or control systems to keep the burning fusion plasma contained.

With a simplified system, Piefer told me, it’s much easier to produce a fusion reaction than a fission reaction. The latter, he explained, “operates on the razor’s edge of something called criticality” — a self-sustaining reaction that must be precisely balanced. If a fission reaction accelerates too quickly, power surges dangerously and you get a disaster like Chernobyl. If it slows, there’s simply no reaction at all. Plus, even after a fission reactor shuts down, it keeps producing heat, and thus must be actively cooled. But when it comes to fusion, there’s no danger of an out of control power surge, because, unlike fission, it’s not a chain reaction — if the input conditions change, fusion stops immediately. Furthermore, fusion produces no heat after the reaction stops.

Some of Shine’s customers include manufacturers of turbine blades and explosives such as the U.S. Army and GE Hitachi, as well as the biopharmaceutical companies Blue Earth Therapeutics and Telix Pharmaceuticals. Piefer told me that the company is now “on the verge of essentially breakeven” — no fusion pun intended — when it comes to its operating expenses. These days, it’s reinvesting much of its revenue to build out what Piefer says will be the largest isotope production facility in the world in Wisconsin. Isotopes are created when high energy neutrons strike stable elements, causing the nuclei to absorb the neutron and become radioactive. The isotope’s radioactive properties make them useful for targeting particular tissues, cells, or organs in medical imaging or focused therapies..

Shine’s in-progress facility will primarily produce molybdenum‑99, the most commonly used isotope for medical imaging. The company already operates one smaller isotope facility producing lutetium-177, which features in cutting-edge cancer therapies.

Compared to materials testing, producing medical isotopes has required Shine to increase the temperature and thus the efficiency of its fusion target. Subsequent applications will require greater efficiency still. The idea is that as Shine applies its tech to increasingly challenging and energy-intensive tasks, it will also move step by step toward a commercially viable, net-energy-generating fusion reactor. Piefer just doesn’t know what exactly those incremental improvements will look like.

The company hasn’t committed to any specific reactor design for its fusion energy device yet, and Piefer told me that at this stage, he doesn’t think it’s necessary to pick winners. “We don’t have to, and don’t want to,” he said. “We’ve got this flexible manufacturing platform that’s doing all the things you need to do to get really good at making fusion systems, regardless of technology.”

Fusion energy aside, the company doesn’t even know how it’s going to reach the heat and efficiency requirements needed to achieve its next target — recycling spent fission fuel. But Piefer told me that if Shine can get there, scientists do already understand the chemistry. First, Shine would separate out the long-lived, highly radioactive waste products from the spent fuel using much the same approach it uses for isolating medical isotopes, no fusion reaction needed. Then, Piefer told me, “fusion can turn those long-lived wastes into short-lived waste” by using high-energy fusion neutrons to alter the radioactive nuclei in ways that make them decay faster.

If the company pulls that off — a big if indeed — it would then move on to building an energy-generating reactor. Overall, Piefer guesses this final stage will wind up taking the fusion industry “more time and money than most people predict.” Perhaps, he said, investors will prove willing to bankroll buzzy fusion startups far longer than their ambitious timelines currently imply. But perhaps not. And in the meantime, he thinks many companies will end up turning to the very markets that Shine has been exploring for decades now.

“So we’re well positioned to work with them, well positioned to help create mutual success, or well positioned to use our position to move ourselves forward,” Piefer told me, hinting that the company would be interested in making acquisitions.

Indeed, some fusion companies are already following Shine’s lead, eyeing isotopes as an early — or primary — revenue generating opportunity. Microreactor company Avalanche Energy eventually wants to replace diesel generators, but in the meantime plans to produce radioisotopes for medical and energy applications. U.K.-based fusion company Astral Systems is also making desktop-sized reactors, but with the central aim of selling medical isotopes.

If too many companies break their promises or extend their timelines interminably, as Piefer thinks is likely, more and more will come around to the pragmatism of Shine’s approach, he said. “Near term applications are increasingly talked about,” Piefer told me. “They’re not the highlight of the show yet, but I’d say the voice is getting louder.”

So while he still doesn’t have any idea what the final form for Shine’s hypothetical fusion power plant will take, in his mind the company is leading the race. “I believe we’re actually on the fastest path to fusion commercialization for energy of anybody out there,” Piefer told me. “Because commercial is important to us, and it always has been.”

“It was definitely touch and go whether this was all going to come together,” Victoria Rome, the director of California government affairs for the Natural Resources Defense Council, told me. “It was a lot of complicated policy to put forward in a relatively short time frame.”

The package reauthorizes California’s signature cap and trade program, rebranded as “cap and invest,” with a slight tweak that will help lower electricity bills. It clears a major hurdle to creating a more integrated Western electricity market that has the potential to deliver cleaner energy throughout the region at lower cost. It replenishes a rapidly diminishing wildfire fund that ensures utilities don’t go belly-up when they’re found liable for wildfires — and offsets the cost to customers by limiting how much of the cost of transmission upgrades utilities are allowed to pass on. And lastly — and most controversially — in an attempt to stabilize gasoline prices, it streamlines approval of new oil wells in Kern County, California.

Not everyone was happy with the compromise. The Center for Biological Diversity condemned the oil and gas bill, while environmental justice advocates were angry that lawmakers did not do more to protect low-income communities in the reform of cap and trade. It also remains to be seen how much the cost containment measures will help. Some of them, like the new Western electricity market, likely won’t pay off for many years. The cap and trade extension could ultimately exacerbate costs.

A few other groundbreaking climate-related bills are still sitting on Newsom’s desk, such as one that would set a safe maximum indoor temperature, requiring landlords to provide cooling to tenants, and another that would override local zoning rules to allow taller, denser housing to be built near public transit. He has until next Monday to sign them. But even without those, the package illustrates how California Democrats are at least trying to leverage the new politics of affordability to advance their climate goals, and the ways in which the two are difficult to align.

Here’s a breakdown of the major changes.

Cap and trade invest through 2045

California’s cap and trade program is the state’s centerpiece climate policy. It puts a price on pollution by requiring dirty industries to buy and retire state-auctioned “allowances” for every ton of carbon they emit, with a declining amount of allowances released into the market each year. Funds raised through allowance sales are funneled into utility bill credits for consumers as well as climate-friendly projects throughout the state.

Prior to last month’s legislation, the program was only authorized to continue through 2030, and the closer that date got, the greater the uncertainty became about whether it would continue. According to one analysis, that uncertainty cost the state $3.6 billion in revenues over the year ending in May 2025 as companies relied on allowances they’d stocked up on in previous years, when they were cheaper and more plentiful. If the program was going to expire in 2030, there was less incentive to collect more — or to invest in emission-reducing solutions like replacing their boilers with industrial heat pumps.

The legislature extended cap and trade through 2045, rebranding as “cap and invest” — a more politically resonant title originating in Washington State that highlights the revenue-raising aspect of the program. It also introduced several key reforms. By 2031, earnings from the program reserved for utility credits will go exclusively toward electric bill savings, i.e. it will no longer subsidize residential gas. “The general idea was that almost every gas customer is an electric customer,” Danny Cullenward, a California-based climate economist and lawyer, told me. “And so if you shift the same total dollars from gas and electric to just electric, you concentrate the benefits on the electric side, which supports building decarbonization, but you don’t take any dollars away from the customer.”

California has the highest electric rates in the continental U.S., and so right now, switching from using natural gas to all-electric appliances is not in everyone’s best interest. Providing more relief on the electric side will help with that — especially as the price of allowances increases in the coming years, translating into more revenue to fund bill credits. The legislation also directs electric utilities to apply the credits over the summer, when bills are highest, rather than on the twice-a-year schedule they used previously.

The other major reform has to do with the way carbon offsets are integrated into the program. Previously, companies could purchase offsets instead of allowances to account for a certain amount of their emissions, giving them a cheaper way to comply. Now, every time a company retires an offset instead of an allowance, the state will also retire an allowance. This is an implicit recognition by lawmakers that carbon offsets haven’t been effective at reducing emissions, Cullenward told me.

While he called the extension of cap and invest a “profound and important accomplishment,” Cullenward also raised major concerns about its future impacts on affordability. The program literally puts a price on carbon, after all, and that price is now set to rise, pervading much of California’s economy, from the pump to the cost of goods and services. “Outside of my hope that this will be a net benefit for electric utility ratepayers, which I think is a very good and positive thing, this is not an affordability bill,” he told me.

Lawmakers have done nothing to mitigate the program’s effect on gasoline and diesel costs, he pointed out. They also haven’t addressed the elephant in the room — a $95 price ceiling on allowances that, if they ever get there, may be politically untenable. (Right now prices are around $30.) State regulators now have a chance to revise the price ceiling, Cullenward said, ideally with an eye toward balancing ambition with consumer cost impacts. “That’s the main part of the work that is completely not yet done,” he said.

Toward the creation of a coordinated Western grid

Energy nerds throughout the West have been scheming to unite its disparate grids for years. Unlike the entire eastern half of the country, where utilities buy and sell energy across state lines in competitive markets on both a daily and realtime basis, and work together to plan transmission upgrades throughout their territories, most Western states do all of their energy trading through longer-term bilateral contracts.

After years of failed efforts to change that, lawmakers have finally given California’s grid operator their blessing to work with other states in the region on creating such a market. Proponents argue that more competition and coordination between utilities in the West will create efficiencies that save money, improve reliability, and accelerate decarbonization. For example, California, which often produces more solar energy than it can use during the day, would be able to sell more of that power to other states. When there’s a heat wave coming, it’ll have more supply to draw from.

To be clear, California was already working on all this prior to last month’s legislation. The state’s grid operator launched a realtime electricity trading market in 2014, which now has 21 utility participants throughout the West. Next year it will launch an extended day-ahead market, enabling utilities to buy power about a week in advance of when they’ll need it. That will initially have just two participants, PacifiCorp and Portland General Electric, with five others planning to join in later years.

But seven companies does not a competitive market make. To grow to its fullest potential, the day-ahead market will need many more participants. That was always going to be a tough sell so long as California was in charge, Vijay Satyal, the deputy director of regional markets at the nonprofit Western Resource Advocates, told me. CAISO, California’s grid operator, is overseen by a governor-appointed board, “which is one reason why the larger West never wanted to be part of CAISO, if the governance and decision making would be controlled by the governor of one state,” he said.

An effort is already underway between state officials, utilities, and other stakeholders, including those from California, to create an independently-governed Western Energy Market called the West-Wide Governance Pathways Initiative. The new legislation grants CAISO permission to transition governance of its realtime and day-ahead markets to the organization that comes out of that effort — as long as the group meets certain requirements around transparency and engagement with state leadership.

“Now there’s opportunity for all the utilities across the West to come together and for clean energy developers to be part of a larger market and be transparent, independent, and not controlled by one state’s policies,” Satyal told me. The other advantage of having this regional organization is that it can engage in more coordinated transmission planning — another potential cost-saving measure.

Some relief from wildfire costs

Wildfires have been a huge part of California’s electricity affordability crisis. Case in point: Since 2019, Californians have had to pay an extra fee on top of their electric bills that goes into a state Wildfire Fund to help utilities cover post-wildfire loss and damage claims — a sort of insurance mechanism to prevent utility insolvency.

This year, lawmakers were under pressure to add more money to the pot. Experts worried that without another infusion, payments related to January’s Eaton Fire in Los Angeles, which the U.S. Department of Justice alleges was caused by faulty utility equipment, would deplete much of what’s left.

The legislature extended the fee, adding $18 billion to the Wildfire Fund that will be split evenly between ratepayers and utility shareholders over the next decade. But it also passed several measures that will help offset that cost by minimizing future rate increases. First, utilities will be prohibited from earning a profit on the first $6 billion they spend on wildfire mitigation projects, such as burying power lines, starting next year. Companies will be required to finance this spending more cheaply through ratepayer-backed bonds rather than through equity, which commands a higher rate of return.

On top of that, the legislature directed the governor’s office to create a “Transmission Infrastructure Accelerator,” a program that will develop public financing options for new transmission lines, such as low-cost loans, revenue bonds, or even partial public ownership of the projects. The program will have a dedicated “Revolving Fund” that will be replenished each year with a portion of cap and invest revenue.

“It is the largest electricity affordability measure in the whole package,” Sam Uden, the co-founder and managing director for the nonprofit policy shop Net Zero California, told me — to the tune of $3 billion in savings per year once the new lines are constructed, according to an analysis his group commissioned.

More drilling

Gavin Newsom has not necessarily been a friend to the oil industry. He’s instituted distance requirements for new oil wells barring drilling near homes and schools, and given local jurisdictions more authority over drilling. But gasoline prices — ever a political issue in California — have tested his resolve. The price at the pump in California has averaged around a dollar higher than the rest of the U.S. for the past several years, and that margin has crept up closer to $1.30 this year. After two of the state’s refineries announced they would close this year and next, threatening to drive prices higher, Newsom backed a bill this session to increase oil production in Kern County.

Uden of Net Zero California justified the bill as a “short term measure.” The provisions that streamline drilling permits only apply through 2036. “We are really trying to grapple with what is a very difficult transition,” he told me. “We’ve got to phase down oil, but we can’t do it in a way that just spikes gas prices.”

It’s unclear, however, whether more drilling in Kern County will do much to address the problem — especially if the cap and invest program continues to drive up prices, as Cullenward fears. At least to date, the state’s high gasoline prices have not been caused by a lack of gasoline supply, according to University of California, Berkeley, economist Severin Borenstein. The bigger factors driving price increases are taxes and environmental fees and the special blend of gasoline required by the state’s air quality regulators.

What will drive prices up are refinery closures. Lawmakers are making a bet that increased in-state oil production will prevent further closures by giving refineries access to cheaper crude. But Borenstein notes that the state will continue to rely on crude imports, meaning the price of gasoline will still be tied to the global market. His preferred solution to keep prices in check is to remove barriers to importing more refined gasoline.

“The longer run challenge is to balance refining supply and demand, which oil production doesn’t address,” Borenstein wrote.

Michael Wara, a senior research scholar at Stanford University’s Woods Institute for the Environment, agreed on the urgency of opening a new import terminal. He told me he saw the Kern County bill as a way to buy time. “We’ve done the kind of stopgap measure. The increased permits will help stabilize Northern California refineries for probably a couple years,” he said. “But if we don’t use that couple of years in the right way, then we will be in big trouble.”

Wara also wasn’t too worried about the measure creating some kind of oil Renaissance. “Permits are one thing. The decision to actually drill a well is an economic decision that’s going to be driven by oil prices, which are pretty low right now. I don’t think anybody thinks that handing out more permits is going to stem the decline in that industry.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTcyMDg2Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgxNjI2MDk5OX0.k-t2cnSZwYO8RZtSCfRund8J0kikIwEJZg5HRQKaV5A/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-10-07 15:05:32.271239

As the Trump Administration recklessly slashes over $33 million from clean energy projects in his district and more than $608 million in critical investments across Colorado, Evans is nowhere to be found.

Evans’ silence is especially ironic considering that just last month, he:

Penned an op-ed arguing that “now, more than ever, we need to invest in… innovative energy technologies” and that “modernized grids are… part of the equation.” One of the now-cancelled grants – worth $27 million – would have helped “optimize” the grid in Evans’ rural district.

Held an energy roundtable where he “reiterated [his] commitment to increasing jobs and ensuring Weld County remained a top energy producer in the state.”

Visited with one of the companies now bracing for more than $6 million in cuts and noted how their “investment will help provide more reliable, safe, and affordable energy for #CO08.”

But now that D.C. Party Bosses have decided to gut these clean energy projects, it’s crickets from Gabe Evans.

REMINDER: After voting for the Big, Ugly Bill earlier this year, Evans admitted he was jeopardizing millions in investments and thousands of good-paying jobs in his district and begged Senate Republican leaders to “mitigate” the negative impacts of his own vote.

Global solar generation grew by a record 31% in the first half of the year, while wind generation grew by 7.7%, according to the report by the energy think tank Ember, which was released after midnight Tuesday London time. Solar and wind generation combined grew by more than 400 terawatt hours, which was more than overall global demand increased in the same period, it found.

The findings suggest it is possible for the world to wean off polluting sources of power — even as demand for electricity skyrockets — with continued investment in renewables including solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal energies.

“That means that they can keep up the pace with growing appetite for electricity worldwide,” said Małgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, senior electricity analyst at Ember and lead author of the study.

At the same time, total fossil fuel generation dropped slightly, by less than 1%.

“The fall overall of fossil may be small, but it is significant,” said Wiatros-Motyka. “This is a turning point when we see emissions plateauing.”

The firm analyzes monthly data from 88 countries representing the vast majority of electricity demand around the world. Reasons that demand is increasing include economic growth, electric vehicles and data centers, rising populations in developing countries and the need for more cooling as temperatures rise.

Meeting that demand by burning fossil fuels such as coal and gas for electricity releases planet-warming gases including carbon dioxide and methane. This leads to more severe, costly and deadly extreme weather.

Analyzing major markets

Ember also dedicated part of its report to an analysis of China, India, the European Union and the U.S. Combined, they account for nearly two-thirds of electricity generation and carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector globally.

In the first six months of the year, China added more solar and wind than the rest of the world combined, and its fossil fuel generation fell by 2%, the report said.

India saw record solar and wind growth that outpaced the growth in demand. India’s fossil fuel generation also dropped.

In both nations, emissions fell.

“It’s often been said by analysts that renewable energy doesn’t really lead to a reduction in fossil fuel use,” said Michael Gerrard, founder and director of the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, who was not involved in the report. “This report highlights an encouraging step in the opposite direction.”

But in the U.S., demand growth outpaced the growth of clean power generation. In the E.U., sluggish wind and hydropower generation contributed to higher coal and gas generation, the report said. In both markets, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased.

Challenges in the US

The U.S. clean energy market faces challenges as President Donald Trump’s administration shifts federal policy away from renewables and toward boosting coal, oil and gas production. The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.

Meanwhile, the administration has lifted barriers to coal mining, granted two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants and other polluting industries and dedicated millions of dollars to these coal plants.

In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly last month, Trump attacked renewable energy and questioned the validity of the concept of climate change.

Experts warn that Trump’s efforts to block clean energy will have a long-term impact.

“The federal government is greatly increasing the growth of artificial intelligence, which is going to massively increase electricity demand, and they’re also shutting down the cheapest new sources of electricity, wind and solar. That’s going to lead to a gap in supply and demand,” Gerrard said.

Renewables “still have an opportunity to make inroads in to displacing fossil fuels, even with some demand growth,” said Amanda Smith, senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown, who also wasn’t involved in the report. But, Smith said: “I am very cautiously optimistic that renewables can continue to grow and continue to displace fossil fuels in the U.S. I am more optimistic on the world scale.”

Lithium-ion batteries have transformed the industry due to their high energy density, lightweight design, and long cycle life. However, as the battery industry expands, safety concerns have become a pressing issue. Incidents involving battery fires, thermal runaway, and improper transportation or disposal have highlighted the need for robust safety standards and risk mitigation strategies.

The battery industry is currently navigating a complex landscape of evolving safety regulations and standards, including those established by organizations such as the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), Underwriters Laboratories (UL), and the United Nations (UN), which apply to transportation and storage. These standards aim to address critical issues, including the prevention of overheating, proper labeling for hazardous materials, and safe recycling practices. Understanding where the industry stands today involves not only recognizing the advancements in battery technology but also acknowledging the challenges in ensuring compliance with these safety measures.

A group of more than 10 experts at the Battery Show North America provided insights during a workshop titled ""Battery Safety - A Comprehensive Risk Mitigation Plan."" These industry experts brought their unique viewpoints and expertise to the discussion, offering valuable commentary on the current state of the battery industry, emerging safety challenges, and the importance of compliance with evolving standards. A key focus of the discussion was the critical need for fire departments and first responders to understand how to effectively mitigate battery fires, particularly those involving lithium-ion batteries. Here are some of the insights from some of the panelists.

Bridging the gap between fire departments and battery technology

Caroline Rudacille, Fire Lieutenant at Baltimore County Fire Department, emphasized that battery fires are fundamentally different from traditional fires and require specialized techniques. She pointed out that battery fires are ""not a fire"" in the traditional sense; they are something entirely different that fire departments are struggling to understand and respond to effectively. Fire departments are ""behind"" the technology and rely heavily on industry expertise during incidents, stressing that collaboration between battery companies and local fire departments is essential. Firefighters encounter these incidents daily but often lack the specialized knowledge needed for a safe and effective response.

Addressing safety across the battery lifecycle

Dr. Veronika Wright, CEO and Founder of Electrification Academy, emphasizes the importance of understanding battery safety across the entire life cycle, not just after an incident occurs. She explained that battery fire incidents stem from multiple trigger categories, including thermal abuse (overheating), mechanical abuse (crashes or structural damage), and electrical abuse (overcharging).

However, she emphasized that the least understood triggers are internal defects and manufacturing defects that can develop over time. As she said, ""any fresh battery cells can go into a thermal runaway, because there could be internal defects, manufacturing defects. A battery cell, a lithium-ion battery cell, is so sensitive, in a way, it really reacts to the littlest, tiniest impurifications."" Wright noted that these defects may only manifest through aging processes, and the industry currently lacks proper tracking systems to understand when and where these incidents actually originate—whether at the cell level, system level, or within the battery management system (BMS). She advocated for better incident tracking and knowledge sharing across the battery lifecycle to learn from these events and improve safety measures.

Closing gaps in dangerous goods transportation

Elizabeth Gibbons Barber, Founder, Principal Consultant at Empower to Comply LLC identified critical gaps in the transportation of dangerous goods, emphasizing that the industry faces significant challenges as technology rapidly evolves. She said, “There are a lot of differences in how teams and organized organizations interpret what Damaged, Defective, Recalled (DDR) means because it's a qualitative determination. You have to talk with technical experts to determine your risk.""

She emphasized that compliance doesn't always equate to safety, highlighting concerns about regulatory requirements that may not adequately address real-world risks: ""It's important to audit beyond compliance and apply risk-based improvements."" She advocated for industry collaboration to address these gaps, saying, ""I encourage everyone to lean into the vulnerability, to just say, like, here are my questions, where vulnerability can be hard when you're representing your organization, and I get the liability point, but it's a good time for us to discuss with each other. Ultimately, Gibbons reminded the audience that ""incidents remind us to stay humble and keep learning. Regulations exist because of lessons paid in lives, property, and money, and every safer seat and every compliance shipment adds to that silent success story.""",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt70ddcd21313a2be2/68e42a6ea8e89107685f64d1/Battery_Safety_Workshop.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-07 16:02:12.544077

The Rhode Island AFL-CIO is lead plaintiff in the suit, filed in federal court in Providence.
The Solar for All program was projected by the Biden administration to help 900,000 households get access to solar power.
It would save Americans, the Biden administration said, $350 million a year in energy costs.
“This is like a one-two punch to the people of Rhode Island,” he said.","A major Rhode Island labor union and a coalition of homeowners, solar energy companies and nonprofits sued the Environmental Protection Agency on Monday, over its termination of $7 billion in grants meant to help low- and moderate-income families install solar panels.

The suit concerns the Solar for All program, part of the Biden administration’s signature climate legislation. The lawsuit accuses the EPA of illegally clawing-back funding without Congressional approval.

The Rhode Island AFL-CIO is lead plaintiff in the suit, filed in federal court in Providence. Patrick Crowley, the union’s president, said cancelling the program means losing hundreds of jobs in the state. Nationally, the program was projected to generate 200,000 new jobs.

“It’s going to limit the amount of work opportunities for the members that I represent to do solar installation,” Crowley said. “It’s going to lead to increased energy costs, because without solar energy as part of an ‘all of the above strategy,’ it means that Rhode Island is going to be subject to more turbulence in the electricity market, like we’ve seen over the last several winters.”

The plaintiffs are represented by the Southern Environmental Law Center, the Rhode Island Center for Justice and Lawyers for Good Government.

The Solar for All program was projected by the Biden administration to help 900,000 households get access to solar power. It would save Americans, the Biden administration said, $350 million a year in energy costs.

But EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called Solar for All “a boondoggle,” in a video on social media. Over the summer, it was one of several big renewable energy programs that saw funding clawed back by the Trump administration.

“This is just another example of the administration targeting programs that would help low-income, disadvantaged communities,” Crowley said, “but also the hurt states like Rhode Island that want to diversify our energy portfolio so that we can control costs.”

Rhode Island’s share of the $7 billion program amounted to more than $49 million.

The AFL-CIO’s Crowley said the cancellation of Solar for All will hurt that much more because of the abrupt cancellation of off-shore wind projects like Revolution Wind.

“This is like a one-two punch to the people of Rhode Island,” he said. “It’s going to hurt everyone’s pocketbook.”

The ash dust is fine as talc, and breathing it is making neighbors sick.
Oh, and let’s not forget the Frankenfish and other mutant creatures horribly disfigured by coal ash poisoning.","Looking for a scary Halloween story? Well you’ve come to the right place for a tale that will chill your bones and leave you questioning all you once thought true. While your typical ghost story always has a spooky setting (an empty stretch of highway in a rainstorm, or a cemetery at midnight…), hinting at the presence of witches, monsters or zombies, this story could be happening in your own backyard. You, your family, your neighbors are all unsuspecting of the dangers lurking nearby.

I’m talking about coal ash, the toxic menace creeping across our landscape like The Blob, gobbling up hundreds of acres and looming over communities across America. The waste is truly a mad scientist’s brew of toxic heavy metals, pollutants and other power plant waste. Dumped in giant open lagoons, most of which are unlined and located directly along our favorite waterways, slowly poisoning rivers, lakes and streams. Across the Southeast there are over 450 of these dumps, at least 21 of these are real monsters earning them a high hazard rating from EPA. Unlike good old-fashioned monsters and ghouls that leap out to grab you, this hidden danger literally seeps into people’s lives; plaguing communities with mysterious illnesses, shattering people’s dreams and leaving ghost towns in its wake.

This is truly the stuff of nightmares and it’s happening more than any of us would like to think.

Take, for example a few particularly frightening tales from across our region. There’s the horror story going on in Juliette, Georgia; a picturesque rural town that’s served as the bucolic backdrop of several movies. Community members living near the Scherer Power Station started suffering from bizarre diseases with no explanation–rare forms of cancer, kidney disease and disfiguring hives. After years of medical tests they discovered their drinking water was poisoned with uranium and other heavy metals. It’s like finding out that the killer calling you is already in your house! Worse yet, there’s no way to get away from the horror; with their property values destroyed, Juliette residents are forced to live through a never-ending ordeal, afraid of the water that comes into their homes.

The community of Cane Run, Kentucky had been haunted by coal ash for years as Louisville Electric & Gas has piled the toxic trash into a mountain that looms over the community. A grey phantom hangs over nearby homes as toxic dust blows from the piles of ash, blanketing everything in its path and sending neighbors running into their homes for safety. The ash dust is fine as talc, and breathing it is making neighbors sick. Children are especially vulnerable to doses of mercury, lead, arsenic and other poisons in the ash and can ingest these toxics when they play outside. In the words of one Cane Run resident:

“You’ve got black soot everywhere…kids that have learning disabilities. There’s excessive amounts of ADHD. There’s excessive amounts of cancer, kidney disease. People are sick there constantly. They’re dying. I’m just sick and tired of it. I’ve lived there for 35 years and all I do is watch people die.”

These are only a few of the horrifying examples of communities threatened by coal ash — if you want to get really scared check out www.SoutheastCoalAsh.org to find out if ash lurks in the places you live, work and play. This waste can strike in other blood curdling ways, too. Sometimes, as happened in 2008 in the Kingston disaster, entire neighborhoods are wiped out in a single day by a billion gallon flood of toxic sludge.

What Happened? On October 3, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a proposed rule providing regulatory relief from certain requirements of the Agency’s 2023 Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) Technology Transitions Rule (TTR), which implements subsection (i) of the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act of 2020 (AIM Act), 42 U.S.C. § 7675(i). The proposed rule addresses topics raised in four administrative petitions and other stakeholder requests regarding specific regulatory requirements. The proposed relief includes extended compliance dates and more lenient global warming potential (GWP) thresholds for acceptable refrigerants.

Who Is Affected? The proposed rule potentially affects manufacturers, importers, and users of residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump systems, retail food refrigeration equipment for remote condensing units and supermarkets, chillers and industrial process refrigeration equipment used in semiconductor manufacturing, refrigerated transport intermodal containers, refrigeration systems in cold storage warehouses, refrigerated laboratory centrifuges and refrigerated laboratory shakers, and condensing units used for residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pumps.

What Should You Do? Stakeholders affected by the proposed rule should carefully review the proposal and consider submitting comments to the docket (Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0005). Comments are due on or before November 17, 2025.

Key Elements of the Proposed Rule

Retail Food Refrigeration – Remote Condensing Unit Systems and Supermarket Systems. The 2023 TTR established restrictions on the use of HFCs in new remote condensing unit systems (starting January 1, 2026) and new supermarket systems (January 1, 2027). The GWP limit in the 2023 TTR is 150 for systems with refrigerant charge capacities greater than or equal to 200 pounds, and 300 for systems with refrigerant charge capacities less than 200 pounds or for the high temperature side of cascade systems, irrespective of the total charge capacity.

Food retailers and a trade association raised concerns about the limited number and types of refrigerant substitutes that EPA had previously determined would be available for use in remote condensing unit systems and supermarket systems by the respective January 1, 2026, and 2027 compliance dates. As a result of these concerns, EPA proposes an interim GWP limit of 1,400 starting January 1, 2026, for new remote condensing units and starting January 1, 2027, for new supermarket systems. Starting January 1, 2032, the GWP limit for remote condensing units and supermarket systems would revert to 150 or 300, depending on the system. EPA did not propose changes to the 150 GWP limit for systems with a refrigerant charge of200 pounds or more, nor to the 300 GWP limit for systems with a refrigerant charge of less than 200 pounds or for the high-temperature side of a cascade system.

EPA also requests comment on whether the expansion of cooling capacity in BTU/hour (e.g., 25 percent) would be allowable during a remodel of a supermarket system without triggering the requirements at 40 C.F.R. § 84.54(e). EPA is requesting comment to address stakeholder concerns that 40 C.F.R. § 84.54(e)(2) and (3) may result in supermarkets having to replace legacy systems before the end of their useful life.

Chillers and Industrial Process Refrigeration Equipment Used in Semiconductor Manufacturing. EPA proposes extending the compliance date for certain chillers used for industrial process refrigeration (IPR) and certain IPR equipment used to manufacture semiconductors (i.e., semiconductor manufacturing and related equipment or SMRE) with charge sizes of 100 pounds or less from January 1, 2026, or January 1, 2028, as applicable, to January 1, 2030. SEMI, the global trade association for the semiconductor supply chain, challenged the 2023 TTR and petitioned EPA to reconsider the compliance dates that affect SMRE for the IPR and chillers for IPR subsectors. (Beveridge & Diamond represents SEMI in challenging the rule and petitioning for administrative reconsideration.)

In addition to delaying the compliance dates, EPA stated that it “understands that IPR and Chillers for IPR used in the semiconductor manufacturing industry may operate at one temperature while being designed to reach lower temperatures” and that “the lowest temperature at which equipment is designed to operate determines whether it is subject to use restrictions.” EPA requests comment on the charge size threshold applicable to SMRE and whether to exempt SMRE from 40 C.F.R. § 84.54, although EPA notes that it is not proposing to exempt this equipment.

Refrigerated Transport – Intermodal Containers. In response to a petition from an intermodal container manufacturer, EPA proposes adjusting the lower bound temperature exclusion threshold of -50 °C to -35 °C, and changing the location where that temperature is measured from the temperature of the refrigerant entering the evaporator (for direct heat exchange systems) or the temperature of the fluid exiting (for chillers) to the “box temperature.” In addition, the petitioner requested that EPA clarify that the temperature measurement be based on the lowest temperature at which the equipment is “designed to reach and maintain.” EPA clarified this means that if a refrigerated transport intermodal container has the capacity to achieve a box temperature below -35 °C, it would not be subject to the TTR restrictions even if at times the container is operated at temperatures at or above -35 °C.

Other Aspects of the Proposal

Condensing Units – Residential and Light Commercial Air Conditioning and Heat Pump Subsector. EPA proposes to retain current requirements regarding the treatment of certain condensing units used in air conditioning and heat pump systems in the residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump subsector.

Cold Storage Warehouses. EPA proposes to adjust the GWP threshold for cold storage warehouses from 150 or 300, as applicable, to 700 starting January 1, 2026, with a later adjustment to the GWP threshold of either 150 or 300, depending on charge size or whether it is part of the high temperature side of a cascade system, starting January 1, 2032.

Industrial Process Refrigeration in Certain Laboratory Equipment. EPA proposes extending the compliance date to January 1, 2028, for refrigerated centrifuges and refrigerated laboratory shakers within the IPR sector.

Compliance Date Extension for Residential and Light Commercial Air Conditioning and Heat Pump Systems. To address concerns about supply chain issues related to R-454B, EPA proposes to remove the installation deadline for residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump systems, provided that specified components of such systems were manufactured or imported prior to January 1, 2025.

Additional Topics on Which EPA Seeks Comment:

Data about which refrigerants are being considered or adopted in new refrigeration equipment for remote condensing units, supermarket systems, and cold storage warehouses;

Data about the commercial availability and timeline for adoption of new refrigeration equipment using lower-GWP substitutes in remote condensing units, supermarket systems, and cold storage warehouses, as it relates to the proposed 2032 compliance dates for these subsectors;

Data about costs and savings resulting from the extension of compliance timelines for manufacturers and servicing companies, which are investing in U.S. production of new raw materials, refrigerants, equipment, and other technologies, intended to support companies’ transition and compliance, across the subsectors in this rule;

The proposed removal of the installation compliance date for residential and light commercial air conditioning systems, as well as whether an extension of the installation compliance date by one or more years would be appropriate, noting that EPA does not have information about the extent of equipment that may remain in inventory as of January 1, 2026, and account for any significant reliance interests in the final action as well as any significant reliance interests that should be accounted for in any final action; and

It currently assembles the R1S, R1T and Rivian Commercial Van (RCV), with the R2 SUV prepping for mass production next year.

For a startup factory, it’s a very busy place, as shown in a new video from YouTuber JerryRigEverything.

Rivian is still very much a startup, but its first factory in Normal, Illinois, is anything but a boring place. In fact, it’s quite busy, as shown in a new video from famous smartphone durability tester and EV enthusiast JerryRigEverything.

He got a chance to visit the place where the R1S, R1T and commercial van are being assembled, and it’s pretty cool to watch an entire vehicle being brought to life under a single roof.

It all starts with several giant Komatsu sheet metal stamping presses that were originally installed in the factory three decades ago. And no, Rivian was not around back then, but Mitsubishi was, and it used the same factory and presses to build cars like the Eclipse and Mirage, before closing the facility in 2016 and selling it to Rivian in 2017.

Now, dozens of robots are being used throughout the plant for precision tasks and tough jobs, including gluing the two sides of the hood together, wielding entire side profiles through the air and welding all sorts of metal parts.

Laser welding is widely used for a bunch of different sections, from body parts to battery packs. Speaking of batteries, Rivian assembles the packs for the R1T, R1S and electric delivery van in-house in Normal. The electric motors are also made in the same factory, and it’s pretty mesmerizing to see how they‘re put together.

Rivian uses liquid nitrogen to cool the motor’s rotator shaft to a chilling temperature of -321 degrees Fahrenheit (-196 degrees Celsius), while the rotator body is expanded using heat. The components are then press-fitted together, and after their temperatures normalize, the two are bonded.

Final assembly is handled by humans, using all sorts of tools, so that employees don’t break their backs.

It’s a busy place, with three models being assembled under the same roof. As someone who has had the chance to visit several car factories around the world, I can say that Rivian’s plant in Normal, Illinois, is a hybrid between traditional assembly plants and the factories of the future. There are a lot of robots handling high-precision repeatable jobs, as well as tasks that require heavy lifting, but people are also involved in the final steps of assembly.

Either way, it’s always fascinating to see a car being built, even if it’s through a YouTube video. Plus, even the golf carts and robots are painted in Rivian Blue, which is quite cool.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/W8762j/s1/rivian-factory-in-normal-illinois.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 16:01:30.467226
,Detroit Environment,2025-10-07 17:12:29+00:00,Crain's Detroit Business,Peter Scher reflects on JPMorgan Chase's $200M bet on Detroit,"Crain's Detroit Business, www.facebook.com, Anna Fifelski",,,,,https://www.crainsdetroit.com/banking-finance/peter-scher-reflects-jpmorgan-chases-200m-bet-detroit,"Can you share a bit about the origin story of JPMorgan's investment in Detroit?
When I first got to Detroit in the fall of 2013, you didn't want to walk around at night.
And one of the main reasons, probably the most important reason, in making this investment was our confidence in the leadership of Mayor Duggan.
Our deposits in the city of Detroit have grown by close to $30 billion.
We see where we may need to sort of tweak the skills and the training, and Detroit at Work works with us.","Can you share a bit about the origin story of JPMorgan's investment in Detroit? Why Detroit?

After the financial crisis in 2009, we were really rethinking how we showed up in communities, because there was a lot of fair criticism that banks and others got bailed out of the crisis, and a lot of communities were left high and dry, and we began rethinking how we should approach our work in communities that we could support them within. And so we were in that process for a year or two, and then where it came together for me was in the summer of 2013.

Jamie Dimon, my boss, the CEO, I was summoned to his office, and he said, ""Are you following what's going on in Detroit?"" And frankly, I said, ""Not really."" And he said, ""They just entered the largest municipal bankruptcy in the history of the country, and I want you to go out there and see if there's anything we can do to help."" And that was literally how it got teed up.

He said, ""I'm not thinking about charity. Are there investments that we can make?""

And so we brought teams in to really identify areas that the community was focused on, that we thought we could help accelerate and catalyze and scale some of the solutions. Things like affordable housing, big focus on workforce skills and the gap. We focused, not as much initially, but eventually, on small business, neighborhood development, all the issues of blight, how you dealt with vacant and abandoned property.

So we identified a number of areas and when the mayor came into office, we then started engaging with him and said, ""Here are some of our ideas."" And Mayor Duggan had some of his own ideas and we continued to work together, and in May of 2014 we announced an initial $100 million dollar investment in the city.

Was that your first time in Detroit? What connections did you have to the city before this effort and what's your view of the city now?

I had certainly been to Detroit before, but had not spent a huge amount of time there, probably the last time I had really spent any time in Detroit before that was the late '80s.

When I first got to Detroit in the fall of 2013, you didn't want to walk around at night. Now, the streets are filled. It's hard to get restaurant reservations, there’s a great food scene, great night life. It's a vibrant, growing city. One of the things I love is the fact that a lot of young people are moving into the city and are sort of adding to it. So it's just a night and day difference.

When did you meet Mike Duggan for the first time? How did your relationship, which seems to be almost a partnership, grow?

The first time I met the mayor, it was early 2014, so he was probably only mayor for a few weeks at that point, and Jamie Dimon had called him and said that we had been looking at the city, and we were potentially interested in making some investments.

We sat down, and he — one of the things he did, I'll never forget — he pulled out maps of the city neighborhoods. One of the things I remember he said at that first meeting was that Detroit can't come back unless the neighborhoods come back. So this couldn't just be like, ""Let's bring back downtown."" And so we spent a lot of time looking at maps, talking about places like Corktown, where we now have a branch, and the potential there. It was really looking at, how do we, neighborhood by neighborhood, get the blight cleaned up and turn over vacant properties?

What surprised me, because I spent a lot of time talking to mayors, working with mayors, was the level of detail of what needed to be done, and a level of focus on how we could help. It's just been an extraordinary partnership for almost 12 years.

The last thing JPMorgan wanted to do is show up in a place like Detroit, or any place else, and say, ""Hey, we're the guys from Wall Street. We're here to fix all your problems."" We can only help accelerate and scale and bring some of our knowledge and expertise from other places, but it's got to be led by the city. And one of the main reasons, probably the most important reason, in making this investment was our confidence in the leadership of Mayor Duggan.

How did its Detroit push pay off for the company?

Our deposits in the city of Detroit have grown by close to $30 billion. Our book of loans has grown; our mortgage lending, and small business lending have all grown.

We really approached this and thought about it like we thought about a business investment, and I think the most important lesson, for us, was that if you want to create sustainable growth — and there's always a role for philanthropy, but if a city is completely reliant on philanthropy to grow, it's not going to work. It's not sustainable. The reality is, if you look at it, there were billions and billions and billions of dollars from the federal government, from the state government, that went into Detroit over 20 years before it filed bankruptcy. But there were no sustainable business investments.

When you first go in, you want to make some part of what we call lower-cost capital, but now it's a vibrant market, and you've got others, other banks, other institutions, investing in the city. And that's what you want. You want to create this environment in which other investors see an opportunity, a long-term opportunity, and our decision and our announcement back in 2014 was a way of saying to the others, ""We believe in the long-term prospects of the city. We believe in the leadership of Mike Duggan. We see how he is bringing together, you know, the business community and the community organizations, civic organizations, they're not fighting with each other, you know, they're really focused on making it a better city."" It's something, frankly, we were really excited about and now very proud to be a partner.

What did JPMorgan learn from the experience of its ""virtual"" call center in Corktown that trained up Detroiters to do decent-paying telephone customer service work?

We're continuing to expand. We continue to grow in Detroit. We've continued to grow in Baltimore. We now have an Atlanta Virtual Call Center, and we also have a true virtual call center that we're actually employing military spouses, who often have to move around so they can have employment no matter where they go. We're actually getting the same or better quality calls at lower costs. From a business perspective, you couldn't ask for a better model, so we will continue to expand it, and it all started in Detroit.

We actually hired more than we anticipated, because there were so many well-qualified applicants, and Detroit at Work has been a really important partner to us throughout the time of this. We see where we may need to sort of tweak the skills and the training, and Detroit at Work works with us. And so we're seeing that it builds on the efficiency of the call center. So one of the most important lessons for us in creating these was to have the right partner, like we had in the mayor and in Detroit at work.

Throughout your career, you’ve been deeply involved in policy and politics. What's your view of the current global and U.S. situation and where we are going?

Politics right now has become this kind of blood sport, and if you pick a team, everything about your team is right and everything about the other team is wrong. I think this is what you saw in Detroit for a long time before Mayor Duggan was elected, and I think people are tired of the kind of partisan warfare that they're seeing. I saw a poll the other day about the shutdown, and people blamed both parties. I mean, people generally are saying, ""Whatever your issues are, it's not worth shutting down the government."" And you saw the same thing in Lansing.

To me, what Detroit represents is a sense that people want something different here. Here's a mayor who came in and said, ""We're not, I'm not going to do us versus them. That drove us into bankruptcy. I'm going to work with anyone who wants to be part of it. I'm going to work with Democrats. I'm going to work with Republicans. I’m going to work with the city council.""

And the fact that here's a white guy that gets elected in a predominantly Black city and gets reelected and is leaving office with an 84% approval rating, one of the things that says is, while people are stuck in this partisan grudge match, at some level, they don’t want it.

They want something different, and to see what the city has been able to accomplish by getting beyond that kind of politics and focusing on what really matters and creating jobs and training people and bringing in investment, to me, is a great example that I wish more people in Washington and other places around the country would look at and say, ""This is the kind of leadership people want.""

What's next for you? Do you see any future connection with Detroit?

Right now, I've been focused on retirement. I plan to stay actively engaged on several boards, and I care deeply about public policy, and I'm going to spend some time figuring out what's next for me.

I'll retire in the spring. I'll remain an advisor to Jamie throughout the year. I'm on several boards, and my family and I want to take some trips, and we'll see. There's still some gas in this tank, and we'll see where it leads me.

Offshore sand mining occurs in the Delaware Bay and Atlantic Ocean and can have long term effects on benthic habitats.
Offshore sand resources that have been historically harvested include sandy shoals and rocky substrate habitats in the nearshore Atlantic important for supporting fisheries and marine birds.","The Delaware Estuary is one of the nation’s largest petrochemical centers, and the potential for spills is an ever-present threat to estuarine and wetland systems and the SGCN that rely on them. The port complex of the Delaware River and Bay is the second largest oil port in the United States, handling about 85% of the East Coast’s oil imports. The Athos I spill in 2004 near Philadelphia released some 265,000 gallons of heavy crude into the Delaware River. The cumulative effects of small spills are also of concern for SGCN.

Some of the largest direct threats from energy production in Delaware are associated with cooling water intakes and discharges (e.g., from power plants), pollution events, and other causes that are covered elsewhere in this chapter.

Renewable energy is not without risks to SGCN. There are many potential impacts of new energy development on wildlife within the Mid-Atlantic states, ranging from effects of hydraulic fracturing and offshore drilling on aquatic systems, the loss of habitat to biofuel production, the direct mortality of birds and bats from wind turbines along mountain and coastal flyways, and noise causing avoidance of marine life. Additionally, solar panels can be highly attractive traps for insects seeking to oviposit on the water’s surface, and design modifications are required to minimize this impact to groups like mayflies, and caddisflies (Horváth et al. 2010).

A Risk Assessment of Marine Birds in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean was completed through the North Atlantic Landscape Conservation Cooperative (NALCC) and partners which developed a series of maps depicting the distribution, abundance and relative risk to marine birds from offshore activities (e.g., offshore drilling and wind energy development; NALCC 2015). This can help document and predict areas of frequent use and aggregations of birds and the relative risk to marine birds along the coast. Delaware is currently evaluating the potential effects of wind energy leases in Delaware, including the effects on fish, wildlife and key habitats.

An estimated 140,000 and 328,000 birds are killed annually by collisions with monopole turbines in the contiguous U.S., with an increase in mortality with increasing turbine hub height (Loss et al. 2013). Large populations of migrating shorebirds, waterfowl, raptors and songbirds make Delaware Bay and its shoreline a high-risk location for wind turbine siting (Jenkins and Clark n.d.).

Energy transmission infrastructure in Delaware results in direct mortality of some SGCN, estimating that between 12 and 64 million birds are killed each year at U.S. power lines, with between 8 and 57 million birds killed by collision and between 0.9 and 11.6 million birds killed by electrocution (Loss et al. 2014). Utility companies are actively taking steps to minimize these effects by installing preventive devices on transmission lines and infrastructure in areas heavily used by wildlife, especially birds.

Mining

Sand and gravel quarries are prevalent in Delaware and typically result in irreversible destruction of habitat if they are located in areas not previously developed. While some SGCN, such as Bank Swallow (Riparia riparia), use active sand and gravel pits for nesting, these modified habitats have limited value for most SGCN. Sand and gravel mines covered over 6,000 acres in Delaware as of 2009 (Mackenzie 2009). Offshore sand mining occurs in the Delaware Bay and Atlantic Ocean and can have long term effects on benthic habitats. Offshore sand resources that have been historically harvested include sandy shoals and rocky substrate habitats in the nearshore Atlantic important for supporting fisheries and marine birds. Potential direct impacts to SGCN, including sturgeon, sea turtles, and sharks, are also of concern.",https://dnrec.delaware.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/1280px-Barrow_Offshore_wind_turbines_edit1.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 19:01:25.045001

What does the Marine Mammal Protection Act do?
But, because of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, they are legally protected from being killed by industries.
What does a weaker Marine Mammal Protection Act mean for whales?
Since the Marine Mammal Protection Act passed in 1972, species like sea otters, whales, seals and more have recovered from population loss.","Out among the crashing ocean surf, half a dozen dolphins leap out of the water together in perfect sync. A humpback whale dives into the depths, flipping its iconic tail. Sea otters bob and float on a bed of kelp, holding paws.

Seeing these ocean animals swimming in the wild waves would fill your heart with wonder.

But a new bill in Congress would weaken the Mammal Protection Act, gutting protections for all sea creatures, including dolphins, sea otters, manatees, seals, sea lions and endangered whales.

For some of these species, especially many whale species on the brink of extinction, threats to the Marine Mammal Protection Act could be a threat to their very existence.

What does the Marine Mammal Protection Act do?

Since 1972, the Marine Mammal Protection Act’s goal has been to restore and maintain healthy populations of species in America’s oceans by banning the harassment, hunting, capturing and killing of marine mammals.

And, it’s been incredibly successful. This law has helped to stop the decline of humpback whales, gray seals and California sea lions, to name a few.

These creatures still face threats like vessel collisions, which are reducing the populations of whale species. But, because of the Marine Mammal Protection Act, they are legally protected from being killed by industries.

What does a weaker Marine Mammal Protection Act mean for whales?

The proposed change would allow industries to kill and harm more marine mammals, and make it more difficult for government agencies to react to early indications of a species in decline.

Take the North Atlantic Right whale for example. With an estimated 370 Right whales alive today, they’re teetering too close to extinction as it is. Allowing more Right whales to be killed could wipe them out forever.

Since the Marine Mammal Protection Act passed in 1972, species like sea otters, whales, seals and more have recovered from population loss. But if we weaken protections, all the progress we’ve made for these species could be reversed.

What can we do to save whales?

We’re working to raise awareness about the challenges whales are facing. And, we’re urging Congress not to reverse the progress sea creatures, particularly whales, have made.

Crux announced today it will purchase the Boston firm Daedaline. Founded in 2023, Crux is building software to make the systems related to investment in clean energy projects more efficient.

The company’s platform will repurpose Daedaline’s software to streamline due diligence in financing, per Crux’s DC-based CEO and cofounder Alfred Johnson. That refers to the process of verifying information and assessing potential risks before a significant transaction. Johnson believes that undertaking is the most arduous part of getting energy infrastructure investment.

“People just want to do these deals as well and as quickly as possible,” Johnson told Technical.ly in an exclusive interview, “and they want to use whatever tools are best available to them to do it.”

Johnson, whose company’s prior funders include Lowercarbon Capital and Andreessen Horowitz, declined to disclose the financial details of the deal and Crux’s valuation.

The Daedaline brand will be subsumed into Crux with no layoffs, he said. Instead, the New York-headquartered startup’s staff is set to grow from its current near-60 headcount to between 80 and 90 employees by the end of 2025.

Crux provides tools for negotiating terms sheets and due diligence in its “data room,” a term for its secure portal for sensitive business documents. Crux relaunched the feature in March for its 1,000 developers and investors using the platform, and jumped from 20% to 80% adoption, per Johnson.

This acquisition does not mean an expansion of products or services, but Johnson hopes Daedaline’s software will make associated procedures faster. Crux was considering developing software similar to the Boston startup’s, and Johnson was drawn to Daedaline’s expertise and staff.

Expected success despite political headwinds

Crux’s first product — a marketplace for financial institutions, clean energy developers and tax credit buyers to sell and transfer tax credits‚— was spurred by the Inflation Reduction Act.

Despite President Donald Trump’s efforts to cancel clean energy projects across the country, including targeting states that voted for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in 2024, Johnson is confident Crux will continue to be successful. The administration has taken specific aim at wind and solar, but is looking to nuclear to address skyrocketing power needs.

The startup also offers more than tax credit-focused tools. Other features focus on debt capital offerings, which can also fund these energy projects.

“The real driver of that market is the fact that electricity prices have gone up, and energy demand is higher than it’s ever been,” said Johnson, who previously worked in the Department of the Treasury during the Biden presidency. “So, a ton of manufacturing infrastructure is still required.”

Economic benefits for streamlined diligence

A typical tax credit transaction can take three-to-12 weeks of diligence, hundreds of hours and thousands in cash, Johnson explained. That’s why this acquisition is important.

“The more we can help [clients] with that process, extract information, deliver insights, support it with context,” Johnson said, “the better decisions they can make the more rapidly.”

The AI software will extract context and key information for users, he said. For example, in deal documents, the technology can provide guidance like recommendations to swap out clauses.

This by no means replaces lawyers, he explained.

“People are still going to do their diligence,” per Johnson. “This is to support that being as efficient and intelligent as possible.”",https://technical.ly/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Alfred-Johnson-speaking-at-Nasdaq-Sept-22-2025.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 17:04:57.882736

Dear Secretary Wright,

We write to condemn the Department of Energy’s (DOE) termination of 321 financial awards, supporting 223 projects supporting energy resilience across the country. We are deeply concerned about your Department’s attempt to rebrand the elimination of U.S. clean energy as “$7.56 billion in savings” to taxpayers and the potential political motivations behind the targeting of projects in Democratic-leaning states

This decision is a reversal of properly awarded projects that will harm American jobs, drive private capital out of our country, weaken our power grid, and give China a strategic edge. This Administration’s decision to play political games will result in genuine harm at a time when millions of American families are already struggling to pay their electricity bills amidst the everrising cost of living. These blatantly partisan cancellations must immediately be reversed.

The projects that the Department of Energy (DOE) has unilaterally decided to cancel were driving down costs for all our constituents—regardless of their political affiliation. Household electric bills have already increased 10% nationally since January 2025 and are poised to spike even further. This Administration’s reckless energy policy and award terminations, designed to stifle the development of cheap clean energy and prop up more expensive dirty energy, will only further increase the cost burden for families to keep the lights on.

Your press statement claims these projects “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment.” That is a pretext for cancellations that track political talking points, not facts. Many of these awards had already passed rigorous review, and many of those had already been processed. Companies hired workers, signed contracts, broke ground, and put up private capital in reliance on DOE commitments. Calling that “savings” ignores stranded equipment orders, canceled subcontracts, and layoffs—real costs that ripple through American supply chains. Instead of executing Congress’s direction to build U.S. energy leadership and grid reliability, DOE is moving the goalposts while terminating the very projects that would deliver results.

The consequences of these actions are significant: cancellations will shutter facilities, kill jobs, and stall critical domestic manufacturing. They also inject avoidable uncertainty into energy markets—forcing investors to consider political risks that you have created, which raises financing costs. Terminating grid and manufacturing projects locks in congestion and supplychain bottlenecks, which will lead to higher long-term electricity prices for households and businesses.

We are at a moment of unprecedented growth in electricity demand, which is expected to increase by 25% by 2030. At a time when more energy supply is needed than ever, these cuts will only exacerbate upward pressure on electricity prices by stranding low-cost supply, delaying grid expansion, and increasing reliance on higher-cost imports. In your confirmation hearing, you pledged to pursue “all sources of affordable, reliable energy” to meet these challenges. By terminating awards for cheap energy solutions and those that strengthen the grid, you are going against your word and worsening the very problem you promised to help solve.

Eliminating the Grid Deployment Office and Office of Clean Energy Deployment projects delays transmission and weakens grid resilience, a shortsighted decision that threatens even steeper increasing costs to American consumers and businesses in the future. Additionally, these socalled “savings” waste sunk federal and state dollars and betray disadvantaged communities by erasing critical work to reduce pollution and improve energy affordability.

Fifteen years ago, China generated less electricity than the United States. Today, China generates more than twice as much as we do —and the gap continues to grow. As China and other nations continue to innovate and build the energy technologies of the future, this is precisely the wrong time for the U.S. to back out and cede our technological leadership. The rest of the world will continue to innovate with or without us, and these grant terminations will only set our innovation back at a pivotal time.

It is difficult for us to believe that these project terminations were anything but a partisan targeting of states that are not politically aligned with this Administration. These terminations undermine the spirit of competitive, merit-based awards and throw into question the fairness of the award process under this Administration.

As such, we demand that DOE take the following immediate actions by Tuesday, October 14, 2025:

Suspend all terminations and de-obligations and reinstate the projects.

Provide a complete list of affected awards (office, recipient, state, award number, selection date, federal obligation, non-federal cost share, milestone status) along with the project-specific written justification for termination.

Identify the specific statutory and regulatory authorities relied upon for these mass postaward terminations.

Preserve and provide all Department of Energy records, memoranda, and communications related to the review and termination of these awards, including those resulting from the May 2025 Secretarial memorandum “Ensuring Responsibility for Financial Assistance.”

Describe DOE’s process for recipient appeals and dispute resolution, including timelines, decision-makers, and whether interim funding will be permitted to avoid waste while appeals are pending.

Dismantling America’s advanced-energy buildout under the banner of “savings” does not protect taxpayers—it subsidizes our competitors. It means higher bills and fewer American jobs. We will utilize every oversight and legislative tool available to ensure the DOE follows the law, honors congressional intent, and keeps the United States at the forefront of the global energy race.

Sincerely,

District 7 released a statement criticizing the Donald Trump administration’s plan to terminate millions in clean energy infrastructure grants, including one for the Indianapolis International Airport.

According to a news release from Carson’s office, Carson said he was notified that the Federal Aviation Administration is planning to terminate a grant for the Indianapolis airport that would help fund a solar power battery storage facility at the site. The FAA said that the grant did “not align with the (Trump) administration’s priorities.”

The Indianapolis International Airport received federal funds in July 2023 that officials said they would use to construct energy-efficient infrastructure and the installation of solar panels. At the time, airport officials said that the grant was for $22.58 million for the project and “a huge win for the Indy airport, our environment and our community.”

In Carson’s release, he said the Trump administration’s plan is to terminate almost $37 million in clean energy infrastructure plants, including a $6.7 million grant for the airport.

In the statement, Carson said that Trump is “taking money away from Indianapolis to score cheap political points in Washington.” Carson said this is a “blow to the hardworking aviation professionals” at the Indianapolis airport.

“Republicans and Democrats have long supported this project because it is economically viable and environmentally intelligent,” Carson said. “It provides renewable energy to the electric grid, lowers emissions, improves air quality, and lowers the airport’s operating costs… Infrastructure should not be partisan. There are no Democratic or Republican bridges, roads, or airports. Clean solar energy serves everyone, especially through the Indianapolis Airport solar farm.”

According to previous reports, the funding was expected to help fund the first 25% of a multi-phased project to transition the airport terminal’s electricity consumption to renewable energy generated onsite.

In a statement from the Indianapolis International Airport, officials said:

We can confirm that we no longer have the commitment by the federal government of this clean energy grant.

The new base Model Y is what Tesla started teasing in social media posts over the weekend, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information. The cheaper vehicle will lack certain features and use less premium materials to offset the loss of the up to $7,500 federal tax credit that the US stopped offering as of this month, the people said.

Tesla representatives didn’t respond to requests for comment. The company’s posts on X helped send its shares up 5.4% on Monday. The stock has risen 12% this year.

Tesla executives said during the company’s most recent earnings call that while production of a more affordable model started in June, they decided to put off ramping up output until after the US phased out tax credits. Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja and Lars Moravy, Tesla’s vice president of vehicle engineering, were cryptic about what the car will be before Elon Musk let loose.

“It’s the Model Y,” Musk said, joking that he would “let the cat out of the bag.”

“The desire to buy the car is very high, it’s just people don’t have enough money in their bank account to buy it,” Musk continued. “So, the more affordable we can make the car, the better.”

Tesla managed to engineer cost out of the Model Y in part by focusing on the battery pack and motor, the people said.

The company announced last week that it delivered 497,099 vehicles worldwide from July through September, a record quarterly total. While the tax credit expiration boosted sales, the pull-forward effect could undermine EV demand in the months to come. Musk himself warned in July that Tesla could be in for “a few rough quarters” after US incentives end.

Vice Chair

Cushman & Wakefield

Indianapolis

With over 22 years of experience in the commercial real estate industry, Michael Weishaar, SIOR, Vice Chair at Cushman & Wakefield’s Indianapolis office, has established himself as a preeminent leader in the industrial sector. His career is marked by significant milestones, unwavering dedication, and a deep commitment to his community—qualities that define a Hall of Fame honoree.

In the past eight years alone, Weishaar and his team have completed nearly 900 leasing and investment sale transactions, totaling over $7 billion in value. Their work spans more than 111.5 million square feet of industrial property, serving some of the most respected names in real estate, third-party logistics, and corporate America, including Prologis, Hines, DRA, Becknell Industrial, Red Rock Developments, and LXP.

Weishaar’s success stems from his passion for the dynamic nature of the industry.

“What I find most enjoyable is the fast-paced environment and the opportunity to work with a wide range of clients, big and small,” he said.

For him, the appeal lies in the variety and constant challenge the commercial real estate world offers.

“Every day is different,” Weishaar said, emphasizing the entrepreneurial opportunities that come with the business.

A key turning point in Weishaar’s career was mastering the art of focus.

“Early on, you want to say yes to everything,” he said. “But over time, you learn to delegate and recognize when an opportunity doesn’t align with your expertise.”

This ability to prioritize and streamline efforts has been instrumental in Weishaar’s sustained success.

Balancing professional demands with personal life is another challenge he has navigated throughout his career.

“Real estate is a business without a clock,” Weishaar said.

The shift to remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic further blurred the lines between work and home life. While he acknowledges that achieving the perfect work-life balance is an elusive goal, setting boundaries has been crucial in managing both worlds.

Outside of work, Weishaar is deeply involved in giving back to his community. He has served in leadership roles within his church and the Carmel Dads’ Club, a youth sports program where he coached basketball and baseball. He also serves as an advisor to the Indiana chapter of NAIOP and supports the Lambda Chapter of Sigma Chi Fraternity at Indiana University. His philanthropic efforts have earned him the Civilian Patriotic Service Award from the U.S. Army Chief of Public Affairs for his contributions to the Department of Defense.

Weishaar’s personal life is rooted in family. He enjoys spending time with his wife, Tabatha, and their two children, Landon and Lainey. Together, they explore national parks, embark on ski trips, and relax at their lake house.

“We’re also huge Indiana University basketball and football fans,” he said. “Go Hoosiers!”

Reflecting on his journey, Weishaar credits mentorship as a cornerstone of his career.

“When I started, I told my mentor, Jeff Castell, and leaders like Pat Lindley and John Huguenard, that I’d bring a strong work ethic and a can-do attitude every day, but I’d need their help learning the real estate side of things,” he said.

Their guidance, along with the support of others, played a pivotal role in shaping Weishaar’s career and remains a source of inspiration.",https://rejournals.com/wp-content/uploads/cropped-Rejournals_logo_512-32x32.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 14:03:23.334846

On Friday the EPA said in a notice that it was withdrawing the delay because the policy wouldn’t create compliance problems for industry after all.
At another U.S. Steel plant in Gary, Ind., a six-month average of emissions of chromium were twice as high as the California standard, EIP said.
U.S. Steel criticized the EPA’s withdrawal of the compliance deadline and said it would consider its next steps.
Unfortunately, the 2024 coke rules do not meet these criteria, and we are evaluating next steps,” the company said in a statement.","Public health advocates pushed back when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it planned to delay for two years a requirement that steel companies monitor air quality at the perimeters of their 11 coke plants in Western Pennsylvania and across the country. Two groups sued.

Now, the EPA has reversed course.

The deadline to begin so-called fenceline monitoring for emissions of benzene, chromium and other toxic contaminants, set by the Biden administration, had been in July. On July 8, the Trump EPA extended the deadline until July 2027 in an interim final rule , saying there wasn’t enough time to seek, compile and respond to public comments, potentially forcing some companies into violation.

On Friday the EPA said in a notice that it was withdrawing the delay because the policy wouldn’t create compliance problems for industry after all.

“EPA does not believe that the currently available information supports a conclusion that regulated parties would face significant immediate compliance challenges,” the agency wrote after the nonprofits Environmental Integrity Project and Earthjustice sued over the matter.

The environmentalists’ lawsuit challenged the rule on the grounds that it deprived people in nearby communities of protection against toxic air pollution. Rather than defend the interim final rule in court, the environmental groups said in a statement, the EPA affirmed its prior finding that coke ovens are fully capable of complying with the rule, “thereby acknowledging that the delay of compliance dates was never needed.”

“We’re glad that EPA recognizes the harm coke oven plants cause to communities and that it is more than reasonable for these facilities to meet emissions standards now,” Adrienne Lee, a senior Earthjustice attorney, said in a statement. “The health and wellbeing of impacted communities should not come at the cost of giving corporate polluters a pass.”

An August report from the Environmental Integrity Project examined preliminary testing the Biden administration required steel and coke plants to conduct. EIP found that emissions of benzene, a carcinogen, from U.S. Steel’s Clairton Coke Works near Pittsburgh were up to eight times higher than a California standard, which the group used as a national benchmark because many states don’t have ambient air-quality standards. At another U.S. Steel plant in Gary, Ind., a six-month average of emissions of chromium were twice as high as the California standard, EIP said.

Two people died and 10 were injured in an explosion at the Clairton plant in August. The facility has been fined more than $10 million by the EPA for environmental violations in the last three years, more than any other plant on a list of 20 surveyed by EIP.

U.S. Steel criticized the EPA’s withdrawal of the compliance deadline and said it would consider its next steps.

“U. S. Steel is committed to working with the EPA and supports regulations that are well-grounded in law, and are based on sound science, available and proven technology, and that consider costs and other non-air quality impacts. Unfortunately, the 2024 coke rules do not meet these criteria, and we are evaluating next steps,” the company said in a statement.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1195315686-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 14:03:00.769129

Nuclear energy is gaining recognition as a vital solution to meet the world’s increasing electricity needs while supporting the transition to cleaner energy sources. Unlike solar and wind, which depend on weather conditions, nuclear power offers a stable and reliable supply of carbon-free energy throughout the year. The restart of a previously shuttered U.S. nuclear plant underscores the technology’s renewed momentum and the rising investor interest in nuclear energy stocks.

The Nuclear industry is benefiting from the new regulatory reforms, ongoing research and development work, leading to the development of microreactors and small modular reactors. The 24x7 immense clean power requirements from the AI-based new data centers and the reshoring of some industries are creating fresh demand. The government is also working to increase the domestic supply of uranium, a fuel essential to power the nuclear plants.

With this increasing importance, nuclear energy-related stocks, such as BWX Technologies (BWXT), Dominion Energy (D) and Duke Energy (DUK), are becoming attractive investment options. Unlike other clean energy sources affected by intermittency, nuclear power plants provide a consistent and stable energy output, operating around the clock except during planned maintenance intervals.

Demand for clean energy is rising, and as per the International Energy Agency (“IEA”), energy supply from nuclear power is expected to nearly double between 2020 and 2050, helping utilities meet the rising demand for clean energy. The IEA also highlights that while large nuclear reactors will dominate overall power generation, small modular reactors (SMRs) are projected to experience significant expansion.

Compared with other clean energy sources, nuclear power plants use far less land to produce an equivalent amount of clean electricity. Moreover, while all conventional energy sources generate waste, nuclear energy is unique in its systematic and secure management and storage of that waste. Increasing adoption of electric vehicles, rising demand from the power grids and development of large artificial intelligence-powered data centers.

As the production of clean energy is expected to rise from nuclear plants, a continuous supply of high-quality uranium is essential to keep the nuclear units running. Companies like Uranium Energy (UEC) and BHP Group Limited (BHP) produce large volumes of uranium and can benefit from the surging demand from nuclear power plants.

Nuclear Energy stocks have a huge potential in the energy space and can offer significant growth opportunities for investors. Our Nuclear Energy Screen makes it easier for investors to locate high-potential stocks at any given time. Apart from the stocks mentioned above, investors can also explore stocks like The Southern Company (SO) and NextEra Energy (NEE) for further growth in the nuclear energy space.

After the Trump administration canceled $7 billion in solar energy grants, nonprofits, solar companies, unions, and homeowners have banded together to sue the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The Solar for All program was designed to help middle- and low-income families install solar panels on their homes. The Biden administration estimated that the successful completion of the program would give 900,000 households access to solar energy. The groups suing the E.P.A. claim that the agency illegally canceled the grants without approval from Congress. The lawsuit, filed Monday in Rhode Island’s federal court, follows a similar lawsuit filed last month, which an appeals court ruled against. Legal experts, however, are doubtful that this current lawsuit will have a similar outcome.

Renewable sources generate more energy than coal worldwide

Global think tank Ember released a report Tuesday stating that renewable energy has surpassed coal in energy generation for the first time. This is largely due to the rapid growth of the renewable sector in China and India. According to the report, China increased its solar energy output by 43% and wind power generation by 26%, resulting in a 2% decrease in fossil fuel use. Similarly, India increased its solar energy output by 31% and wind power generation by 29%, resulting in a 3.1% reduction in fossil fuel use. In the first half of 2025, coal supplied 4,896 terawatt hours (TWh) of energy, while renewables exceeded that with 5,072 TWh. Despite this positive growth in renewables around the world, the EU and the U.S. increased coal generation by 1.1% and 17%, respectively.

NiSource Investment Narrative Recap

To be a NiSource shareholder, you need to believe in the company’s ability to capture accelerating electricity demand, particularly from large data center clients, while maintaining regulatory support to fund major capital investments. The approval of GenCo’s declination petition directly addresses a key short-term catalyst by unlocking a pathway to meet new load growth, though the risk of high capital expenditure still looms and could influence margins and future dividends. For now, the regulatory win may help support near-term outlook, but won’t eliminate longer-term headwinds around future gas demand or leverage.

Among recent announcements, the steady quarterly dividend declaration, US$0.28 per share in August, stands out because dividend sustainability is closely tied to cost management and regulatory clarity, both of which GenCo’s approval is designed to reinforce. How effectively GenCo delivers on its “financial stability” pillar will directly impact free cash flow and NiSource’s ability to balance growth investments with investor returns. In contrast, investors should be aware that substantial capital needs for GenCo and grid modernization may still constrain...

First, the EPA plans on finalizing the following actions: Listing of Specific PFAS as Hazardous Constituents Under RCRA.
Next, the EPA plans to clarify the following actions: PFAS National Primary Drinking Water Regulation Rulemaking.
Finally, the EPA is spearheading the following new actions: PFAS Requirements in National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit Applications.","As the Trump Administration rolls back Biden-era regulations, all eyes have been on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as it determines if and how it will enforce the Biden Administration's regulations on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The Trump Administration has offered insight into its direction through responses to ongoing litigation against the rules. (See previous Holland & Knight alert, ""The PFAS Drinking Water Rule Under the Second Trump Administration,"" April 16, 2025.)

Now, the EPA has released their most definitive guidance to date with the announcement that it will retain the Biden-era designation of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund).

The EPA's broader regulatory trajectory is detailed in the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) recently released Unified Regulatory Agenda, which outlines seven upcoming PFAS-related actions at varying stages in the rulemaking process and utilizes a broad range of legislative authorities. These actions span multiple environmental statutes, including the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) and Clean Water Act (CWA). The rulemakings provide further insight into the Trump Administration's trajectory on PFAS regulations.

CERCLA Designation

The EPA announced on Sept. 17, 2025, that it would retain the Biden-era designation of PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under CERCLA with the intention of ""holding polluters accountable"" for cleanup costs. The EPA has opted to defend the Biden EPA's final rule in ongoing litigation. In tandem with their announcement, the EPA submitted an unopposed motion to lift the ongoing abeyance, as the agency has completed its review of the rule and made a decision to keep it in place, which was allowed on Oct. 2, 2025, and set a deadline of Dec. 5, 2025, for final briefs.

Though the EPA plans to defend the CERCLA Rule to provide more regulatory certainty, the EPA intends to develop a CERCLA Section 102(a) Framework Rule governing future CERCLA hazardous substance designations. This rule will instill a uniform approach to designations and require the EPA to consider the costs of proposed designations. In addition to this regulatory fix, the EPA called on Congress to take further action to protect passive receivers from liability through statutory action guided by technical assistance from the EPA. At least one bill has been introduced that would provide liability protection for water utilities. The prospects for legislative relief for other large categories of passive receivers – such as farmers who apply biosolids – remain unclear.

Regulatory Unified Agenda

Earlier in September 2025, the OMB released its biannual Regulatory Unified Agenda. This agenda provides insight into the Trump Administration's upcoming regulatory activities, including a timeline for their release, and revealing a coordinated, multi-statute strategy to require reporting and/or limit PFAS discharges under CWA, RCRA, TSCA and SDWA.

The Regulatory Unified Agenda features seven upcoming PFAS actions, many of which finalize or clarify actions initiated during the Biden Administration, but the EPA also includes two new actions to further regulate PFAS.

First, the EPA plans on finalizing the following actions:

Listing of Specific PFAS as Hazardous Constituents Under RCRA. In April 2026, the EPA plans to finalize the proposed rule designating nine PFAS compounds, their salts and structural isomers to the list of hazardous constituents under RCRA. This will require corrective action for releases of these substances. (See Holland & Knight's previous alert, ""EPA Proposes RCRA Corrective Action Expansions Targeting PFAS,"" Feb. 14, 2024.) The EPA did not hint at any potential revisions of the rule, only stating it is considering public comments as it develops the final version of the rule. EPA also plans to finalize (potentially at the same time as this listing) its proposed rule clarifying that RCRA's statutory definition of ""hazardous waste"" applies to corrective actions at solid waste management units. As a practical matter, this clarification would apply RCRA's corrective action authorities not only to PFAS chemicals listed as hazardous constituents but to any PFAS chemical that meets the broader statutory definition of ""hazardous waste.""

Addition of Certain PFAS to the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI). In February 2026, the EPA plans to finalize a rule to add individual PFAS and PFAS categories to the TRI and finalize the criteria needed for PFAS to be automatically added to the TRI. In the meantime, the EPA announced on Oct. 7, 2025, the addition of the chemical perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS-Na) to the list of substances subject to TRI reporting, bringing the total number of PFAS subject to TRI reporting to 206.

Clarification to Supplier Notification Provision Due to Automatic Additions of PFAS to the TRI. In November 2025, the EPA plans to finalize edits to the TRI guidelines to align supplier notification provisions with the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act's (NDAA) requirement for the EPA to annually add new PFAS compounds to the TRI. These revisions would explicitly require covered suppliers to notify customers receiving products containing chemicals newly added to the TRI, namely PFAS compounds, of their presence as soon as these compounds are added to the list on Jan. 1 of each year. In practice, this means suppliers will be required to notify customers of the presence of these compounds as early as the first shipment of each calendar year.

Next, the EPA plans to clarify the following actions:

PFAS National Primary Drinking Water Regulation Rulemaking. In October 2025, the EPA plans to propose a rule to extend the deadline for public water systems to comply with the April 2024 National Primary Drinking Water Regulation (NPDWR) setting Maximum Contaminant Levels for PFAS. Additionally, this action will solidify the revisions announced in May 2025, which would narrow the regulation to only applying to PFOS and PFOA. This revision eliminates perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic Acid (PFNA), hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA) (commonly known as GenX), along with the Hazard Index mixture of these three PFAS plus perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), from the original reporting and mitigation requirements. This revision significantly reduces the number of PFAS compounds subject to monitoring and mitigation, potentially easing compliance burdens for public water systems.

PFAS Data Reporting and Recordkeeping under TSCA. In December 2025, the EPA plans to propose a rule to revise an October 2023 final rule requiring manufacturers and importers of PFAS to report data about their usage of such substances between 2011 and 2022 under TSCA. The upcoming action, which is currently undergoing interagency review, is likely to create exemptions for certain uses and modify the scope of reporting. Based on previous EPA actions to extend the data submission deadline for manufacturers granting further leniency for small manufacturers reporting as article importers, it is likely that the EPA will create exemptions for these importers. The EPA has also opened additional opportunities for public comment on the October 2023 action, stressing a need for critical feedback on data collection software and desired guidance. Manufacturers and importers should monitor this rulemaking closely, particularly if they qualify as small entities or import PFAS-containing articles, as exemptions may reduce reporting obligations.

Finally, the EPA is spearheading the following new actions:

PFAS Requirements in National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Permit Applications. In November 2025, the EPA plans to propose a rulemaking to update NPDES to require permit applications to include monitoring and reporting for PFAS discharges. Facilities in the plastics, chemical and synthetic fiber sectors should prepare for expanded monitoring and discharge limitations under these forthcoming rules.

PFAS Requirements in Effluent Limitation Guidelines. Following through on Effluent Guidelines Plan 15, in January 2026, the EPA plans to propose a rulemaking to revise the Organic Chemicals, Plastics and Synthetic Fibers Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards to address PFAS discharges from manufacturing facilities.

Next Steps

The fate of other recent PFAS-related EPA actions – including the proposed 2026 Multi-Sector General Permit (which included PFAS monitoring requirements for certain sectors), draft recommended ambient water quality criteria for PFOA, PFOS and PFBS, and draft risk assessment of PFOA and PFOS in biosolids – remain unclear.

Industries across the supply chain should anticipate heightened scrutiny as EPA advances rulemakings that will expand monitoring, reporting and corrective action requirements for PFAS, particularly in manufacturing, water treatment and waste management sectors. Regulatory uncertainty persists around several key federal initiatives, including PFAS-related permit requirements and biosolids risk assessments. Moreover, states continue to promulgate PFAS measures of their own, adding to this uncertainty.

Enova stated that it has revised its requirements to open funding for ammonia- and hydrogen-propulsion retrofit projects. The maritime industry is crucial to the global economy as 90% of the world’s goods are transported by sea.

The Viking nation has plans to completely revolutionize the maritime industry

The maritime sector plays an integral role in the global supply chain. Nearly every sector in the world relies on the vast shipping industry to transport goods to every corner of the planet.

Taking that into account, the large shipping vessels that transport our goods use massive amounts of fuel, and as such, produce vast amounts of harmful greenhouse gases. So it became evidently clear that something had to be done to shift the maritime industry towards the growing renewable energy sector.

Norwegian state-owned Enova has delivered a potential solution to the problem. It recently announced that, from next year, existing vessels scheduled for retrofits with ammonia or hydrogen-capable primary propulsion will be eligible for funding. Even those who do not operate the fuel continuously will be eligible for financial support.

“The changes give more people the opportunity to seek support, Even vessels with a shorter lifespan can help cut emissions and build experience,” – Norwegian state-owned company, Enova

Enova has awarded approximately $75.5 million to projects developing hydrogen and ammonia-powered vessels

The move underscores the importance of transitioning the maritime sector to renewable energy usage. The reports coming out of Norway state that four companies that intend to construct hydrogen-powered ships will receive a total of $50.5 million, while the remaining $25 million is reserved for the construction of two ammonia-powered ships.

As part of the revision of the scheme, the greenhouse gas emission reduction quota required for new technology projects has been lowered from 100% to 55%. Additionally, Enova also stated that it has extended the application deadline for funding to build ammonia bunkering infrastructure along the Norwegian coast. In order to qualify, projects must include ammonia storage and refuelling facilities.

“The purpose of the program is to ensure that the bunkering facilities are realised in time for the first vessels to enter the water, probably during 2027,” – Enova

As the cooperative nature of the hydrogen sector fosters new and amazing alliances that have the potential to completely change the landscape of the renewable energy sector in Europe, the move by Enova has been welcomed by industry insiders.

“The technology is still new. Now we will support the industry in building experience. If we are going to succeed in cutting emissions from ocean transportation, we need to go for solutions that can grow in scale towards 2050.” – Nils Kristian Nakstad, Managing Director of Enova

Norway could become a global leader in the renewable energy sector if the plans are successful",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Depositphotos_210036308_XL-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 15:04:07.551357

U.S. sales of electric vehicles topped 1.3 million units in 2024, a 7.3% year-over-year increase, Cox Automotive’s Kelley Blue Book said in a Jan. 13 press release.

Q4 sales set a best-ever quarterly sales mark with 365,824 units sold, a 15.2% YoY improvement, according to the release. Sales benefited from strong automaker incentives and leasing deals, as well as federal and state programs.

Cox Automotive’s report coincides with automakers’ Q4 sales numbers, with many reporting record-breaking domestic sales aided by surging demand for EVs.

While it’s been suggested that the incoming Trump administration may end EV tax credits, which could slow sales growth, Cox Automotive said it would take time for any changes to take effect and the possibility of lost incentives may boost sales in the short term.

With improving charging infrastructure and 15 additional EV models entering the market, sales growth is expected to continue in 2025 with EVs projected to represent nearly 10% of all U.S. vehicle sales this year, Cox Automotive said.

A slew of new EVs, including those from General Motors and Honda Motor Co., which together sold nearly 80,000 more EVs in 2024 than in 2023, provided a boost to last year’s sales, Cox Automotive said. Hyundai Motor Group and Ford Motor Co. also reported increased EV sales last year.

By volume, Tesla sales were estimated to be lower YoY by more than 37,000 units, which was roughly the volume GM added, Cox Automotive reported. Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz also posted lower volumes in 2024 compared to 2023.

Cox Automotive said the U.S. EV market is comparably competitive to China and Europe. Of the 68 mainstream EV models tracked by Kelley Blue Book, 24 models saw YoY sales increases; 17 models were new to the market; and 27 decreased in volume, which included discontinued models such as the Chevrolet Bolt and Mazda MX-30.

The Tesla Model Y and Model 3 reigned as the two best-selling EVs in the U.S., though both aging models saw notable sales declines, Cox Automotive said. However, the Model Y and Model 3 still accounted for more than 40% of all EVs sold last year.

Eight plaintiffs filed suit Monday against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for its termination of the Solar for All program, alleging that the termination was unconstitutional and caused them harm.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the rescission in August, saying in a post on X, “The bottom line is this: EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive.”

“If Defendants’ unlawful termination of the Solar for All program is allowed to stand, nearly one million low-income households will lose access to affordable, resilient solar in communities in all states and territories, and hundreds of thousands of good-paying, high-quality jobs will be lost,” the plaintiffs argued.

Dive Insight:

The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The plaintiffs are solar installation companies Sunpath Solar and EIS Solar, nonprofits Solar United Neighbors and Black Sun Light Sustainability, environmental consultancy 2KB Energy Services, trade union Rhode Island AFL-CIO, the nonprofit Rhode Island Center for Justice, and Anh Nguyen, a member of Georgia BRIGHT’s Solar for All advisory board.

“Plaintiffs are not direct grantees under the Solar for All program, but rather they are its intended beneficiaries,” the lawsuit said. “They are a labor organization, an individual homeowner seeking access to solar energy to reduce costs, nonprofit organizations dedicated to assisting low-income families with affordable energy, and solar consultants and installers.”

The eight plaintiffs “should have benefited directly from the Solar for All program’s provision of new sources of energy throughout the nation and its electricity cost savings,” according to the lawsuit.

In an August statement posted on YouTube, Zeldin referred to Solar for All as a slush fund and said there was “massive dilution” of the program’s funding disbursements, “as many grants go through pass through after pass through after pass through after pass through, with all of the middlemen taking their own cut.”

An April 2024 announcement from the Biden administration said the program was intended to “deliver residential solar projects to over 900,000 households nationwide” by “[providing] funds to states, territories, Tribal governments, municipalities, and nonprofits across the country to develop long-lasting solar programs that enable low-income and disadvantaged communities to deploy and benefit from distributed residential solar.”

The plaintiffs argue that the executive branch didn’t have the statutory authority to rescind the $7 billion in funding, even after Congress “repealed large parts of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund” in July, as it “did not repeal the Solar for All program retroactively.”

“Congress rescinded only ‘unobligated balances,’ which preserved all $7 billion of the obligated funding EPA already had awarded through its Solar for All grants,” the lawsuit said. “Instead of distributing the Solar for All funds as Congress directed, Defendants hastily and unlawfully terminated the Solar for All program,” an action the plaintiffs allege was illegal.

A coalition of environmental groups, meanwhile, filed a separate, more expansive challenge to MISO’s cost allocation plan.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

Coalitions of large energy users and environmental groups on Monday urged federal regulators to reject the Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s proposal for paying for a coal-fired power plant that the U.S. Department of Energy ordered to run past its retirement date.

The issue centers on the 1,560-MW, coal-fired J.H. Campbell plant in West Olive, Michigan.

In late May, DOE said MISO faces an “energy emergency” and ordered the owners of the power plant to run it past a planned May 31 shutdown. DOE issued a second 90-day emergency order for the power plant that keeps it online until Nov. 19, with additional extensions possible.

Under the Federal Power Act, DOE can order power plants to operate for 90 days during emergencies. Michigan’s attorney general and a coalition of groups, led by the Sierra Club and Earthjustice, have challenged the DOE order in court, saying there isn’t an emergency in the Midcontinent grid operator’s footprint.

In August, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved MISO’s preliminary outline for the Campbell power plant’s owners — Consumers Energy, Wolverine Power Supply Cooperative and the Michigan Public Power Agency — to recover their costs to comply with DOE’s orders.

Now, FERC is weighing the plan itself. The power plant’s owners haven’t asked to recover costs yet.

However, MISO’s cost recovery plan fails to meet the ratemaking principle that parties pay for the costs that they cause, according to filings at FERC.

FERC directed MISO to allocate the power plant’s costs across its central and northern zones on a demand basis, but the grid operator proposed recouping them on an energy basis, according to a coalition that is comprised of the Coalition of MISO Transmission Customers, the Association of Businesses Advocating Tariff Equity, the Midwest Large Energy Consumers and the Illinois Industrial Energy Consumers.

“Given that the Campbell units are being retained for capacity and resource adequacy purposes under the DOE Order, using an energy based load ratio share instead of a demand based load share deviates from cost causation principles and therefore, is unjust and unreasonable,” the groups said.

They pointed out that FERC has already approved a demand-based cost allocation method for a different plant — Constellation Energy’s Eddystone units in Pennsylvania, which also faces DOE emergency orders.

A coalition of environmental groups, meanwhile, filed a separate, more expansive challenge to MISO’s cost allocation plan.

The plan recovers costs from utilities across MISO’s northern and central zones — as FERC said it could do — instead of just from Michigan, the Environmental Law & Policy Center, Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council and Sustainable FERC Project said.

The DOE order and FERC’s approval of MISO’s cost recovery methodology failed to identify any evidence that utilities or ratepayers in MISO zones 1 through 7 will benefit from Campbell’s continued operation, according to the groups.

“Instead, the commission order relied wholly on the DOE’s unlawful emergency declaration both to determine the scope of cost allocation and as the sole basis for the conclusion that an emergency exists in Zones 1-7,” they said.

Also, MISO’s compliance filing goes beyond FERC’s order by establishing a permanent cost allocation provision that will apply to any future DOE orders affecting the Campbell facility, the groups said.

“While the commission order contemplates extensions of [the] DOE order, it did not give blanket approval to an allocation method where the scope of the … emergency and resulting beneficiaries no longer align with that allocation,” the groups said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/aKadooqNDIUJRstwLymSNpanSKKMx30aXe93HMTQhB0/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9DTVNXZXN0T2xpdmVDYW1wYmVsbDA0MjAyMDE3LTEwNi5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-10-07 12:06:40.041251

NYSEG presented the New York Public Service Commission with its ""Powering New York"" proposal in June, including plans to increase customer rates.

Starting May 1, 2026, the proposed increase could mean residential customers using about 600 kilowatt-hours would pay an additional $33.12. Commercial customers using 3,650 kilowatt-hours a month with a 25-kilowatt monthly demand could see an overall $155.37 bill increase. A total 10.9% bill increase for industrial customers could add $8,679.98.

Residential gas customers using 83 therms — the unit of measure for heat energy — could see $33.57 added to their overall bill that year.

NYSEG and RG&E Director of New York Communications Shelby Cohen said the rate increases cover needed upgrades.

Webb joined Assemblywoman Donna Lupardo and the Public Utility Law Project of NY Executive Director and General Counsel Laurie Wheelock on Oct. 1 to encourage residents to voice their concerns for the proposed rate increases at upcoming in-person and virtual hearings in the Southern Tier.

""People aren't just confused and concerned, they're worried,"" Lupardo said. ""They're worried about being able to keep their lights on. They're worried about what it means for their families. They're worried about what it means for them to stay housed.""

How NYSEG will use additional funds

Cohen said the ""Powering New York"" proposal would create 1,100 jobs across New York, including the recruitment of line workers she said would aid in storm costs and limit the use of outside contractors.

The more in-house line workers ""will eventually make storm cost decrease and lower cost in the future for our customers,"" she said.

NYSEG is also targeting investment in areas including energy demand, upgrading aging infrastructure and systems for reliability and customer service, storm/vegetation management expenses, wage requirements, federal and state pipeline safety mandates, and clean energy goals.

As part of addressing the energy demand and aging infrastructure, new transformers have to be made — the custom equipment takes four years to build. The ""skyrocketing"" energy demand, Cohen said, is being seen across the state and requires a grid expansion to keep up with the growing economic development.

In 2022, NYSEG received eight new power requests for the whole division in the Catskills. By 2024, that number jumped to 49 requests, which the company did not anticipate in its last rate case.

""There's a ton of new businesses coming. We've got to upgrade our infrastructure to serve them,"" Cohen said. ""The existing substations serving these areas can't handle that much more power running through them.""

What to know about rate approval process

Cohen said the data included in the proposal supports a five-year plan. In previous years, the multi-year agreement spanned three years, and was switched to five years for better planning.

""We have proposed a multi-year agreement so that we can spread the increases out over multiple years,"" Cohen said.

For example, a NYSEG customer could see the $33.12 applied to their bill in divided, monthly increments instead of one lump-sum fee.

The 11-month rate case process began in July. As of Oct. 1, the company is still in the negotiating stage. The PSC will decide whether the agreement will be approved for a one- or multi-year plan.

At the Oct. 1 event, Webb described the findings from audits and investigations conducted by the PSC as ""very challenging.""

An audit released in May 2025 found 128 corrective actions for NYSEG to address, including cost allocation simplification, revision of the Cost Allocation Manual, a third-party review of individual CEO metrics, new cybersecurity systems, implementation of an asset management system and upgrading customer service operations.

""We are saying NYSEG must get their house in order before asking for another rate hike that our constituents quite frankly can't afford, nor should flip the bill for,"" Webb said.

Electric Era helps C-stores and gas stations secure NEVI funding; adds Love's Travel Stops to list of customers.

Electric Era's path to growth is fueled by their patented battery-backed DC chargers that reduce operating costs up to 70% and cutting installation times from years to months. They've also leveraged their 98%+ guaranteed per-port uptime and start-to-finish project support to help their customers win 83% of the grant applications they've applied for over the past two years – for a total of $41 million worth of incentives.

With federal NEVI funding restored, available state and federal funding programs can cover up to half of charger deployment costs, allowing some retailers to reach positive ROI in less than two years from charging alone. Beyond selling electrons, however, Electric Era's customer-branded chargers with retail program integration add an entirely new revenue stream by turning EV charging into store revenue drivers.

Love's Travel Stops Chooses Electric Era

Love's Travel Stops recently commissioned an Electric Era charging station for their newest location in Buena Vista, Co. along U.S. Highway 24, which serves as a rural connector between Denver and Colorado Springs.

The deployment marks the 38th EV charging location for Love's, which now has more than 150 EV chargers across 15 states while offering refueling customers a wide range of food and beverages, along with Love's in-store Mobile-to-Go Zone, which retails consumer electronics accessories.

""As part of our commitment to sustainability, we're proud to bring this location online as we continue to bring more clean energy solutions to communities across Colorado,"" said Ryan Erickson, vice president of Love's Alternative Energy. ""This new location offers a seamless charging experience for travelers with weather protective canopies, and a variety of fresh food options and clean restrooms.""

Love's secured grant funding from the Colorado Energy Office Direct Current Fast-Charging Plazas program, which leverages both federal NEVI and Colorado state funding to deploy public DC fast charging systems in strategic and underserved areas.

The four-stall, 200 kW chargers are wrapped in Love's signature yellow and red heart brand graphics, feature both CCS1 (Combined Charging System) and NACS (North American Charging Standard) cables.

While lower total cost of ownership (TCO) was Love's initial driver, the long-term upside was compelling. Electric Era's retailer‑focused platform – with integrated brand experiences and loyalty program support – offers Love's the chance to not just break even faster, but to grow store traffic and non-fuel revenues.

""We work with a lot of customers who come to us with a variety of incentive options and business cases that strictly look at the cap-ex and op-ex in relation to the revenue from selling electrons, which is where we started at with Love's,"" said Electric Era Sr. Manager of Enterprise Sales, Brittany Kaplan.

""The best part of this engagement was helping Love's build a broader marketing and loyalty program that accelerates their revenue past break even, and sets them up to generate stronger returns for the long haul.""

Electric Era Full-Service Revenue Growth Experts

Electric Era's founder, Quincy Lee, a former SpaceX engineer, has leveraged innovation and first principles engineering to break down the barriers holding back the rapid growth of public EV charging in America. He recognized deployment complexity as a barrier holding back rapid adoption of EV charging, so he created an in-house deployment team to ""cut red tape"" on behalf of their retail customers.

His team includes project managers and engineers, government/sustainability experts and site selection specialists to help public and private entities navigate the maze of permits, regulations – plus state and federal funding programs, where applicable – to help manage the various stakeholders and applicants optimize incentive opportunities.

With $5 billion in federal NEVI funding restored with a greater emphasis on time-to-deployment, reliability and a focus on traditional refueling locations, more convenience store and fuel retailers are expected to take another look at EV charging to grow revenues today and future proof their businesses against a changing marketplace.

""Despite being grant agnostic, we've had a lot of success helping our customers who wanted to go the incentive route. Now that NEVI is back, we expect more companies like Love's to take a second look at EV charging to grow their businesses,"" Kaplan said. ""Fortunately for us, our solution and business model are aligned with the incentive program requirements for those looking to future proof their businesses.""

Without adequate insurance coverage, however, operators could lose their Oil Spill Financial Responsibility certification and be forced to suspend offshore operations.","(The Center Square) − Dismissal of offshore oil and gas policy litigation contradictory to the Trump administration’s goals are being sought by Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill.

She’s made the request to Attorney General Pam Bondi.

In a letter sent Sept. 24, Murrill said the Department of Justice’s litigation under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 has destabilized the insurance market that underpins offshore energy operations and placed Louisiana jobs and production at risk.

“The DOJ filed the lawsuit in question during the waning days of the Biden Administration and have directly harmed the Louisiana energy industry,” Murrill wrote. “The novel position taken by the DOJ is fundamentally contrary to well-settled insurance law and reverses decades of accepted, lawful interpretation and application of insurance policy coverage.”

At the center of the dispute is a lawsuit filed in 2024 that seeks to recover insurance payments related to the 2004 Taylor Energy spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The Justice Department says multiple years of insurance coverage may apply to the long-running spill – an interpretation Murrill say upends long-standing industry norms.

According to the letter, the Biden administration’s reinterpretation of the term “incident” under OPA 90 could expose insurers to liability for policies that weren’t even in effect at the time of Hurricane Ivan, the storm that caused the original damage. Murrill warned the move has already prompted insurers to withdraw from the Oil Spill Financial Responsibility market or raise premiums to unsustainable levels.

Murrill emphasized Louisiana’s role as “the epicenter of America’s offshore oil and gas industry,” noting the sector supports more than 100,000 jobs and thousands of small businesses across the state. Production from the gulf has averaged nearly 1.8 million barrels per day, she said, and could increase with new high-tech projects coming online.

Without adequate insurance coverage, however, operators could lose their Oil Spill Financial Responsibility certification and be forced to suspend offshore operations. Murrill warned such an outcome would “result in job losses in Louisiana, energy market disruptions, and increased liability for the federal government.”

The letter invokes Trump’s January executive order directing federal agencies to encourage exploration and production on federal lands and waters. It also requires the Department of Justice to identify and address court actions inconsistent with the policy.

“Given the direct negative impacts on American energy dominance, we have been optimistic – and presumed – the DOJ would abandon its litigation and dismiss its lawsuits,” she wrote. “Louisiana continues to play a leadership role in driving the country forward with the infrastructure and investments to grow energy production consistent with the vision of President Trump.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/51/351bdf7d-db56-4ca1-99ae-505f247e385e/68d5cd74a892f.image.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 12:09:38.640808

That includes $1 billion for the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub, which was slated to extend across parts of Washington, Montana and Oregon, Bloomberg first reported. Such hubs are networks of regional hydrogen producers and consumers, plus connective infrastructure like distributors and storage facilities.

The Trump administration’s move was part of the U.S. Department of Energy’s plan to slash $7.56 billion in funding for hundreds of energy projects nationwide. The department has argued that financing them wouldn’t offer sufficient return to taxpayers.

Several other Democrat-leaning states are also seeing climate-related funds terminated, including New York and California.

The news coincides with a White House-imposed pressure campaign for Democratic members of Congress to stop the federal government shutdown. The energy cuts are part of a larger $26 billion funding freeze announced Oct. 1.

Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson said in a Oct. 2 post on X that the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub “will create a clean hydrogen economy across our region.

“It is outrageous that this administration is using a government shutdown to punish blue states like Washington,” the Democrat continued. “We’re working with the Attorney General’s Office to fight this illegal action.”

McClatchy has reached out to the DOE and Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub for comment.

The state Office of the Attorney General is “absolutely considering our legal options here,” said spokesperson Mike Faulk. He said the latest news is emblematic of the Trump administration’s disregard for the rule of law.

“It also reflects their economic illiteracy with regard to energy production and unapologetic denial of the robust evidence that shows greenhouse gases are unsustainable for our planet,” Faulk continued. “Abundant renewable energy is key to economic growth as well as environmental protection.” WA Democrats blast Trump over canceled energy funding

U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene, a Washington Democrat, noted in a Oct. 2 news release that the DOE yanked funding for 11 Washington energy and manufacturing projects, including the hydrogen hub.

DelBene slammed the president for going after states that didn’t vote for him.

“President Trump’s campaign of political retribution continues, and hardworking Washingtonians are now part of the collateral damage,” DelBene said. “This politically motivated claw back of funds will result in significant job losses and increased utility bills in our state.”

Russell Vought, chief of the Office of Management and Budget, teased DOE’s nearly $8 billion in cuts in a Oct. 1 post on X. The Trump ally listed states set to lose federal dollars for “Green New Scam” projects — all of which voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

This isn’t the first time that Trump and company have been accused of going after blue states. Democratic U.S. Sen. Patty Murray of Washington called out the administration in May over its plan to revoke hundreds of millions of dollars in construction-project funding in blue states.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement that President Donald Trump has vowed to safeguard taxpayer money and expand the country’s supply of secure, affordable and dependable energy.

“Today’s cancellations deliver on that commitment,” Wright continued. “Rest assured, the Energy Department will continue reviewing awards to ensure that every dollar works for the American people.”

The DOE has said it would unravel 321 financial awards bolstering 223 projects.

U.S. Rep. Kim Schrier, a Washington Democrat, called the Trump administration’s decision to gut the $1 billion earmarked for the Pacific Northwest hub “senseless.”

She railed against the move as a “politically motivated attack” on a bipartisan project expected to generate billions of dollars in economy-strengthening investments and create thousands of good-wage jobs.

“At a time when rising prices are already squeezing families across the country, this action hits Washington consumers hard by increasing utility bills and kneecapping U.S. competitiveness in the global energy race,” she said in the Oct. 2 statement.

Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, a Republican, has also previously praised the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub, which he said would create high-quality jobs in his state.

Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom blasted the Trump administration for nixing $1.2 billion meant for the hydrogen hub in California.

“In Trump’s America, energy policy is set by the highest bidder, economics and common sense be damned,” Newsom said in a statement.",https://www.columbian.com/wp-content/themes/columbian2/static/img/og/default-2022.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 16:01:40.048353

Building US critical mineral resilience | White & Case LLP,Not Available,,,,,https://www.whitecase.com/insight-our-thinking/shovel-ready-building-us-critical-mineral-resilience,"Additionally, the administration has also designated copper a critical mineral, extending access to policy support.
While EXIM financing has included projects in the critical minerals sector, with environmental statements posted for mining projects, MMIA is not limited to mining.
Additional lending authorities through the Office of Strategic Capital at the Department of War have become a vehicle to secure critical minerals value chains.
However, policies supporting critical minerals value chains are largely bipartisan, evidenced by the administration's expansion of financings begun during the Biden administration.
The administration's approach has therefore fused security and geopolitical interests with critical minerals policy domestically, and abroad to secure investment and supply.","In nine months, the Trump administration's policy of energy dominance has reshaped the competitive landscape for the mining & metals sector in the US and beyond. American policy has pivoted from a focus on tax credits for critical minerals projects and preferences built around free trade agreements to a focus on expanding domestic mined and refined supply. Among other things, US government-backed financing aligned to geopolitical priorities is to be used to secure supply in the US and abroad.

While projects can take years, even decades, to move from exploration to production, the administration's supportive approach to the industry shows promise in moving capital toward miners and processors. But partial shutdowns during the US government budget impasse are pushing out the window in which projects can secure permissions and financing. Even if the shutdown is short-lived, mining projects need to plan for a window that may shut within 12 to 24 months, after which renewed political uncertainty could stymie further progress. If a project isn't shovel-ready, miners and processors must get it ready as fast as possible, before this window closes.

The administration's approach can be divided into three buckets. First, the use of administrative interventions such as deregulation, accelerated permitting processes and the executive authority invested in the National Energy Dominance Council to direct all-of-government efforts to accelerate project development; second, the use of existing funding authorities and offtake powers delegated to the Department of Defense and other federal bodies to finance and support projects deemed critical to national security; and third, the application of tariffs and negotiation of investment agreements linked to geopolitical and diplomatic initiatives, namely the critical minerals investment agreement with the Ukrainian government, a peace deal between the governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, a memorandum of cooperation regarding critical minerals with Saudi Arabia, and an agreement to co-invest into critical minerals value chains with the UAE.

Taken together, the current policy mix is a more supportive environment for investment into the mining & metals value chain in the US or in partnership with US allies elsewhere. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) is supportive in the near-term, allowing companies building manufacturing projects before 2029 to deduct 100 percent of the eligible property's cost in its first year of operations as long as it's in service before January 1, 2031. On paper, this should support greenfield processing, refining and smelting projects in the US. However, potential constraints on labor, a more inflationary economic environment, and uncertainty over investment, the cost of capital and economic growth may challenge projects, especially those dependent on private sector demand instead of publicly backed offtake support.

Racing for critical mineral dominance

Seeking to onshore the extraction and/or processing of those critical minerals vital to national security, manufacturing and tech giants undertaking huge AI-driven investment into datacenters and associated utilities, the administration has launched a dramatic reform effort to accelerate permitting. Begun with the Unleashing American Energy executive order (EO) on January 20, 2025 and continued with additional EOs since, the administration's highest priority has been reducing the immensely long, arduous lead times to receive permission to build mines. Additionally, the administration has also designated copper a critical mineral, extending access to policy support.

The National Energy Dominance Council formed in February 2025, a cabinet-level coordinating body chaired by the Secretary of the Interior, is explicitly tasked with improving permitting and accelerating projects deemed vital for national security. Acting on its mandate, the Council's deliberations and parallel action from the White House rescinded existing regulatory burdens imposed by the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) on June 30, 2025. The EO delegates more authority to each department to narrowly apply the law for NEPA reviews, impose review page limits, and eases the process of establishing exclusions from the review process. These regulatory rollbacks potentially come at the expense of environmental outcomes, a legitimate cause for concern that poses legal risks after the Supreme Court's overturning of the Chevron Deference doctrine.

Existing projects stuck in limbo have benefited from designation under FAST-41, a federal designation for projects to accelerate decisions on outstanding permit applications. The largest project among them—the Rio Tinto–led Resolution Copper in Arizona—received an expedited environmental impact statement and decision from the US Forest Service in June. Resolution Copper could provide up to 400,000 tons of copper production, equivalent to approximately 25 percent of US demand and enough to significantly reduce dependence on refined copper imports as smelting and refining capacity comes online. Resolution Copper still faces a legal injunction on a necessary land swap to build the mine, but the federal government continues to support a faster development timeline.

Please see the list of the FAST-41 Transparency Projects here.

With or without FAST-41 status, copper, rare earths, uranium and gold projects are the likeliest to benefit most in the near term. Persistent fears of large copper concentrates deficits after 2030 dovetail with greater demand growth linked to electrification. China's export controls on light and heavy rare earths have left defense and automotive manufacturers exposed to supply chain concentration. A significant expansion of domestic uranium mining and processing similarly would support the administration's efforts to kickstart a nuclear power renaissance.

Designation for faster review doesn't guarantee success. The administration is blocking the development of Northern Dynasty's Pebble Mine project in Bristol Bay, Alaska, one of the world's largest undeveloped gold and copper prospects, fearing environmental impacts on the Bay's salmon fisheries. As officials begin reviewing projects with significant environmental impacts—Orla Mining's Dark Star Mine near Elko, Nevada is the first open-pit mine receiving an accelerated review—market participants will learn more about the relative importance assigned to local concerns.

Despite some uncertainty about degree, there is a definitive change and expansion of what's considered a permissible tradeoff between development, environmental concerns and national needs. Newfound support for research, exploration and international leadership for offshore deep sea mining projects highlights this shift, though the lack of an established regulatory framework remains troublesome.

Show me the money

Alongside aggressive coordination efforts fast-tracking permissions, policymakers are expanding support for strategically important projects. The Department of Energy's loan program office is having its remit expanded to include traditional fossil fuel infrastructure, while backing away from its past mandate to lend to projects aiding emissions reduction like battery gigafactories requiring lithium and other metals offtakes. Make More in America (MMIA) supports a broad range of U.S. manufacturing and production projects that strengthen American competitiveness. While EXIM financing has included projects in the critical minerals sector, with environmental statements posted for mining projects, MMIA is not limited to mining. It is important to note that MMIA applies only to domestic U.S. projects. Separately, EXIM provides international export financing through its traditional programs under a distinct statutory framework. Additional lending authorities through the Office of Strategic Capital at the Department of War have become a vehicle to secure critical minerals value chains.

The concentration of rare earths mining and refining in China poses significant national security risks exposed by China's implementation of export license controls on a widening array of rare earths and battery metals since 2023. In the spring, western OEMs and defense manufacturers panicked over any sudden halt to trade flows from a lack of large inventories. But breaking into the mining and processing of rare earths has been notoriously difficult because of the low price points at which Chinese producers can operate and their advantages from existing economies of scale.

By considering equity stakes and supporting profitability through price interventions, the administration is prioritizing onshoring production of key inputs, particularly for existing brownfield assets. Current policy also aims to leverage the International Development Finance Corporation (DFC).

By taking on equity and guaranteeing profitability through price interventions, the administration is prioritizing onshoring production of key inputs where possible with greater influence over investment decisions. Taking equity positions in exchange for financial support has become a vote of confidence for investors and an implicit promise of support when market conditions deteriorate. DFC has in place commitments to support the Lobito Corridor, a rail route linking the Angolan port to the Copperbelt in the DRC and Zambia. In September, the agency announced a US$75 million equity commitment to seed the US-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund that will provide seed capital to jumpstart the fund's investment in critical minerals, hydrocarbons and related infrastructure in Ukraine. Other initiatives to combine the DFC's efforts with private funding, in some cases, and sovereign wealth, in others, may be explored with a particular focus on investments in critical minerals. A significant increase in the DFC's investment capacity is also under consideration in a congressional reauthorization hoping to take place in November 2025. But with many staff of both DFC and EXIM currently furloughed and both looking for congressional reauthorization in the coming months, a speedy resolution to the budget impasse may be critical for them to maintain momentum to finance mining projects during the window described above.

Carrots and sticks

Trade policy has expanded into an instrument organizing industrial policy through a broad array of carrots and sticks. Since 2018, tariffs have been featured as a tool to protect domestic steel and aluminum production under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. The Trump administration expanded the use of Section 232 in 2025, increasing the steel tariffs from 25 percent to 50 percent, and the aluminum tariffs from 10 percent to 50 percent. On August 1, 2025, 50 percent of Section 232 tariffs were also levied on imports of semi-refined copper products, a move meant to foster more investment into domestic smelting and refining. Officials are still considering a 15 to 30 percent general copper import tariff for 2027 that will be reviewed next year. A similar investigation is ongoing for a broad range of processed critical minerals and derivative products, including rare earths and uranium, with a report and policy recommendations scheduled for delivery to the President in October.

Each shift in the tariff regime alters domestic project economics—higher import costs can offset higher construction, labor and operational costs for US projects. But their application by executive order also creates the potential for negotiated exemptions with foreign partners in line with diplomatic and geopolitical initiatives. Conversely, the Republican majorities in Congress's unwillingness so far to challenge the Trump administration's tariffs in regulating trade or establishing these priorities beyond budget allocations can create longer-term risks from shifts in policy. However, policies supporting critical minerals value chains are largely bipartisan, evidenced by the administration's expansion of financings begun during the Biden administration.

Two major diplomatic initiatives have produced intergovernmental framework agreements for mining and metals projects—attempts to broker peace and post-war stability in Ukraine and the DRC. Responding to Ukrainian concerns that the US might disengage from military and security support, the US government negotiated the creation of a joint fund for exploration and early-stage development. All projects' equity will be split between the two governments. Since much of Ukraine's critical mineral wealth currently sits in occupied territory, the agreement provides a longer-term basis for US involvement.

More pressing for metals markets, the Trump administration brokered the Washington Accord between the governments of the DRC and Rwanda, which risked threatening mining operations. While the agreement only begins implementation in October, and did not include M23, which continues to fight against the Congolese government in Kinshasa, the DFC has begun underwriting exploration agreements in the region. To date, there is no systematic process for US firms to invest, and a durable peace deal has yet to be reached.

Finally, the administration has brokered a memorandum of cooperation with the Saudi government to collaborate securing critical minerals and an agreement with the UAE to co-invest into relevant projects. These agreements build on both countries' existing critical minerals strategies acquiring strategic stakes in mining businesses and projects internationally. The administration's approach has therefore fused security and geopolitical interests with critical minerals policy domestically, and abroad to secure investment and supply. These efforts can also create headwinds for US firms and opportunities for miners based in Europe. Tensions between the governments of Greenland and Denmark with Washington over talk of incorporating Greenland into the United States opened the door to more agreements with European companies. The unintended consequences of transactional minerals diplomacy can create opportunities in Europe and elsewhere too.

Macro-economic road bumps

Miners and investors attempting to capitalize on these shifts in policy face demand uncertainty and structural constraints that will likely elevate project costs. The repeal of most tax credit provisions from the Inflation Reduction Act in the OBBB creates a headwind for the uptake of electric vehicles on the US market. Coupled with the slowdown in federal permissions for clean energy and battery storage, the demand outlook for domestic lithium projects faces uncertainty. Among the major US automakers, Ford is the only company committing to aggressive EV production targets and investment timelines.

More broadly, current policies create risks of significant increases in the cost base for projects. A more restrictive immigration policy has begun to pose a challenge for the construction sector. Projects requiring significant infrastructure investment and development will likely cost more as a result. But labor shortages are most pronounced for more senior expertise because new mines haven't been developed at scale in the US for a generation. Tariffs and the lack of a large domestic industrial base for mining & metals kits pose additional cost pressures. In the years ahead, electricity will also become a cost pressure point driven by rapidly growing demands on power grids, for AI data centers, and balancing supply between baseload, renewables and batteries.

Finally, greater uncertainty about future economic growth may challenge the economics of some proposed mines. For instance, copper prices and demand correlate strongly to GDP growth, a relationship strengthening from electrification. But the present policy mix creates headwinds for growth, even as it encourages domestic investment into mining & metals. By contrast, the demand for gold often correlates to uncertainty, inflation and the value of the US dollar, which has depreciated against other major currencies at near historic levels for the past 50 years.

These challenges will not stop investment into the sector, nor will they necessarily last. Miners like Ivanhoe Electric, which concluded its preliminary feasibility study for the Santa Cruz copper project in Arizona in June, can lock in the benefit of more accommodative policy. But the current policy environment creates a market landscape with two tiers. Miners chiefly serving private sector demand and making use of expedited permitting alone face greater risks than miners receiving financial support from the US government. Both groups enjoy an accommodative policy environment, but the latter also enjoys financial support that may be unavailable in commercial markets.

While California is establishing some of the most forward-thinking plastic responsibility and recycling rules in the country, a dirty secret is that most plastic recycling methods are ineffective at best and illusory at worst.
A credible solution to plastic waste?
“Communities across California and the country are searching for credible solutions to plastic waste,” Bauer wrote in an open letter to the community.
Ambitious rules and tough realities for plastic California’s goals to reduce plastic pollution and make producers responsible for plastic waste are ambitious in size, scope, and speed.","The plan sounded like a magic bullet from the future to solve one of the world’s most vexing environmental waste problems.

In Rohnert Park, just north of San Francisco, a startup company called Resynergi planned to use a form of “advanced recycling” to reuse plastic. Its process would chemically transform old plastic, blasting bits of it with microwaves until they turned into an oil that could then be used to make new plastic.

But the process – known as pyrolysis – was a hard sell to Sonoma County neighbors, who protested so much that the company withdrew its application and now plans to move out of state.

The fight that boiled over in Rohnert Park in recent months is a window into the tensions ahead for California as the state overhauls nation-leading regulations governing plastic pollution and packaging. (CalRecycle, formally known as the Department of Resources Recovery and Recycling, will hold a public hearing about those rules Oct. 7.)

While California is establishing some of the most forward-thinking plastic responsibility and recycling rules in the country, a dirty secret is that most plastic recycling methods are ineffective at best and illusory at worst.

Millions of tons of plastic go to the state’s landfills each year, and millions more are shipped to Southeast Asia, where plastic is rarely recycled. Instead it is illegally dumped, and often burned.

Last year, Attorney General Rob Bonta brought suit against ExxonMobil for “perpetuating the myth … that you can recycle plastics, including single use plastics, and that it’s sustainable and good for the environment … It’s not true. It’s a lie.” ExxonMobil has since countersued Bonta for defamation.

California’s regulators, meanwhile, are working to implement a 2022 state law that moves the state toward a circular economy for plastic – by making companies that produce packaging and single-use plastic items responsible for what happens to them after people throw them away. Those companies, along with environmental groups, have been weighing in as CalRecycle has been writing regulations, now years in the making.

Recent comments by Gov. Gavin Newsom suggest the state is aiming to strike a balance, finding a way to encourage recycling companies while hitting the state’s goals – all while avoiding more air pollution or other environmental impacts.

As for Resynergi, local and environmental advocates say that the way local, county, and regional regulators handled the company points up the challenges the state will face as it regulates plastic and defines whether and how it can be recycled.

“It does make me nervous, since it took seven years to get any enforcement on a facility that’s a two hour drive from the Capitol,” said Nick Lapis, advocacy director for Californians Against Waste.

A credible solution to plastic waste?

Resynergi’s departure came as Sonoma County officials began to ask more serious questions about its operations, almost a decade after the company first arrived.

In 2017, company founder Brian Bauer chose Rohnert Park, a small, middle-class community surrounded by farmland, to develop and test his process.

He set up shop in a development called SOMO Village – a 200-acre neighborhood with homes, a high school, and commercial space. Developers market it as a climate-conscious place, built to be carbon-neutral, which Bauer said was a draw for Resynergi.

In early conversations, according to Bauer, Sonoma County officials “suggested” his business could follow simpler recycling guidelines. Sheri Cardo, a spokesperson for Sonoma County’s Department of Health Services, confirmed the department had talked with Bauer about its operations as a recycling research and development site, and that his characterization was accurate.

In 2023, when Bauer sought to expand operations, he approached the city of Rohnert Park’s planning division for permits.

Officials told Bauer his facility was considered a heavy manufacturing site, and that Resynergi’s location – 600 feet from a school – demanded an environmental review, according to documents obtained by residents through a public records request. In a response late last year, Resynergi argued that such a review could take too long, and moving quickly “could make or break substantial investment from a large strategic investor.”

Within a month, planning officials had flipped and were now siding with Resynergi, granting it a more flexible, less burdensome administrative use permit. The decision avoided additional public review.

But to operate legally, Resynergi had to secure approval from county officials and the regional air district.

In California, pyrolysis is classified as a type of incineration, associated with toxic and hazardous waste. Businesses must obtain a solid waste permit from local authorities, who enforce the state’s public resources code. In the past, three facilities have received permits to use pyrolysis, two for the purpose of destroying medical waste. All are now closed, according to CalRecycle.

California counties issue waste permits on behalf of CalRecycle. The Bay Area Regional Air Quality Management District permits and controls pollution that microwaving plastic could produce.

County officials started looking into the company when they realized Resynergi’s plans would make the company a fully operational and “fixed component in the county’s waste system,” said Cardo, the county spokesperson.

“Although your facility might be considered a recycling facility in vernacular language, it is not under state law,” wrote Christine Sosko, Sonoma County’s director of environmental health.

CalRecycle spokesman Lance Klug said in an email that Sonoma County’s response followed state standards.

But environmental advocates say the way city and county officials handled Resynergi reflects regulators’ confusion about the processes for advanced recycling – confusion fueled by the plastic industry.

Jane Williams, director of California Communities Against Toxics, argues that federal and state law make it clear that pyrolysis facilities have to follow rules as incinerators. “It’s really interesting for me to see, having worked on these incinerators for so long, how these guys pulled strings,” Williams said. “They pulled whatever out of their pockets so they could convince people this is a recycling facility.”

The American Chemistry Council, a trade group supporting the plastic industry, disagrees. And Resynergi’s Bauer said he doesn’t think his company’s process counts as incineration.

“Communities across California and the country are searching for credible solutions to plastic waste,” Bauer wrote in an open letter to the community. “This city has the chance to lead by example.”

Community fears toxic air pollution

People living in and near SOMO Village found out that Resynergi planned to burn plastic on a larger scale when the Bay Area Air Quality Management District notified the public of the company’s permit application.

The community protested, filling city council rooms at each meeting and waving signs depicting polluting smoke stacks. Some parents spoke through tears to their city leaders. “Our air is not your experiment,” one poster read.

Among the local opponents of Resynergi was Stephanie Lennox. She lives about 20 minutes from Rohnert Park in rural Forestville, but her two daughters go to Credo High School right next to the facility. She wondered about emissions and the risk of an explosion.

“My Lord, don’t we need a solution to our global plastic pollution,” Lennox said. “But my daughters’ lungs are not part of your beta testing phase for your ‘world’s global plastic solution.’”

Local organizers said they wanted city and county leaders to follow state law and the federal Clean Air Act.

When plastic is burned, additives like flame retardants or other chemicals that don’t break down can create toxic emissions, said Veena Singla, a researcher at the University of California San Francisco.

Resynergi applied to the regional air district to obtain a permit for pollution control equipment in April, after the company had already begun operating their technology.

In August, the air district issued three notices of violation to Resynergi for constructing and operating without a permit.

Bauer admitted to operating the equipment without a permit. The company never burned plastic in Rohnert Park he said; it did burn plastic at “prototype levels” in Santa Rosa.

But, Bauer added, Resynergi was trying to follow the rules as he understood them. As a startup, he said, “you don’t even know if you will get a prototype to work. You’re also trying to figure out how the permitting process works.”

Millions spent to sway regulations

Resynergi’s departure wasn’t because of a community outcry, Bauer said. The turning point, he said, was “the pull from other states; how they treated climate technologies such as ours …combined with the overall culture of accepting what we’re doing.”

Plastics manufacturers and industry advocates like the American Chemistry Council have campaigned to redefine terms and loosen environmental regulations for the process Resynergi is developing. After the lobbying, 27 states have reclassified pyrolysis as manufacturing instead of solid waste operations, said Davis Allen, a researcher for the Center for Climate Integrity. That classification helps operators get around federal air requirements, he added.

Resynergi’s Bauer told CalMatters that “one of those (states) is a candidate,” and that the company will move out by the end of the year.

An analysis by the climate accountability newsletter HEATED found the chemistry council and groups aligned with it have spent as much as $30 million to promote the concept of advanced recycling as a mainstream and established one. That language aims to sway not just state laws, but federal clean air policy as well.

Between 2021 and 2022, when lawmakers were discussing plastic producer legislation, the American Chemistry Council spent more than $1.6 million on lobbying state legislators, according to publicly available data published by the Secretary of State.

The American Chemistry Council’s Ross Eisenberg says that pyrolysis and other chemical recycling processes do work. These processes turn “hard-to-recycle plastics into the raw materials for high-quality products while reducing greenhouse-gas emissions and fossil energy use during production compared with virgin production,” he said.

“America’s plastic makers are investing billions of dollars to modernize and expand recycling capacity and improve efficiency,” Eisenberg said, adding that the companies are “advocating for smart policies that enhance collection and sorting so more plastics can be remade into new products.”

This year, the Environmental Protection Agency said it isn’t taking further action on the matter, but industry representatives said they’ll continue to lobby at the federal level.

Ambitious rules and tough realities for plastic

California’s goals to reduce plastic pollution and make producers responsible for plastic waste are ambitious in size, scope, and speed. Within seven years, state law seeks to reduce plastic packaging by 25%, make single-use plastic packaging 100% recyclable or compostable, and divert most of that packaging into recycling.

Allen, from the Center for Climate Integrity, says laws like this can be a good idea – as long as regulators focus more on reducing plastics and less on recycling them.

“Almost any solution that is based on the idea that plastics can widely be recycled just isn’t really going to work,” Allen said. “There just aren’t easily available solutions to a lot of the problems that limit the effectiveness of recycling.”

But in March, regulations aimed at achieving the state’s goals were dealt a setback after two years of hearings. The day they were due, Gov. Newsom directed CalRecycle to start the regulatory process over.

The governor asked for changes “to minimize costs for small businesses and families – while ensuring California’s bold recycling law can achieve the critical goal of cutting plastic pollution,” said Daniel Villaseñor, a spokesperson for the governor, in an email to CalMatters.

The Plastics Industry Association and the American Chemistry Council hailed the governor’s announcement as an opportunity. “We believe California’s regulations should be clear, technology-neutral, and performance-based,” said the council’s Ross Eisenberg.

According to Klug, the CalRecycle spokesman, the state “remains committed to fostering business innovation that promotes a safe and clean future for all Californians.”

But environmental organizations like the Monterey Bay Aquarium and Surfrider called the decision disappointing.

Williams, the California Communities Against Toxics activist, said she’s concerned that more recent draft language may encourage pyrolysis facilities like Resynergi, which, she says, don’t belong in the state.

If California “rolls out the red carpet,” she said, “The only thing that will stop a whole new fleet of incinerators being built in California now is open, persistent community opposition.”

Resynergi also took part in CalRecycle workshops for the regulations. The company’s departure announcement praised the “innovative spirit of California … instrumental in the company’s growth.”

Brian Bauer said he’s hopeful the state plastic regulations will ease regulations for companies like his, but he plans to return to California either way.

“So it might be a couple years,” Bauer said. “We’ll be back to California in due time.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/082725_Rohnert-Park-Incinerator_CS_CM_06.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-07 12:07:20.154567

From pioneering clean energy to scaling up advanced manufacturing and digital innovation, we’re backing the sectors that will define the future. This strategy is about delivery, not just ambition — and it’s already laying the foundations for a stronger, more resilient economy that works for everyone.

Advanced Manufacturing

The newly launched DRIVE35 programme is injecting £2.5 billion into the automotive sector, supporting capital investment and R&D. A £650 million electric vehicle grant scheme is already accelerating consumer adoption, while over 50 cutting-edge auto projects have secured £70 million in innovation funding.

Clean Energy Industries

The UK’s clean energy ambitions are advancing at pace. The Contracts for Difference Allocation Round 7 has opened with a £544 million budget, while ten hydrogen projects from Allocation Round 1 are now moving forward — creating over 700 jobs. Two new Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage (CCUS) projects will join the HyNet cluster, supporting nearly 3,000 jobs across North Wales and the North West.

Creative Industries

The government is investing in the UK’s world-class creative industries, with £150 million from the Creative Places Growth Fund allocated to regions including the West Midlands and Greater Manchester. New higher technical qualifications and a Creative Careers Programme are being developed to inspire the next generation of talent.

Defence

An £182 million Defence Skills package will establish five new Defence Technical Excellence Colleges, while £220 million is being invested in test and evaluation capabilities through the Defence Tech Scaler. A further £65 million is supporting SMEs and exporters in the defence sector.

Digital and Technologies

In digital tech, the creation of a new AI Growth Zone in the North East is expected to generate over 5,000 jobs and attract more than £30 billion in private investment. The UK-US Tech Prosperity Agreement is also unlocking new opportunities in AI, quantum, and digital trade.

Financial Services

The UK is sharpening its competitive edge in financial services with the launch of a new Office for Investment concierge service this October, designed to streamline support for firms and attract global capital. A bold consultation on regulatory reform is underway, including plans to merge the Payment System Regulator and Financial Conduct Authority—a move set to simplify oversight and boost innovation.

Life Sciences

The UK is cementing its position as a global life sciences powerhouse with the launch of Europe’s first Biofoundry for mRNA manufacturing in Darlington, backed by £30 million in government support. A £50 million Transformational R&D Investment Fund Pilot is now live, alongside the opening of Moderna’s Innovation and Technology Centre, part of a landmark £1 billion, 10-year partnership. To supercharge research, a new body has been created to deliver a £600 million Health Data Research Service, offering secure, streamlined access to NHS data through a single gateway.

There is no objectively correct, scientific answer to how much we should worry about climate change.
Converting all, or even some, of the carbon tax revenue to universal flat cash transfer payments could more than offset the economic burden of the tax for lower- and middle-income households.
Carbon taxes justifiably have their critics; translating the simple model of a Pigouvian tax to climate change involves a lot of judgment calls worthy of debate.
Nonetheless, most of the objections to a carbon tax as a policy mechanism apply to other climate policies too, and the core structural advantages of a carbon tax still hold relative to the alternatives.","Back in 2019, an unprecedented group of thousands of economists signed a public letter in favor of a carbon tax as the best solution to climate change.

At the same time, legislation known as the Green New Deal was gaining popularity among progressives and climate activists. The Green New Deal legislation put forward a top-down, public-sector approach to addressing climate change. While the exact parameters of the Green New Deal were vague, it emphasized massive-scale federal investment in climate-related infrastructure projects, invoking FDR’s New Deal. The climate activists downplayed or even dismissed carbon taxes—fees on greenhouse gases emitted by fossil fuel use and other economic activity—as both regressive and inadequate to achieving their goals.

While the Green New Deal was not a serious legislative proposal, the Biden administration’s approach to addressing climate change was closer to the Green New Deal approach than it was to carbon pricing. The resulting Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) relied heavily on subsidies for green technologies, whether zero-emission electricity generation or electric vehicles. The Biden administration also pursued emissions reduction through regulation.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), passed in July 2025, cut the IRA green energy subsidies substantially, although it stopped short of full repeal. With the IRA subsidies gutted and deficits elevated, carbon taxes may be worth another look.

The case for carbon taxes.

A tax on socially harmful behavior is known as a Pigouvian tax, named for the British economist Arthur Pigou, who introduced the concept in 1920. The basic case for such a tax is that some economic activity imposes costs on third parties not involved in those transactions. Those costs are also known as externalities. A Pigouvian tax forces economic actors to factor in these social costs. Taxes on cigarettes and alcohol are the two most prominent historical examples of Pigouvian taxes. The idea is to find the social cost of an activity, such as the climate impacts of carbon emissions, and impose a tax at the rate that aligns the costs from producing emissions with the benefits.

The straightforward advantage of this policy in the context of climate change is that it leaves the decision of which emissions to reduce, and by how much, to the market. It may be cheap to reduce emissions in some sectors, but expensive in others. Under a broad carbon price, firms would undertake the least expensive approaches possible to reducing emissions. Depending on the context, that might mean more incremental changes, like improvements in energy efficiency or replacing coal-fired electricity generation with natural gas, or it might mean more radical decarbonization involving the full-scale adoption of zero-emission technology in electricity generation, passenger cars, or even other more difficult areas like industrial processes.

The U.S. has not implemented a significant carbon tax at the national level. Carbon taxes have been introduced in plenty of other developed countries, such as Sweden, Norway, France, and the United Kingdom. Carbon taxes (and cap-and-trade systems, which are similar) have expanded around the world in the past two decades. The most notable setback came in Canada this year, when new Prime Minister Mark Carney repealed the federal carbon tax that had been a signature achievement of Justin Trudeau’s premiership.

Critiques of carbon pricing.

Critiques of the simple “Econ 101” case for a carbon tax abound. They’re worth addressing, but none of them defeat the underlying logic of the basic approach.

1. The social cost of carbon is a flawed metric.

To get to the social cost of carbon, you need to first model the damage from carbon emissions, a difficult process in itself. But then you must choose a discount rate (in short, how much to value future costs relative to present costs), and whether to consider the global costs of emissions or just the domestic costs.

Reasonable assumptions about discount rates and global versus domestic costs can produce wildly different estimates of the social cost of carbon, from under $10 to almost $200. Because methodological differences produce dramatically different estimates of the social cost of carbon,

just about any carbon tax policy could plausibly be argued to either overprice or underprice emissions. However, this issue is not exclusive to carbon pricing. When considering a regulation on power plant emissions or the size of subsidies for green energy investment, policymakers also must make judgment calls on how to value potential future costs of climate change.

There is no objectively correct, scientific answer to how much we should worry about climate change. However, given that we will implement climate policy in some form, and given that carbon emissions do have a social cost, a carbon tax is still the best option in the toolkit. In simple terms, we have agreed on the premise; now we’re just negotiating the price.

2. Carbon taxes distract from pro-innovation policy that will lower the cost of green energy.

Carbon taxes should drive clean energy innovation, and that is especially true in the United States. The pattern of “induced innovation,” where energy innovation accelerates when energy prices are higher, suggests a carbon tax would spur innovation in lower-emission technology. That’s truer in the U.S. because we are a massive market. A carbon tax in, say, Luxembourg probably won't drive emissions reduction through technological innovation because Luxembourg is not a big market for innovators to pursue. The United States is.

A carbon tax and government support for new technological development are not mutually exclusive. Even with a carbon tax, there is a case for government support for energy research, just like there is a role for government support for basic research in other fields.

The challenges to broader technological transformation apply regardless of a carbon price or innovation subsidy approach. If the main constraint to more transformative decarbonization is, say, permitting, then that is going to be a challenge whether the primary financial lever for supporting clean energy investments is a tax subsidy for new technology or a tax on carbon emissions.

3. Carbon taxes don’t go far enough.

A carbon price is not the same as a net-zero-emissions policy, and that's a good thing. Fossil fuels are tremendously useful technologies, even if they have downsides. A carbon tax would make private actors take the environmental costs of burning fossil fuels into consideration, but in many cases no viable alternatives to fossil fuels exist (and there may not be for a long time). A carbon tax lets market actors—you and me—decide if certain activities are worth their environmental costs.

4. Carbon taxes disproportionately burden low-income households.

While there is some truth to this critique, the same can be said of other climate policies too. Green energy credits, whether consumer-facing ones for electric vehicles or business-side ones for electricity generation or other green energy tech, disproportionately flow to high-income households and big businesses and must ultimately be offset by other sources of tax revenue or spending cuts.

The economic burden of command-and-control regulation of fuel use also falls disproportionately on low-income households. Most of the economic literature shows carbon taxes are less regressive than these alternatives.

The other factor to consider here: Carbon taxes produce revenue. Converting all, or even some, of the carbon tax revenue to universal flat cash transfer payments could more than offset the economic burden of the tax for lower- and middle-income households.

The big picture.

In implementing a carbon tax, an additional consideration is the need for deficit reduction. Revenue will have to be part of the conversation. In a situation where policymakers are looking to bring deficits down, a climate policy approach like a carbon tax that reduces the deficit has a lot more appeal than an approach like green subsidies that increases it.

Carbon taxes justifiably have their critics; translating the simple model of a Pigouvian tax to climate change involves a lot of judgment calls worthy of debate. Nonetheless, most of the objections to a carbon tax as a policy mechanism apply to other climate policies too, and the core structural advantages of a carbon tax still hold relative to the alternatives.",https://thedispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-528822404.jpg?w=1024,N,,2025-10-07 13:04:02.721699

The US Environmental Protection Agency is under fire for cancelling a USD 7 billion solar-power programme...

The US Environmental Protection Agency is under fire for cancelling a USD 7 billion solar-power programme despite already guaranteeing that funds would be forthcoming.

A coalition of trades unions, environmental campaigners, businesses and individual homeowners has filed a lawsuit in the District of Rhode Island against the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and its administrator Lee Zeldin, challenging the Trump administration’s termination of the USD 7 billion ‘Solar for All’ programme. The complaint, lodged yesterday (6 October), argues that the EPA acted unlawfully in cancelling a scheme designed to bring solar power to more than 900,000 low-income households nationwide. The claimants contend that Congress had already guaranteed the funds, meaning they were legally preserved even after lawmakers repealed parts of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund earlier this year.

The case is being brought by the Rhode Island AFL-CIO (a federation of trades unions), the Rhode Island Center for Justice, Solar United Neighbors, Sunpath Consulting, 2KB Energy Services, Energy Independent Solutions, Black Sun Light Sustainability and individual homeowner Anh Nguyen of Atlanta, Georgia.

The lawsuit alleges violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and the US Constitution, particularly the separation of powers. Claimants argue that by rescinding funds that Congress had already obligated, the executive branch unlawfully usurped Congress’s “power of the purse”.

HUGE MISTAKE

“Families all over the country were counting on energy bill relief that disappeared overnight when the administration unlawfully terminated Solar for All. This popular programme was poised to bring more solar to our communities, provide jobs for the small businesses installing those projects, and help families get cheap, clean power,” said Nick Torrey, a lawyer at the Southern Environmental Law Center, in an online statement. “We’re asking the court to fix the Trump administration’s huge mistake.”

The 47-page filing emphasises the scale of reliance on the programme. Rhode Island AFL-CIO had invested heavily in apprenticeship and workforce planning, anticipating hundreds of new union jobs. The Rhode Island Center for Justice expanded staff and entered formal agreements with state agencies to deliver affordable solar power to disadvantaged households. Solar United Neighbors hired staff in Florida, Texas and Indiana and had already begun projects such as ‘Hub Homes’ in Harris County, designed to provide backup power to communities during blackouts.

BUSINESSES’ DIRECT LOSSES

Georgia-based Sunpath Solar reported more than USD 30,000 in out-of-pocket costs for vehicles, USD 18,000 in annual software expenses and more than USD 100,000 in staff commitments tied to Solar for All contracts. 2KB Energy Services, also in Georgia, estimated nearly USD 2 million in lost revenue over the contract period and said it had been forced to lay off staff after purchasing compliance tools and project software specifically for the scheme. Black Sun Light Sustainability lost a USD 29.9 million sub-award in Indiana that was to fund five energy cooperatives, 50 resilience hubs and 200 rooftop projects.

MAKING AMERICANS PAY

Environmental groups have not held back in their criticism of the programme’s termination. “EPA’s termination […] is a betrayal against a million American families and communities who need access to clean, affordable energy,” said Jillian Blanchard, vice president of climate change and environmental justice at Lawyers for Good Government. “By terminating the Solar for All programme while simultaneously ending clean air protections, this administration is sending a clear message: they will make Americans pay with their savings and their health in order to benefit the fossil fuel industry. We will not allow this administration to trample the legal rights of Americans, and we will keep fighting for a clean, affordable future for the people and the planet.”

Amy Romero, chief legal counsel at the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island, added: “Congress designed Solar for All grants to give local front-line communities the tools to lower household energy costs and ensure high-quality careers for a new generation with clean, renewable energy. EPA’s unlawful termination halts the creation of hundreds of union jobs in Rhode Island, and then compounds the risk of utility shutoff and perpetuates energy insecurity in the very low-income households that Congress sought to protect with this programme.”

The legal arguments rest heavily on statutory interpretation. Claimants point to the July 2025 legislation, which repealed the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and rescinded only “unobligated balances”. By September 2024, the EPA had already awarded and allocated the full USD 7 billion, and the claimants argue that the repeal could not retroactively extinguish those grants.

BOONDOGGLE

Administrator Zeldin has defended the decision, writing on social media that the “EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle [or wasteful project] alive”. The EPA subsequently issued termination letters to grantees on 7 August, claiming that without statutory authorisation and administrative appropriations, it could not lawfully continue the scheme.

Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, said in a statement: “The Trump administration’s rollback of the Solar for All programme is a shameless attempt to prop up fossil fuel companies at the expense of families. This programme would provide families with low incomes access to clean, affordable solar power: energy that lowers bills, improves air quality, and keeps people safer during extreme heat. Stripping those benefits away is unlawful and betrays communities. We will not let it stand.”",https://iclg.com/uploads/pages/images/coalition-sues-epa-over-termination-of-solar-for-all-plan_0_QEQo8ZxbOn5sKlxTLPjHAbdg8pL30IuL4nAnEXd3.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 14:03:06.448375

Delta will use $268,248 from the N.C. Division of Air Quality to buy six electric belt loaders used to get luggage on and off planes at Raleigh-Durham International Airport. The airline plans to retire six diesel belt loaders, leaving it with about a dozen diesels still in use at RDU, according to the airline.

Each year, the state awards grants to reduce pollution from diesel-powered “mobile sources,” including trucks, buses, lawnmowers and construction equipment. The money comes from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Diesel Emissions Reduction Act program, created by Congress in 2005.

Altogether, the state awarded $1.14 million in grants this year. Other recipients include the town of Carrboro, which received $6,951 to replace a utility terrain vehicle with an electric model.

With each grant award, the Division of Air Quality lists the estimated amount of pollution it will prevent. In the case of Delta’s belt loaders, the state estimates emissions reductions over the liftime of the machines of 1,316 tons of carbon dioxide, 3.36 tons of nitrogen oxides and 560 pounds of small particulates.

Delta has bought more than 2,000 electric belt loaders, bag tractors and other ground equipment across its network since 2020, according to Jesse Miers, Delta’s director of fleet operations. About 39% of core ground support equipment is now electric, Miers said.

The transition to electric will help the company achieve its goal of producing net zero carbon emissions by 2050, Miers said. The state grant helps accelerate that process at RDU, he said.

Last year, the company received $132,420 from the same grant program to help replace four pieces of diesel equipment at RDU with electric ones.

From memory, Talarico quoted Catholic Worker Movement co-founder Dorothy Day: ""You really only love God as much as you love the person you love the least.""","Religion and politics dramatically intertwined when thousands of people attended Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk's memorial service on Sept. 21. The loud gathering exemplified the rise of Christian nationalism within the Republican Party — and the call to a quasi-spiritual, quasi-political battle between good and evil.

In contrast, more quietly, days earlier, a 36-year-old Democrat studying to be a Presbyterian minister launched a bid for the U.S. Senate in Texas. State Rep. James Talarico's announcement was substantially different from the Kirk memorial's apocalyptic message.

""My granddad was a Baptist preacher in South Texas,"" he said. ""He taught me that we follow a barefoot rabbi who gave two commandments: love God and love neighbor. Because there is no love of God without love of neighbor.""

Talarico's speech, delivered while standing on a flatbed truck in front of a church, is inspiring, profound and unique for a Democrat. His message has the potential to transcend party lines — and perhaps even transform American politics. This three-minute clip offers one of the clearest, compelling examples in decades of a public official linking hopeful Christianity to our national public discourse.

Unlike Talarico, many Democratic candidates dodge the topic of religion in politics, while Republicans have embraced the religious right, politically benefitting from the modern reality that ""all politics is influenced by identity [including religion],"" as Ezra Klein writes in his excellent book, Why We're Polarized.

For decades, I worked in government and politics at all levels, including senior positions in three Democratic presidential campaigns. I've seen candidates and the party struggle to connect with religious voters, fearing that ""God talk"" only benefits Republicans and stirs culture war issues.

Talarico masterfully accepts this challenge and isn't shy about sharing Christian teaching as a unifying message. ""Every single person bears the image of the sacred,"" he said. ""Every single person is holy, not just my neighbors who look like me, or pray like me, or vote like me.""

But equally significant, Talarico understands that we live in combative times. A turn-the-other-cheek Christian candidate would appear too weak or out of touch to lead a party or a nation. But this candidate emphasizes how Jesus was not just a revolutionary figure but a true rebel in his time.

""Two thousand years ago, when the powerful few rigged the system, that barefoot rabbi walked into the seat of power and flipped over the tables of injustice,"" said Talarico. ""To those who love this state, to those who love this country, to those who love our neighbors, it's time to start flipping tables.""

And he is straightforward about what he means. His campaign video starts with a declaration: ""The biggest divide in our country is not left versus right, it's top versus bottom."" Billionaires, Talarico goes on to say, want people to look left and right at each other, ""so that we're not looking up at them.""

His understanding of justice and moral courage provides a lens through which he approaches real-world politics, shaping the decisions that have defined his short but impressive political career. Talarico is a relative newcomer to politics. He was elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 2018 and recently entered the U.S. Senate Democratic primary against a better-known candidate.

He attracted national attention earlier this year by leading the debate against a bill that required Texas public schools to display the Ten Commandments in classrooms. Talarico argued that the bill was not only unconstitutional and un-American but also ""deeply un-Christian."" He pointed out that the bill imposed one religious tradition over others, violating the principle of religious freedom. The bill eventually passed, but Talarico's calm, thoughtful arguments impressed people on both sides of the aisle, leading to some notable media attention.

In July, his message found a national platform on the popular Joe Rogan podcast. During that two-and-a-half-hour conversation, which has received over 1 million views so far, Talarico impressively discussed a wide range of political, religious and historical issues.

Talarico said that ""this idea that there is a set Christian orthodoxy on the issue of abortion is just not rooted in Scripture."" But he welcomed ""honest debate."" He said that if Pope Francis were to come back to life and express his pro-life, anti-abortion stance, Talarico would listen to and respect the pope's theological argument. Ultimately, Talarico said that he wanted pro-choice Christians who respect women's bodily autonomy to be given the space to make their theological arguments.

From memory, Talarico quoted Catholic Worker Movement co-founder Dorothy Day: ""You really only love God as much as you love the person you love the least."" Rogan told Talarico that he's the type of good person who should be in public office — and concluded that the Texan should run for president.

The Rogan conversation revealed Talarico's intellectual range. Then, in August, his appearance on Chris Cuomo's podcast clarified his political philosophy more precisely.

Talarico described himself as theologically conservative and politically progressive. ""That's the long-term bet I'm making,"" he said. ""That love and compassion are going to win in the long run."" Cuomo likened Talarico to his late father, former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, the last nationally prominent Catholic to openly discuss how religious faith influences public service.

Talarico's approach demonstrates that faith can drive politics without weaponizing it — a model that feels both urgent and overdue in our current moment. His vision stands in stark contrast to the rhetoric on display at Charlie Kirk's memorial service, where President Donald Trump declared: ""I hate my opponent, and I don't want the best for them.""

Where Trump and the Christian nationalist movement frame politics as spiritual warfare, demanding the defeat of enemies, Talarico invites Americans into a Christian tradition that sees the sacred in every person and justice as an expression of love.

Whether his Senate bid succeeds or not, his message represents the potential for transformative realignment. He's showing Democrats how to reclaim a moral vocabulary without compromising pluralism.

And he's reminding Christians that our tradition offers a pathway for healing rather than deepening our national divisions.",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-10/Election_2026_Texas_Senate_Redistricting_25228782289806.jpg?h=8b9c984c&itok=CZrsXNxG,N,,2025-10-07 12:07:55.935669

What Happened? On October 3, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a proposed rule providing regulatory relief from certain requirements of the Agency’s 2023 Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) Technology Transitions Rule (TTR), which implements subsection (i) of the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act of 2020 (AIM Act), 42 U.S.C. § 7675(i). The proposed rule addresses topics raised in four administrative petitions and other stakeholder requests regarding specific regulatory requirements. The proposed relief includes extended compliance dates and more lenient global warming potential (GWP) thresholds for acceptable refrigerants.

Who Is Affected? The proposed rule potentially affects manufacturers, importers, and users of residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump systems, retail food refrigeration equipment for remote condensing units and supermarkets, chillers and industrial process refrigeration equipment used in semiconductor manufacturing, refrigerated transport intermodal containers, refrigeration systems in cold storage warehouses, refrigerated laboratory centrifuges and refrigerated laboratory shakers, and condensing units used for residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pumps.

What Should You Do? Stakeholders affected by the proposed rule should carefully review the proposal and consider submitting comments to the docket (Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0005). Comments are due on or before November 17, 2025.

Key Elements of the Proposed Rule

Retail Food Refrigeration – Remote Condensing Unit Systems and Supermarket Systems. The 2023 TTR established restrictions on the use of HFCs in new remote condensing unit systems (starting January 1, 2026) and new supermarket systems (January 1, 2027). The GWP limit in the 2023 TTR is 150 for systems with refrigerant charge capacities greater than or equal to 200 pounds, and 300 for systems with refrigerant charge capacities less than 200 pounds or for the high temperature side of cascade systems, irrespective of the total charge capacity.

Food retailers and a trade association raised concerns about the limited number and types of refrigerant substitutes that EPA had previously determined would be available for use in remote condensing unit systems and supermarket systems by the respective January 1, 2026, and 2027 compliance dates. As a result of these concerns, EPA proposes an interim GWP limit of 1,400 starting January 1, 2026, for new remote condensing units and starting January 1, 2027, for new supermarket systems. Starting January 1, 2032, the GWP limit for remote condensing units and supermarket systems would revert to 150 or 300, depending on the system. EPA did not propose changes to the 150 GWP limit for systems with a refrigerant charge of200 pounds or more, nor to the 300 GWP limit for systems with a refrigerant charge of less than 200 pounds or for the high-temperature side of a cascade system.

EPA also requests comment on whether the expansion of cooling capacity in BTU/hour (e.g., 25 percent) would be allowable during a remodel of a supermarket system without triggering the requirements at 40 C.F.R. § 84.54(e). EPA is requesting comment to address stakeholder concerns that 40 C.F.R. § 84.54(e)(2) and (3) may result in supermarkets having to replace legacy systems before the end of their useful life.

Chillers and Industrial Process Refrigeration Equipment Used in Semiconductor Manufacturing. EPA proposes extending the compliance date for certain chillers used for industrial process refrigeration (IPR) and certain IPR equipment used to manufacture semiconductors (i.e., semiconductor manufacturing and related equipment or SMRE) with charge sizes of 100 pounds or less from January 1, 2026, or January 1, 2028, as applicable, to January 1, 2030. SEMI, the global trade association for the semiconductor supply chain, challenged the 2023 TTR and petitioned EPA to reconsider the compliance dates that affect SMRE for the IPR and chillers for IPR subsectors. (Beveridge & Diamond represents SEMI in challenging the rule and petitioning for administrative reconsideration.)

In addition to delaying the compliance dates, EPA stated that it “understands that IPR and Chillers for IPR used in the semiconductor manufacturing industry may operate at one temperature while being designed to reach lower temperatures” and that “the lowest temperature at which equipment is designed to operate determines whether it is subject to use restrictions.” EPA requests comment on the charge size threshold applicable to SMRE and whether to exempt SMRE from 40 C.F.R. § 84.54, although EPA notes that it is not proposing to exempt this equipment.

Refrigerated Transport – Intermodal Containers. In response to a petition from an intermodal container manufacturer, EPA proposes adjusting the lower bound temperature exclusion threshold of -50 °C to -35 °C, and changing the location where that temperature is measured from the temperature of the refrigerant entering the evaporator (for direct heat exchange systems) or the temperature of the fluid exiting (for chillers) to the “box temperature.” In addition, the petitioner requested that EPA clarify that the temperature measurement be based on the lowest temperature at which the equipment is “designed to reach and maintain.” EPA clarified this means that if a refrigerated transport intermodal container has the capacity to achieve a box temperature below -35 °C, it would not be subject to the TTR restrictions even if at times the container is operated at temperatures at or above -35 °C.

Other Aspects of the Proposal

Condensing Units – Residential and Light Commercial Air Conditioning and Heat Pump Subsector. EPA proposes to retain current requirements regarding the treatment of certain condensing units used in air conditioning and heat pump systems in the residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump subsector.

Cold Storage Warehouses. EPA proposes to adjust the GWP threshold for cold storage warehouses from 150 or 300, as applicable, to 700 starting January 1, 2026, with a later adjustment to the GWP threshold of either 150 or 300, depending on charge size or whether it is part of the high temperature side of a cascade system, starting January 1, 2032.

Industrial Process Refrigeration in Certain Laboratory Equipment. EPA proposes extending the compliance date to January 1, 2028, for refrigerated centrifuges and refrigerated laboratory shakers within the IPR sector.

Compliance Date Extension for Residential and Light Commercial Air Conditioning and Heat Pump Systems. To address concerns about supply chain issues related to R-454B, EPA proposes to remove the installation deadline for residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump systems, provided that specified components of such systems were manufactured or imported prior to January 1, 2025.

Additional Topics on Which EPA Seeks Comment:

Data about which refrigerants are being considered or adopted in new refrigeration equipment for remote condensing units, supermarket systems, and cold storage warehouses;

Data about the commercial availability and timeline for adoption of new refrigeration equipment using lower-GWP substitutes in remote condensing units, supermarket systems, and cold storage warehouses, as it relates to the proposed 2032 compliance dates for these subsectors;

Data about costs and savings resulting from the extension of compliance timelines for manufacturers and servicing companies, which are investing in U.S. production of new raw materials, refrigerants, equipment, and other technologies, intended to support companies’ transition and compliance, across the subsectors in this rule;

The proposed removal of the installation compliance date for residential and light commercial air conditioning systems, as well as whether an extension of the installation compliance date by one or more years would be appropriate, noting that EPA does not have information about the extent of equipment that may remain in inventory as of January 1, 2026, and account for any significant reliance interests in the final action as well as any significant reliance interests that should be accounted for in any final action; and

Information and data that may be used to inform future actions that could be taken by EPA or other parts of the federal government to address R-454B supply challenges.",https://www.bdlaw.com/content/uploads/2025/10/iStock-1328050223-default-social-share-social-sharing-image-23107.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 13:04:15.450727

Scientific Consensus Grows Stronger Scientific support for the 2009 finding has not weakened.
In Sept., the National Academies of Sciences released a fast-track review reaffirming that human-caused greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health, welfare, and climate stability.","NEW ORLEANS – Louisiana State Treasurer John Fleming has joined a coalition of state financial officers that are part of a national conservative movement supporting the Environmental Protection Agency’s July 29 decision to rescind the 2009 Greenhouse Gas Endangerment Finding, a landmark climate ruling adopted after extensive scientific research concluded that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases harm human health and the environment. The rule had given the federal government authority to regulate those emissions under the Clean Air Act.

The group, which includes 12 members of the State Financial Officers Foundation and four researchers from the American Institute for Economic Research, argues that the rule has imposed costly and unnecessary regulations on manufacturers and consumers while overstepping the EPA’s legal authority.

The 2009 finding gave the agency the power to set national vehicle-emission standards and other limits on greenhouse gases. Environmental groups have credited the policy with driving cleaner technologies and helping the U.S. reduce emissions, but opponents say it unnecessarily expanded federal reach. Fleming and his colleagues said the decision “triggered a wave of regulatory expansion without sufficient congressional oversight. It has imposed significant costs on consumers and manufacturers while failing to demonstrate meaningful environmental benefits.”

Economic Framing by State Financial Officers

Although the Endangerment Finding is an environmental and public-health determination, members of the State Financial Officers Foundation say the resulting regulations carry major financial consequences for state economies. The group contends that stricter federal climate rules increase production and energy costs, affecting industries, tax revenues, and public investment portfolios.

By weighing in, state treasurers argue they are defending fiscal stability and consumer affordability, not simply taking an environmental position. Critics, however, say the foundation’s members are stretching their role as financial stewards to advance a political agenda against climate action.

National Debate Over the EPA Proposal

On July 29, the Environmental Protection Agency formally rescinded the 2009 Greenhouse Gas Endangerment Finding, ending the agency’s determination that greenhouse gas emissions harm human health and the environment.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the change would lift what he called “hidden taxes” on businesses and consumers, while environmental and public health groups warned the move would gut the federal government’s ability to regulate climate pollution.

Following the announcement, scientists and advocacy organizations denounced the decision as a direct challenge to the Supreme Court’s 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA ruling, which held that greenhouse gases qualify as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. Environmental groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council, vowed to challenge the rollback in court, arguing that the EPA is legally obligated to regulate pollutants that endanger public health.

Scientific Consensus Grows Stronger

Scientific support for the 2009 finding has not weakened. If anything, it has grown stronger. Yet Fleming, a medical doctor, is challenging the scientific evidence linking greenhouse gases to serious risks for human health and the environment.

In Sept., the National Academies of Sciences released a fast-track review reaffirming that human-caused greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health, welfare, and climate stability. The report concluded that the 2009 finding “was accurate, has stood the test of time, and is now reinforced by even stronger evidence.” It noted that research since 2009 has expanded observational records and identified new health impacts linked to rising temperatures and pollution.

The National Academies’ report detailed a range of threats tied to greenhouse-gas-driven climate change, including increased heat-related illness and mortality, degraded air quality from ozone and particulate pollution, and more frequent floods and wildfires. The authors said evidence of harm has deepened across nearly every measure, and that “new evidence is developing about additional health impacts of climate-related exposures” not yet recognized in 2009.

That conclusion directly challenges claims by proponents of repeal who argue that current science is weaker or more uncertain than it was in 2009. Major research institutions, including the U.S. National Climate Assessment and international medical journals such as The Lancet, have likewise found that climate change is already contributing to worsening air quality, expanding disease risk, and causing thousands of premature deaths in the United States each year.

Federal Limits and State Authority

The push comes as recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have placed new limits on federal agencies, requiring clearer congressional authorization for major regulatory actions. Fleming said those decisions strengthen the case for revisiting the EPA’s climate authority.

“Revoking the 2009 Greenhouse Gas Endangerment Finding will be a constructive move toward restoring a more balanced federal approach, one that aligns with the principles of competitive federalism,” Fleming said in a statement. “This shift will empower states to lead with innovative, tailored solutions to energy and climate challenges, fostering healthy competition among state governments and returning federal policy to its rightful, limited role.”

The State Financial Officers Foundation

The State Financial Officers Foundation is a nonprofit alliance of Republican state treasurers, auditors, and comptrollers that advocates for what it calls “free-market” financial and energy policies.

Based in Kansas, the group has become a key player in national conservative efforts to challenge federal regulations and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment standards. Its members say they seek to protect taxpayers and promote fiscal responsibility, while critics describe the foundation as part of a broader political push to roll back climate and corporate accountability measures.",https://assets-bizneworleans-com.s3.amazonaws.com/2025/10/State-Treasurer-Supports-Roll-Back-of-EPA-Climate-Regulations.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 13:04:20.948285

About College of Lake County","College of Lake County, in partnership with Lake County Workforce Development and The Community Works, recently announced the successful completion of the Energy Auditor Program by four participants through the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA) Workforce Hub, a grant administered through the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity.

This achievement marks an important step in preparing Lake County residents for in-demand careers in clean energy.

The Energy Auditor Program equips participants with the technical skills and credentials necessary to assess energy use, recommend efficiency improvements, and support homeowners and businesses in reducing costs and environmental impact.

Graduates of this program are positioned to enter a growing sector where clean energy jobs are projected to increase significantly over the next decade.

In addition to completing the program, all four graduates earned three nationally recognized Building Performance Institute (BPI) credentials: the Building Science Principles (BSP), Building Analyst Technician (BA-T), and Building Analyst Professional (BA-P).

These industry-standard certifications validate their knowledge of building science, energy efficiency, and home performance testing, positioning them as highly qualified professionals ready to enter the clean energy workforce.

The inaugural class of graduates includes: Udell Rogers, Christopher Berry, Justin Ortiz, and Mykhalio Perevalov. Each completer demonstrated persistence and commitment throughout the rigorous training program, guided by Lon Turner, lead instructor for Energy Auditing.

“These four graduates represent the promise of CEJA — empowering individuals with skills that create both career opportunity and community impact,” said Emily Echevarria, manager of workforce initiatives. “With the strong support of Lake County Workforce Development and The Community Works, these participants gained the training and wrap-around services they needed to succeed.”

The CEJA Workforce Hub, based at CLC’s Lakeshore Campus in Waukegan, provides a pathway for residents to access training, barrier-reduction support services, and career connections in clean energy industries such as EV Automotive, HVAC, and building and home inspection. The Energy Auditor Program is one of several specialized training opportunities offered through the Hub.

Graduates celebrated their achievement alongside family members, trainers, staff, and community partners at a recent recognition event. Local utilities and employers — including Nicor Gas, People’s Gas, North Shore Gas, and other clean energy stakeholders — attended to connect with completers and discuss employment opportunities.

This milestone underscores the Hub’s mission, shared by CLC, Lake County Workforce Development, and The Community Works, to ensure that Lake County residents have access to the skills and careers that will drive the future of energy.

Mercedes’ new platform supports EVs and internal combustion.

BMW is ditching bloated grilles for a slim look with its iX3 EV.

Electric vehicle developments from German automakers made news at Europe’s first auto shows of the fall.

Mercedes and BMW teased new architectures that will spin off multiple vehicles, Porsche embraced a new charging technology, VW showed four very small vehicles and Audi revealed its new face at Germany’s IAA show, now held in Munich after decades in Frankfurt.

Two new Mercedes EVs coming to USA

After initially saddling its EVs with confusing names like EQE sedan and EQE SUV, Mercedes is moving its electric vehicles to familiar model names.

The Mercedes-Benz’s compact GLC SUV and CLA sedan inaugurate the change with varying levels of grace.

Both vehicles offer 800-volt/350 kWh fast-charging capability to shorten stops. Arriving in the U.S. later this year, the CLA has a two-speed automatic transmission. Most EVs thus far operate with single-speed transmissions. Mercedes says its unit “combines dynamic performance with high efficiency for all driving situations.”

The sleek CLA will launch as an EV, with a hybrid coming for the 2027 model year.

The CLA EVs are identified by “with EQ technology” badging, proving Mercedes isn’t done with clumsy EV designations yet: The CLA 250+ with technology and all-wheel drive CLA 350 4Matic with EQ technology.

What I’d give to be Mercedes’s chrome supplier.

The SUV ― likely to sell better, because, America ― is simply called GLC.

Arriving in the second half of 2026, the GLC SUV will tow 5,291 pounds and offer features including adaptive air suspension and four-wheel steering .

Porsche embraces wireless EV charging

Porsche has backed away from its schedule to cease using internal combustion engines, but the company’s march to electrification continues.

The electrically powered turbocharger that lit up the 911 GTS earlier this year does double duty in the 911 Turbo S twin-turbo, which accelerates to 60 mph in 2.4 seconds, reaches 124 mph in 8.4 seconds and tops out at 200 mph. The all-wheel drive Turbo S develops 701 hp.

For its purely electric vehicles, Porsche is adding wireless charging.

The system debuts in Europe next year. Other regions will get it later.

Porsche says its “one box” design eliminates the wall unit common to Level 2 240 volt home chargers.

The system will debut on the electric Cayenne, which will be shown later in 2025.

BMW ‘new class’ to underpin dozens of vehicles

Arriving in U.S. dealerships in 2026, BMW’s iX3 electric SUV is the first of what BMW promises “nearly 40 new models and model updates arriving between now and 2027” using the architecture and technologies in its Neue Klasse, or new class, engineering program.

The iX3 features a welcome departure from the cartoonishly inflated grilles on recent BMWs. The slimmed down double kidney grille gets optional lighting and returns to the vertical orientation BMW used in the 1960s and ‘70s.

At 188.3 inches, the iX3 is about an inch longer than the current X3.

Notable features include 800 volt charging that can accommodate even high levels for brief peaks. BMW promises up to 175 miles range in 10 minutes and 10%-80% charging as quick as 21 minutes.

Also of note:

Standard 20-inch wheels

Full-width, Lincoln Navigator-style instrument display

Touch screen controls

All-wheel drive

Up to 463 hp and 476 pound-feet of torque

48.1/51.6 front/rear weight distribution

Estimated 4.7 seconds 0-60 mph

Production begins in Debrecen, Hungary, early next year.

VW’s shows 4 very small EVs

Volkswagen pulled out all the stops with four small EVs slated for production starting in 2026. All are likely too small for U.S. sale.

For instance, the ID Cross SUV — at first glance the concept best suited to American tastes — is just 163.8 inches long.

That’s 15 inches shorter than the subcompact Chevrolet Trax, eight inches shorter than a Nissan Kicks.

The ID Cross uses a single electric motor for front-wheel drive and has a top speed of 108 mph, but it can tow more that 2,600 pounds up an 8% grade.

VW’s other EV concepts were a pair of subcompact cars, including one with bearing the popular GTI performance badge, and the “entry-level” ID Every1. The Every1 appears to be even smaller than the subcompact ID Polo and ID Polo GTI.

That's the good news.

The bad news is that Rivian narrowed its vehicle delivery guidance for the year, the electric vehicle industry just had its federal tax credits axed, and the company reported a gross loss again in the most recent quarter.

To say Rivian's challenges are increasing would be an understatement. Here's why Rivian stock likely won't make you a millionaire anytime soon.

Rivian's slow but steady progress

They say it's always best to start with the good news, so here's what Rivian has going for it right now, starting with the company's upcoming cheaper models. Rivian will begin selling its smaller R2 SUV next year and R3 crossover in 2027. The former will start at just $45,000 while the latter has an estimated price tag of around $40,000.

Those are important price points because they're below the average price of a new EV, which is currently around $57,000. Potential EV buyers often cite cost as a concern when considering an electric vehicle, and for EVs to gain ground in the market, their prices need to come down. You can't buy a new Rivian vehicle for less than $71,000 right now, so the upcoming lower-priced models could potentially spark interest among more budget-conscious buyers.

What's more, Rivian has proved that it can run an efficient EV business after reporting two consecutive quarters of positive gross profit. Management set a goal to achieve that, and it did so, in part, by retooling and reengineering its manufacturing process last year -- cutting up to 35% in material costs for some vehicles. Achieving that goal also unlocked $1 billion in additional funding from its partner, Volkswagen, which was another win for Rivian.

Unfortunately, even after notching these wins, Rivian is still in uncharted territory.

The road to success is long, winding, and uncertain

Despite Rivian's successes and its pipeline of new models, the company is facing an arduous path. First, the federal government ending the EV tax credits is a blow to the industry. Rivian's vehicles didn't qualify for the credit because they're too expensive, but the company was able to take advantage of a leasing loophole that helped lower costs for some customers.

Making matters worse for Rivian is that after two consecutive quarters of positive gross profit, the company slipped back into the red in the second quarter. That may not have been such a big deal if everything else was humming along for the company, but it came just ahead of Rivian's management narrowing its full-year vehicle guidance.

Rivian now expects deliveries between 41,500 to 43,500 -- lower than its previous midpoint guidance by about 500 vehicles. That's the company's second revision this year. When Rivian started its production year, it first estimated deliveries of up to 51,000.

What's especially disappointing is that deliveries for Q3 were actually up by 32% from the year-ago quarter, but the company's revised full-year delivery guidance was adjusted down, likely due to the federal tax incentives being eliminated and tariff uncertainty. While some of the delivery increases were likely due to customers signing up for leases before the tax credits expired, there's no getting around the fact that the current 2025 estimates are nearly 18% lower than 2024's deliveries.

Is Rivian a millionaire maker?

For the reasons listed above, I don't think Rivian stock is a millionaire maker. I have a small position in Rivian, and I'm willing to wait out this rough patch to see what happens with the company, but expecting Rivian stock to mint millionaires doesn't look like a good bet.

That doesn't mean Rivian isn't a good company or won't be a good long-term investment, but investors should know that the EV industry is facing significant headwinds and Rivian will likely face more hurdles ahead as it tries to build its EV future.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/836210/r1s_woods.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 09:59:18.125289

Rivian founder and CEO R.J Scaringe, who has been called the “anti-Elon” by some, is excited to launch the electric vehicle manufacturer’s more affordable R2, which he calls “insanely good.”

“I've never been more confident in the company than I am today,” Scaringe said during an Automotive Press Association event at the company's development, prototyping and testing facility in Plymouth Township, Michigan.

He’s not concerned about the disappearance of the federal EV tax credit and he says he’s aligned with the Trump administration, which is advocating for more U.S. production.

Rivian assembles all its vehicles in Normal, Illinois, is building a plant in Georgia, and will source batteries for R2 from Arizona after LG Energy Solution launches production there in mid-2026.

The Rivian R2 remains on track for a $45,000 starting price -- lower than the average -- with production beginning in the first half of 2026.

“The R2 isn't just a great EV, it's an incredible vehicle,” he says. “It offers acceleration; it’s like a sports car that can go off-road.”

Scaringe predicts about two-thirds of customers will elect to buy the R2 rather than lease it, and that two-thirds of the vehicles cross-shopped with the R2 will not be EVs.

“I'm highly biased, but I can't imagine not buying this,” Scaringe says. “For the longest time, the electrified space, there's been a singular set of great choices. There's been the Tesla Model Y and Tesla Model 3. They are great cars. They're highly compelling. They're well executed. But it's remarkable that they've maintained such extraordinary market share that they control about 50% of the sales in the United States.”

While many of the automaker’s employees have shifted to its California facilities, Rivian still has about 1,000 employees in Michigan.

The historic space, designed by noted industrial architect Albert Kahn, includes a call center for customers to access experts, vehicle testing, virtual reality manufacturing station layout review and 3D printing for prototype parts and tools.

After the Q&A with Scaringe, media members were invited on a tour and given a 3D printed plastic R2 model, which they said took about 20 minutes to print (see photo below.) The building has a very Rivian vibe, including a neon sign that reads “Of all the paths you take in life, make sure a few are dirt.”

Scaringe, who knew at age 10 he wanted to start a car company, is a serious environmentalist -- and the building reflects that. There are trash containers throughout that offer the choice of compost, mixed recycling or landfill. The continental breakfast served before the talk was served on compostable dinnerware.

Speaking to BBC North East & Cumbria, she said: “They are destroying more jobs than they are creating. We are bankrupting our economy. Oil and gas is disappearing, manufacturing is disappearing.”

Badenoch argued that current net zero targets were driving businesses abroad due to high energy costs. “I’ve heard businesses all around the country say we can’t afford the energy prices here and it is because of a lot of the decisions we are taking on net zero,” she said.

Her comments drew criticism from industry and opposition parties.

Energy UK, which represents most power generators and suppliers, warned the move would damage investor confidence.

Chief Executive Elon Musk for years has promised mass market vehicles, though last year he canceled plans to build an all-new $25,000 EV, Reuters first reported. The car expected this week is an ""affordable"" vehicle based on current manufacturing and design platforms.

Tesla posted two clips on X over the weekend, igniting excitement among Tesla fans. One video shows headlights peering out of the dark and another shows what looks like a wheel spinning for a few seconds, followed by ""10/7"", the US format for the date October 7.

Neither Tesla nor influencers have indicated that an in-person event is in the works, in contrast to previous major Tesla launches. Still, analysts, investors and fans expect the company to make some kind of announcement.

Major questions include the car's price, driving range and efforts to strip down costs. Late last year, Musk said the vehicle would be priced below the ""key threshold"" of $30,000 including US EV tax credits.

In the United States, prices effectively rose by $7,500 at the end of last month, when the credit ended. That helped goose quarterly sales to a record, but expectations are that they will slow down for the rest of the year, unless the affordable car comes to the rescue.

""The desire to buy the car is very high. (It's) just (that) people don't have enough money in the bank account to buy it,"" Musk said in July during Tesla's second-quarter earnings call. ""So the more affordable we can make the car, the better.""

Musk initially promised that production of the vehicle would start by the end of June. But Tesla only made what it called ""first builds"" of the car, it said in July, adding that it would be available for customers sometime in the last three months of the year.

Tesla has already been grappling with slowing sales of its aging lineup as competition has grown rapidly, especially in China and Europe, where Musk's far-right political views also have undermined brand loyalty.

Earlier this year, Tesla launched a refreshed version of the Model Y with improvements including new light bars and a rear touchscreen.

Musk has been pivoting the company toward artificial intelligence, focusing on robotaxis and humanoid robots. Tesla has said it will launch more affordable vehicles in its lineup but has not provided details. Sources have told Reuters the EV maker also plans to roll out a stripped down version of its Model 3 midsize sedan.

Affordable cars will also be key to Tesla delivering 20 million vehicles over the next decade - one of the several operational and valuation milestones set by the company's board as part of its proposed $1 pay package for Musk.",https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/11745384252-0/11745384252-0-640x480.webp,N,,2025-10-07 12:06:20.534040

""So, this clean energy growth is really cleaning up other sectors.""
Clean energy expert Mark Jacobson is a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, where he directs the Atmosphere and Energy Program.
He used two leading clean energy states in the U.S., California and Texas, as an example of what's possible through efficiency.","The first half of 2025 brought a small but potentially significant tipping point in the global energy system, according to the independent clean energy research group Ember.

""Clean sources grew more than demand and therefore they displaced some fossil fuels,"" Ember's Senior Electricity Analyst Małgorzata Wiatros-Motyka told Newsweek.

The remarkable growth in clean energy has, until now, been more about energy addition than energy transition, as the global growth in demand used up both the power from fossil fuels and new renewable sources.

In the first six months of this year, however, that appears to have shifted in what Wiatros-Motyka called ""the first signs of a crucial turning point"" where clean power is keeping pace with demand growth and beginning to muscle out fossil fuels.

""For the first time ever, we saw renewables overtaking coal generation globally,"" Wiatros-Motyka said.

Solar power alone met more than 80 percent of new electricity demand, she said, as solar deployment soared and prices for solar equipment continued to decline.

The Ember research found that fossil fuel generation fell in both China and India.

China is both the world's biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions and by far the world's clean energy leader. China added more solar and wind than the rest of the world combined, Ember found, and its fossil generation dropped by 2 percent compared to the previous year.

In India, renewable energy sources grew more than three times bigger than the country's growth in power demand in the first half of the year.

In the U.S. and the E.U., however, clean power growth did not keep up with power demand and fossil generation ticked upward. In the E.U., the report found, countries relied on more gas and coal power as the output from wind and hydro sources dipped.

""So, emerging markets are leading the way at the moment,"" Wiatros-Motyka said.

The Ember report covers only the global electricity sector, and no other energy uses such as transportation and industry where fossil fuels still dominate. However, Wiatros-Motyka pointed out, electricity is becoming a bigger part of the total energy picture with the rapid rise of EVs, the wider adoption of heat pumps and battery energy storage.

""We have electrification of a number of sectors now,"" she said. ""So, this clean energy growth is really cleaning up other sectors.""

Sam Kimmins, director of energy at the nonprofit Climate Group, told Newsweek via email that Ember's work ""highlights a new milestone"" in the economics of clean energy as companies demand the cheaper, faster power that renewables offer.

""Their purchasing power and influence is re-making the energy system,"" Kimmins said. ""Governments risk losing business to more competitive markets if they fail to act quickly to improve access to renewables.""

Brendan Pierpont directs electricity modeling at the independent energy think tank Energy Innovation. Pierpont said the growth of wind and solar globally shows that these are the ""cheapest sources of new electrons"" and are quickly becoming more competitive with coal and gas.

""Global renewable energy deployment keeps exceeding our expectations,"" Pierpont told Newsweek, as actual measures of wind and solar deployment outdo the forecasts from major monitoring organizations like the International Energy Agency.

""It's getting cheaper and easier to integrate these resources on grids as the cost of complementary resources like energy storage also falls in tandem,"" he said.

Clean energy expert Mark Jacobson is a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, where he directs the Atmosphere and Energy Program. Jacobson told Newsweek via email that Ember research is ""positive news,"" but said he is not quite ready to declare a turning point in the energy transition until he sees a sustained trend in which ""fossil fuel use continues to drop while renewables rise over a two-year period.""

Jacobson said the Ember research also points to the potential gains from rooftop solar and energy efficiency improvements to further blunt demand for electricity from the grid.

He used two leading clean energy states in the U.S., California and Texas, as an example of what's possible through efficiency. While both states have added enormous amounts of wind, solar and battery storage, ""the average person in California uses 40 percent of the electricity as the average person in Texas"" due to energy efficiency measures for buildings and appliances, he said.

Jacobson said the U.S. could match or exceed the drop in fossil generation that China saw in the first half of this year if it pursued a more aggressive development of renewable energy. However, he said, the Trump administration's energy strategy is moving in the other direction, encouraging more use of gas and coal.

""The challenge is that the U.S. has now embarked on a policy to stop renewable growth and increase fossil fuel growth,"" Jacobson said, ""potentially slowing the world's efforts to reach a real turning point in the energy transition.""

Wiatros-Motyka said Ember's data indicates that the clean transition is ""unstoppable"" and the trend of fossil fuel displacement will continue.

""More than half the world's economies are already past the peak of fossil fuels,"" she said. ""So, there is no turning back now, I believe, from this moment.""",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2729096/clean-energy-growth-illustration.png,N,,2025-10-07 12:08:39.983564

Together, these universities represent one of the most research-intensive coalitions in the nation, uniquely positioned to address the complex challenges at the intersection of environment, economy, and community.

This year, RU4M launched the Liveable Futures Initiative, a platform designed to catalyze collaborative, cross-disciplinary research that helps Michigan communities thrive in the face of climate change, flooding, pollution, and other sustainability challenges. The initiative fosters partnerships, funds seed projects, and accelerates innovation aimed at making Michigan — and the Great Lakes region — a global hub for sustainable solutions.

As a sponsor of the Sustainable Urban Design Summit (SUDS), RU4M is amplifying this mission, bringing academic research into conversation with practitioners, policymakers, and community leaders. Detroitisit spoke with Dr. Britany Affolter-Caine, executive director of RU4M, and Vince Nystrom, program director, about the power of collaboration, the role of research universities in Michigan’s sustainability journey, and the opportunities ahead.

REGISTER FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN DESIGN SUMMIT 2025 , NOV, 6 AT NEWLAB DETROIT HERE.

How does RU4M’s collaborative model strengthen Michigan’s ability to tackle complex issues like climate resilience and sustainability?

Britany Affolter-Caine: Michigan is fortunate to have four of the nation’s highest-intensity research universities, and not every state can say that. Each brings deep expertise, but when we connect them, align agendas, and foster collaboration, the impact multiplies. Sustainability challenges — from climate change to clean water access — are too big for any single institution to solve alone.

That’s why we launched the Liveable Futures Initiative. It’s designed to seed and support collaborative research across institutions that directly addresses the issues shaping Michigan’s future: flooding, water quality, microplastics, algae blooms, and infrastructure resilience. It’s about creating solutions that make this state not just livable, but thriving, for generations to come.

How do you align the unique strengths of Michigan State, Michigan Tech, the University of Michigan, and Wayne State toward common goals?

Vince Nystrom: We start by mapping the research landscape in detail — tracking projects, funding, and outputs across institutions. Over the last five years, these universities have generated more than a billion dollars in sustainability research. By aggregating that data, we can see where expertise already overlaps and where it can be complementary.

For example, some universities are deeply invested in hydrogen research as a clean energy source, while others focus on water infrastructure or materials science. RU4M’s role is to connect these dots, highlight opportunities for collaboration, and make sure the state and industry partners know how to tap into this expertise when real-world challenges arise.

There’s often tension between environmental stewardship and economic growth. How does RU4M view this balance?

Affolter-Caine: For us, it’s not “either/or” — it’s the power of and. Sustainability and economic growth can reinforce one another if approached strategically. Take mobility: when new facilities are being built, like the Los Alamos-linked AI center in Ypsilanti Township, the conversation isn’t just about technology. It’s also about environmental standards, community impact, and long-term resilience.

Nystrom: At the research level, we see this duality all the time. Michigan State is testing bioreactors to reduce farm runoff. Michigan Tech is advancing natural resource management alongside engineering solutions. These projects protect the environment while building new industries, jobs, and opportunities.

Water is central to Michigan’s identity. What do you see as the most pressing water-related challenges, and how are universities helping address them?

Affolter-Caine: Flooding is a major one. Detroit has seen catastrophic flooding in recent years, and the Midland dam failure was another wake-up call. We need smarter infrastructure and policy solutions, and our universities are leading research on both fronts.

Microplastics are another urgent issue. Bills are moving through the Michigan Senate right now, and researchers are at the table providing science-based guidance. That’s where our role is so critical — connecting cutting-edge science with policy and practice.

Nystrom: Beyond urban flooding and water quality, there’s also a huge economic and ecological dimension. From rebuilding the Soo Locks to protecting outdoor recreation, water drives both industry and community life here. Universities are advancing technologies for oil spill prevention, fresh water protection, and agricultural water efficiency.

From your vantage point, what role will AI and advanced manufacturing play in tackling sustainability challenges?

Britany Affolter-Caine: AI is one of our verticals, and we’re seeing it play two roles. On the one hand, researchers are advancing AI itself as a technology. On the other, more and more teams are using AI as a tool to accelerate their own work. For example, when we faced the challenge of PFAS contamination, AI helped identify and map the many different compounds — short- and long-chain variants — much faster than traditional methods. That kind of pattern recognition and data processing makes it possible to reach solutions more quickly.

Vince Nystrom: What’s powerful about AI is that it operates both as a standalone sector and as an enabler across every other sector. Whether it’s mobility, clean energy, or water, AI is being embedded into research and development as a force multiplier. Advanced manufacturing works in much the same way — it provides the tools and methods that make scaling these innovations possible.

How are students being prepared to enter careers at this intersection of science, sustainability, and economic development?

Affolter-Caine: RU4M acts as a conduit, ensuring industry needs are reflected in university programs. We ask employers what skills they’re looking for, feed that information back into curricula, and track how students are graduating into these critical fields.

Nystrom: The entrepreneurial piece is also growing. Each university has accelerators, incubators, and programs that encourage students to build their own ventures. We’ve already seen spinouts ranging from advanced materials to clean-tech startups. In fact, one in five of our alumni become entrepreneurs — and many are now tackling sustainability challenges directly.

When you look ahead, where can Michigan lead most strongly in the global sustainability conversation?

Affolter-Caine: Water is where we have unmatched potential. Few regions in the world can rival Michigan’s freshwater resources or the scale of expertise we’ve built around them. At the same time, energy storage and clean mobility will be critical. But water innovation — quality, management, resilience — is where we can truly lead.

Nystrom: Michigan gets called the “Saudi Arabia of water.” That abundance comes with responsibility. If we manage it wisely, Michigan can set the standard globally for how water is protected, leveraged, and sustained for both economy and environment.",https://detroitisit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-09-30-at-9.12.54-AM-1024x722.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 13:04:33.556476

U.S. light-vehicle sales rose 3.5% year-over-year in September, reaching a 16.4 million SAAR.

BEVs reached a record 11.8% market share as buyers took advantage of expiring tax credits.

Industry forecasts now project 15.9 million total light-vehicle sales for 2025.

New light-vehicle sales in the United States climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of 16.4 million units in September 2025, up 3.5% from a year earlier, as buyers rushed to purchase electric vehicles before the federal EV tax credit expired on September 30. According to the NADA’s September Market Beat report, the strong performance was driven in part by “pull-ahead” demand ahead of the credit deadline.

Battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales reached a record 11.8% of all new vehicles sold, nearly two percentage points higher than in August. BEVs also recorded a 24.1% year-over-year increase in the third quarter and accounted for 8.4% of total new vehicle sales through the first nine months of 2025, up 0.7 percentage points from the same period last year. Plug-in hybrid (PHEV) models, which were also eligible for the federal incentive, maintained a flat 1.7% monthly market share and 1.8% year-to-date share.

Analysts said the strong September performance reflected consumers rushing to take advantage of the final days of the tax credit. The surge helped offset slowing growth earlier in the quarter as automakers faced tariff pressures and rising production costs.

According to J.D. Power, average incentive spending per new vehicle rose slightly from August to $3,116, with more funds directed toward EVs. Incentive spending represented 6.1% of the average vehicle’s sticker price, compared with 4.8% for non-EVs.

Inventory levels also showed modest improvement. Combined dealer and in-transit light-vehicle inventory reached 2.65 million units by the end of September, up 6.2% from August but still 5.9% below the same period last year.

Automakers, including GM, Ford, Toyota, Stellantis, Honda, and Tesla, all gained market share through September, while Nissan and Volkswagen reported declines. Crossovers continued to dominate the market with a 49.2% share, followed by pickups at 18.7%.

Despite ongoing concerns about tariffs and upcoming model-year price hikes, industry analysts remain cautiously optimistic.

“Australian households and small businesses have already embraced rooftop solar in record numbers, with more than 4.2 million having made the switch, and 800,000 of those from Victoria, while large-scale renewable developers are building utility solar at pace,” said Con Hristodoulidis, general manager – distributed energy, Clean Energy Council.

Under the program, a 200kW solar system generating around 600kWh per day could reduce energy costs, improving cash flow for businesses while lowering emissions and operating expenses.

According to Hristodoulidis, the commercial and industrial sector – long seen as the “missing middle” between household and utility-scale renewables – stands to benefit significantly from the initiative. He noted that large rooftops, such as those on warehouses and supermarkets, offer strong potential for solar generation, reducing payback periods and easing energy costs for both businesses and consumers.

In its annual Renewables 2025 report out on Tuesday, the agency slashed its growth forecasts for clean energy capacity extensions by 45% compared to the growth of about 500 gigawatts (GW) expected last year.

“The forecast for the United States is revised down by almost 50%,” the IEA said.

“This reflects several policy changes, including the earlier phase out of federal tax credits, new import restrictions, the suspension of new offshore wind leasing and restricting the permitting of onshore wind and solar PV projects on federal land.”

Last month, the American Clean Power Association’s (ACP) quarterly report showed that the clean power development pipeline showed virtually no growth, expanding by less than 100 MW to 184.5 GW, solar installations slumped by 23% in the first half of 2025, and Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) plummeted. These are “early indicators of federal policy attacks and fluctuating trade policy undermining American energy security and economic growth,” ACP said.

“Federal policy actions from nearly every department and an unstable tariff environment have led to a drop in clean power purchasing and planning for the future—despite skyrocketing demand nationwide,” the association added.

U.S. consultancy Atlas Public Policy has estimated that almost $19 billion worth of wind and solar power generation projects have been canceled since President Trump took office.

The IEA’s expectations for U.S. renewable capacity growth are now aligned with unfavorable policies for clean energy this decade. But the Paris-based agency strongly promoting renewables has also cut its growth projections for global additions and for additions in China, the world’s biggest renewables market.

Growth estimates for the world and in China were revised down by 5% each compared to the 2024 forecast.

“China’s shift from fixed tariffs to auctions is impacting project economics and lowering growth expectations,” the IEA said.

Jim O'Toole, Managing Director of the Port of Mostyn, said: The Ports Prospectus highlights Mostyn's successful track record of working with companies within the offshore wind sector.","That’s the message from the Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Energy and Planning, Rebecca Evans, as she launches the Welsh Government’s Port Prospectus at the Future Energy Wales conference today.

The offshore wind sector is projected to create 29,000 jobs, generate a £4.5 billion economic impact, and power more than four million homes across Wales by 2030. Total offshore wind capacity is forecasted to reach over 20 gigawatts around Wales by 2045.

Located less than 50km from designated development areas in the Celtic Sea, with a coastline that delivers natural deep-water harbours and established supply chains, the Prospectus showcases how Welsh ports are uniquely placed to capitalise on this opportunity.

This is alongside the existing opportunity off the north Wales coastline, where more than 500 wind turbines have already been positioned from the Port of Mostyn, and where Wales is home to the UK’s first fixed bottom offshore wind farm.

Wales’ two Freeports provide investors with tax incentives, streamlined customs processes, and development-ready sites, while a wide range of financial support is available to companies via investment and infrastructure programmes. The Welsh Government is also investing in renewable energy skills across Wales.

Speaking ahead of the Future Energy Wales conference, hosted by RenewableUK Cymru at the ICC Wales in Newport, Rebecca Evans, said:

The UK's clean energy revolution is a generational opportunity to build a cleaner, more prosperous future for our communities whilst delivering the infrastructure Britain needs for energy security.

Wales stands at the heart of the clean energy transition – with a coastline that delivers natural deep-water harbours, proximity to major wind lease zones, and an agile, ready-to-scale supply chain we represent one of Europe’s most strategic locations for offshore wind development.

Our Ports Prospectus outlines how our approach to offshore wind is collaborative, targeted and strategic, ensuring long-term value for investors and communities alike.

Ashley Curnow, Divisional Port Manager for Wales and South West, Associated British Ports, said:

The upcoming model is expected to be based on existing manufacturing and design platforms, making it more accessible without requiring a complete redesign.
Tesla has faced slowing demand for its ageing line-up, while rivals in China and Europe continue to gain ground.
Even so, Tesla reported a rise in sales across several European countries in September.
Earlier this year, the company launched a refreshed Model Y featuring new light bars and a rear touchscreen.","Tesla is expected to unveil a more affordable version of its best-selling Model Y SUV on Tuesday, aiming to reverse declining sales and shrinking market share amid increasing global competition. CEO Elon Musk has long promised mass-market electric vehicles, although plans for a new $25,000 EV were scrapped last year.

The upcoming model is expected to be based on existing manufacturing and design platforms, making it more accessible without requiring a complete redesign.

Over the weekend, Tesla stirred anticipation by posting teaser clips on social media showing headlights and a spinning wheel alongside the date “10/7”, the US format for October 7. Unlike previous major launches, there is no indication of an in-person event, but analysts, investors, and fans are expecting an announcement.

Key details such as price, driving range, and cost-cutting measures remain uncertain. Last year, Musk indicated the vehicle would be priced below $30,000 after US EV tax credits.

Those credits, however, expired at the end of September, effectively raising prices by $7,500 and prompting a temporary boost in sales ahead of the deadline. Analysts expect demand to slow in the months ahead unless Tesla’s new budget-friendly option helps offset the impact.

“The desire to buy the car is very high,” Musk said during Tesla’s second-quarter earnings call in July. “It’s just that people don’t have enough money in the bank account to buy it. So the more affordable we can make the car, the better.”

Musk previously indicated that production would begin by the end of June, but Tesla later clarified that only “first builds” had been completed. The company now expects the new model to reach customers sometime during the final quarter of the year.

Tesla has faced slowing demand for its ageing line-up, while rivals in China and Europe continue to gain ground. Musk’s increasingly polarising political views have also dented brand loyalty in some key markets. Even so, Tesla reported a rise in sales across several European countries in September.

Earlier this year, the company launched a refreshed Model Y featuring new light bars and a rear touchscreen. Musk is also shifting focus toward artificial intelligence projects such as robotaxis and humanoid robots, with plans to introduce more affordable vehicles, including a simplified version of the Model 3 sedan.

Delivering affordable cars is crucial for Tesla’s goal of producing 20 million vehicles over the next decade. This target is part of ambitious milestones tied to Musk’s proposed $1 trillion pay package approved by the company’s board.

Party leaders in Congress once boasted about finding conservative solutions to global warning, and rank-and-file lawmakers discussed pressure from constituents and activists to act. Now, President Donald Trump’s pro-fossil-fuel ethos is firmly in control.

A handful of Republicans lawmakers still talk about the need to promote renewable energy, but they are increasingly isolated in a party focused on fighting what conservatives call the Democrats’ “Green New Scam.”

“We seem to be in a political retrograde, and yet emissions continue to rise,” said Republican Alex Flint, executive director of the group Alliance for Market Solutions, a conservative group focused on reducing planet-warming carbon emissions.

A lot has changed in a fairly short time. In 2016, House Republicans started joining a bipartisan caucus focused on climate solutions. And in 2019, GOP star pollster Frank Luntz urged the federal government to act on climate, publicly disavowing comments he made 20 years prior.

After Joe Biden beat Trump in 2020 and Democrats regained control of Congress, then-House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) created a task force to deal with climate and conservation issues.

Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, now the Republican whip, five years ago talked up “climate resilience” and at one point said of GOP lawmakers, “We all believe climate change is real. We believe mankind is certainly contributing to that.”

Asked last week about action on climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Barrasso said, “Finally, the Republicans are doing the right thing to become energy dominant for this nation in spite of the fact Joe Biden put our head in the noose in the fight against China by shutting down American energy and prioritizing climate over energy that’s available, affordable and reliable.”

Trump himself has repeatedly called human-made climate change a hoax. And Energy Secretary Chris Wright called the international Paris climate agreement “silly.”

The conservative and bipartisan climate caucuses do still exist on Capitol Hill, and so do a small number of Hill Republicans who talk openly about climate change — including Sens. John Curtis of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, as well as Rep. Andrew Garbarino of New York.

But while dozens of House Republicans signaled their support for protecting renewable energy tax incentives, the party was largely unified in voting to phase them out.

Murkowski and Curtis did help strike a last-minute deal to make that phase-out more lenient. But they have not pushed back, at least not publicly, on the administration’s plans to roll back an EPA decision that underpins federal regulations against greenhouse gas emissions. Murkowski said the move was “not unexpected.”

Tom Pyle, head of the conservative Institute for Energy Research, said, “The climate wing of the GOP has been clipped by reality. Heck, even the Democrats aren’t talking about climate anymore.”

Interviews with lawmakers, advocates and administration officials show how the landscape for climate action feels much different under Trump 2.0 — with many Republicans moving away from well worn arguments against picking winners and losers in energy.

Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) say the shift in his party is a reaction to Biden-era green energy policies, which he said were too harsh on fossil fuels.

“We had everybody saying you just got to go all renewable, forget the reasonable transition. Now, you got people going the opposite direction,” said Tillis, a moderate who is retiring from Congress next year.

“I think most members are still in the same place,” said Tillis. “Intuitively, they know it’s an all-of-the-above strategy.”

Others attribute the GOP’s increased hostility to wind and solar on the administration’s rhetoric and the decreasing prominence of climate change as an electoral issue.

“The sobering lesson we may be learning is that Trump has correctly judged that politics is about the short term — the consequences be damned,” Flint said.

Clean energy Republicans are not gone, said Anne Kelly, vice president of government relations at the sustainability group Ceres. They are just “shell-shocked” by administration actions.

Heather Reams, president of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, a group that works with Republicans on climate and renewable energy issues, said: “No one has successfully gotten in Trump’s bull’s-eye and withstood it.”

She said, “House members being singled out by the president, in any administration — that’s tough. In this administration, that could be the end of a congressional career: ‘Why should I stick my head out on something that’s not a top voter issue?'”

The election results are a big reason why Democrats are joining climate-minded Republicans in highlighting the economic benefits of renewable energy development rather than its benefits for the planet.

“Those of us in the climate community who are used to making a more broad argument about where we are in the sweep of history have to get comfortable making a more immediate argument that says the reason prices are going up is a deliberate policy choice of the Republican Party,” said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii).

Reams said of climate-minded Republicans, “I think we are in an evolving time. It’s not like we’ve gone from A to B. … I think we are amidst the journey, and we haven’t landed on anything else. It’s kind of hard to put your finger on it.”

Chris Barnard, president of the right-wing American Conservation Coalition, said, “I think the way that we framed it is like — ‘the climate hawk is dead, what comes next?’ And it should be something that aligns energy dominance needs with reindustrialization, with climate co-benefits as a result,” Barnard said. “It’s just a new way of approaching and thinking about these issues.”

Advocates on the left say the Republican Party has had plenty of time to show its true colors on climate action.

“I think assuming congressional Republicans are going to stick up for renewable energy is a mistake,” said Emily Becker, a deputy director at the center-left think tank Third Way. “How many times do we need to touch a hot stove?”

‘All folded like origami’

Republicans’ posture toward clean energy and climate change was on full display during this year’s monthslong fight to pass their One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

GOP moderates, particularly in the House, ceded ground on renewable energy, allowing the near-immediate phase-outs of wind and solar tax credits. The Senate eased but didn’t prevent the incentives’ demise.

Even though the megalaw preserved credits for geothermal, hydrogen and nuclear, House moderates caved when it came to extending tax credits for wind and solar — even after 21 GOP members signed letters urging leniency.

The night before the House voted on its version, Garbarino stormed out of the speaker’s office saying he was “not happy.” Garbarino, co-chair of the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus, ended up missing that early morning roll call but said he would have supported the legislation.

“They all folded like origami,” Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.) said of the 21 Republicans. “Even to the detriment of their own districts, where these investments have been made. It just hasn’t grown into a policy-making effort. It seems it’s maybe political cover for them.”

But reflecting later on the chain of events, Garbarino rejected accusations that his pro-renewable-energy positions were political cover.

“If it wasn’t for the work prior to the Big Beautiful Bill, everything would have been repealed right away. It was the work we did, both publicly and behind the scenes, both here in the House and Senate, I think that got us to the final language,” the New Yorker said.

“Was the final language perfect? No, the language wasn’t perfect on a lot of things, but it was not a full repeal which a lot of people demanded. I am happy. I am satisfied with what we got in the bill. … It gives people time.”

Sarah Chieffo, vice president of government affairs at the League of Conservation Voters, which mostly supports Democrats, said pro-renewables advocacy from some Republicans has been positive. The group has launched a $4 million campaign to denounce what it calls the “Big Ugly Bill.”

“I don’t want to greenwash it, but I think how some Republicans in Congress are now talking about clean energy as something we need to get on the grid for energy security and to lower cost impacts is an important shift from even five years ago,” she said.

What about Miller-Meeks?

One key player appeared to be working mostly behind the scenes: Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-Iowa), who chairs the House’s Conservative Climate Caucus.

Last year, the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE) named Miller-Meeks renewable energy champion of the year, and she defended the clean energy credits to top tax Republican Rep. Jason Smith in April. But the swing state congresswoman was relatively quiet during the late-stage public fights over the credits.

Miller-Meeks’ approach was a departure from that of Curtis, who founded the Conservative Climate Caucus in 2021 when he was a House member. As caucus leader, Curtis was one of the most vocal GOP representatives when it came to climate issues and has continued that work in the Senate.

With Tillis and Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Curtis helped delay fast confirmation of some administration nominees over renewable energy concerns and how the administration would implement the phase-out of incentives.

Curtis has also reached out to conservatives like fellow Utah, Senate Energy and Natural Resources Chair Sen. Mike Lee. “We’ve talked more about what I’m doing, and I’ll just say: He’s not very critical of what I’m doing,” said Curtis.

In an email through her office, Miller-Meeks defended her work, saying the tax credits ended up “in a far better position than I could have hoped this time last year.”

“When we sent the first letter, to Speaker Johnson, asserting Republican support for a more comprehensive conversation on energy tax credits we were fighting against full repeal,” she wrote.

“As more projects were built and came online, the urgency of meeting demand for AI and meetings the energy needs of AI increased, and politization died down, and a reasonable conversation about the benefits of the tax credits emerged.”

Miller-Meeks, who is facing a tough reelection fight, said she helped educate House Republican colleagues about the benefits of renewable energy tax credits and ended up with a compromise.

“But after many conversations with a variety of stakeholders everyone understands the timeline and good projects will continue to be built,” she said.

The group Climate Power, which has Democratic ties, says the GOP agenda is threatening more than 100 clean energy projects and thousands of jobs.

“The credits were never going to last forever and the is a reasonable runway for businesses to meet US energy needs and continue to build out and strengthen our energy system,” said Miller-Meeks.

‘Things appear to be worse’

Former Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), who founded the Climate Solutions Caucus in 2016, said that while Trump may be shifting rightward on climate, the megabill fight actually signaled that not all Hill Republicans are following.

“On the surface, things appear to be worse,” said Curbelo. “Trump 2.0 is definitely looking at climate and energy issues through the lens of the culture wars. Certainly that’s a lot more prevalent in the administration than it was the first time around.”

But beneath the surface, Republican support has not diminished, Curbelo argued — in fact, on the Hill, the opposite is true. He pointed to a failed amendment from Lee that would have scrapped the production and investment tax credits for wind and solar energy. It went down 21-79.

Curbelo says it’s notable that at least some of the Democrats’ 2022 climate law survived this year when Republicans in 2023 expressed support for full repeal under pressure from the far right during debt ceiling negotiations.

“It depends on your perspective and where you want to start measuring from,” Curbelo said. “But certainly anyone should have expected this to be a major target for the Republican trifecta and the truth is we landed somewhere between the scalpel and the sledgehammer approach and I think significant investments were protected.”

Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell unseated Curbelo in 2018 elections. She was then ousted by GOP Rep. Carlos Gimenez, who went from stressing climate issues as mayor of Miami-Dade County to downplaying them in Congress.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/eb/ae/c28c2ce64ffcba39a1ee51649e98/congress-tax-cuts-84663.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 06:59:43.948468

But a major shift in federal policy could put the brakes on that momentum. The federal tax credit for electric vehicles has officially expired, putting what was once viewed as the future of driving in jeopardy.

For years, the $7,500 credit helped make EVs more affordable. It boosted consumer demand and pushed automakers to invest heavily in electric models.

Now, without that incentive, executives warn of a sharp drop in EV sales. Ford's CEO says market share could fall to just 4% to 5% by year's end.

Dealers currently sit on about 134,000 unsold EVs — that's roughly two months' worth of inventory at current sales rates.

To soften the blow, some automakers are stepping in. Ford and GM are offering lease deals that mimic the credit. Hyundai is cutting prices on certain models.

,IRA Tax Credits,2025-10-07 10:33:04+00:00,NPR,A tribe in Arizona planned to connect 600 homes to electricity. Then the funding was cut - NPR,"Nate Perez, Ryan Kellman",,,,,https://www.npr.org/2025/10/07/nx-s1-5453913/trump-hopi-tribes-native-americans-clean-energy,"Those who live more than a mile away from that line — nearly 3,000 people — have no access to electricity.
The Hopi were approved for a $25 million grant to install solar panels and battery storage for around 600 homes through a program called Solar for All.
Now, the tribe will be lucky to power around 100 homes from a much smaller pot of funding through a federal grant from the Tribal Electrification Program.
""As they [utility companies] were building out the transmission lines, they excluded tribes, tribal lands,"" she says.
But Pilar Thomas, who practices tribal energy and economic development law with the law firm Quarles & Brady, disagrees with that.","For as long as 55-year-old Hopi Chairman Tim Nuvangyaoma has been alive, high-voltage power lines have cut across Hopi lands in northeast Arizona, carrying vast amounts of power long distances throughout the Southwest.

But residents of the Hopi Reservation have never been connected to that grid. Instead, tribal members have relied on a single power line that runs roughly 30 miles east and west across high desert punctuated by three distinctive mesas, home to 12 distinct villages, including some of the oldest inhabited communities in the United States.

Those who live more than a mile away from that line — nearly 3,000 people — have no access to electricity. Families need to rely on generators to power everything from refrigerators to medical devices.

The rest of the reservation is connected to the grid, but the power is unreliable and outages can sometimes last days.

""If you have a power surge or any kind of power outage, you're definitely going to lose that power to that equipment that somebody's life might be reliant on,"" Nuvangyaoma says.

The tribe thought those days without reliable electricity were about to change.

Under then-President Joe Biden, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, providing nearly $2 billion to tribes to invest in renewable energy.

The Hopi were approved for a $25 million grant to install solar panels and battery storage for around 600 homes through a program called Solar for All.

But in August, the Trump administration terminated the Solar for All program, calling it wasteful.

Now, the tribe will be lucky to power around 100 homes from a much smaller pot of funding through a federal grant from the Tribal Electrification Program. Hopi officials say they will now have to decide who gets power and who doesn't.

""That's hard news to deliver, man,"" says Nuvangyaoma, ""especially when you offer somebody hope and they're thinking, 'All right, finally we're getting somewhere' — and then the rug gets pulled out from them.""

A game changer for tribes

The situation on the Hopi Reservation isn't unique. An estimated 54,000 tribal members across Indian Country don't have access to electricity, according to a 2023 report from the Department of Energy's Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs.

Even those with power often deal with more frequent outages, says Wahleah Johns, who directed that office during the Biden administration.

""Tribal households face power outages 6.5 times more than the national average,"" she says.

That disparity dates back to the 1920s and 1930s, says Johns, when tribes were often left out as energy infrastructure was built across the West.

""As they [utility companies] were building out the transmission lines, they excluded tribes, tribal lands,"" she says.

The Inflation Reduction Act was seen as a game changer for tribes across the country, says Johns, who's a member of the Navajo Nation.

The IRA allowed tribes for the first time to access tax credits to finance and expand renewable energy projects across Indian Country. The law also provided billions of dollars in loan guarantees for tribes, including the Hopi.

Johns says the IRA pushed forward the Solar for All program, allowing residential solar for low-income and disadvantaged households across the nation. Programs like the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants were meant to accelerate the clean energy transition on tribal lands.

Most tribes couldn't afford major investments in energy infrastructure without that federal support, Johns says.

""[It's] estimated it costs over $40,000 per mile to build out transmission lines,"" Johns says. ""The median income's pretty low in tribal lands, and so to be able to afford that is just not gonna happen.""

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the median non-Hispanic white household brings in $81,604 annually, compared with the median yearly income of $54,485 for non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native households.

But this summer, Congress rolled back much of that IRA funding after lawmakers passed President Trump's key legislative agenda, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which ends tax credits for large-scale renewable energy projects if construction begins after July 4, 2026, or if the project isn't placed into service by Dec. 31, 2027.

Tribal and rural communities don't have a lot of access to capital to get renewable energy projects started, explains Fletcher Wilkinson, who is the energy manager at Hopi Utilities Corporation. That's why it is nearly impossible, he says, to get utility companies to invest.

""This bill [OBBB] hurts the Hopi Tribe and it hurts rural and remote communities, because it makes it harder to develop energy projects in these communities,"" Wilkinson says.

In August, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would also end the Solar for All program. The agency said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act halted future funding for the program, including money that had already been set aside for tribes.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the change in a video posted to the agency's YouTube account.

""EPA no longer has the authority to administer the program or the appropriated funds to keep this boondoggle alive,"" he said.

But Pilar Thomas, who practices tribal energy and economic development law with the law firm Quarles & Brady, disagrees with that.

""All of the grant money was fully obligated,"" Thomas says. ""Congress cannot rescind obligated funds.""

The EPA did not respond to questions from NPR. Instead, the agency said in an emailed statement that it is working to implement the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in accordance with congressional intent. ""The Trump EPA will continue to work with states, tribes, and communities to support projects that advance the agency's core mission of protecting human health and the environment.""

""A heck of a plan""

The rollbacks in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are a major blow to tribes, including the Hopi.

For years, the Hopi relied on the Navajo Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant on Navajo Nation land, for jobs and revenue. But in 2019, the plant's operators shut it down, and about 85% of the Hopi's revenue vanished.

The unemployment rate on the reservation hovers around 12%, nearly three times higher than the national average.

NPR asked the White House why the administration canceled Solar for All. In an emailed statement, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers responded that the president is bringing down energy costs and providing stability.

""The left imposed a radical climate agenda and declared war on American energy, which shut down beautiful, clean coal plants and forced communities across the country to depend on unreliable, 'green' energy sources,"" she wrote.

In addition to the plans to provide solar panels and battery storage, the tribe was counting on tax credits from the IRA to help build an 8-megawatt microgrid — enough electricity to operate the entire reservation — and provide jobs and economic benefits to the Hopi Tribe.

Nuvangyaoma also has aspirations to build out a large-scale solar project — 400 megawatts — with battery storage that could turn the Hopi into a major player as an energy service provider for northeast Arizona.

The Hopi were banking on tax credits to cover upward of half the cost of the project, which is not cheap, says Thomas, of the law firm Quarles & Brady.

""No one's going to write anybody a check for $900 million,"" Thomas says. ""No bank is gonna do it. So what the tax credits have done in the past is, they've served as capital into the project.""

Now, commercial-scale utility renewable energy projects will be even harder to develop, because they're so expensive and require a longer build-out.

Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act doesn't just damage the Hopi's renewable energy dreams, says Thomas.

"" It's not that it's gonna kill their project, 'cause it's gonna kill every project,"" says Thomas, who's also a member of the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in Arizona.

Johns, the former director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, says there's probably a lot of confusion among tribes about what funding is still available.

""Eliminating these clean energy programs within the IRA isn't just bad policy,"" says Johns. ""It's a betrayal of the federal government's trust, responsibility to tribes.""

The Hopi and other tribes plan to sue the Trump administration to reinstate their Solar for All funds, which total around $7 billion to 49 organizations, six tribes and five states.

"" We have a heck of a plan,"" Nuvangyaoma says. ""I refuse to let that sit on the shelf and collect dust.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x1688+0+313/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F08%2Fb0%2Ff8fbbecb40d099875bbcdaffb72a%2F0b6a3014.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 07:00:25.103631

Trump and DOGE have gutted the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which enforces the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Superfund Act, as well as the Department of the Interior, which enforces the Surface Mining Act (for coal), the Endangered Species Act, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, and also manages the National Park System. Trump has also fired experienced environmental lawyers and Inspectors General from the EPA, the Department of the Interior (DOI), the Justice Department, and U.S. Attorney's Offices, where these laws are enforced in federal courts. He is making it nearly impossible to implement these laws, thereby allowing industrial and other polluters to damage the environment with impunity. He has also caused the removal of interactive pages from federal websites related to climate change and environmental justice.

In the Department of the Interior, Trump has opened millions of acres of protected public lands and the offshore continental shelf to oil and gas leasing. He recently opened 13 million acres of federal lands to more coal mining and is pushing to restart obsolete, polluting, and expensive coal-fired power plants. His MAGA House and Senate supporters are still trying to legislatively order a massive sell-off of public lands to offset their tax breaks for millionaires. His complicit Supreme Court has recently weakened the standards for complying with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), meaning that there will be less stringent reviews of proposed development projects on Federal Lands.

His minions at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have proposed changing the definition of ""harm"" under the Endangered Species Act to exclude habitat destruction—the primary way in which threatened and endangered species are harmed. His U.S. Forest Service minions have announced a vastly expanded production of timber from National Forests while also cutting the budget for forest firefighters. He has again withdrawn the United States from the international Paris Accord climate treaty and has cut all funding and tax incentives for electric vehicles and solar power. He continues to deny that climate change is happening or caused by human pollution, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, and his EPA chief has proposed reversing the “endangerment finding” under the Clean Air Act that forms the basis for EPA to promulgate rules regulating CO2 and methane in the atmosphere.

In short, the Trump Administration is a disaster for the human and natural environment. It threatens the entire system of environmental and public lands protections that Congress has enacted over the last sixty years. It is madness: Protecting the profits of industry in the short run to guarantee the destruction of the environment in the long run.

The Sierra Club, Earthjustice, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Southern Environmental Law Center, and the Environmental Defense Fund, among others, have filed dozens of lawsuits against the Trump administration and have achieved considerable success. For instance, EarthJustice's suit against the USDA for deleting climate data from its website resulted in the USDA restoring the data. A lawsuit by the NRDC led to the U.S. District Court in the Western District of Washington issuing a preliminary injunction, lifting the Trump administration's unlawful freeze on federal funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program. Several courts have ordered the Trump administration to spend money appropriated by Congress for environmental programs and personnel that it had illegally impounded, but the Supreme Court has recently allowed Trump to go forward with many of his firings and personnel cuts.

So, what can you do to help? You can financially support the Sierra Club and the environmental law groups mentioned above in their efforts to thwart Trump's actions. You can write or call your Congressional representatives and respectfully but heartily protest.

The potential launch comes as the company moves to offset the loss of US federal incentives for electric vehicles.

Sources said the new entry-level Model Y is the vehicle the company hinted at in social media posts over the weekend.

The cheaper variant will drop some features and use less expensive materials to help counterbalance the end of the federal tax credit of up to $7,500 that ceased this month.

Executives indicated on the company’s latest earnings call that production of the lower-cost model began in June, but the decision was taken to delay scaling up output until after the US phased out the incentives.

Chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja and Lars Moravy, vice president of vehicle engineering, offered few specifics at the time, before Elon Musk clarified the model in question.

“It’s the Model Y,” Musk said, adding that he would “let the cat out of the bag”.

He continued: “The desire to buy the car is very high, it’s just people don’t have enough money in their bank account to buy it. So, the more affordable we can make the car, the better.”

The company reduced costs on the Model Y partly by concentrating on the battery pack and motor, the sources said.

Last week, Tesla reported global deliveries of 497,099 vehicles for the July to September period, a quarterly record.

Tesla does not provide regional breakdowns, but with Europe and China weaker this year, the increase likely reflected stronger US demand.

While the expiry of the tax credits lifted sales ahead of the deadline, the pull-forward could weigh on electric vehicle demand in the coming months.

Musk cautioned in July that the company could face “a few rough quarters” after US incentives end.

According to Kings Research, the global tubular solar collector market was valued at USD 5,450.0 million in 2023 and is projected to expand from USD 5,724.1 million in 2024 to USD 8,394.2 million by 2031, registering a CAGR of 5.62% during the forecast period.

This expansion is supported by rising adoption of solar thermal technologies in residential, commercial, and industrial sectors, as well as government-backed incentives for clean energy, advances in hybrid solar systems, and increasing awareness of carbon reduction.

Tubular solar collectors utilize evacuated glass tubes to absorb solar radiation and transfer thermal energy to a heat transfer fluid. A vacuum between the inner and outer tubes reduces heat loss, enhancing efficiency even in low-light and cold-weather conditions. These systems are widely applied for residential heating, commercial water heating, and industrial thermal processes, offering a low-carbon, energy-efficient solution.

Kings Research identifies the following growth accelerators for the tubular solar collector market

Strong Government Incentives and Policy Frameworks

The IEA reports that in 2023, global renewable heat consumption is rising, with solar-thermal use in buildings projected to grow ~40% during 2023–2028. Under the updated Renewable Energy Directive (RED III, 2023), the EU has set a binding target for at least 42.5% of gross final energy consumption to come from renewables by 2030.

In India, the MNRE’s renewable targets aim for 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030, reinforcing the country’s push for solar and thermal systems (Source: www.pib.gov.in). In the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act extends the 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for eligible renewable energy projects (including solar technologies) through at least 2025, aiding deployment of solar thermal and related technologies.

Advancements in Solar Technology

Ongoing innovations such as selective coatings, advanced insulation, automated smart controllers, and hybrid photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) systems are significantly improving efficiency and lowering costs. Hybrid collectors integrating PV and thermal functions are enabling dual energy generation, improving energy independence and space efficiency.

Rising Demand for Hybrid Solar Systems

The integration of tubular solar collectors with PV panels is an emerging trend that enables simultaneous production of electricity and heat. This dual function increases system ROI and makes adoption more appealing for residential and commercial applications.

Commercial & Industrial Sector Adoption The commercial sector accounted for 52% of market share in 2023, driven by demand for energy-efficient heating in offices, hospitals, and hotels. Industrial applications, such as process heating, are also increasingly adopting solar thermal solutions to offset fossil fuel costs and emissions.

Tubular solar collectors offer critical benefits for residential, commercial, and industrial sectors

Operational Efficiency: Low-maintenance systems reduce downtime and enhance long-term reliability.

Cost Savings: Extended equipment life and lower operating costs reduce overall expenditure.

Sustainability: Eco-friendly designs contribute to emissions reduction and compliance with climate policies.

Soon, though, it may be out of their hands. A BlackRock-owned private equity firm is set to take over the parent company of central Indiana’s electricity monopoly, AES Indiana.

Indiana and Indianapolis need to work together to stop this.

What are private equity firms?

Private equity firms purchase companies with the intent of selling them for profit. They often cut staffing, equipment and put companies in debt to do so, at the expense of their long-term sustainability.

When most people think of private equity, BlackRock is one of the first firms that comes to mind. It is a multinational investment firm and the largest asset manager in the world.

State Treasurer Daniel Elliott put BlackRock on a watchlist last year and ultimately banned it from managing Indiana’s public retirement funds because of its environmental, social and governance commitments, in an attempt to keep “politics out of investments.” ESG commitments include things like a corporation's social mission or cultural agenda that it can't necessarily monetize.

A spokesperson for Elliott declined to comment on the sale.

BlackRock has also invested in companies involved in human rights violations in China, according to the U.S. House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.

In purchasing a public utility, private equity firms like BlackRock could pass on debt to consumers and lower service quality to extract profit with no consequences, as consumers have no alternatives.

These firms likely see a route to quick profits selling electricity to data centers, fueled by an economy high on artificial intelligence and subsidized by massive state tax breaks.

Blackstone, another private equity firm, bought almost 20% of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. LLC last year. NIPSCO then planned several solar farms and other infrastructure investments and passed costs onto consumers. It is also planning additional natural gas plants to power data centers.

The result was the highest jump in electricity prices of any utility in Indiana over the last year, 26%. For some customers, that meant an increase of $50 per month.

Indiana should ban sale of public utilities to private equity

State Sen. Chris Garten, R-Charlestown, who authored a law banning Indiana’s public retirement system from investing in China, opposes the sale of AES Indiana to a firm controlled by BlackRock.

“BlackRock's focus on short-term profits contradicts the long-term interests of Hoosier ratepayers who rely on stable and affordable energy,” Garten told me. “By prioritizing their ESG beliefs over the financial well-being of our communities, BlackRock threatens to undermine our energy independence and economic stability.”

“It is vital that we protect the interests of Indiana residents by opposing this acquisition and ensuring that our utility companies remain accountable to those they serve, rather than to the ideological pursuits of distant investors,” he added.

There is very little that Indiana can do to stop the merger, however, said Kerwin Olson, executive director of Citizen’s Action Coalition.

“By choice, the state has virtually no authority,” he said, citing a decision by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission on a recent merger of two utilities, in which it claimed to have no “approval jurisdiction” over the transaction.

State legislators would likely have to enact a law during the next legislative session to do anything about it.

Such legislation could do several things. It could give the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission “approval jurisdiction” over purchases of public utilities. Then it could ban private equity companies from buying a controlling stake in Indiana’s public utilities. It could also force private equity companies that already own a controlling stake to sell their stock to a municipality or another local owner, ideally a nonprofit.

Indianapolis should buy AES Indiana

If the state does not take action, Indianapolis could offer to buy AES Indiana.

Almost 50 years ago, the city was granted the authority to buy public utilities using revenue bonds, a tool frequently used to fund multimillion-dollar school improvements.

Indianapolis last exercised this right in 2002 with the purchase of the Indianapolis Water Company for $515 million. The city contracted with another company to manage the utility until selling it to Citizens Energy, a nonprofit, public charitable trust, in 2011.

The City-County Council could grant Mayor Joe Hogsett the authority to strike a deal to purchase AES Indiana. It would be an excellent way for the Mayor to begin to fix his public image during a scandal-filled third term.

Jesse Brown, an east-side City-County Council Democrat, supported the idea after I asked him about it.

“Indianapolis should purchase AES Indiana and run it ourselves,” he said on X, after I showed him the portion of Indiana code that allows the city to do so. “If we can use revenue bonds to finance a hotel, why not use those bonds to finance an electric utility? Guaranteed return on equity is obviously attractive to shareholders.”

Republican Councilor Michael-Paul Hart told me the idea was “worth exploring."" He later called it “a massive concept that would restore local control of our power grid.” He clarified in his newsletter, though, he wasn’t “exploring that path right now.”

Josh Bain, another Republican, told me he was open to the idea under one condition.

“I would certainly entertain the idea of Indianapolis purchasing AES, but only if the end goal is to create a true ratepayer-owned cooperative,” he told me. “I don’t trust the Hogsett administration to properly run a utility company, and the last thing we need is more government mismanagement.

“If we’re serious about this, it needs to be owned and operated by the people who pay the bills — not by city hall,” he added.

Hogsett could strike a deal with AES

To be fair, the city had an advantage in 2002 due to an ordinance from 1870 that gave it first option to purchase of the water utility. The state, however, could end its ban on municipalities forcing public utilities to sell their property and give them essentially the same power now.

It's unclear what a fair price might look like to purchase the company, though.

""The city of Indianapolis is in a better position to discuss its own processes, including views with respect to valuations,"" an AES Indiana spokesperson told me.

When AES bought Indianapolis Power and Light Co. in 2000, the transaction valued IPL much higher than AES Indiana is today. But AES Corp.'s ownership structure is more complex. While AES Corp. holds the controlling stake in AES Indiana, it owns only 82.35% of the total stock.

AES Indiana's electricity infrastructure is worth more than $5.4 billion, but much of it is financed through debt. AES Indiana's yearly revenue is around $1.6 billion. Those two points, along with AES Indiana's existing debt obligations, would likely be the key factors in determining the final purchase price. This would be paid for out of the utility's yearly operating revenue over time using bonds.

Regardless of what that final number is, it would likely be a small price to pay to save our public utility from being chopped up and sold for parts.","https://www.indystar.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/03/PIND/82792770007-040325-storms-carmel-kmw-024.JPG?crop=3599,2026,x0,y391&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-07 08:03:00.069849

“Boy, we sure hate what they’re doing to our country,” goes the thinking that one often hears expressed, “but we wish that our side could stop pussyfooting around and learn a thing or two from the right about doing what it takes to win!”

In some ways at least, it’s an understandable sentiment. Over the last several years, progressives have watched in horror as a determined minority movement has seized control of and radicalized the nation’s laws and governmental institutions in unprecedented ways. In numerous areas – public and higher education, personal bodily autonomy, the role and rights of corporations and workers, racial and gender equality, the distribution of the nation’s wealth, separation of church and state, gun ownership, combating the climate crisis, and even America’s role in the world – the right has succeeded in overturning decades of slow but mostly steady progress and imposing a series of dramatic policy 180’s.

What’s more, to add to the frustration, the change in no way reflects any kind of significant shift in public opinion or popular values.

Rather, like so many past authoritarian movements that seized upon narrow electoral victories and, either by hook or crook, converted them into massive power shifts and policy sea changes, modern American conservatives have used passion, large doses of cynical pragmatism and an unapologetic willingness to shatter legal and societal norms to secure their objectives.

Think about it – the proof of this reality is in the numbers. Donald Trump lost the popular vote in two of the last three national elections and won less than 50% of the vote in his 2024 victory. Congress has been divided by the narrowest of margins for years. In North Carolina, registered Democrats still slightly outnumber registered Republicans and as multiple razor-thin Supreme Court races demonstrate, it remains a deeply “purple” state.

If ever there was a time in which public attitudes would seem to demand divided, middle ground government, this is it.

Instead, of course, we have the opposite. Rather than generally staying the course or pursuing incremental change, Republicans in Washington, DC and several states like North Carolina have repeatedly swung for the fences and moved with all the speed they can muster to roll back past progressive wins and lock in unpopular, ultra-right policies – like slashing taxes on the rich, disempowering workers, undermining reproductive freedom, abandoning efforts to combat climate change and militarizing law enforcement.

Will they succeed in effecting a lasting overhaul of American society?

Maybe.

While it’s true that many, if not most, hard right and authoritarian regimes in modern times have eventually foundered, Trump and company have taken some steps – perhaps most notably in the courts – that will make rooting out some of their changes quite difficult.

That said, a recent public opinion poll in North Carolina helps shine a light on what could be an important Achilles’ Heel.

The issue is gerrymandering – the drawing of political maps to rig elections for partisan purposes.

As has been well-publicized, Republicans have been moving aggressively at Trump’s specific direction of late to further gerrymander already rigged electoral maps in a handful of states they already control in hopes of retaining their narrow control of the U.S. House in the 2026 elections. This includes North Carolina, where it appears Republican legislative leaders are likely to pass legislation later this month that would eliminate chances for Democrats to prevail in the First Congressional District – a region in the state’s east that takes in most of the so-called “Black Belt,” currently represented by Democrat Don Davis.

If this effort succeeds – and some reports indicate that Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger has pledged to do the deed in exchange for a Trump endorsement in his 2026 GOP primary, although Berger has denied this — the state’s already rigged U.S. House map would shift from 10-4 Republican to 11-3.

As a new poll conducted by a GOP polling firm and released by the good government nonprofit Common Cause demonstrates convincingly, however, such a move will be enormously unpopular. The poll found that 84% of voters – including 78% of unaffiliated voters and 65% of Republicans – said gerrymandering maps for partisan advantage is “never acceptable.” Two-thirds of GOP leaders said the practice should be illegal and nearly half conceded that the current already rigged maps were likely unfairly drawn.

Could this remarkable consensus in public opinion ultimately help give rise to a shift in attitudes and behavior among enough voters (and help anger enough progressives) to help swing upcoming elections against Trump and set the nation on a different path? In such closely divided times, it certainly seems possible.

Whatever the case, the blatant and desperate nature of the scheme provides a strong indication that, like many other authoritarian fear-dependent regimes down through human history, the Trump movement is grappling with some significant fears of its own.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Redistricting-Daniel.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 05:58:18.720933

And when the U.S. still had 33 operating aluminum smelters in 1980, many of them relied on publicly owned hydropower facilities to provide cheap power.","This story was originally published by Canary Media.

For nearly a century, the Kelley’s Falls Dam in Manchester, New Hampshire, generated as much as 2,400 megawatt-hours of electricity per year. When the small hydroelectric station in a downtown park came up for relicensing in 2022, its owners faced what many dam operators now expect when trying to extend the lifespan of these power generators: strict requirements that would force them to spend millions on upgrades to qualify for a new operating permit. Instead, Green Mountain Power made a choice that has become common among hydroelectric operators. The utility simply surrendered its licenses.

Last year, the plant shut down.

Nearly 450 hydroelectric stations totaling more than 16 gigawatts of generating capacity are scheduled for relicensing across the United States over the next decade. That’s roughly 40% of the nonfederal fleet (the government owns about half the hydropower stations in the U.S.). The country is now on the verge of a major shift in hydropower. The facilities could be relicensed to supply the booming demand for electricity to power everything from data centers to aluminum smelters. Tech and industrial giants could even help pay for the costly relicensing process with deals like the record-setting $3 billion contract Google inked with hydropower operator Brookfield Asset Management in July for up to 3 gigawatts of hydropower. Or, as has been happening for years, the U.S. could continue to lose gigawatts of power as hydroelectric facilities shut down rather than absorb the high costs of relicensing — especially with cheaper competition from gas, wind, and solar.

The fleet of dams that helped electrify the nation starting in the late 1800s provides the second-largest share of the country’s renewable power after wind, and by far its most firm. But the average age of U.S. dams is 65 years, meaning the bulk of the fleet wasn’t built with newfangled infrastructure to enable unobstructed passage for fish and other wildlife. As seen in New Hampshire, the cost of upgrading facilities to allow for that passage can soar into the tens of millions of dollars — on top of the expense of upgrading custom-built equipment for each plant. Complicating matters further, after decades of decline in the hydropower sector, the manufacturing muscle for turbines and other hardware that make a dam work has largely atrophied in the U.S.

The relicensing waiting game

The biggest obstacle to a hydropower comeback may be the relicensing bureaucracy. The problem is that the Federal Power Act — passed in 1920 to regulate hydroelectric facilities — does not give any single agency full authority over hydropower the way the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has over atomic energy. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issues the key permits on the national level, but other agencies also play a role. The Fish and Wildlife Service, for example, may require a National Environmental Policy Act review to examine a dam’s effects on a specific fish species, a process that involves assessing multiple spawning cycles. And once that’s done for salmon, the agency may undertake yet another multiyear study on trout. FERC, meanwhile, can’t issue its licenses until state agencies overseeing waterways approve permits. That alone can eat up years.

As a result, it takes eight years on average to relicense an existing hydropower facility, according to the National Hydropower Association, the leading U.S. trade group. That’s more than five times slower than licensing for the typical atomic power station. (Nuclear, hydroelectricity’s closest competitor for clean, always-available power, is also notorious for its slow permitting timeline.)

“It takes longer to relicense an existing hydro facility than a new nuclear facility,” said Malcolm Woolf, the National Hydropower Association’s chief executive. ​“It takes just 18 months to get a new license for a nuclear plant.”

With no central body in charge of permitting hydropower plants, multiple state agencies have been known to take advantage of the once-in-a-generation certification process — eliciting support for tangentially related projects from dam owners who once represented a big and growing business.

“This is major infrastructure. These facilities cost billions of dollars,” Woolf said. ​“They’re like bridges and roads. They get a license for 50 years. The state agencies view [the relicensing process] as an opportunity to extract concessions from what they view as a deep pocket.”

At times, those concessions have little to do with the functioning of the hydropower plant itself. Woolf cited examples of dam owners pressed to build an amphitheater for Boy Scouts, and to fund the construction of regional roads that wouldn’t even go to the plant.

“One … regulator was requiring a facility to pay for a feral-pig-eradication program,” Woolf said.

“In the 1970s, maybe the industry was a deep pocket,” he added. ​“But now, with the low cost of other fuels like wind and solar and gas, it’s driving these facilities to bankruptcy and to surrender licenses.”

The eight-year timeline for relicensing is just an average.

In Idaho, the Hells Canyon hydroelectric plant has gone for 20 years without a permanent license. In Maryland, the Conowingo Dam’s relicensing process has also stretched on for two decades. In Massachusetts, the Northfield Mountain plant is in the middle of a 15-year permitting slog.

To continue operating, hydroplant owners obtain one-year extensions as they inch toward full licenses. ​“But if they don’t have a long-term license,” Woolf warned, ​“they’re not about to invest millions in upgrades.”

One potential bright spot in the relicensing quagmire has been a shift in federal tax policy. For years, the wind and solar industries have benefited from a rule that treats facilities as new if owners reinvest at least 80% of the plant’s market value into upgrades like new turbines or panels, making them eligible for bigger federal write-offs. In January, the Biden administration’s Treasury Department granted hydroelectric facilities the same flexibility.

But so far, no hydroelectric facility has made use of the federal investment tax credit except one small plant that was destroyed in a flood, thus requiring a total reconstruction. That’s because until recently the industry still lacked clear guidance on how to apply the tax credit.

“The question in the hydropower industry was, if you think of the Hoover Dam, is it 80% of the electric generating equipment? Or 80% of the whole Hoover Dam and the reservoir? So that’s what the Treasury clarified,” Woolf said. ​“It’s 80% of the electric generating equipment. So if you replace a 50-year-old generator with a new generator, you’re going to satisfy that.”

While renewables face ongoing opposition from the Trump administration, the president specifically named hydropower as a key priority in his Day 1 executive orders on energy. In July, Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, preserving hydropower’s access to key federal tax credits for the next eight years. If a hydro project is built in a designated ​“energy community” and uses domestically manufactured equipment, the tax credit can cover as much as half the investment.

A fishy problem

Providing safe passage for fish through dams is a perpetual challenge, especially at older facilities that lack proper infrastructure. But dams that have been updated with newer, thinner turbine blades are also an issue, as the blades become guillotines for trout and salmon navigating through. American eels pose an even greater problem, as the snake-like fish — which can make up as much as half the biomass in rivers across the country — migrate downstream to spawn as breeding-age adults.

One of the simplest and most widely used tools to prevent fish from being killed in a dam’s turbines is a screen that blocks them from entering the plant’s water intake. Other methods include fish ladders or elevators that allow wildlife to ascend rising water to reach the other side. Less practical are trap-and-haul systems where fish are manually captured and set free above the dam.

“Fish-passage solutions can be extraordinarily expensive,” said Jennifer Garson, the former director of the Department of Energy’s Water Power Technologies Office. ​“The problem is the burden falls completely on hydropower operators to make these upgrades.”

The key to overcoming the issue may be marrying the refurbishment of hydropower stations with environmental upgrades. In 2019, the startup Natel Energy, which designs fish-safe hydropower turbines, installed its pilot project in Maine, then another in Oregon the following year. Natel’s technology — based on thicker blades that don’t sever fish as they move through the dam — was validated by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. The company won $9 million from the Energy Department to scale up its supply chain.

While the fish-safe blades are thicker than traditional turbine blades, Natel claims that its equipment is more efficient than the older equipment it’s replacing. Compared with turbines that are nearly 40 years old, CEO Gia Schneider said, the new Natel units produce more electricity per spin on average.

“They’re going to modernize, get fish-safe turbines that will safely pass eel, salmon, and herring that need to go through the plant, and they’ll get 5% more energy,” Schneider said.

Even replacing newer blades comes with little loss in efficiency.

“At another plant where we’re working on the design, the turbines are pretty young – only installed 10 years ago,” she said. ​“There, we’re going to get maybe 0.2% less energy out.”

On balance, Schneider noted, plant owners get more out of the facility, because even with new traditional turbines, dams require very fine exclusion screens and other equipment that restrict water flow enough to reduce energy output by anywhere from 5% to 15%.

“You’re losing a lot more from these bolt-on solutions,” she said. ​“At the end of the day, if you get 0.2% less on the turbine side, … on the whole-plant level, you’re coming out ahead.”

Old hydropower, new opportunities

At the moment, hydropower finds itself in a similar position to that of nuclear energy a few years ago, where existing facilities risk closure due to relicensing costs amid competition from cheaper newcomers. The U.S. is now actively looking to restart its nuclear program, with the once far-fetched prospect of new large-scale reactors under serious consideration. Even if hydropower can similarly flip its fortunes, few in the industry anticipate an appetite in the U.S. for a Hoover Dam–size project. Still, there is ample opportunity for new hydroelectric capacity.

Just 3% of the nation’s 80,000 dams generate electricity. In 2012, an Energy Department report found that the U.S. could add 12 gigawatts of new power by overhauling those facilities to produce electricity. More than a decade later, ​“none of it was built,” Woolf said.

There are plenty of hydropower critics who welcome that stagnation. The history of damming rivers is rife with ecological destruction that fish-passage routes don’t entirely solve, as well as social upheaval from land seizures that uprooted poor, Black, and Indigenous communities from their homes to make way for new reservoirs.

And in parts of the U.S. where water is growing more scarce as the climate warms, reservoirs are drying up. Hydropower output in the American West hit a 22-year low last year after below-average snowfall, according to analysis by the Energy Information Administration. Yet other parts of the U.S., such as the Northeast, are getting wetter as the planet heats up.

While debate over hydropower continues in the U.S., nations overseas are moving ahead with new dam projects. In July, China started construction on what will, upon completion, be the world’s largest power station, a giant hydroelectric facility in Tibet. Last month, Brazil held its first auctions for new small- and medium-size dams with hopes of turning $1 billion in investments into more hydroelectricity. And Ethiopia just opened its megadam project meant to alleviate electricity issues in the country, despite pushback from Egyptians who say the facility could negatively impact the flow of water on the Nile.

The U.S. could get in on the game, or at least work to clear away hurdles preventing the country from taking advantage of the infrastructure that already exists. As the Trump administration looks to re-shore heavy industry through tariffs, Woolf said, ​“hydropower is a great resource for colocating manufacturing because you’ve got energy infrastructure and you’re typically in fairly rural areas where land is less expensive.” For data centers, reservoirs could offer the additional service of providing water for cooling hot computer servers, along with electricity. And when the U.S. still had 33 operating aluminum smelters in 1980, many of them relied on publicly owned hydropower facilities to provide cheap power. These plants could, in theory, play that role again as new demand for domestically produced aluminum — to manufacture electric vehicles and clean-energy equipment — puts strain on the remaining six smelters.

“We know we’ve got load growth. We know we’ve got grid variability from renewables and extreme weather. The flexibility of hydropower offers clean, firm generation that is unique,” Woolf said. ​“At the same time — through quirk of history — we’ve got so much of the fleet at relicensing and at risk of surrendering permits. This could be an amazing opportunity.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/hydropower-2048x1366.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 11:00:54.034602

On a warm, sunny Saturday morning in late September, The Corner Farmers Market in Greensboro’s Lindley Park neighborhood was an inviting place to be. Throngs of people — some with kids or dogs in tow — drifted from one tent to the next, browsing tables filled with fresh vegetables, baked goods, cut flowers and handmade crafts.

Beyond the friendly atmosphere and fresh offerings, the market offers another important benefit: shoppers who receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits can not only use them here — they can get double their value.

SNAP participants can visit the manager’s booth to swipe their benefits card, and the market matches the amount — up to $50 — by issuing tokens that can be used to purchase any SNAP-eligible food, market manager Kathy Newsom said.

“They can buy meat, eggs, any sorts of produce [or] prepared foods if they’re cold,” Newsom said.

While the U.S. Department of Agriculture reimburses the amount spent through SNAP, Corner Market must raise separate funds — through grants, community donations and frequent fundraisers — to cover the cost of the match, Newsom said.

“We have to raise about $50,000 a year to match the amount of demand that comes into our market.”

Market regular Dianne, 67, who preferred to use only her first name, said she appreciates that the market offers a discreet, respectful way for SNAP users to shop without stigma.

“Shopping at the market is a win for all of us,” she said. “We need the vendors, and the vendors need us.”

But cuts to the SNAP program embedded in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act recently passed by Congress threaten to jeopardize access to farmers markets for millions of Americans like Diane. In 2024, nearly 42 million people — about 12 percent of the U.S. population — received SNAP benefits each month, according to USDA data.

Because of the OBBBA, those benefits are due to shrink, with consumers and farmers taking the hits.

Mixed messages

As concerns mount about the scheduled program cuts, U.S. Health and Human Services Sec. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pledged to “Make America Healthy Again.”

A statement on the HHS website reads: “Under the leadership of Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., HHS is taking bold, decisive action to reform America’s food, health, and scientific systems to identify the root causes of the chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.”

Yet in September, the USDA announced it would discontinue its annual Household Food Security Reports, also known as the Food Insecurity Survey — the tool used to measure how many U.S. households struggle to put food on the table. Without the survey, it’ll be hard to track how well people are doing in getting access to healthy food.

SNAP is a key federal tool for reducing food insecurity. Without it, millions of Americans would be at greater risk of hunger or be forced to eat cheaper, lower-quality food.

In North Carolina, more than 1.4 million people — across more than 700,000 households — receive SNAP benefits each month. More than 600,000 children, 159,000 adults over 65 and more than 46,000 North Carolina veterans rely on SNAP, according to the state Department of Health and Human Services.

In response to the federal government shutdown, the state health department assured residents that October SNAP benefits would not be affected. The agency encouraged households to continue applying for services and said it will post updates as new information becomes available from the USDA. Those with additional questions are urged to contact their local county department of social services, according to information provided on the agency’s webpage.

Mutual benefits

Maggie Funkhouser, the North Carolina Farmers Market Network program coordinator, emphasized the dual purpose of accepting SNAP benefits at farmers markets: expanding food access and supporting the local farm economy.

“[We] estimate that SNAP incentives make up about 20 percent of total sales at farmers markets — and 20 percent is huge,” Funkhouser said.

“If incentives get folks into that market to be able to buy highly nutritious, fresh, culturally relevant food — to support our farmers [and] connect them with our consumers who use SNAP — that’s the goal,” she said.

“We’re able to accept SNAP through the farmers market,” said Brittany Peters, who with her partner, Richard Raggi, operates Sun and Soil Farm in Madison, about 25 miles from Greensboro. The couple sell fruits, vegetables and flowers at the Corner Market.

“It’s a huge deal, because it makes our food more accessible to everybody,” Peters said.

That kind of accessibility — and the income it generates — is especially valuable for small farms, many of which operate on tight margins and face limited funding options.

The support is essential, said Roland McReynolds, executive director of Carolina Farm Stewardship Association, a nonprofit that advocates for sustainable, local and organic food systems. He explained that the federal government — primarily through the USDA and the farm bill that’s reauthorized every few years — has historically provided the main safety net for U.S. agriculture. State governments, including North Carolina, rarely step into this role, he said, and when they do, it’s typically on an emergency basis, such as providing disaster relief after Hurricane Helene.

With growing budget pressures from programs like Medicaid and SNAP, most states are unlikely to fully absorb the burden if federal support declines.

Still, McReynolds said, the state can play a vital role in the event of future SNAP cuts.

“If the state can step in to provide funding for SNAP Double Up Bucks programs — [that] will absolutely be important for helping a lot of small farms stabilize their revenue into next year,” he said.

In addition, in some parts of the state where the now-defunct Healthy Opportunities Pilot was buying produce from local farms to provide to Medicaid recipients, growers will be losing another revenue stream.

“In the Helene-impacted part of the state, there are a lot of farmers who got hit really hard last year,” McReynolds added. “They’re trying to make it this year, but when they run their numbers at the end of this year, we may be looking at a significant number of farmers who don’t come back for next year’s growing season.”

Uncertainty going forward

In response to questions about how North Carolina will support the more than 1 million residents who rely on monthly SNAP benefits, DHHS explained in an email that starting October 2026, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes provisions that would significantly reduce federal reimbursement rates to states for administering SNAP. That shift will force North Carolina’s 100 counties, which handle SNAP applications and eligibility, to absorb a greater share of administrative costs.

“NCDHHS will continue to work with county partners to drive down error rates, which determine the state cost share amount,” a department spokesperson said in an email. “Despite these challenges, the mission of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services remains unchanged — we will continue to work to improve the health and well-being of all North Carolinians.”

With the federal government shut down, combined with SNAP funding under pressure, questions persist about the future of SNAP — and what could happen to access to fresh produce at places like the Corner Farmers Market.

Operational since August, the facility aims to strengthen grid reliability in the Houston area, where capacity demand is sharply increasing.

Located approximately 40 kilometres south of downtown Houston, the project is based on Tesla Inc.’s Megapack 2 XL technology, manufactured in California. The two-hour duration facility operates under a long-term power purchase agreement with an investment-grade off-taker, ensuring stable long-term revenue.

Structured financing to accelerate deployment

The project’s financing was led by Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale (Nord/LB) and MUFG Bank, acting as co-lead arrangers. The structure includes a tax equity bridge loan, construction-to-term loan, and letters of credit. A traditional tax equity partnership was also used, reflecting a combination of debt and federal incentive structures to speed up the facility’s deployment.

Nightpeak Energy submitted Bocanova Power’s interconnection request in mid-2023. Two years later, the facility is operational, demonstrating the company’s ability to quickly deliver complex energy infrastructure.

Strategy focused on dispatchable capacity expansion

Founded in 2022, Nightpeak Energy currently operates 240 MW of combined energy storage and natural gas generation capacity. The company is focused on Texas and the Western United States, where the growth of intermittent renewable energy has created a critical need for flexible assets capable of responding to grid fluctuations.

This focus also addresses rising electricity demand driven by the expansion of data centres and industrial sites. Nightpeak Energy executives highlight the urgency of deploying dispatchable resources to meet growing demand and ensure grid stability across key U.S. markets.

Financial partners’ role in project development

MUFG Bank, administrative agent for the financing, stated that the project demonstrates how international banks can support local energy infrastructure while contributing to regional economic growth. Nord/LB also played a key role in structuring the financing, enabling the rapid deployment of battery storage capacity in a strategic Texas location.

Still, all experts WIRED spoke to stressed that ending GHGRP data collection would severely hobble U.S. efforts to measure and combat greenhouse gas emissions, no matter how good the non-federal options are.","The Environmental Protection Agency announced last month that it would stop making polluting companies report their greenhouse gas emissions to it, eliminating a crucial tool the U.S. uses to track emissions and form climate policy. Climate NGOs say their work could help plug some of the data gap, but they and other experts fear the EPA’s work can’t be fully matched.

This story was originally published by WIRED and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

“I don’t think this system can be fully replaced,” says Joseph Goffman, the former assistant administrator at the EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation. “I think it could be approximated — but it’s going to take time.”

The Clean Air Act requires states to collect data on local pollution levels, which states then turn over to the federal government. For the past 15 years, the EPA has also collected data on carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases from sources around the country that emit over a certain threshold of emissions. This program is known as the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, or GHGRP, and “is really the backbone of the air quality reporting system in the United States,” says Kevin Gurney, a professor of atmospheric science at Northern Arizona University.

Like a myriad of other data-collection processes that have been stalled or halted since the start of this year, the Trump administration has put this program in the crosshairs. In March, the EPA announced it would be reconsidering the GHGRP program entirely. In September, the agency trotted out a proposed rule to eliminate reporting obligations from sources ranging from power plants to oil and gas refineries to chemical facilities — all major sources of greenhouse gas emissions. (The agency claims that rolling back the GHGRP will save $2.4 billion in regulatory costs, and that the program is “nothing more than bureaucratic red tape that does nothing to improve air quality.”)

Joseph says shutting down this program hamstrings “the government’s basic practical capacity to formulate climate policy.” Understanding how new emissions-reduction technologies are working, or surveying which industries are decarbonizing and which are not, “is extremely hard to do if you don’t have this data.”

Data collected by the GHGRP, which is publicly available, underpins much of federal climate policy: Understanding which sectors are contributing which kinds of emissions is the first step in forming strategies to draw those emissions down. This data is also the backbone of much of international U.S. climate policy: Collection of greenhouse gas emissions data is mandated by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which undergirds the Paris Agreement. (While the U.S. exited the Paris Agreement for the second time on the first day of Trump’s second term, it remains — tenuously — a part of the UNFCCC.) Data collected by the GHGRP is also crucial to state and local climate policies, helping policymakers outside the federal government take stock of local pollution, form emissions-reductions goals, and track progress on bringing down emissions.

There’s some hope that nongovernmental actors could help. In recent years, various groups have stepped up to the table to help calculate greenhouse gas emissions from sources both in the U.S. and nationwide. These groups use a mix of federal, state, industry, and private data — from oil and gas industry databases to public and private satellites to federal data like what the EPA provides — to create tools that help policymakers and the public understand where greenhouse gas emissions are coming from, and how they impact people in various ways. Technology has also grown leaps and bounds, too, as artificial intelligence models are getting more advanced at both tracking and modeling emissions from different sources.

In the days since the EPA’s announcement, groups collecting and modeling emissions data say that they are fielding calls from various stakeholders trying to figure out solutions if the EPA revokes the program. Goffman, who left the EPA at the start of this year, says that there are staff within the agency looking to “connect or become part of university efforts” to continue data collection.

One of the most high-profile efforts in nongovernmental emissions modeling is a coalition called Climate TRACE, which was founded in 2019, following a donation from Google, to observe global emissions using satellites. The group, which has since grown to more than 100 collaborating organizations, has developed a host of AI models that they pair with data from various sources to track and model emissions from around the world.

There’s a dark timing, says cofounder Gavin McCormick, in having the EPA move to end the GHGRP after Climate TRACE has built its models relying so heavily on EPA data. “We started this project on the thesis that America has the world’s best emissions monitoring, and other countries could reduce emissions faster if they got up to the same quality as America,” McCormick says. “We just spent five years building this AI system to try to make it possible for other countries to have an approximation of the same system America has.”

It’s not just the climate-conscious who are worried about the future of this data: There’s significant industry interest in continuing to collect national data on greenhouse gas emissions. Just because the U.S. government is no longer invested in tracking climate change doesn’t mean the rest of the world is on board. Oil and gas companies with facilities in the U.S., for instance, still have a financial interest to keep track of their emissions if they’re selling to other markets — like Europe, which is beginning to impose strict methane requirements on gas imported into the bloc.

“Our phones have been blowing up over the last ten days or so, from people saying, ‘Should we start reporting to you now? You’re not an official source, but you’re the closest thing there is,’” says McCormick. “It’s not obvious to me that we are the right vehicle for that. But there are very clear business interests in why companies would want to continue reporting even though they don’t have to.”

Private industry data could also be used to help track greenhouse gas emissions — and even covers some emissions that aren’t captured in the EPA data. The Rocky Mountain Institute, for instance, a nonprofit that works on market-based climate solutions, runs an index based on private industry data that tracks emissions from across the oil and gas production cycle. (RMI is part of the Climate TRACE coalition.) This private data enables this index to have insights into emissions from the industry that the GHGRP may have missed or undercalculated — including calculating emissions from sources that don’t meet the cutoff for reporting.

Still, all experts WIRED spoke to stressed that ending GHGRP data collection would severely hobble U.S. efforts to measure and combat greenhouse gas emissions, no matter how good the non-federal options are. There’s a myriad of difficulties that face any organization that tries to take on this monumental task.

“If the EPA stopped requiring this, it’s entirely possible that states will continue to do it,” says Gurney. But, he says, “there is no [other] central warehouse to do the collating. Fifty entities turning in data files, which are massively complex, is just a huge endeavor. The EPA plays such an important role as this kind of data arbiter, ensuring that it’s all complying with standardization. That’s key for the rest of us, frankly, to not have to do that ourselves, which would be pretty much a prohibitive barrier for us to be able to make sense of that amount of data.”

There are many different ways to calculate emissions; the techniques used to collect and model data can also differ between different organizations and experts. Gurney, for instance, has been a vocal critic of the way Climate TRACE designs its models. The EPA’s pollution reporting requirements, meanwhile, are also backed by law: “A nongovernmental entity really can’t require that,” Goffman says.

There’s also an open question of whether nongovernmental estimates could hold up legally, especially if a policy formed using these estimates is challenged in court. In Louisiana, a law passed last year seriously restricts the ability of communities to use low-cost emissions-monitoring devices to track air quality and bring complaints or lawsuits about emissions violations; air monitoring must now be solely done by EPA-approved tools. (Groups who advocate for communities living near oil and gas facilities filed a lawsuit in May, saying that the tools are prohibitively expensive for local advocates and claiming the law is a “blatant violation of the free speech rights of community members to use their own independent air pollution monitoring to raise alarms about deadly chemicals being released into their own homes and schools.”)

That law “really drove home to me that this is only partly a scientific and do-you-have-the-data question, and partly an are-you-legally-allowed-to-use-that-dataset question,” says McCormick.

SEOUL, South Korea and DETROIT, Oct. 6, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Energy Tech Solution (ETS), a South Korea-based manufacturer of battery factory equipment, announced today the launch of the 'Made in America Cell Foundry' to help battery startups commercialize faster. North American energy storage innovators can reduce tariff risk, avoid costly Capex and iterate efficiently by relying on trusted contract manufacturing in Michigan.

Early-stage companies face many obstacles while standing up manufacturing operations. Common hurdles like procurement, equipment downtime and scrap rate can waste significant amounts of cash during a startup's early years. By working with a contract manufacturer, startups can shift that risk to a vendor with a fixed-cost contract and preserve their runway.

Today, an American battery organization seeking end-to-end contract manufacturing support must either offshore or work with research labs with limited capacity. Energy Tech Solution has stepped up to fill that gap.

""Energy Tech Solution believes in the American battery industry,"" said Hans Kim, co-CEO of Energy Tech Solution. ""After serving dozens of Asian battery organizations with contract manufacturing in Seoul, we're thrilled to bring these capabilities to the United States and support the country's incredible innovation landscape.""

The 'Made in America Cell Foundry' is a complete contract manufacturing solution. Energy Tech Solution builds factory equipment for every stage of the battery manufacturing process and then uses that same equipment to quickly create bespoke processes for customers. US-based battery startups can come to the 'Made in America Cell Foundry' with nothing more than a written recipe and receive battery cells within weeks. Cylindrical, prismatic and pouch cell formats are happily accommodated.

Startups that rely on the Made in America Cell Foundry during their early years can mature their organizations more quickly. Upon achieving commercial traction, those companies can work with Energy Tech Solution consultants to stand up their first factory.

Dr. Bruno Vanzieleghem, chief executive officer of ETS North America, added, ""I've seen from experience that early-stage battery startups focus on raising capital to build out pilot production capabilities, but often lack the expertise to effectively use those assets. They burn significant time and money streamlining their pilot manufacturing operations to deliver proof-of-concept cells to potential customers. I want to help those startups save their valuable cash so they can bring novel technology all the way to market.""

Germany’s ruling coalition confirmed it will extend a tax exemption for new electric vehicles as part of a broader effort to support the nation’s key car industry in the transition to more climate-friendly technologies.

Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil will present a draft law soon which will keep the existing tax exemption for EVs in place until 2035, Maximilian Kall, a finance ministry spokesman, said Oct. 6 at a regular government news conference in Berlin.

“To get significantly more electric cars on the road in the coming years, we need to set the right incentives now,” Klingbeil, a member of the Social Democrat Party who is also the vice chancellor, told dpa news agency.

The coalition accord agreed on by Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s conservatives and Klingbeil’s SPD included the pledge to extend the incentive to 2035, and the confirmation comes ahead of a planned “car summit” Oct. 9 between government officials, auto executives and labor representatives.

The meeting hosted by Merz at the chancellery will focus on ways to help the car industry navigate mounting challenges ranging from Chinese competition to U.S. trade tariffs and stubbornly high energy costs.

Announcements last month that Volkswagen AG was paring back production and Robert Bosch GmbH slashing 13,000 jobs were the latest evidence of how the auto industry’s decline is rippling through Europe’s biggest economy.

Car parts maker ZF Friedrichshafen AG followed last week by saying it planned to eliminate 7,600 positions at its electrified drivetrain division as it steps up its restructuring efforts to deal with poor demand.

“We now need a strong package to guide Germany’s automotive industry into the future and secure jobs,” Klingbeil said. “We want the best cars to continue to be made in Germany.”

Extending the EV exemption is expected to cost the federal government approximately 600 million euros ($703 million) in lost revenue through 2029, Kall told reporters.

As part of his government’s effort to aid the car sector, Merz last month urged the European Union to give up its 2035 deadline to effectively ban combustion engines and instead allow the industry to pursue a softer path to climate neutrality.

“We haven’t agreed on a joint position on the matter within the coalition, but I hope that this will happen soon,” Merz said in a television interview with n-tv broadcaster.

“I don’t want Germany to be among the member states that stick to this wrong ban.”

Some members of Klingbeil’s SPD, including Environment Minister Carsten Schneider, are unhappy with the move, but the party is expected to signal its backing later this week, with the issue set to be discussed at regular coalition talks Oct. 8 in Berlin.

Olaf Lies, the SPD premier of the state of Lower Saxony whose government is VW’s second-biggest shareholder, said last week the priority should be to protect jobs.

""These are big packages that we put together to help keep Minnesota energy effective, efficient, and have fewer disruptions and keep costs down for ratepayers,"" Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minnesota) said.
The largest terminated grant in Minnesota involves a $464 million award to the Minnesota Department of Commerce, related to upgrading the electrical transmission lines across seven Midwestern states.
The other cancellations involve millions of dollars in reductions to major power companies in Minnesota, such as Minnesota Power in Duluth that serves northeastern Minnesota, Otter Tail Power, Cummins Electrified Power and Native Sun Community Power Development for tribal communities.
The $50 million grant termination associated with Minnesota Power and ALLETE, Inc., was part of a broader modernization project.","SAINT PAUL, Minn. — Minnesota stands to lose more than $600 million in federal energy grants after the Trump administration terminated about a dozen projects connected to the state, according to lists provided by the U.S. Department of Energy and a member of Minnesota's Congressional delegation.

Shortly after the government shutdown began last week, the Department of Energy announced the cuts in Minnesota and a handful of other largely Democratic states, totaling more than $7.5 billion. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has denied that the program cancellations had anything to do with the shutdown and said the agency reviewed the merits of the projects for months.

""A team of seven or eight people have evaluated over 2,400 projects just on business conditions, whether it makes sense for the American taxpayers or not,"" Wright said. ""So no, I mean timing of announcements, I don't control that always. But these decisions are made all in the Energy Department, all based on facts.""

Democrats, meanwhile, have widely viewed the grant terminations as retribution for the shutdown, given the concentration in blue states. The cancelled projects are largely, though not exclusively, focused on issues around climate change, renewable energy and energy efficiency.

""These are big packages that we put together to help keep Minnesota energy effective, efficient, and have fewer disruptions and keep costs down for ratepayers,"" Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minnesota) said. ""This is being punitive, this is being harmful, this, in my opinion, almost bears to be childish.""

The largest terminated grant in Minnesota involves a $464 million award to the Minnesota Department of Commerce, related to upgrading the electrical transmission lines across seven Midwestern states. A Commerce spokesperson said Monday that the department still has not been formally notified about the cancellation, but last week, the agency argued the cuts could be potentially illegal if true.

The other cancellations involve millions of dollars in reductions to major power companies in Minnesota, such as Minnesota Power in Duluth that serves northeastern Minnesota, Otter Tail Power, Cummins Electrified Power and Native Sun Community Power Development for tribal communities.

The $50 million grant termination associated with Minnesota Power and ALLETE, Inc., was part of a broader modernization project. DFL State Sen. Grant Hauschild said the state had already come forward with $25 million in matching grant money for that project.

""These are competitive, merit-based grants at the federal level that we were going toward clean energy infrastructure,"" Hauschild said, ""toward our energy grid, making sure we have the power we need.""

The list of terminated projects also includes initiatives such as an American Lung Association car-sharing program for the east side of St. Paul.

""That project, called Greater East Side Expansion, was designed to empower East Side Saint Paul residents to determine how carshare can improve access to jobs, shopping, and healthcare, while also reducing air pollution,"" the American Lung Association wrote in a statement to KARE 11. ""This DOE announcement is a definite setback to this work, although we are still moving forward on other work to expand the carshare network on the East Side of Saint Paul.""

Another significant project on the list of terminations includes $70 million for Xcel Energy, involving a battery project in Colorado and Minnesota to store renewable energy. The Minnesota plant associated with that project is based in Becker, which falls in Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Emmer's district.

Emmer, who also serves in House leadership as Majority Whip, said on a press call with local media last week that Democrats were to blame for the shutdown. He said he had not spoken with the U.S. Department of Energy about the termination of the Xcel funding in his district.

""The battery project in Becker, why would I be talking to them?"" Emmer said. ""I need to be talking to Amy (Klobuchar) and Tina (Smith) and Chuck Schumer and telling them, knock it off.""

In an interview, Senator Smith responded by saying that ""it is the Republican administration that cancelled these grants.""

""So I don't know how you could blame Democrats, who are not doing any of this,"" Smith said. ""What I would say to Rep. Emmer is, I am fighting to get Congress to act to stop a massive increase in health insurance premiums.""",https://media.kare11.com/assets/KARE/images/e4615ec2-7811-402a-943a-3125cd0593fe/20251006T225038/e4615ec2-7811-402a-943a-3125cd0593fe_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 02:59:30.490786

Nuclear energy has emerged as a top energy priority in the U.S., with significant investments and ambitious timelines for achieving criticality.

The Department of Energy announced its Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program in June, fast-tracking 11 projects with a goal launch date of July 4 for at least three of the plans.

American energy startup Aalo Atomics was tapped for the initiative. It's constructing a facility, Aalo-X, adjacent to the ​​Idaho National Laboratory Materials and Fuels Complex in Idaho Falls.

Aalo Atomics' experimental extra modular nuclear reactor is based on advanced nuclear reactors known as small modular reactors. Aalo looks to take the concept further, expanding upon SMRs to develop a reactor that is more flexible and easily deployable.

Aalo Atomics CEO Matt Loszak said the startup had power-hungry data centers in mind when developing Aalo-X's XMR.

""We believe that to address today's massive data center market demand, another category of nuclear reactor is needed, one that blends the benefit of the factory manufacturing of microreactors, the power levels of SMRs, and the economic targets of a large reactor,"" he explained.

As cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels go, nuclear energy has long had something of an image problem.

This is partly due to high-profile nuclear incidents in the 1970s and 1980s, but experts say much of that distrust was based on feelings, not facts — and the technology has come a long way in the intervening decades.

It's true that despite rapid advancements and support from tech titans such as Bill Gates, nuclear energy has its cons. The Union of Concerned Scientists took a balanced yet cautious stance on advanced nuclear energy in 2021, outlining both sides.

Nuclear power generates waste that must be managed properly, and facilities remain ""vulnerable to catastrophic accidents and sabotage,"" the former of which is sometimes unavoidable. The UCS also expressed concerns that nuclear plants could be repurposed to build destructive weapons.

However, in contrast to planet-warming dirty fuels, nuclear remains a low-carbon source of energy, one that provides nearly 20% of the country's electricity. If progress continues, nuclear power could soon play a more significant role in America's energy supply.

""​​Our selection for the Nuclear Reactor Pilot Program is a significant catalyst for achieving our goal of going from founding to fission in less than three years — a feat many deemed impossible just a year ago,"" Loszak told Interesting Engineering.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/MoIpEjjoLswYTGyiXGObMg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03OTY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/104af4de0986625b450eb2de5acb8c6c,N,,2025-10-07 03:58:58.796885

India saw record solar and wind growth that outpaced the growth in demand.
“This report highlights an encouraging step in the opposite direction.” But in the U.S., demand growth outpaced the growth of clean power generation.
The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.
“The federal government is greatly increasing the growth of artificial intelligence, which is going to massively increase electricity demand, and they’re also shutting down the cheapest new sources of electricity, wind and solar.","Worldwide solar and wind power generation has outpaced electricity demand this year, and for the first time on record, renewable energies combined generated more power than coal, according to a new analysis.

Global solar generation grew by a record 31% in the first half of the year, while wind generation grew by 7.7%, according to the report by the energy think tank Ember, which was released after midnight Tuesday London time. Solar and wind generation combined grew by more than 400 terawatt hours, which was more than overall global demand increased in the same period, it found.

The findings suggest it is possible for the world to wean off polluting sources of power — even as demand for electricity skyrockets — with continued investment in renewables including solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal energies.

“That means that they can keep up the pace with growing appetite for electricity worldwide,” said Małgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, senior electricity analyst at Ember and lead author of the study.

At the same time, total fossil fuel generation dropped slightly, by less than 1%.

“The fall overall of fossil may be small, but it is significant,” said Wiatros-Motyka. “This is a turning point when we see emissions plateauing.”

The firm analyzes monthly data from 88 countries representing the vast majority of electricity demand around the world. Reasons that demand is increasing include economic growth, electric vehicles and data centers, rising populations in developing countries and the need for more cooling as temperatures rise.

Meeting that demand by burning fossil fuels such as coal and gas for electricity releases planet-warming gases including carbon dioxide and methane. This leads to more severe, costly and deadly extreme weather.

Analyzing major markets

Ember also dedicated part of its report to an analysis of China, India, the European Union and the U.S. Combined, they account for nearly two-thirds of electricity generation and carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector globally.

In the first six months of the year, China added more solar and wind than the rest of the world combined, and its fossil fuel generation fell by 2%, the report said.

India saw record solar and wind growth that outpaced the growth in demand. India’s fossil fuel generation also dropped.

In both nations, emissions fell.

“It’s often been said by analysts that renewable energy doesn’t really lead to a reduction in fossil fuel use,” said Michael Gerrard, founder and director of the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, who was not involved in the report. “This report highlights an encouraging step in the opposite direction.”

But in the U.S., demand growth outpaced the growth of clean power generation. In the E.U., sluggish wind and hydropower generation contributed to higher coal and gas generation, the report said. In both markets, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased.

Challenges in the US

The U.S. clean energy market faces challenges as President Donald Trump’s administration shifts federal policy away from renewables and toward boosting coal, oil and gas production. The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.

Meanwhile, the administration has lifted barriers to coal mining, granted two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants and other polluting industries and dedicated millions of dollars to these coal plants.

In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly last month, Trump attacked renewable energy and questioned the validity of the concept of climate change.

Experts warn that Trump’s efforts to block clean energy will have a long-term impact.

“The federal government is greatly increasing the growth of artificial intelligence, which is going to massively increase electricity demand, and they’re also shutting down the cheapest new sources of electricity, wind and solar. That’s going to lead to a gap in supply and demand,” Gerrard said.

Renewables “still have an opportunity to make inroads in to displacing fossil fuels, even with some demand growth,” said Amanda Smith, senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown, who also wasn’t involved in the report. But, Smith said: “I am very cautiously optimistic that renewables can continue to grow and continue to displace fossil fuels in the U.S. I am more optimistic on the world scale.”

Now, as Entergy Mississippi embarks upon the latter half of its 102nd year, it continues to champion its legacy of innovation and dynamism within the electrical industry.
The market may be changing rapidly, presenting a plethora of new challenges, but Entergy Mississippi is harnessing new opportunities to support its communities.
On the topic of environmental impact, Entergy Mississippi is also making significant strides into new renewable energies; in particular, nuclear.","Take an Arkansas visionary, a handshake and a new industry that’ll change the course of the world forever, and you’re transported back in time to the birth of Entergy Mississippi. Founded by Arkansas businessman, Harvey Couch, back in 1923, the business initially started out under the name of ‘The Mississippi Power & Light Company’, acquiring several utility systems throughout Jackson, Columbus, Greenville, and Vicksburg, right at the rise of the electrical industry. Today, Entergy Mississippi is a true powerhouse, leading the state of Mississippi at the forefront of energy innovation.

Energy, Oil & Gas last sat down with Entergy Mississippi in 2023 in celebration of one of its most significant milestones to date: its 100-year anniversary. Commemorating a century of excellence, Haley Fisackerly, Entergy Mississippi’s Chief Executive Officer, shared exclusive insight into the company’s heritage and how it continues to evolve with the industry, keeping affordability and reliability at its core. Now, as Entergy Mississippi embarks upon the latter half of its 102nd year, it continues to champion its legacy of innovation and dynamism within the electrical industry. The market may be changing rapidly, presenting a plethora of new challenges, but Entergy Mississippi is harnessing new opportunities to support its communities.

In September 2025, Haley rejoins Energy, Oil & Gas to offer an update on how the company has progressed. “What’s happened in the two years since we last spoke has been amazing. As we enter our next century of service, we are seeing a transformation in the business like we’ve never seen before,” Haley reveals. “When we were founded 100 years ago, electricity was still a new industry, and now, the industry is seeing a rebirth; a lot of manufacturing is moving back to the United States, and there’s been a huge growth in the number of data centers, cloud storage hubs, machine learning and artificial intelligence. We’re excited because this growth will allow us to better serve our customers and communities.”

In terms of new developments, Entergy Mississippi has been thrilled to announce perhaps its biggest partnership to date: a major data center project with Amazon Web Services (AWS). For a company that’s committed to empowering its communities, this project is monumental for Entergy Mississippi. Regarded as the ‘largest economic win in Mississippi history’, AWS’ investment in the state will change the lives of many, creating thousands of new jobs, generating significant tax revenue and funding an increasing number of charitable and philanthropic projects for communities.

“We entered into an agreement with AWS to provide two data center campuses in Madison County, which is a part of the Entergy Mississippi service territory. It’s the largest economic project in state history, fivefold,” Haley affirms. “AWS has committed over $10 billion to the state of Mississippi, which will create more than 1000 new jobs: it’s a real win for our customers and communities. These investments are also allowing us to pull two of our later-planned power plants forward, which will be a real benefit to our customers.

“Growth is very important when it comes to serving our customers because the more money we spend, the more cost we’re adding to the business, and if our customer base isn’t growing then that cost gets transferred to our customers. When 20 percent of your customers live below the national poverty level, you must be cognizant of that, so we were very aggressive in finding a partner like AWS to come in and help us to grow, invest and unlock new technologies.”

As Haley explains, this investment will accelerate Entergy Mississippi’s planned infrastructure upgrade projects, without transferring the cost to its consumers – a major win for the company and its customers alike. One of such projects is Entergy Mississippi’s Delta Blues Advanced Power Station, situated in Greenville, Mississippi. Focusing heavily on sustainable operation, Delta Blues is set to be a 745-megawatt facility able to power nearly 400,000 homes across Entergy Mississippi’s service area, which will significantly increase the quality and reliability of the energy provided to its customers.

“We recently broke ground on this $1.2 billion project, so it is under construction as we speak – a very highly efficient plant that uses less water, has less emissions and is much quieter. We’re going to install Mitsubishi turbines into the plant, which are 50 percent more efficient than what they’re replacing, and we’re building the plant in such a way that it can be retrofitted to use hydrogen fuel when it becomes more economic. We’re also building the plant to be adaptable to carbon capture capability, so that our CO2 emissions can be sequestered and not admitted into the environment,” Haley elaborates.

On the topic of environmental impact, Entergy Mississippi is also making significant strides into new renewable energies; in particular, nuclear. Haley comments: “We’ve been speaking with potential customers on partnerships within that arrangement. In the last couple of weeks [at the time of writing], we filed a request at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to extend an early site permit at our Grand Gulf nuclear power plant in Claiborne County, Mississippi. We won the ESP permit for that site back in 2007, which is now set to expire in 2027, but we’re currently working with the new Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Trump Administration on seeking an extension for another 20 years. That’s very important to us because it would help us to accelerate and reduce costs on another plant if we were to look at building one; it’s something we’re studying very carefully.

“For example, we’re looking at new technologies such as small modular reactors, which are greater passive safety systems than what we currently use today,” he continues. “We’re making investments in upgrading our transmission systems with more resilient, robust structures, as well as into various other grid enhancement technologies, to ensure that the grid is stable and operating at its highest capability.”

With all these developments well underway, Entergy Mississippi is positioned for an exciting 12 months and an even more exciting future. Continuing to build upon its past legacies, Entergy Mississippi enters a new era defined by ambition, innovation and technological advancement, taking both its customers and communities into the future together. Haley concludes by sharing what the next chapter holds for Entergy Mississippi.

“Now, we aim to look for other productive growth opportunities to serve our communities. Reliability and affordability remain at the front of our customers’ minds, and the new revenue generated by AWS is going to allow us to make further investments to offset the rate impacts to them,” he finishes, optimistic for the years ahead. “We’ll be rolling out a new reliability plan over the next five years to really drive that service and make the grid more reliable; we intend to introduce more self-healing networks to sense problems on the grid before they result in outages.

“When I talked about this being a transformational period within the industry, it’s worth noting that the United States is looking at energy dominance surrounding AI, and Entergy is making this happen – not just with us, but with our sister companies in Louisiana and Arkansas as well. We’re working to bring these opportunities forward, not only to benefit our customers and communities, but to unlock a new era of investment in the United States going forward.”",https://energy-oil-gas.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/Entergy-Mississippi-228-headline-image.jpg,N,,2025-10-07 01:59:41.406088

At the same time, the state has avoided more than 742,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions.
The Murphy administration had banked on using offshore wind as a major provider of future clean power.
An independent group backing Republican Jack Ciattarelli and the Ciattarelli campaign have ads distorting comments Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-11th) made about clean energy and its cost.
She blamed Trump’s cancelling new clean energy projects for increasing costs to ratepayers.","Climate change – which is causing sea levels to rise and heat waves to last longer and be more intense — has taken a back seat to affordability issues in political campaigns, but recent spikes in utility bills have made it a key issue in this year’s race for New Jersey governor.

According to NASA, human activities – primarily the burning of coal, petroleum, natural gas and other fossil fuels – have led to an average 1.8-degree increase in the earth’s temperature since the pre-industrial era of 1850-1900 and that temperature continues to rise .36 degrees each decade. The Paris Climate Accords seeks to limit the temperature rise to 2.7 degrees or no more than 3.6 degrees by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels by half by 2030.

Under Gov. Phil Murphy, New Jersey has taken aggressive steps to reduce the state’s impact on climate change which include a detailed energy master plan and a target of 100% clean energy in the state by 2035. These and other actions are meant to address current and predicted impacts on the state, including more intense storms, sea levels creeping up on ocean and bay beaches, impaired water quality, more drought conditions and degraded air quality.

As part of its efforts, the administration rejoined the Regional Greenhouse Gase Initiative, or RGGI, a market-based system in the northeast that aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. Under the system fossil fuel plants essentially pay to emit greenhouse gases and participating states receive funding from the sale of carbon allowances. In total, New Jersey has received more than $1 billion through the program, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection. New Jersey has awarded close to $233 million of that to about 400 clean energy and climate mitigation projects that include solar power, clean trucks and buses, charging infrastructure, the restoration of tidal marshes and investments in energy efficiency. At the same time, the state has avoided more than 742,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions.

The Murphy administration had banked on using offshore wind as a major provider of future clean power. But developer Ørsted pulled out, citing inflation and supply chain issues as setbacks. Since January, the Trump administration has taken several actions that have essentially ended the ability of companies to develop offshore wind farms. Atlantic Shores, which was to have been located off the coast between Atlantic City and Barnegat Light and provided enough power for roughly 1 million homes, ended its development effort.

Earlier this year, PJM Interconnection, the energy grid operator for New Jersey, held energy auctions that led to increased electricity costs of about 20% for ratepayers as of June. Another increase is expected next June. The state responded by giving about $430 million in direct relief to electric customers with at least $100 per customer and $150 for those with lower incomes.

Supply and demand are responsible for the higher prices, experts say. The higher demand for power is driven largely by the increase in data centers that deliver artificial intelligence applications, as well as hotter temperatures driving the need for air conditioning. And the power supply is not keeping up with that increased demand due in large part to a logjam at PJM of new energy sources seeking to connect to the grid and replace older coal-burning plants that have retired. New Jersey’s last coal-fired power plant closed in mid-2022.

The consumer concern over higher energy prices is considered so important this year that it is key in campaign messages to potential voters.

An independent group backing Republican Jack Ciattarelli and the Ciattarelli campaign have ads distorting comments Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-11th) made about clean energy and its cost. The YouTube page for the ad from Restore New Jersey shows that it has had more than 2.3 million views since Sept. 11. The New Jersey State Democratic Committee has posted on X, formerly Twitter, a short clip from Ciattarelli during a Fox News interview where he seems to say much the electricity rate hike is helping his campaign. The ad cuts off his full response.

Here are the candidates’ positions on climate change, clean energy and rising utility costs:

Republican Jack Ciattarelli

Ciattarelli acknowledges that climate change is real and that it’s “due to human activity.” But he disagrees with Murphy’s approach and has vowed to pull the state out of RGGI. New Jersey’s air quality is influenced by what happens in Pennsylvania, whose membership in RGGI is currently on hold while its state supreme court decides a challenge to it. Unlike New Jersey, which closed its last coal burning plant three years ago, they still operated in Pennsylvania. Ciattarelli said that getting out of RGGI will save ratepayers between $300 million and $500 million because electric companies are passing on the costs they have to pay to generate power, although environmentalists contend ratepayers are saving money because the state is a member of RGGI.

“The way to get down the monthly electric bill is to pull out of RGGI on day one, and I will by executive order,” Ciattarelli said in answer to a question from NJ Spotlight News while campaigning last month in Clinton.

At the same time, Ciattarelli said he plans to create a state Department of Energy, eliminated as a state department in 1988, to help reduce electricity rates.

“I don’t need 1-or-200 people, I need 12 policy experts that will work in partnership with the executive branch,” Ciattarelli said. “I do not believe that energy policy should be coming out of the BPU (Board of Public Utilities) or the DEP. Those are regulatory agencies. We need a department of energy that gives us a rational energy plan that solves the current electricity crisis and points us in the right direction for the future.”

He said he could find enough money to cut from the state budget to fund the new department.

Ciattarelli said he will implement a different state energy master plan that includes natural gas, which is a fossil fuel, and nuclear and solar power, but not offshore wind. He pledged to ban wind farms from being built off the coast.

Another vow from Ciattarelli is to “repeal unrealistic and unaffordable state mandates regarding electric vehicle sales, household appliances, home renovation and home construction.” Murphy set goals for adding electric vehicles to the state vehicle fleet and ending the sale of gas-powered vehicles by 2035.

Democrat Mikie Sherrill

Freezing utility costs is Sherrill’s signature energy proposal, saying she would declare a state of emergency on utility costs on her first day in office. Gov. Phil Murphy and others have questioned whether the governor would have the power to do this, but Sherrill’s campaign chairman Sen. Vin Gopal and Stefanie Brand, the former head of the state Division of Rate Counsel, say they think she can. Sherrill pledged no utility rate increases over her first year in office.

“So immediately, as I put that out, we see an open letter from utility companies saying, we want to come to the table and be a part of the solution,” Sherrill told NJ Spotlight News during a campaign stop in Clinton. “We know that there is money coming in from RGGI or the BPU to defray some of these costs. Certainly, it’s a matter of, are you going to allow all of the agencies who failed to take on this problem, even though we saw it coming, to profit off the people of New Jersey or are you going to step in and be a strong leader and make sure that you’re driving change?”

In her position paper on energy costs and the environment, Sherrill said supports the need for New Jersey to do its part to alleviate climate change to help the state “hit our emissions and clean air goals.”

She pledged to expand cheaper and cleaner energy generation to “build an energy arsenal.” Sherrill said she would eliminate unnecessary red tape and make permitting easier for new projects, including solar and battery storage projects, and expedite upgrading the capacity of existing nuclear plants. She also said she would work to develop “new nuclear capacity” in Salem County.

Modernizing natural gas facilities is also part of her plan, with Sherrill promising to “make them cleaner and more efficient – which will lower costs, reduce carbon emissions, and boost reliability and energy independence right now.”

Sherrill, who has been endorsed by NRDC Action Fund and the state League of Conservation Voters, also said she would increase transparency and accountability for the state’s utilities, including the four electricity suppliers.

And she said she would have her attorney general, in coordination with other governors in the region, take the Trump administration and PJM to force them to allow the continued development of clean energy and connect new power generators to the grid.

Key Takeaways

Clean energy grants provide funding for projects that promote renewable energy and energy efficiency.

Eligibility criteria for clean energy grants may include project location, organization type, and project scope.

Research available clean energy grants through government agencies, non-profit organizations, and private foundations.

A solid project proposal for clean energy grants should include a clear project plan, budget, and expected impact.

Building collaborative partnerships with other organizations and stakeholders can strengthen a clean energy grant proposal.

Understanding the Eligibility Criteria

Before diving into the application process for clean energy grants, it is crucial for NGOs to thoroughly understand the eligibility criteria set forth by grant-making organizations. These criteria can vary significantly depending on the funding source, which may include government agencies, private foundations, or corporate sponsors. Common eligibility requirements often include the type of organization (non-profit status), project scope, geographic focus, and alignment with specific clean energy goals.

For instance, some grants may prioritize projects that serve low-income communities or those disproportionately affected by climate change. Others might focus on innovative technologies or educational initiatives. By carefully reviewing these criteria, NGOs can tailor their proposals to align with the funders’ priorities, thereby increasing their chances of securing funding.

Additionally, understanding eligibility can help organizations identify which grants are worth pursuing and which may not be a good fit for their mission or capabilities.

Researching Available Clean Energy Grants

Once eligibility criteria are understood, the next step is to conduct thorough research on available clean energy grants. This process involves identifying potential funding sources that align with the organization’s mission and project goals. Various online databases and resources can assist in this endeavor, such as Grants.gov, Foundation Center, and state-specific grant portals.

These platforms provide comprehensive listings of grants, including application deadlines, funding amounts, and specific requirements. Moreover, networking within the clean energy sector can yield valuable insights into upcoming grant opportunities. Attending conferences, workshops, and webinars focused on renewable energy can help NGO professionals connect with funders and other organizations that have successfully secured grants.

Engaging with local universities or research institutions can also provide access to collaborative opportunities and funding insights. By leveraging these resources, NGOs can create a targeted list of potential grants that align with their clean energy initiatives.

Creating a Solid Project Proposal

A well-crafted project proposal is the cornerstone of a successful grant application. It serves as a roadmap for funders to understand the project’s objectives, methodology, and anticipated outcomes. To create a compelling proposal, NGOs should begin by clearly defining the project’s goals and how they align with the funder’s mission.

This alignment is crucial; funders are more likely to support projects that resonate with their values and objectives. In addition to outlining goals, a strong proposal should include a detailed project plan that addresses implementation strategies, timelines, and measurable outcomes. Incorporating data and research to support the project’s feasibility can enhance credibility.

For example, if an NGO proposes a solar panel installation project, including statistics on energy savings and environmental impact can strengthen the case for funding. Furthermore, engaging stakeholders in the proposal development process can provide diverse perspectives and enhance the project’s overall design.

Building Collaborative Partnerships

Collaboration is a powerful strategy for NGOs seeking clean energy grants. By forming partnerships with other organizations, businesses, or government entities, NGOs can leverage shared resources and expertise to enhance their project proposals. Collaborative partnerships can also demonstrate to funders that there is community support and a broader impact potential for the proposed initiative.

For instance, an NGO focused on renewable energy education might partner with local schools to implement educational programs on sustainability. This partnership not only broadens the reach of the project but also showcases community engagement—a key factor that many funders look for in grant applications. Additionally, collaborating with businesses in the clean energy sector can provide access to technical expertise and resources that strengthen project implementation.

Demonstrating Community Impact

Funders are increasingly interested in understanding how their investments will create meaningful change within communities. Therefore, NGOs must articulate the anticipated community impact of their clean energy projects clearly. This involves not only outlining the direct benefits of the project—such as reduced energy costs or increased access to renewable energy—but also addressing broader social and environmental implications.

For example, an NGO implementing a community solar project could highlight how it will reduce energy poverty in low-income neighborhoods while also creating local jobs in installation and maintenance. Providing qualitative and quantitative data to support these claims can enhance credibility. Surveys, testimonials from community members, and case studies from similar projects can all serve as powerful tools to illustrate potential impact.

Budgeting and Financial Planning

A comprehensive budget is a critical component of any grant proposal. It provides funders with a clear understanding of how requested funds will be allocated and demonstrates the organization’s financial responsibility. When developing a budget for a clean energy project, NGOs should include all relevant costs—such as materials, labor, administrative expenses, and any indirect costs associated with project implementation.

Moreover, it is essential to justify each line item in the budget by explaining its relevance to the project’s goals. Funders appreciate transparency and clarity in budgeting; therefore, providing detailed explanations for costs can help build trust. Additionally, NGOs should consider including potential sources of matching funds or in-kind contributions from partners to demonstrate financial commitment and sustainability.

Navigating the Application Process

The application process for clean energy grants can be complex and competitive. To navigate this landscape effectively, NGOs should develop a clear timeline that outlines key milestones—from initial research to final submission. This timeline should account for all necessary steps, including gathering supporting documents, obtaining letters of support from partners, and allowing time for revisions based on feedback from colleagues or mentors.

Additionally, NGOs should pay close attention to application guidelines provided by funders. Each grant may have specific formatting requirements or questions that need to be addressed in particular ways. Adhering strictly to these guidelines is crucial; failure to do so can result in disqualification from consideration.

Engaging in peer reviews or seeking feedback from experienced grant writers can also enhance the quality of the application before submission.

Engaging with Local Government and Agencies

Building relationships with local government officials and agencies can significantly enhance an NGO’s chances of securing clean energy grants. Local governments often have insights into available funding opportunities and may even provide letters of support that strengthen grant applications. Engaging with local agencies responsible for energy policy or environmental initiatives can also open doors for collaboration on projects that align with community priorities.

Moreover, demonstrating alignment with local government goals—such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions or increasing renewable energy adoption—can make proposals more appealing to funders who prioritize community impact. Regular communication with local officials not only fosters goodwill but also positions NGOs as proactive partners in advancing clean energy initiatives within their communities.

Implementing Sustainable Practices

Once funding is secured and projects are underway, NGOs must prioritize implementing sustainable practices throughout the project lifecycle. This commitment not only ensures that projects achieve their intended outcomes but also sets an example for communities regarding responsible resource management. Sustainable practices may include using locally sourced materials, minimizing waste during installation processes, or incorporating educational components that promote ongoing community engagement in sustainability efforts.

Additionally, NGOs should consider how their projects can be designed for long-term sustainability beyond the initial funding period. This might involve creating maintenance plans for renewable energy installations or establishing community-led initiatives that continue promoting clean energy practices after project completion. By embedding sustainability into every aspect of project implementation, NGOs can maximize their impact while fostering a culture of environmental stewardship within their communities.

Reporting and Accountability

Finally, effective reporting and accountability mechanisms are essential components of successful clean energy projects funded by grants. Funders typically require regular progress reports detailing how funds have been utilized and what outcomes have been achieved. NGOs should establish clear metrics for success at the outset of the project and regularly track progress against these benchmarks.

Transparency in reporting not only fulfills funder requirements but also builds trust within the community and among stakeholders. Sharing successes—and challenges—through public reports or community meetings can foster ongoing engagement and support for future initiatives. By demonstrating accountability and a commitment to continuous improvement, NGOs can position themselves favorably for future funding opportunities while reinforcing their role as leaders in promoting clean energy solutions.

In conclusion, navigating the world of clean energy grants requires strategic planning, collaboration, and a commitment to community impact. By understanding eligibility criteria, conducting thorough research, crafting compelling proposals, building partnerships, demonstrating impact, budgeting effectively, engaging with local entities, implementing sustainable practices, and maintaining accountability through reporting, NGO professionals can successfully secure funding for transformative clean energy initiatives that benefit both their organizations and the communities they serve.",https://fundsforngosmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/19141120/icon.png,N,,2025-10-06 23:58:40.703830

Climate change is straining America's health care system: Study

Climate change is a public health emergency, driving heat, poor air quality, stronger storms, and new diseases that threaten people's health and strain health care systems, according to a new report from The Commonwealth Fund examining the impact of climate change on health and health care.

The report examined the preparedness of all 50 states and the District of Columbia to address rising health threats from climate change, identifying significant gaps in how health care systems respond to extreme weather, pollution and other climate-related risks.

The highest performers were Vermont, New York, Washington, New Jersey and Maine due to their clean energy policies, lower vulnerability to environmental hazards and lower greenhouse gas emissions. The worst performers were West Virginia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Florida and Mississippi.

However, the report makes clear that even the most prepared states need to do more.

Rising temperatures and more frequent, intense heat waves have become the deadliest weather hazard in the United States, accounting for nearly 250,000 additional deaths, according to the World Health Organization. Extreme heat disproportionately impacts older adults, outdoor workers, people with chronic conditions and low‑income populations.

According to the report, Nevada, New Mexico, and Arizona are the most vulnerable to extreme heat, with Arizona experiencing more than 140 days over 100℉ in 2024 and Nevada approaching 115 days.

Air quality is another growing concern.

Warmer temperatures and more frequent wildfires are leading to higher concentrations of ground-level ozone and particulate matter, both of which can exacerbate asthma, respiratory diseases, and heart conditions.

Smoke from wildfires — especially across the U.S. West — is now a significant health hazard and may be responsible for 200,000 excess deaths annually. Arizona and California had the worst air quality, while residents of Alaska and Hawaii can breathe the easiest with the cleanest air.

The report explains that extreme weather events such as floods, hurricanes, and storms can cause injury, water contamination and mental trauma.

These events often disrupt health services and basic infrastructure, compounding their long-term effects and jeopardizing the health of communities. Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida stand out in this category, facing especially severe flood risks. The report estimates that nearly 15 percent of Florida hospital beds are located in high-hazard flood zones.

The health care system is not only at risk from these climate threats, but is also contributing to the problem, the researchers found.

More than 8.5% of the national greenhouse gas emissions originate from the health sector, with West Virginia, Wyoming, and North Dakota contributing the highest percentage per capita, according to the report.

And, while the report examines the national and state picture, weather events are also having a profound impact on local communities.

""Some disasters recently here in the U.S. have wiped out significant health infrastructure,"" Eckelman said.

Flooding in Western North Carolina wiped out some critical manufacturing facilities that supply life-saving medical supplies for the rest of the country, Eckelman explained. So, while the weather event only impacted one region of the country, it affected the supply chains everywhere, he added.

The authors of the report encouraged governments and health facilities to develop resilience plans and emergency plans so that they can continue operating during these events. They also challenged health care institutions to do their part.

""They can take a little bit of control over the emissions associated with their own operations and really abide by their mission to do no harm, not only through the care that they provide, but also in their behavior within the environment itself,"" Eckelman said.

The question for the court Did federal Maritime law or Louisiana law govern the dispute?
There was no question that the indemnity provision required Island to indemnify OOSI for Felix’s personal injury claims; however Island argued that the Louisiana Oilfield Anti-Indemnity Act rendered the indemnity provision unenforceable.
OOSI said federal maritime law controls.","You would think that a Master Service Contract concerning boats and oilfield operations in the Gulf of Mexico would be governed by federal maritime law. In some situations you would be mistaken, says Offshore Oil Services, Inc. v. Island Operating Company, Inc.

The facts

Fieldwood and Island Operating entered into a MSC through which Island performed production services on Fieldwood’s Gulf of Mexico platforms. Most of the categories of “Work” identified in the MSC were those traditionally associated with production activities. Fieldwood contracted with OOSI for marine transport of equipment and Island’s workers on the platforms.

In the MSC Island agreed to indemnify third-party contractors such as OOSI against claims resulting from injuries to Island employees.

Fieldwood and Island agreed to a work order in which Island would fill “A Operator” positions. These operators would conduct BESE compliance testing and a host of other activities.

Island employee Felix sustained injuries while disembarking from a vessel. OOSI filed a Complaint for Exoneration From and/or Limitation of Liability and Felix filed a personal injury claim. OOSI demanded indemnification from Island.

The question for the court

Did federal Maritime law or Louisiana law govern the dispute? The question was whether transportation vessels would play a substantial role in the performance of the MSC and whether the parties expected as much.

There was no question that the indemnity provision required Island to indemnify OOSI for Felix’s personal injury claims; however Island argued that the Louisiana Oilfield Anti-Indemnity Act rendered the indemnity provision unenforceable. OOSI said federal maritime law controls. The trial court granted summary judgment for Island, concluding that the LOAIA governed the dispute based on a finding that the MSC did not provide that the vessels would play a substantial role in the completion of the contract and that the parties did not expect vessels to play such a role.

The Fifth Circuit affirmed the take-nothing judgment against OOSI. The court applied the choice of law analysis in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Whether federal maritime law applied of its own force to the MSC depended on the answer to two questions:

Was the contract to provide services to facilitate the drilling or production of oil and gas in navigable waters? The answer was “yes”. Then the court asked if the contract provided or did the parties expect that the vessel would play a substantial role in the completion of the contract? To this question the court said “no”. The result of that “no” was the MSC was a non-maritime contract. There was not a direct and substantial link between the contract and operation of the ship, it’s navigation or its management afloat.

The result was based on the testimony of the parties. A Fieldwood employee testified to the effect that they typically don’t use equipment associated with a vessel but it had been done. Island’s president testified that operators perform no work on vessels. The provision relating to marine transportation concerned transporting workers to the platform and was not a description of actual work the MSC contemplated.

The trial court, affirmed by the Fifth Circuit, ruled that OOSI take nothing. The MSC was not maritime in nature. Thus, the Louisiana Oilfield Anti-Indemnity Act controlled, nullifying Island’s indemnity obligations. (OOSI agreed that if the LOAIA applied, the indemnity obligation would be null, rendering discussion of that question unnecessary).

President Trump is still considering a massive aid program for U.S. farmers… Trump officials are reportedly evaluating how money made from tariffs could supplement farmer payments. Official details about the bailout are scarce, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC that information regarding “substantial support” for farmers would be released Tuesday. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday his administration will provide “some of that tariff money” to farmers, “who are, for a little while, going to be hurt until the tariffs kick into their benefit.”

Senator Grassley speaks up for Nationwide E15… Any farmer will tell you that they want to sell into the market and not harvest government checks. Although those checks may be necessary again this year, we need to address the root cause of this issue by giving farmers more markets. So, one very important decision that Congress could make is to have permanent year-round, nationwide E15. And, that would do just that, giving farmers more markets – particularly for corn.

Now, people would say, “Well, you better wake up,” because we’ve had nationwide, year-round markets for six years through presidential waiver. But we need to have this by legislation because we need more certainty than what an individual president might think about this issue. And you need that certainty because it’s going to take a lot of investment of infrastructure at retailers selling gasoline to invest in the equipment that it takes to have E15 nationwide. -source: Senator Charles Grassley

FDA moves NWS serum forward… The FDA recently, conditionally approved Dectomax-CA1 (doramectin injection) injectable solution for the prevention and treatment of New World screwworm (NWS) larval infestations and prevention of NWS reinfestation for 21 days. “We understand the urgency with which America’s farmers and ranchers are asking for tools to fight New World screwworm,” said FDA Commissioner Marty Makary. “Today’s conditional approval – the first in the U.S. for NWS – shows our dedication to rapidly advancing important animal medicines when they are needed most. We continue to work tirelessly to complete review of other NWS products to protect multiple animal species in the U.S.”

“Under this conditional approval, the FDA has determined the drug is safe and has a reasonable expectation of effectiveness. We are making this treatment available to cattle producers immediately while the sponsor collects the data needed for a full approval,” said Timothy Schell, Ph.D., acting director of the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine.

The value of all energy trade between the United States and Mexico was estimated to be $57 billion in 2024, down from nearly $72 billion in 2023, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. A combination of lower petroleum output from Mexico and lower fuel prices, particularly for petroleum products that make up the bulk of the cross-border energy trade between the two countries, drove most of the decrease. Energy trade value represents the total value of energy imports and exports between two countries and is driven by commodity volumes and prices.

Most of the energy trade value between the United States and Mexico comes from U.S. exports of refined petroleum products to Mexico—$37 billion in 2024—which accounted for 64% of the total energy value traded between the two countries. The inflation-adjusted value of all U.S. energy exports to Mexico declined by 13% in 2024 from a year earlier to $41 billion, falling by less than the previous annual decline of 24% from 2022 to 2023. -source: U.S. Energy Information Administration

California’s adoption of E15 is a bright spot… California Governor Newsom’s signing his legislature’s E15 bill made the state the last remaining and biggest to allow sales of the higher ethanol blend. Renewable Fuels Association’s Troy Bredenkamp never doubted Newsom would sign the unanimously passed bill saying, “He [Newsome] got on board last year…RFA commissioned a study with UC Berkeley and others, that looked at, what would E15 mean to the California consumer. That study showed a $2.7 billion per year savings to California consumers—almost $200 per household.”

Those numbers reportedly helped fuel Newsom’s signature on the bill. Bredenkamp says California will add almost 600 million gallons of new demand for American ethanol or 200 million bushels of corn. He says he hopes California’s move will give added momentum to year-round E15 legislation in Congress.

The Texas Department of Agriculture enacted an emergency quarantine Oct. 2 to stop the spread of the invasive two-spotted cotton leafhopper, also known as the cotton jassid. Originally from Asia, the cotton jassid has spread across much of the southeastern United States and now poses a serious threat to Texas’ multi-billion-dollar cotton industry and other agricultural products, said TDA.

“Texas cotton farmers are the backbone of our economy and our communities,” Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said. “Texas grows 40% of the cotton grown in the U.S., making this pest a major threat to our supply. I won’t let a threat like the cotton jassid harm our farmers, ranchers, nurseries or landscapes. We’re taking aggressive steps to stop this pest in its tracks.” The quarantine applies to shipments from Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, North Carolina and Tennessee where the pest has been detected.

ON THE ROAD: Gov. Gavin Newsom hasn’t forgiven car companies for helping nix California’s electric vehicle sales mandate, but the state’s top transportation lawmakers aren’t spending time looking in the rearview mirror.

While Newsom and other lawmakers traveled to New York for Climate Week, Assemblymember Lori Wilson and Sen. Dave Cortese — the respective chairs of their chambers’ transportation committees — were in Detroit meeting with Ford and General Motors executives as they attempt to chart a path forward for the state’s EV market.

The trip, organized by SoCal labor leader and former Michigan state Rep. Jon Switalski, took place amid the inauspicious backdrop of Newsom bashing General Motors CEO Mary Barra, whom he singled out by name as aiding the Trump administration’s successful maneuver to have Congress revoke California’s authority to enforce national-leading vehicle emissions standards.

“Mary Barra sold us out,” Newsom said during a Climate Week press conference late last month. “The Republicans rolled that back this year under Donald Trump‘s leadership, but the American automobile manufacturers allowed that to happen. GM led that effort.”

Wilson said the policy disagreements made the talks awkward.

“It was an elephant in the room,” she said.

But she also said she was sympathetic to automakers’ dilemma.

“They feel like they’re being beat up by China,” she said. “They would like to see a voluntary collaborative transition that’s led by the market and allows them to stay competitive.”

The episode illustrates how raw the emotions are for Newsom and clean vehicle advocates who’ve watched the Trump administration systematically dismantle EV incentives, including the $7,500 federal tax credit for car buyers and HOV lane access, both of which expired last week. GM spent the most of any automaker — $11.5 million — lobbying the federal government through June. (That’s more than double the spending from Toyota, which also vocally opposed EV rules.)

“They didn’t spend as much as the oil industry, but were clearly part of the offensive,” said Matt Davis, vice president of federal policy at the League of Conservation Voters.

Cortese and Wilson, who were joined by Assemblymembers Rhodesia Ransom, Juan Carrillo and LaShae Sharp-Collins, said they walked away optimistic that the American auto giants won’t abandon their EV ambitions.

“The theme of both Ford and GM is, ‘We’re not going backwards,” Wilson said. “‘Despite the conversation happening, despite the advocacy, we’re committed to a zero-emission future.’”

Whether that means the companies are prepared to actively work with lawmakers and state regulators to advance California’s EV agenda is an open question. Cortese said he left the meetings with a sense that neither automaker was rushing to offer policy concepts to bolster the state market after the flurry of federal action.

“It isn’t very comforting from the transportation chair standpoint,” Cortese said. “It just seems like, if anything, they’re in a wait-and-see mode.”

However, both lawmakers said the looming specter of the Chinese electric vehicle market, which has rapidly developed into the largest in the world, has Ford and GM spooked and reluctant to step away from electrification completely.

“It’s no joke that there are very competent competitors elsewhere,” said Ivan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds, which analyzes auto markets. “We must continue developing and producing because if we don’t, someone else is going to eat our lunch.”

It will take creative lawmaking from Cortese and Wilson to take advantage of that opening without the state’s EV sales targets and with an anticipated budget deficit that has already caused Newsom to back away from his commitment to backfill federal tax incentives with a state-run program.

Their agreed-upon target for next session is one of the trickiest knots in the EV space — exponentially increasing the number of home chargers for millions of California renters, with little available funding to encourage landlords to install new infrastructure.

“That’s the missing piece,” Wilson said. “There’s still nothing like people going home, plugging in their vehicle and waking up in the morning knowing they can drive.” — AN

BOTH WAYS: While it’s been an awkward EV autumn between American carmakers and California officials, a Japanese motor company rolled out a high-tech new partnership with one of the state’s largest utilities.

Honda is partnering with Southern California Edison on an initiative to push forward the ability of electric vehicles to power homes, reports David Ferris for POLITICO’s E&E News. The idea has been around for more than a decade but has sputtered getting off the ground. As of now, some EV models are able to feed energy back to a home during a blackout, but that’s limited to when the house is disconnected from the electric grid.

Owners of the Acura RSX will be able to push the envelope further. In SCE’s territory, the grid will be able to actually turn the task of powering appliances like the dishwasher, induction stove and lighting over to the car during periods of high energy demand.

It’s a baby step toward the eventual dream of so-called bidirectional charging for EVs: Using the cars to send power directly to the grid, using them like a miniature, local version of a wind farm or natural gas plant. That is the possibility that most excites vehicle-to-grid experts. Americans drive their cars on average only an hour a day, leaving them idle 95 percent of the time, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

“We would love to run, but we are crawling first,” said Chanel Parson, Edison’s director of clean energy and demand response. “We want to master crawling quickly so we can get up and walk quickly.” — DF, NB

NO CIGAR: Veto season is in full swing, and Newsom shot down a series of bills aimed at energy affordability Friday evening. How come? Concern that the proposals could actually cause ratepayer costs to climb.

That was the fate of SB 541, by Senate Energy Chair Sen. Josh Becker. If signed, the bill would have required the California Energy Commission and California Public Utilities Commission to evaluate the economics of “load shifting,” a practice in which utilities incentivize customers to use less energy during high-demand hours so as to reduce the strain on power plants and transmission lines.

Newsom concluded that piling more work on state agencies could backfire.

“At a time when electric bill affordability continues to be a pervasive challenge, it is important that we consider the workload and cost impacts on the CEC and CPUC, some of which are ultimately borne by electric customers, to avoid further compounding the costs embedded in customer electric bills,” Newsom wrote in his veto letter.

It was a similar story for AB 1408, by Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin, which aimed to expedite clean energy projects while saving ratepayers money by requiring the state to make it easier to plug new projects into the grid where spare space already exists.

“This bill risks constraining energy resource procurement and interconnection options, likely increasing electric costs and undermining electric grid reliability,” Newsom wrote.

Advocates for so-called virtual power plants also took a knock with the rejection of AB 740, which followed the veto of AB 44 earlier last week. AB 740 would have required the CEC to adopt a virtual power plant deployment plan, a boon to the companies creating technology that pools energy by adjusting devices in homes, such as batteries and thermostats, to boost the grid during periods of high demand.

Supporters of the vetoed bills expressed a mix of frustration and surprise at the rejection.

“I’m disappointed in this veto of SB 541. This bill was about affordability,” Becker said in a statement, citing a study commissioned by analysis firm GridLab that found the state could avoid $13.7 billion in grid upgrades through 2030 by doubling its load-shifting target. “Next year this area will be a focus of the clean energy community — clearly we have some educating to do.” — NB

SMOLDERING: The U.S. Forest Service has paused planned prescribed burns during the government shutdown, an employee told Marc Heller at POLITICO’s E&E News after a staff meeting last week. The pause comes as the beleaguered agency is falling behind its 10-year average for number of acres on which it’s actively reduced wildfire risk through thinning, prescribed fire and related actions.

As of mid-September — about two weeks before the end of fiscal 2025 — the agency had treated about 2.2 million acres for the year, Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz said in a letter to Sen. Ron Wyden, well behind the more than 4 million acres treated in the last year of the Biden administration. — MH, CvK

FOLLOW CALIFORNIA’S LEAD: California’s heat safety regulations are paying dividends for the state’s workers.

The five states, including California, that had heat protections in 2023 saw their odds of workplace injuries increase 8 percent during heat waves that year, while the risk in states without rules was double that, according to a study released Monday by Harvard University and the George Washington University.

The study found that almost 28,000 work injuries occur in the U.S. annually because of heat exposure, but protections like access to water, rest and cool places significantly reduce risk, Ariel Wittenberg reports for POLITICO’s E&E News.

The new data comes after the Workers Compensation Research Institute released a study last week that found California’s heat standard reduced workplace injuries by more than 15 percent on hot days in “high-exposure” industries like construction, agriculture and transportation. — AW, AN

RECLAIMING THE LEAD: Scott Cameron will take over as acting head of the Bureau of Reclamation, shifting titles at the Interior Department while he maintains his role as the Trump administration’s lead official in negotiations over the future of the Colorado River, as Jennifer Yachnin reports for POLITICO’s E&E News. The decision comes in the wake of Trump’s decision Sept. 30 to withdraw his nomination of Ted Cooke, a former top official at the Central Arizona Project, to be Reclamation commissioner. David Palumbo, a veteran career official at Reclamation overseeing operations in the West, had previously served as acting commissioner.

— California farmworkers are tapping into a state fund to retrofit their homes to lower energy costs and protect against heat.

— When the Garnet Fire tore through the Teakettle Experimental Forest east of Fresno last month, it destroyed old growth trees and decades of scientific research.

— Corporate developers are disproportionately buying up lots in Altadena that were burned in the Eaton Fire.

Raising EV fees to the highest in the nation takes us in the wrong direction, punishing families who are part of the solution.","In the last-minute rush to adopt a state budget, one casualty in the road funding package was a fair, forward-looking approach for electric vehicle drivers.

House Bill 4183 passed early Friday morning with a provision that significantly raises registration costs for EVs. As a result, annual fees for EV drivers will rise by $100, making the cost $260. That increase makes Michigan No. 1 in the nation for the highest, most punitive fees on EVs. A similar increase will be imposed on plug-in hybrids, from $60 to $110.

This outcome is deeply troubling, but it is not irreversible. It is up to the Legislature to solve the problem they created by lowering EV and plug-in hybrid fees to more closely reflect what comparable gasoline-powered vehicles pay. That approach would ensure EV drivers contribute their fair share, while protecting Michigan from being the costliest state in the country for EV ownership.

This fix is essential, because the new policy places a disproportionate burden on a small group of drivers who, according to our research, are already contributing more toward road funding compared to similar gasoline vehicles.

According to the state’s budget estimates, the newly passed measure would only generate $8.3 million in additional road revenues. That amount is negligible in the context of Michigan’s multibillion-dollar transportation budget, but it would create the nation’s highest financial barrier for families who choose to drive electric.

Michigan has built an economic strategy on becoming a hub for clean mobility and electric vehicle manufacturing. Automakers, suppliers, and communities across our state have and are investing in the transition. But the transition hasn’t been easy, and has come under strain by increased foreign competition, tariffs, and the elimination of federal tax incentives.

By increasing EV registration fees, lawmakers risk further undercutting the state’s clean mobility strategy and sending the wrong signal to businesses that are creating jobs in our state.

The costs of this decision, of course, fall on Michigan families. These high fees make it more expensive to own and operate an EV, hitting hardest the households already burdened by high transportation costs and looking to EVs as a way to save money and breathe cleaner air. Instead of supporting these benefits, the state is discouraging adoption and slowing progress toward transportation electrification.

Michigan has a proud legacy as the auto capital of the world, and our future depends on leading the shift to clean mobility. Raising EV fees to the highest in the nation takes us in the wrong direction, punishing families who are part of the solution.

It is now up to lawmakers to correct this imbalance and enact an approach that keeps Michigan competitive, supports innovation, and ensures all drivers contribute fairly to our roads.

— Connor Sandagata, Senior Public Opinion Fellow

WASHINGTON, DC, UNITED STATES, October 6, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- In a time when it’s rare to find an issue that unites Americans, energy production, date security, information privacy and national security bring voters together. A new national survey conducted by the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy finds broad, bipartisan agreement among likely voters that America’s energy and data infrastructure must remain secure, independent, and domestically powered.

A national survey conducted on September 28, 2025, among 2,010 likely voters found that Americans across party lines view domestic energy production and data security as essential pillars of both economic strength and national security.

Key Findings:

- 96% of voters say it’s important that Americans’ personal data not be stored in Chinese data centers, with 82% calling it extremely or very important.

- 94% of voters believe it’s important that the energy powering U.S. data centers is generated exclusively from domestically produced sources.

- 70% agree that the United States is in a technological arms race with China, and 81% say energy security is a key component of national security.

- 71% support reducing regulatory burdens to make it easier to build new data centers and energy infrastructure within the United States.

- 79% of respondents would prefer the United States—not China—lead the world in installing new energy projects, even though a plurality (39%) believe China is currently moving faster on energy development.

- A majority, 83%, agree that data centers serving American consumers and companies should be based in the United States.

“These findings make clear that voters understand the connection between energy, technology, and national security,” said Connor Sandagata, Senior Public Opinion Fellow at the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy. “The numbers show a strong, bipartisan consensus that keeping America’s data and energy secure isn’t a partisan issue. It’s a top priority for voters across the political spectrum.”

The survey also underscores strong support for pro-growth energy and infrastructure policies, with nearly three-quarters of voters calling for the U.S. to expand its energy capacity and data infrastructure to compete against China and other foreign adversaries.

“Americans want to see more domestic production, less reliance on foreign adversaries, and smart policies that empower innovation here at home,” said Sarah Hunt, President of the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy.

This week, elected officials, energy experts, technology innovators, and policy leaders from across the country will gather at the Joseph Rainey Center’s LAMP National Summit in Washington, D.C. to discuss these issues, focusing on how to strengthen America’s energy independence, secure its data infrastructure, and keep the nation competitive in the global race for innovation and security.

If this sounds familiar, that’s because it is, the government shut down for a record 35 days in 2018 under Trump’s leadership. As political blame circles in Washington D.C. and the media alike, one of our biggest concerns as a grassroots environmental nonprofit is the vulnerable position this puts our blue-green planet, and the communities who depend on it, in. We work every day to protect marine and endangered wildlife, and promote climate resilience. But we rely on strong public institutions to uphold it. When Congress fails to fund the federal government, the agencies that safeguard our oceans and coastal communities are forced to close their doors, furlough their scientists and halt critical protections. This isn’t just a political gridlock, it’s a direct threat to the ocean, fisheries and the people who depend on healthy marine ecosystems.

An Avoidable and Manufactured Crisis with Real Consequences

Instead of coming together to fund the government responsibly, extremists in Congress are pushing a Continuing Resolution that would lock in an 11% cut to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the long-standing agency we depend on for hurricane forecasts, fisheries management and coastal restoration. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is using the shutdown as cover to accelerate mass layoffs and “Reductions in Force” (RIFs) at environmental and scientific agencies. These actions have already stripped away thousands of years of expertise and data, leaving our nation less prepared for climate disasters and more vulnerable to pollution and habitat loss.

NOAA: Our First Line of Defense Against Climate Disasters

When NOAA is shut down, we all lose and are in danger. Their mission is simple but essential — to protect lives and livelihoods through science, forecasting and stewardship. Without a skilled workforce and technologies the following is possible…

Hurricane forecasting delays: With fewer staff and reduced capacity, communities will receive slower and less accurate warnings just as we enter the height of hurricane season. Every hour counts when lives and homes are at stake.

Fisheries management on hold: A shutdown halts stock assessments and enforcement, creating uncertainty for coastal economies and jeopardizing sustainable seafood supplies.

Climate and ocean research stalled: NOAA’s research vessels will be forced back to port, and its laboratories will go dark. Critical studies on ocean warming, coral bleaching, and shifting marine ecosystems will be delayed or lost entirely.

Public resources offline: Communities rely on NOAA’s Climate Resilience Toolkit and open data platforms to plan for flooding and sea-level rise. A shutdown would cut off access when these tools are needed most.

Wildlife response curtailed: Marine mammal rescue and stranding programs will be scaled back, leaving endangered species like sea turtles and dolphins without critical emergency response support.

The Coast Guard: Working Without Pay and Burning Out

The U.S. Coast Guard, one of NOAA’s closest partners in protecting marine life and coastal safety, must continue operations during a shutdown but without pay. Tens of thousands of service members will still conduct rescues and patrol our waterways under immense strain. Training, maintenance and inspections will be suspended, reducing readiness and increasing risk. Port safety checks will be delayed and pollution monitoring will weaken, all while crews work unpaid to keep the nation’s coasts secure.

Offshore Enforcement Vanished: BOEM and BSEE

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) oversee offshore drilling operations and enforce safety standards that prevent oil spills. When these agencies are shut down, safe inspections stop, leaving oil rigs and pipelines dangerously unmonitored. Also, environmental reviews are frozen which give fossil fuel companies a free pass operate without oversight… a terrifying new reality. We’ve seen what happens when offshore drilling goes unchecked — from Deepwater Horizon to smaller spills that quietly devastate ecosystems. A shutdown puts us on that path again.

U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service: Paused Protections = At Risk Wildlife

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) plays a key role in protecting endangered marine species and managing coastal habitats that buffer against storms. During a federal government shutdown the following occurs:

Protections for endangered species like sea turtles, whales and sharks are delayed.

National wildlife refuges may close or operate with skeleton crews, harming local tourism and leaving habitats vulnerable.

Restoration projects are halted, weakening natural storm defenses.

Community partnerships and grants freeze, cutting off support for local conservation and coastal resilience initiatives.

Every day of inaction means more lost time for restoration, more risk for wildlife and more hardship for the people who depend on these ecosystems. Healthy oceans and strong environmental protections are not partisan luxuries, they are essential to our survival. Every delay in research, every missed inspection, every suspended rescue mission erodes our ability to adapt to the climate crisis and protect the living planet we share. We need a government that works for people and the planet, not one that shuts down when politics get tough.",https://i0.wp.com/seaturtles.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ant-rozetsky-q-DJ9XhKkhA-unsplash-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-06 22:00:51.539689

The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.

Global solar generation grew by a record 31% in the first half of the year, while wind generation grew by 7.7%, according to the report by the energy think tank Ember, which was released after midnight Tuesday London time. Solar and wind generation combined grew by more than 400 terawatt hours, which was more than overall global demand increased in the same period, it found.

The findings suggest it is possible for the world to wean off polluting sources of power — even as demand for electricity skyrockets — with continued investment in renewables including solar, wind, hydropower, bioenergy and geothermal energies.

“That means that they can keep up the pace with growing appetite for electricity worldwide,” said Małgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, senior electricity analyst at Ember and lead author of the study.

At the same time, total fossil fuel generation dropped slightly, by less than 1%.

“The fall overall of fossil may be small, but it is significant,” said Wiatros-Motyka. “This is a turning point when we see emissions plateauing.”

The firm analyzes monthly data from 88 countries representing the vast majority of electricity demand around the world. Reasons that demand is increasing include economic growth, electric vehicles and data centers, rising populations in developing countries and the need for more cooling as temperatures rise.

Meeting that demand by burning fossil fuels such as coal and gas for electricity releases planet-warming gases including carbon dioxide and methane. This leads to more severe, costly and deadly extreme weather.

Analyzing major markets

Ember also dedicated part of its report to an analysis of China, India, the European Union and the U.S. Combined, they account for nearly two-thirds of electricity generation and carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector globally.

In the first six months of the year, China added more solar and wind than the rest of the world combined, and its fossil fuel generation fell by 2%, the report said.

India saw record solar and wind growth that outpaced the growth in demand. India’s fossil fuel generation also dropped.

In both nations, emissions fell.

“It’s often been said by analysts that renewable energy doesn’t really lead to a reduction in fossil fuel use,” said Michael Gerrard, founder and director of the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, who was not involved in the report. “This report highlights an encouraging step in the opposite direction.”

But in the U.S., demand growth outpaced the growth of clean power generation. In the E.U., sluggish wind and hydropower generation contributed to higher coal and gas generation, the report said. In both markets, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased.

Challenges in the US

The U.S. clean energy market faces challenges as President Donald Trump’s administration shifts federal policy away from renewables and toward boosting coal, oil and gas production. The administration has terminated Biden-era funding that supported clean energy projects, repealed policy underpinning climate-related regulation and halted wind energy developments.

Meanwhile, the administration has lifted barriers to coal mining, granted two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants and other polluting industries and dedicated millions of dollars to these coal plants.

In his speech at the United Nations General Assembly last month, Trump attacked renewable energy and questioned the validity of the concept of climate change.

Experts warn that Trump’s efforts to block clean energy will have a long-term impact.

“The federal government is greatly increasing the growth of artificial intelligence, which is going to massively increase electricity demand, and they’re also shutting down the cheapest new sources of electricity, wind and solar. That’s going to lead to a gap in supply and demand,” Gerrard said.

Renewables “still have an opportunity to make inroads in to displacing fossil fuels, even with some demand growth,” said Amanda Smith, senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown, who also wasn’t involved in the report. But, Smith said: “I am very cautiously optimistic that renewables can continue to grow and continue to displace fossil fuels in the U.S. I am more optimistic on the world scale.”
