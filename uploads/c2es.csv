The agreement marks significant progress toward meeting customer demand for low-carbon footprint products

HOUSTON, TX, January 22, 2026 – BASF has signed a 15-year agreement with BP Energy Retail Company to acquire Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). These certificates are linked to approximately 47 megawatts (MW) of annual capacity from Swift Current Energy’s Castle Gap Wind project in Central Texas. By securing RECs, BASF can offset carbon-intensive, grid-supplied electricity attributed to multiple U.S. locations, helping to reduce emissions in its value chain.

“This long-term agreement marks a significant step toward meeting our customers’ growing demand for products with a reduced carbon footprint,” said Heather Remley, President & CEO of BASF Corporation. “This is a clear demonstration of how we are advancing our ambition to be the preferred partner in supporting our customers’ green transformation.”

The energy output anticipated from the 47 MW from Castle Gap would help offset more than 98,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent and is expected to be more than 147,000 megawatt hours (MWh) of electricity per year – the same amount of electricity used by more than 20,500 U.S. households on average, according to EPA estimates[1].

“Securing long-term virtual power purchase agreements is a powerful tool in our strategy to reduce Scope 2[2] emissions,” said Matthias Lang, Managing Director, BASF Renewables GmbH. “This approach allows us to make meaningful progress toward our sustainability goals while supporting the broader transition to a low-carbon energy system.”

The contract is associated with Swift Current Energy’s Castle Gap Wind project, a 197 MW energy facility located in central Texas.

“Swift Current Energy is delighted to add BASF as a long-term partner for Castle Gap Wind,” said Eric Lammers, CEO and Co-Founder, Swift Current Energy. “This transaction demonstrates our commitment to maximizing value across our operating portfolio. We energized this facility in 2023, and it continues to be a strong asset, producing reliable energy for the Texas grid.”

This agreement aligns with BASF’s climate protection goals. BASF aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by the year 2030 compared with 2018 and aspires to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

Meanwhile, BMW freed up production capacity at the Spartanburg plant by retiring the X4.","Last June, Automotive Energy Supply Corporation (AESC) halted construction at its new battery cell plant in South Carolina. The $1.6-billion project was meant to support production of electric BMWs at the automaker’s Spartanburg facility. Thankfully, the Japanese company’s decision to pause work has not derailed BMW’s EV plans.

In an interview with German business publication Automobilwoche, BMW purchasing chief Nicolai Martin explained how the situation has been defused. To prevent a bottleneck, AESC will supply BMW’s South Carolina plant with battery cells from other factories.

BMW’s $700-million investment in a new battery assembly plant in Woodruff is nearing completion. It will give the automaker the infrastructure to build battery packs for its upcoming EVs. Construction began in late 2023, and the factory will become operational later this year. Martin confirmed the company remains on track to begin EV production in Spartanburg by late 2026.

BMW is staying tight-lipped about which electric vehicles it will build in the U.S., but it has committed to producing at least six models by the end of the decade. Leading the charge is expected to be the iX5, an all-electric version of the fifth-generation X5. Internally known as the “G65,” the luxury SUV has been confirmed for a 2026 debut with combustion engines, plug-in hybrid, and electric powertrains. A hydrogen fuel-cell variant is also planned for select markets starting in 2028.

The iX7 (G67) is expected to follow in 2027, with an iX6 (G66) arriving in 2028. There are also rumors of a G74 model slated for 2029, reportedly derived from the next X5 but with a more off-road-oriented focus and a mix of hybrid and electric power. That still leaves two models unaccounted for, both likely SUVs. All are expected to fall under the Neue Klasse umbrella, even though these zero-emission heavyweights will continue to use the CLAR platform shared with their combustion-engine counterparts.

Meanwhile, BMW freed up production capacity at the Spartanburg plant by retiring the X4. The final “G02” rolled off the line in November, with no direct replacement planned. A fully electric iX4 is in development, though its production location remains unclear. BMW could opt to build the coupe-style electric crossover at its new plant in Debrecen, Hungary, where the iX3 is already in production.",https://cdn.bmwblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2027-bmw-x5-spy-photos-prototype-06.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 08:38:55.539411
,Texas Environment,2026-01-22 12:40:06+00:00,Rio Grande Guardian,Cortez: Texas can lead on cutting methane — but not with cherry-picked data,Tricia Cortez,,,,,"https://riograndeguardian.com/stories/cortez-texas-can-lead-on-cutting-methane-but-not-with-cherry-picked-data,55500","Cutting methane emissions is the fastest, most effective way to slow down the warming of our planet and protect our communities from a climate catastrophe.
It even lumps Texas and New Mexico together, an effective way to mask underperformance in Texas.
That means for every unit of oil and gas produced, Texas is releasing over twice as much methane.
That would have been enough to meet the residential gas needs of 4.5 million Texas households.
Meanwhile, a closer look at the Delaware Sub-basin in Texas using the Texas Flaring Project’s interactive map highlights alarming trends.","An op-ed in this publication by the Texas Oil & Gas Association (TxOGA) praised Texas oil and gas producers for slashing the intensity of methane emissions by more than half amid rising production, hailing it as a new benchmark for the state’s “energy leadership.”

This may seem like welcome news, but as someone who studies environmental conditions in South Texas and spends every day with the data that captures our reality, I urge caution.

At the Rio Grande International Study Center in Laredo, we monitor the air quality across the Eagle Ford Shale, and along the U.S.-Mexico border. Taking a closer look at this claim of methane “reduction” makes it clear that the truth is more complex, and the underlying data tells a different story — one that raises serious concerns about transparency, accountability and the industry’s PR machine.

Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas responsible for nearly 25% of the warming our planet is experiencing today. In places like El Paso, it’s fueling climate change and wasting valuable energy resources. Cutting methane emissions is the fastest, most effective way to slow down the warming of our planet and protect our communities from a climate catastrophe.

The S&P Global report behind the methane claims omits key details — actual emissions figures, regional data, and modeling methods. It even lumps Texas and New Mexico together, an effective way to mask underperformance in Texas. Our state, unfortunately, is riding the coattails of New Mexico’s policy leadership, who have made it a priority to reduce harmful emissions and natural gas waste, particularly from the massive Permian Basin, which straddles both states.

Even more telling, the report itself quietly acknowledges that satellite data showed no significant change in methane intensity between 2023 and 2024.

This framing is everything. Without the proper data that distinguishes between Texas’ and New Mexico’s emissions, Texans are left with an overly optimistic picture that doesn’t match what’s happening on the ground or in the air.

MethaneSAT’s measurement data captures all emissions, including the many smaller, widespread sources that account for a significant share of total emissions, overall. Thanks to this new data from this satellite launched in 2024, we have been able to dig into methane emissions in the Permian Basin. We know that the methane intensity in the Delaware Sub-Basin, which is the most active part of the Permian, is more than double that of neighboring New Mexico. That means for every unit of oil and gas produced, Texas is releasing over twice as much methane.

The difference lies not in geology, but in policy.

New Mexico has taken methane seriously. It has enacted smart, science-based regulations, including a ban on routine flaring, robust leak detection, and mandated zero-emission equipment in many cases.

Texas, on the other hand, still allows routine flaring, functionally exempts thousands of wells from inspection, and lacks basic standards for emissions control equipment. The massive impact of those differences is both environmental and economic.

Since 2020, New Mexico has doubled its oil and gas production while holding methane emissions flat. Texas, meanwhile, has increased production by just 20% with no meaningful change in emissions. This is unacceptable given the powerful forces of climate change that are bearing down upon us.

The data is unmistakable: Texas is falling behind. Last year alone, operators flared 168 billion cubic feet of gas in the Texas Permian Basin — 40% more than was reported to the state. That would have been enough to meet the residential gas needs of 4.5 million Texas households. Its market value would have been around $380 million.

Meanwhile, a closer look at the Delaware Sub-basin in Texas using the Texas Flaring Project’s interactive map highlights alarming trends.

In Reeves County, alone, an estimated $40 million worth of natural gas was burned off. Just next door in Loving County, satellite data shows flaring levels nearly three times higher than what companies reported to the state—representing another $29 million in wasted energy.

You can’t fix what you don’t track. That’s why RGISC was proud to partner with the Texas Flaring Project to equip our communities with the data we need to hold both state agencies and industry accountable for wasteful flaring and the pollution it causes. They must keep pollution in the pipe.

All told, Texas wasted $1.5 billion worth of natural gas in 2023. That’s 590 billion cubic feet of wasted energy which means lost tax revenue that could help impacted communities like mine on the border, and fund schools, health clinics, or critical infrastructure. Nearly 2.4 million Texans live within half a mile of an active oil or gas well and bear the health burdens of the resulting poor air quality and underregulated operations.

We must do better. New Mexico has shown that strong, sensible regulations don’t threaten industry, which has increased production. They are reducing waste, protecting health, and fostering innovation. Texas has the resources, the technology, and the workforce to lead the field. Why are we okay with our state falling behind?

Texas leaders must stop cherry-picking stats fed to them by the industry’s PR machine, and embrace real solutions. Border communities and your community all deserve clean air, opportunity, and honest leadership.

That's a big ""if,"" however, as it is widely known that some of the plans filed by so-called hyperscalers are more aspirational than hard commitments and will likely be withdrawn if development or grid interconnection takes too long.

The Reuters Power Up newsletter provides everything you need to know about the global energy industry. Sign up here.

Other project estimates likely deliberately inflated the computing capacity that is expected to be constructed, in the hopes that large-scale projects may be eligible for local government support and attain leverage in zoning negotiations.

That said, it is clear that a huge swell in overall data center computing heft - and power consumption - can be expected across the country, which will have sizeable repercussions for local electricity markets, utilities and other businesses.

To help assess which states face the biggest potential impact from the data center build-out, here is a breakdown of where the planned capacity additions are due to be located - and how state electricity supplies and prices have been trending.

COAST-TO-COAST

One of the standout features of the data center capacity pipeline is how widely spread the development plans are across the country.

In total, plans for just over 150 gigawatts (GW) of new data center power capacity have been filed nationally, with 24 different states planning or building at least 1 GW of new capacity, according to Cleanview, an energy data portal.

Given that total current U.S. data center capacity is just under 15 GW and that only three states - Virginia, Texas and Arizona - have more than 2 GW in current operation, the planned capacity building boom is potentially transformational.

The proposed sites span from North Dakota to Alabama, but some states have chunkier development pipelines than others.

Virginia - already called the country's data center alley - plans an eleven-fold rise in computing capacity, which will maintain the state's lead in data center heft with close to 35 GW in development.

Texas ranks second with around 27 GW of capacity plans, while gas-rich Pennsylvania ranks third with a capacity pipeline of around 14 GW.

Outside of those already established hubs for energy-intensive industry, New Mexico, Indiana, Arizona and Utah also have hefty capacity plans in the works, with more than 25 GW of additional capacity planned between them.

Other notable states with plans to bring on massive new capacity include Georgia, Louisiana and Wyoming, which each plan to build more than 3 GW of new computing power.

POTENTIAL ROADBLOCKS

Electricity prices - already buoyed in nearly every market as utility systems upgrade grids and transmission networks - have also risen as data center chatter intensified in key markets.

Among the top 15 states for planned new data center capacity, electricity prices for residential customers have climbed by an average of 16% since the start of 2024, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

That price gain compares to a 10% rise in national residential electricity prices over the same period and indicates that hefty data center capacity pipelines may come with a side of local rate inflation.

Thankfully for large energy consumers, utility-scale supplies of electricity have increased at an even faster rate across the country - especially in the states where large data center demand loads are set to emerge.

Total electricity output across the same 15 states with the largest data center capacity pipelines has increased by an average of 22% since the start of 2024, data from think tank Ember shows.

That growth rate slightly exceeds the national electricity supply expansion of 21% over the same period and suggests that utilities in those states may be outworking their peers in an effort to make the data center capacity dreams a reality.

,American Energy,2026-01-22 11:23:57+00:00,CNN,New-wave reactors are the face of an American nuclear renaissance. Some experts are ...,Laura Paddison,,,,,https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/22/climate/small-nuclear-reactors-smrs-holtec-kairos,"Large conventional nuclear reactors are incredibly expensive, sometimes stretching to tens of billions of dollars.
But Holtec said its staff has hundreds of years of collective operational nuclear experience, and its technology is proven, based on conventional water-cooled nuclear power plants.
“The deployment of advanced reactors is a priority for the Trump administration,” said Rian Bahran, deputy assistant secretary for nuclear reactors.
Nuclear power cannot compete on cost with alternatives, both fossil fuels and increasingly renewable energy, he said.
“If they don’t prove what they’re claiming about how nuclear power is going to save the world, then it’s going to become obsolete,” he said.","On the sandy shores of Lake Michigan, set against a backdrop of thick forest, a sharp-angled grey concrete building could be the face of an American nuclear renaissance.

The Palisades nuclear plant, about a two-hour drive from Chicago, was decommissioned in 2022, judged to be uneconomical in a world of cheap American gas. But Florida-headquartered company Holtec is reviving it. It will mark not only the first ever restart of a shuttered US nuclear plant, but, if all goes to plan, Palisades will also be the birthplace of a nuclear breakthrough: America’s first commercial “small modular reactors.”

These advanced nuclear reactors, known as SMRs, are like mini nuclear power plants but touted as cheaper, safer, faster to build and easier to finance than their conventional counterparts — and hype around them is rising fast.

Their appeal is clear: the prospect of abundant, clean power that can run 24/7. They’re catnip for tech companies seeking reliable energy sources to slake the incredible thirst of their data centers, expected to increase exponentially as AI grows. Money is pouring in from Big Tech and the Trump administration.

SMRs are in a sweet spot right now, said Michael Craig, an associate professor of energy systems and climate at the University of Michigan. “They’re in this perfect ground where there’s lots of great ideas … and they have a lot of promise and potential,” he told CNN.

The reality, as ever, is likely to be messier and experts are sounding notes of caution. The total cost of SMRs may be lower than conventional plants, but they are still very expensive, meaning the price of electricity they produce will be far higher than wind, solar or gas, experts warn.

They also take a long time to get up and running. There are only three operational SMRs in the entire world, and none is in the US. One is on a Russian barge off the Siberian coast and the other two in China.

Whether the SMR hype is warranted will only start to become clear once they are built — and the race is on to do so.

Advanced nuclear is “a ‘Back to the Future’-type story,” Touran said. In the 1950s and ’60s, the US had dozens of small reactors, “and they all operated uneconomically,” he told CNN. So, seeking economies of scale to reduce costs and the price of electricity, the industry went big.

Nuclear, however, is an inherently complex technology and building bespoke mega-projects has proved hard. Timelines were delayed, costs spiraled and nuclear stagnated in the US, unable to compete with cheap fracked gas.

Now, small is in again. Companies are saying “we have new technology, we have new materials, and this time it will be cheaper,” Touran said, although “that is definitely yet to be seen,” he added.

The enduring appeal of SMRs is found in their name. First, it’s about size. Large conventional nuclear reactors are incredibly expensive, sometimes stretching to tens of billions of dollars. Smaller reactors simply cost less to build. They are “a technological solution to a financial problem,” Touran said. “No venture capitalists can say, like, ‘oh, sure, we’ll build a $30 billion plant.’ But, if you’re down into hundreds of millions, maybe they can do it.”

It’s also about modularity. The idea is these small reactors will be mass produced in centralized factories and delivered to sites, making them cheaper and more flexible than huge nuclear plants.

Holtec wants to prove the concept at Palisades in Covert Township, Michigan. Alongside firing up the 800-megawatt conventional reactor, the company plans to install two 300-megawatt SMRs to be built in its Camden, New Jersey, factory.

The company kicked off the formal licensing process with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission last month and hopes to have everything approved by 2029, with the SMRs coming online by 2031, a Holtec spokesperson said.

Its long-term aim, with partner company Hyundai Engineering & Construction, is to build a fleet of SMRs in North America in the 2030s.

Some experts question the ambitious timelines, especially for a company that has never operated a nuclear plant before — Holtec started out in the nuclear waste business before buying up and decommissioning closed nuclear plants. But Holtec said its staff has hundreds of years of collective operational nuclear experience, and its technology is proven, based on conventional water-cooled nuclear power plants.

Using this technology is “a very sensible approach” because it should ease the licensing and supply chain process, said Brendan Kochunas, an associate professor at University of Michigan Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences.

But in the race to bring America’s first SMR online, Holtec has competition.

In 2024, California-based Kairos Power broke ground in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on the construction of a demonstration reactor, aiming to start operations in 2028. The next step will be a commercial-scale reactor which the company says will produce electricity on the grid by 2030. It’s opted for a different technology to Holtec, using molten fluoride salt as a coolant instead of water.

Kairos is interesting because it’s one of the few companies in the US that’s actually building right now, said Allison Macfarlane, director of the School of Public Policy and Global Affairs at the University of British Columbia, and a former chair of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Its process of building, testing, learning and building again may take longer than companies that just design and build one final reactor, but it can provide invaluable learning. “You have to demonstrate the technology before you can sell it to anyone,” Macfarlane told CNN. “Whether it will be successful is another story.”

Big tech companies are betting it will be. In 2024, Kairos signed a deal with Google to deploy a fleet of reactors totaling 500 megawatts — enough to power around 300,000 homes — with the first slated to start operations in 2030. Kairos wouldn’t confirm the value of the deal but said it will help it build out factory production lines and “accelerate the learning curve, making each unit cheaper and faster to deploy.”

Other tech companies are also pouring money into the field. Amazon invested in Maryland-headquartered X-Energy, which uses a gas-cooled design and is planning up to 12 SMRs at a new facility in Washington state.

Earlier this month, Meta announced a deal with SMR startup Oklo to prepay for power and to help build a campus in Pike County, Ohio, to support Meta’s data centers in the region. Oklo did not disclose the value of the deal but a spokesperson told CNN, “the full project build-out would be a multi-billion dollar infrastructure project.”

There’s plenty of public money, too. In December, the Department of Energy approved $800 million toward developing SMRs, with $4 million to Holtec, and more is on the horizon.

“The deployment of advanced reactors is a priority for the Trump administration,” said Rian Bahran, deputy assistant secretary for nuclear reactors. “Additional funds will be invested in the research, development, and deployment of these technologies.”

As the hype increases, some experts are sounding warning bells.

All the arguments in favor of SMRs overlook a fundamental issue, said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists: They are too expensive.

Despite all the money swilling around the sector, “it’s still not enough,” he told CNN. Nuclear power cannot compete on cost with alternatives, both fossil fuels and increasingly renewable energy, he said. “An SMR is still a luxury, and it may be more affordable in terms of its initial price tag, but that doesn’t mean it’s producing less expensive electricity.”

So far, the NRC has approved only one SMR design, by the company NuScale Power, but a project to build them in Idaho was canceled in 2023 as costs soared and not enough utilities signed on to buy electricity.

Neither Kairos nor Holtec would confirm how much their SMRs will cost, citing commercial sensitivity.

Some SMRs also have an issue with fuel. The more unconventional designs, those cooled by salt or gas, often require a special type of fuel called high-assay low-enriched uranium, known as HALEU (pronounced hay-loo). The amounts available are limited and the supply chain has been dominated by Russia, despite efforts to build up a domestic supply.

It’s a major risk, said Touran. The biggest challenge nuclear has is competing with natural gas, he said, a “luxury, super expensive fuel may not be the best way.”

There is still stigma around nuclear waste, too. SMR companies say smaller reactors mean less nuclear waste, but 2022 research from Stanford University suggested some SMRs could actually generate more waste, in part because they are less fuel efficient.

Amid the push to accelerate SMRs, some experts say the biggest concern is safety. The Trump administration has focused on speeding up licensing processes and loosening regulatory requirements, which Lyman fears will not give enough time to evaluate safety and security. “It’s really the Wild West,” he said.

Other experts are more optimistic. “Just eliminating regulations without much thought is dangerous,” Michigan’s Kochunas said. But done properly “I don’t think there’s any inherent concerns to safety by prioritizing and fast tracking SMRs,” he told CNN.

The Department of Energy rejected claims safety would be compromised. “DOE upholds the highest standards of safety in our work with the nuclear industry,” Bahran said.

As companies race to prove SMRs can meet the hype, experts appear to be divided in their thinking.

For some, SMRs are an expensive — and potentially dangerous — distraction, with timelines that stretch so far into the future they cannot be a genuine answer to soaring needs for clean power right now. They may not be ready for decades, Macfarlane said. “Will these companies wait until then? Will AI be relevant then?” she asked.

Lyman believes a driving force behind the push to get SMRs online is fear that time is running out to compete with wind, solar and batteries. “If they don’t prove what they’re claiming about how nuclear power is going to save the world, then it’s going to become obsolete,” he said.

Others, however, point out that all technology is expensive to start with, and costs tend to come down as it advances. SMRs could mean data centers don’t strain the grid and push up people’s electricity bills, they could be used in remote areas instead of diesel generators or even in industrial factories to provide heat, they argue.

Investing in SMRs now will prove, one way or another, if they can be an option to complement wind or solar, Touran said, “progress requires people to do stuff.”

“Let’s build the reactor. Let’s turn it on, and let’s see if it actually runs well,” he said. “The big debate, the big race is who can run one economically.”

Baird's bill attempts to maintain multiple generations of trees on state forest land.
The bill would require the Department of Natural Resources to ensure that 10% of state forest land consists of forests 100 years or older and 10% of state forest land consists of forests 20 years or younger at all times.
""The Department of Forestry estimates that 28% of our state forests consist of trees 100 years or older.
But even the 10% figure intended to preserve forest land isn't entirely logical to environmental advocates who have similar intentions.","Almost everyone agrees that Indiana forests are under threat. Figuring out how to help them is where the quibbling begins even among environmentalists who want to do all they can to preserve the forests.

Lawmakers this session have proposed legislation designed to support forest health. House Bill 1414 intends to bolster funding for the state's Division of Forestry and strengthen forest conservation requirements. The bill would tack entrance fees onto state forest visits (which unlike state parks, are typically free to enter) and regulate new and old growth forest composition.

Bill author Rep. Beau Baird, R-Greencastle, said his intention with the bill is to preserve the environmental, economic, recreational and health benefits that woodlands provide to Hoosiers.

""Our forest lands are under threat,"" Baird said speaking Jan. 21 in the House Committee on Natural Resources. ""We want to make sure they're here for generations to enjoy.""

Many support Baird's plan to increase revenue for state forestry. But not all environmentalist advocates are convinced that the current bill delivers on the forest health front. Some worry that it might actually imperil the ancient trees it was designed to protect.

Age mandates for trees worry some environmentalists

Woodlands that are healthy, biodiverse and able to provide food and habitat for myriad species usually have a mix of tree types, from skinny saplings to looming old-timers. Old growth forests are especially prized for their ability to sequester large amounts of carbon and provide for other life forms.

Baird's bill attempts to maintain multiple generations of trees on state forest land. The bill would require the Department of Natural Resources to ensure that 10% of state forest land consists of forests 100 years or older and 10% of state forest land consists of forests 20 years or younger at all times.

The Nature Conservancy, one of Indiana's largest conservation organizations, supports the bill, citing an amendment that provides some liability protection for land trusts, like TNC, who host hikers, bikers and outdoorsmen.

TNC believes the management techniques outlined would help ensure the longevity of Indiana forests, said John Ketzenberger, TNC's director of government relations.

Other environmental advocacy groups took a slightly different stance, saying the bill's language concerned them.

""As written, this could be interpreted as instructing the department to cull any trees that are 100 years or older that fall outside of that percentage population mark,"" said Nicole Snider, a volunteer with the Sierra Club Hoosier Chapter. ""The Department of Forestry estimates that 28% of our state forests consist of trees 100 years or older. This means that a huge swath of our mature trees that fall outside of that 10% limit will be cut.""

The vague nature of the four-page bill was a frequent theme of discontent among lobbyists who had varying interpretations of what might be required to comply with the bill.

""We believe it is a mandate to continuously log in order to maintain that 20 years and younger. We also believe it caps the ability of the forest to mature beyond 100 years at 10%,"" said Jason Flickman, the executive director of the Indiana Forest Alliance. ""I think that needs to be defined in this legislation before any movement is made on it.""

Baird said he did not think the bill would have that impact. Right now, he said, the DNR isn't mandated to protect any amount of forest that has aged past a century. This bill would set at least some of the forests aside for preservation.

""I'm hoping they keep as much of that as they can, but they do that in a scientific based manner, and I want them to follow that science. I'm just saying if you decide to cut into that, 10% has to be saved,"" he said.

But even the 10% figure intended to preserve forest land isn't entirely logical to environmental advocates who have similar intentions.

David Van Gilder, the senior policy and legal director for the Hoosier Environmental Council, said that HEC supported the heart of the bill and agreed it was wise to find ways to increase revenue for the forests. But he was less positive about the plan to set benchmarks for forest conservation targets.

""HEC is not aware of any data that supports that 10% number,"" Van Gilder said. ""We suspect that that is a smaller number than it ought to be.""

Despite acknowledging the need for ""fine tuning,"" the bill passed out of the House Committee on Natural Resources by a vote of 8-3.",https://www.indystar.com/gcdn/-mm-/e201518a1d35e85adb723e28a8ff14633b74d7bc/c=0-41-800-491/local/-/media/2021/06/27/Bloomington/b1d5a012d1d065c680d1c7567c5c838e.jpg?width=800&height=450&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp,N,,2026-01-22 08:39:02.893377

“Our entire entrepreneurial system is thriving in our state, where I think we’ve found that balance.”","California Governor Gavin Newsom drew applause at the World Economic Forum in Davos Thursday with a heated denunciation of President Donald Trump — but also rejected the growing Davos consensus that Trump represents a permanent breach in the American-led global order.

Newsom spoke a day after Trump grudgingly backed off threats to seize Greenland, and two days after Canadian Prime Minister captivated the global forum by declaring that US allies needed to acknowledge a permanent “rupture” in the global systems and begin hedging their bets by deeper engagement with China.

“These relationships are in dormancy. They’re not dead,” Newsom told me in a Thursday morning interview. “I don’t use those binary terms. Don’t fall prey to that. That’s a bit hyperbolic.”

Newsom drew repeated applause from an audience in the Congress Center that included European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde for heated denunciations of Trump, who he painted as an anomalous figure who “will be remembered in years, not decades.” Newsom denounced “corruption and graft at a scale we’ve never seen in American history,” and waved red kneepads at CEOs and American politicians he painted as frightened and subservient.

“I respect what Carney did because he has courage of convictions. He stood up,” Newsom said. But he also lamented that Carney’s deal with Beijing would involve “introducing low cost, high quality electric vehicles, not made in Michigan or Detroit, but overseas, into Canada.

“It says everything you know about the recklessness of America’s foreign policy,” Newsom said. “It’s a remarkable thing to break down 80-plus years of alliances. It takes decades and decades to build trust in organisations …. It takes weeks, tweets, hours, minutes, sometimes to destroy it.”

Newsom also defended his decision to “fight fire with fire” by responding to Trump and his aides with the personal, sometimes sexual, social media jibes the White House directs at their enemies.

“it’s deeply unbecoming. Come on. Of course it is. It’s not what we should be doing,” he said. “But you’ve got to point out the absurdity. You got to put a mirror up to this.” He proceeded to describe Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who had attacked Newsom as a Ken doll, as appearing “as if he was reading a diary and had just broken up with someone.”

Newsom also criticized a proposal by a California union to fund health care with a one-time wealth tax on the state’s super rich. “We’re competing with 50 states,” he said. Capital flows and moves …. The impact of that has to be considered in the context of how freely capital can move and how that’s already occurred..” He added that the if the proposed referendum gets on the ballot, it would lose.

Ben’s view

Newsom has energized American Democrats and their European allies by fighting Trump on his own terms, but some of the most striking parts of our conversation came when I challenged him on Americans’ doubts about Democratic governance in states and cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco, as well as New York and Chicago.

Newsom’s response to that question — perhaps the largest hanging over his likely presidential campaign in 2028 — is an unabashed rejection of its premise. He rejected the notion that government — rather than environmental conditions — bore responsibility for devastating Los Angeles fires, defended extending state health insurance to undocumented migrants, and blew past my question about how the state could run a deficit amid a historic AI boom.

“California has figured it out in many respects,” Newsom told me, touting the state’s growing number of tech giants, a new wave of venture capital pouring into its companies, and OpenAI’s San Francisco headquarters even as the state spends heavily on social programs. “Our entire entrepreneurial system is thriving in our state, where I think we’ve found that balance.”","https://img.semafor.com/32b9b141749f8b3b1c0a15acf19b4b6146f7048c-5500x3667.jpg?rect=0,390,5500,2888&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format",N,,2026-01-22 07:39:50.093084

But Lowen said she needs to see evidence that nuclear energy is cost-effective before she buys into the conversation.
State law currently limits the construction of nuclear power plants and the disposal of nuclear waste within Hawaiʻi.","For decades, Hawaiʻi has said no to nuclear power. But advancements in nuclear technology and pressures to shift Hawaiʻi away from costly oil have prompted some lawmakers to revisit the nuclear question.

Last session, the state Legislature directed the Hawaiʻi State Energy Office to convene a working group to explore whether new forms of nuclear energy production, like small modular reactors and microreactors, could be a good fit for Hawaiʻi.

These new technologies take up a significantly smaller footprint than conventional nuclear facilities like Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania. Small modular reactors can be less than a third the size of a conventional reactor, and new microreactors are being developed to fit inside shipping containers.

A nuclear plant can also produce power 24 hours a day regardless of weather conditions, unlike wind or solar farms, and emits zero carbon emissions during operation.

Despite these advantages, the Hawaiʻi State Energy Office determined advanced nuclear technologies are not appropriate for Hawaiʻi at this time.

The Energy Office's Monique Zanfes led the working group and produced its final report. Zanfes told HPR that these new technologies show more promise than conventional nuclear power, but they are still too nascent to be a worthwhile investment.

Only a handful of small modular reactors are in operation in the world, and none of them are in the U.S. Zanfes said even working group members who see a potential role for nuclear power in Hawaiʻi’s future don’t want the state to be ""the guinea pig"" for new nuclear technology.

And right now, the electricity produced by advanced nuclear technologies isn't any cheaper than oil generation.

""We certainly do not want to introduce a new technology that is going to cost more for ratepayers,"" Zanfes said.

Working group weighs concerns

The working group included state agency representatives, industry experts, and environmental advocates.

Zanfes said there was consensus among the group that advanced nuclear technologies need to develop further before they can be a cost-effective energy solution for Hawaiʻi.

But some group members disagreed on some of the finer points, like the threat posed by nuclear waste.

The U.S. has no permanent, long-term place to store spent nuclear fuel, which remains extremely radioactive after use.

Any nuclear waste produced by a local nuclear facility may need to be cooled and stored onsite or somewhere in the state.

Zanfes said some members of the group expressed concerns that long-term storage of nuclear waste in the islands could pose a serious contamination risk to our environment.

""If radiation gets into soils or the atmosphere, there's a chance that plants could take it and then it gets transferred up through the food chain. If it gets into our aquifers, it can dissipate across underground geology,"" she said.

Others in the group countered by pointing out that nuclear waste is safely stored at a number of sites across the U.S.

Working group member Jack Shriver spent over 20 years in the U.S. Navy as a nuclear submarine officer and operated naval nuclear plants during that time. He thinks the hurdles around the storage and transport of nuclear waste are ""very manageable.""

""All of the nuclear waste is contained, and you can point to it and say, that is the waste right there in that container,"" he said. ""If you compare that to any other energy source, in particular fossil fuels, you can't point to it. It's out there in the environment, right?""

But the Pacific is home to more than one example of nuclear contamination.

The U.S. conducted 67 nuclear weapon tests in the Republic of the Marshall Islands between 1946 and 1958. The Energy Office’s report notes that the Marshall Islands still experience radiation impacts to this day. Similar impacts have been felt in Tahiti, Guam, and other Pacific nations.

""In the Pacific in particular, we have people who have direct experience with radioactive waste,"" Zanfes said.

While Zanfes noted that ""the peaceful production of energy is very different then defense related testing,"" she said those experiences have understandably shaped public perception of nuclear power and should not be disregarded.

Lawmakers’ next move

Over the last 15 years, lawmakers have repeatedly introduced bills to create nuclear commissions or conduct feasibility studies on nuclear power, but those measures have rarely gained traction.

Many of those bills have come across the desk of state Rep. Nicole Lowen, who chairs the House Energy and Environmental Protection Committee.

Lowen said she agrees with the Energy Office’s conclusion that nuclear energy doesn't make sense for Hawaiʻi right now. But she added that she thinks the national conversation around nuclear energy is changing.

""There's just been a lot more focus nationally in getting off of fossil fuels. I think that nuclear has a role to play in that,"" she said.

While the Trump administration has shown no interest in limiting fossil fuel use, the White House has been supportive of expanding nuclear energy production.

The U.S. Department of Energy released a memo on Tuesday that lays out plans for ""America’s next nuclear renaissance.""

But Lowen said she needs to see evidence that nuclear energy is cost-effective before she buys into the conversation.

""Any real discussion of it is pending the cost coming down, because until that is something that makes sense, it's sort of like, why open the can of worms?"" she said.

State law currently limits the construction of nuclear power plants and the disposal of nuclear waste within Hawaiʻi. The Energy Office is not recommending any amendments to those laws at this time.

Hawaiʻi Sen. Glenn Wakai led calls last session for the Energy Office to convene the working group. He said he still thinks nuclear power has potential to be a part of Hawaiʻi’s grid and hopes that small modular reactors become commercially viable in the near future.

""Hopefully, in the next three to five years, that will develop, and then we can revisit this issue,"" he said.

Until then, Wakai plans to put the issue on the back burner. He told HPR that this legislative session, he's focusing on grid reliability, reducing energy costs, and geothermal exploration.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a06994a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/9134x4795+0+542/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F42%2F47%2F7f34ed5d44f08f5210afde8222e4%2Fap23018538370282.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 06:37:49.566721

That’s because the most common way to forge it begins with producing iron in coal-fired blast furnaces.

Now, for the first time, a new report identifies who buys the lion’s share of primary steel in the United States — and how much steel they’re buying.

At least 60% of U.S. primary steel is purchased by automobile manufacturers, according to an analysis from the environmental group Mighty Earth that was shared exclusively with Canary Media. The six automakers identified in the report — Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co., Honda Motor Co., Hyundai Motor Group, Stellantis, and Toyota Motor Corp. — produce 73% of all new cars on American roads.

The finding highlights a point of leverage for customers in decarbonizing American steel production at a moment when steelmakers are largely reversing plans for greener mills and doubling down on coal-fired blast furnaces.

“The auto market drives blast furnaces in the U.S.,” said Matthew Groch, senior director of decarbonization at Mighty Earth. ​“If they really cared and wanted to, they could put pressure on these companies they’re buying steel from. But they aren’t, and they don’t.”

Only one of the six automakers, Honda, responded to emailed questions from Canary Media. But the Japanese firm declined to comment on its steel suppliers.

“Honda is actively working to reduce CO₂ emissions associated with raw material procurement and manufacturing processes,” Honda spokesperson Chris Abbruzzese said in an email. ​“We do not publicly disclose individual supplier relationships.”

Automakers have traditionally relied on primary steel to form the outer shell of their cars because it’s long been considered higher quality than steel made from recycled scrap metal in electric arc furnaces. Increasingly, though, thanks to improvements in its purity and strength, so-called secondary steel has been able to displace some of that demand. Steel recyclers like Nucor say the auto sector represents a growing share of their customer base, but primary steel made using coal still dominates the sector.

To identify the buyers of primary U.S. steel, Mighty Earth commissioned the consultancy Empower LLC to conduct ​“an exhaustive review” of supply chains, according to the report. The analysts then reviewed ​“everything from annual reports and investor presentations to new articles and company websites, looking for clues regarding links between the steel facilities of interest and their ties to the largest U.S. automakers.” The study relied on supply chain and financial data from the platforms Panjiva, Sayari Graph, S&P Capital IQ, and MarkLines, and it used OpenRailwayMap to track materials shipped by train.

Since President Donald Trump returned to office a year ago, the nascent efforts to clean up America’s primary steel production have largely collapsed.

Cleveland-Cliffs, which had been awarded a $500 million grant from the Biden administration to finance construction of new, greener equipment at one of its Ohio steelworks, abandoned the initiative and is now working with Trump’s Energy Department to develop a coal-focused scope for the project.

U.S. Steel, whose sale to Japanese rival Nippon Steel was approved by the Trump administration, finds itself at a crossroads. The company has promised some greener investments in the U.S. but has yet to announce any specifics. Its new owner, however, has a reputation as ​“a coal company that also makes steel” — and Nippon has also promised to invest in upgrading U.S. Steel’s blast furnaces to last longer.

That leaves Hyundai’s project to build a low-carbon steel factory in Louisiana as the flagship push for clean steel in the U.S.

Despite recent challenges from the Trump administration, Hyundai has signaled its commitment to bringing the facility online by 2029. The plant is designed to first use blue hydrogen, the version of the fuel made with fossil gas and carbon capture equipment, to produce the cleaner direct reduced iron. But by the mid-2030s, the facility is expected to switch to green hydrogen, made with electrolyzers powered by renewables.

The low-carbon iron will then be fed into electric arc furnaces to produce steel — making it the first integrated low-carbon steel plant in the U.S. That Louisiana plant could reduce emissions by at least 75% relative to a traditional integrated steel plant with a blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace.

In a sign of progress, Hyundai this month announced plans to test its DRI equipment at an existing steelworks in South Korea in anticipation of bringing the technology to Louisiana.

Once that Louisiana plant comes online, Groch said, it’s expected to generate enough steel to meet Hyundai’s needs and supply additional potential buyers — opening up an opportunity for other automakers. In its report, Mighty Earth calls on automakers to commit to buying more green steel in the coming years.

General Motors and Ford have committed to buying at least 10% green steel by 2030 as part of a pledge via the First Movers Coalition, led by the World Economic Forum. Other global carmakers not included in Mighty Earth’s report, such as Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW, have adopted separate targets. Honda, Stellantis, and Toyota, meanwhile, have avoided making such promises.

Holding car companies to those targets has proved challenging. While some companies have vowed to slash emissions by buying more low-carbon steel, a September 2024 report by the International Council on Clean Transportation found that carmakers’ pledges to buy fossil-free steel by 2030 cover less than 2% of their total demand for the metal.

“We’re not asking for everyone to have 100% green steel,” Groch said. ​“But these are their commitments, and the car companies are the ones driving investment in steel.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GMC-factory_2026-01-22-015933_ynmi.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=19f91f7a316c3f2f3a030ab5a2f5e56c,N,,2026-01-22 05:59:12.038123

“It has been an extraordinarily destructive year,” said Rachel Cleetus, climate and energy policy director at the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists.
The Interior Department announced a $625 million investment to “reinvigorate and expand America’s coal industry” and directed a costly Michigan coal plant on the verge of closure to stay open.
Indeed, only a small fraction of the climate damage threatened by Trump is truly permanent, experts told Grist.
Trump’s climate blitzkrieg may be the starkest example yet of the benefits and drawbacks of that model.","One year ago, with one of the first strokes of his presidential Sharpie, President Donald Trump signed an executive order declaring a “national energy emergency,” making good on a campaign promise to “drill, baby, drill.” It was the first of many such orders, signaling that the championing of fossil fuels would be a cornerstone of the new administration: A subsequent order pledged to revitalize America’s waning coal industry, eliminate subsidies for electric vehicles approved by Congress under former president Joe Biden, and loosen regulations for domestic producers of fossil fuels. Yet another executive order withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, the nearly unanimously-adopted international treaty that coordinates the global fight against climate change. He resumed liquefied natural gas permitting paused by his predecessor and reopened United States coastlines to drilling.

In the days following his inauguration, Trump killed a climate jobs training program, closed off millions of acres of federal water designated for offshore wind development, reopened U.S. coastlines to drilling, and scrubbed mentions of climate change from some federal agency websites. To many observers, it looked like the most comprehensive reorientation of the executive branch’s environmental and climate priorities in American history.

On paper, it certainly appears as though Trump has continued to make good on these early promises. He pushed Congress to pass the so-called Big Beautiful Bill, which phases out an extensive set of tax credits — for wind and solar energy, electric vehicles, and other decarbonization tools — that were responsible for much of the progress the U.S. was expected to make toward its Paris Agreement commitments. (That move has already led some companies to abandon new clean energy projects.) Trump’s attacks on the nation’s offshore wind industry, which he recently called “so pathetic and so bad,” have been unrelenting, culminating in a blanket ban on offshore leases last month. A few weeks ago, he upped the ante on his earlier withdrawal from the Paris Agreement by severing ties with the United Nations framework that facilitates international cooperation on matters of climate change, environmental health, and resilience — a treaty that was ratified unanimously by the U.S. Senate in 1992.

“It has been an extraordinarily destructive year,” said Rachel Cleetus, climate and energy policy director at the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists. It’s not hard to find specific moves that have already done tangible harm to the climate: The EPA, for instance, delayed a requirement that oil and gas operators reduce emissions of methane, an ultra-potent and fast-acting greenhouse gas, for a full year. The Interior Department announced a $625 million investment to “reinvigorate and expand America’s coal industry” and directed a costly Michigan coal plant on the verge of closure to stay open.

However, while these moves have been effective in sowing panic and uncertainty, their long-term effects on the country’s climate policy framework are far from certain. Indeed, only a small fraction of the climate damage threatened by Trump is truly permanent, experts told Grist. That’s not only because many of Trump’s moves may ultimately be ruled illegal — federal judges in Rhode Island and New York, for instance, allowed offshore wind farms in those states to resume construction just last week — but also because executive actions can be reversed by a future president. And the president has not shown much interest in passing energy- or climate-related legislation, a far more durable form of policymaking than executive decree. Despite claims to the contrary, Trump has signed fewer bills than any president since Dwight D. Eisenhower.

“He is not changing law,” said Elaine Kamarck, who worked in the Clinton administration and is the founding director of the Brookings Institution’s Center for Effective Public Management. “He is changing practice.”

Even something as unprecedented as the EPA’s moves to relinquish its own authority to regulate the emissions that affect human health — a responsibility that comprises a core tenet part of the agency’s mission and is therefore widely regarded as unlikely to hold up in court — could be unraveled by a future administration even if it’s ruled to be legal, though that process would take years.

“You can’t make up for the lost time, the increased emissions, and the extent that new areas are opened up for [fossil fuel] exploration,” said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. “But from a regulatory perspective, what this administration is doing to EPA and the other agencies are all executive actions that can be undone in the same way they were done.”

The major exception is the GOP’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA. If a future administration wants to restore expansive tax credits for wind and solar energy, that president will have to push Congress to pass new climate legislation. But the climate-relevant portions of OBBBA are noteworthy for being subtractive rather than additive — and are perhaps more accurately viewed as a representation of Trump’s quest to refute former President Biden’s legacy than a desire to radically alter U.S. energy law. Indeed, the new law left in place tax credits for other sources of carbon-free energy, including nuclear and geothermal — something that more moderate Republicans who do not share the president’s dismissal of climate science have been quick to note.

“We like to point out that the baseload clean energy credits were maintained,” said Luke Bolar, head of external affairs and communications at ClearPath, a think tank that develops conservative climate policies. Sean Casten, a Democratic U.S. Representative from Illinois, said that the goal of the Biden-era climate legislation — ensuring that U.S. clean energy can be built in a cost-competitive way — has largely been achieved even if specific parts of the law have been repealed.

“Every single zero-carbon power source … is still cheaper on the margin than a fuel energy source,” he said.

The relative fragility of Trump’s assault on bedrock environmental and climate laws could be a product of the president’s prioritization of political dominance over lasting change, said Josh Freed, senior vice president for climate and energy at the think tank Third Way.

For example, the administration has taken steps to shield the American coal industry from the punishing blows of competition, environmental regulation, and the rising costs of mining. Trump has signed an executive order aimed at “reinvigorating America’s beautiful clean coal industry,” granted coal-fired power plants temporary exemptions from emissions limits, and ended a federal moratorium on coal leasing. But those interventions will do little in the long run to reverse a decline driven mainly by economics: The nation’s aging coal plants are becoming increasingly expensive to run while natural gas and solar energy have only gotten cheaper. And they certainly don’t help the president’s stated goal of reducing household energy costs.

To attempt to make sense of the president’s crusade to save coal is to assume there is a larger political strategy at play — which may not be the case, Freed said.

“There’s no reason to bring back coal other than to show that the administration can bring back coal,” he said. “It’s not like there’s this huge lobbying effort or donor base that will be of significant benefit to MAGA or Republicans if they do it.”

A style of governance motivated by political dominance is a good way to make headlines, but it’s not a particularly effective way to build a lasting legacy. Trump’s efforts to buoy coal may help the industry in the short term, but experts are broadly in agreement that coal can’t be “saved” without sustained support from the federal government. And an industry that can only survive with a coal-friendly Republican in the Oval Office isn’t exactly thriving.

“When you have to get the government to step in to put its thumb on the scale in order to help your industry,” Sean Feaster, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, told my colleagues earlier this week, “it’s a sign that you’re not particularly competitive, right?”

For decades now, the pendulum of U.S. climate policy has swung left and right, reflecting the priorities of the sitting president. Trump’s climate blitzkrieg may be the starkest example yet of the benefits and drawbacks of that model. But despite his best efforts to stand out from the pack, the president’s first year back in office fits a well-worn pattern. As a result, his victories may not last much longer than his presidency.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/trump-climate-legacy.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2026-01-22 04:57:32.508643

On her first day in office Tuesday, New Jersey Democratic Gov. Mikie Sherrill signed executive orders seeking to freeze electricity cost increases, issue ratepayer relief in the form of bill credits, and increase distributed energy resources, including utility-scale solar and battery storage.

One order directed the state’s Board of Public Utilities to ensure bill credits by July 1 and to “consider pursuing a pause, abeyance, or modification of the schedule governing any proceedings in which electric distribution utilities seek approvals for rate increases or cost recoveries.” It also ordered the board to publish a study within 180 days of how to “modernize” the traditional electric utility business model, including opportunities to make utility revenue models “less dependent on capital spending.”

Another order focused on growing the state’s electricity supply and increasing efficiency. It directed regulators to initiate solicitations for solar and transmission-scale battery storage and to begin development of a virtual power plant program to be administered by electric distribution utilities and third-party suppliers in the state.

Dive Insight:

Sherrill, who made affordability and rising energy prices a focus of her campaign, said in her inaugural speech that the orders “will deliver relief to consumers and stop rate hikes.”

“This will also create the conditions to massively expand New Jersey’s power generation, because more power in-state will help lower costs,” she said.

Electric rates were a key issue in the governor’s race, particularly after bills spiked as much as 20% last year. Another increase is slated to go into effect this summer. The increases are a result of higher capacity prices in PJM’s recent auctions, which are held several years in advance and reflect both current and projected power demand.

Residential bill credits will rely on the same or similar funding sources used in August 2025 to provide credits, according to Sherrill’s first executive order. Last year, the BPU said all 3.9 million New Jersey residential ratepayers of Public Service Electric and Gas, Atlantic City Electric, Jersey Central Power and Light, and Rockland Electric would receive $100 in direct bill assistance.

PSE&G emailed a statement responding to Sherrill’s orders, saying “steps must be taken to safeguard long-term energy reliability and cost effectiveness for residents as New Jersey relies on imported electricity for more than 40% of its power.”

“We are confident that open dialogue and information sharing will lead to workable solutions,” the utility said.

Grid advocates hailed the governor’s focus on developing new sources of energy.

“These executive orders are tackling peak demand, unlocking customer-sited resources, and speeding deployment of solar and storage,” Katie Mettle, New Jersey state lead at Advanced Energy United, said in a statement.

According to the second executive order, the BPU has 45 days to initiate a solicitation “for qualifying solar facilities or solar facilities in combination with storage” under the state’s Competitive Solar Incentive program. Within the same timeframe, the BPU must also open 3 GW of capacity for registration under New Jersey’s Community Solar Energy Program, “endeavoring to expedite the registration process by any necessary and appropriate means.”

Regulators must also accelerate the development of grid-scale storage through the Garden State Energy Storage Program by holding a solicitation within 45 days, launching Phase 2 of the program within 90 days, and “thereafter establishing a specific tranche of capacity for electric distribution utilities to develop to support interconnection of distributed energy resources and grid stability.”

And, within 180 days, the BPU must begin development of a virtual power plant program that aims “to drive down peak demand by aggregating behind-the-meter distributed energy resources.”

“Virtual power plants are a proven, cost-effective way to lower peak demand, improve reliability, and put downward pressure on energy bills,” AEU’s Mettle said.

Allison McLeod, interim executive director of the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters, said the group was “particularly encouraged” by the actions aimed at solar and battery storage development.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/nYZ5mhT74OAM_W_VUwjKcwa4tRzkVz4rm2bN_HTfdY8/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjQ1MDYyODk4Yi5qcGc=.webp,N,,2026-01-22 06:37:53.649608

She was delighted to see how fast vibe coding could give her the command codes she needed.
That quick win in generating command codes led Wilton and Computational Biologist Nick Chia to think about other ways vibe coding could help.
He said vibe coding can help him explain his work to the many collaborators from different backgrounds that he works with.","It started with a social media post from Andrej Karpathy, one of the founders of OpenAI. Last year, he tweeted, ​“There’s a new kind of coding I call ​‘vibe coding,’ where you fully give into the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists.” Karpathy said that large language models and voice-to-text programs had gotten so sophisticated that he could just ask a model to create something and then copy and paste the code it generated to build a project or create a web app from scratch. ​“I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy-paste stuff, and it mostly works.”

That groovy technique might be good for patching a glitchy website or building a phone app, but can it really change the way we do science? Researchers from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory are testing vibe coding tools and techniques to see how they stand up to data-intensive scientific challenges. At a recent hackathon, researchers from across the lab gathered to learn together and test commercially available coding tools like Cursor and Warp against scientific challenges as large and hairy as the hunt for dark matter and as pressing as the optimization of nuclear power plants.

As a long-time leader in computational science and the home of Aurora, one of the world’s fastest and most powerful supercomputers, Argonne is no stranger to grand challenges. But to solve huge problems and to process more data than ever before, researchers are working to stay at the bleeding edge of harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) for science.

“With these tools, you’re not bottlenecked by writing code. Now, you’re focused on ideas.” — Rick Stevens, associate laboratory director for Computing, Environment and Life Sciences

Rick Stevens sees vibe coding as another way Argonne researchers can continue to speed up scientific innovation. Stevens is the associate laboratory director for Computing, Environment and Life Sciences at Argonne. He has said that scientists need to be able to work as fast as they can think. He gets frustrated by the bottlenecks of current technology. But vibe coding is a productivity hack. ​“You’re unhobbled from your coding speed,” said Stevens.

With vibe coding, researchers can interact with large language models in real time, asking them questions by talking rather than by typing commands, and then getting usable output in seconds or minutes. Stevens compared it to having an AI co-scientist — or even a team of co-scientists — working alongside you. He challenged fellow scientists to work with the technology every day. ​“You need to get your head around how to be productive in this environment,” he said. ​“Think, play and have a blast!”

Breaking barriers between ideas and action

Part of the excitement around vibe coding is that we don’t know how it’s going to change science. At the hackathon, the vibe in the room was playful. The group was a mix of coders and non-coders from a variety of disciplines. Instead of quietly pecking away at their keyboards, researchers were laughing, bouncing ideas off each other and confidently speaking commands to their laptops.

The promise of AI and vibe coding isn’t just about doing science faster, Stevens explained. These tools free up scientists to be more creative, to put their energy toward things that only a human can do. ​“With these tools, you’re not bottlenecked by writing code,” he said. ​“Now, you’re focused on ideas.”

Here are some of the ideas Argonne scientists are vibing on:

1. Prototyping software to strengthen nuclear power plants

Nuclear power plants are an integral part of America’s energy supply and a reliable source of power for the growing energy needs of AI. Nuclear engineer Yeni Li and her team are creating AI models of those power plants to help plant engineers and managers predict the best times for maintenance. That knowledge can lead to more reliable and affordable energy production.

Li said that vibe coding will be useful for setting up the software architecture she needs to turn her ideas into prototypes. ​“These tools will help us do a few days of work in a single afternoon,” said Li.

2. Automating workflows in bioscience

Rosemarie Wilton doesn’t do a lot of coding in her work as a molecular biologist, but she does spend a significant amount of time using software tools for data analysis. Developing Python-coded pipelines would allow her to automate her data processing workflows and integrate multiple tools seamlessly. She was delighted to see how fast vibe coding could give her the command codes she needed. ​“For a coding novice, it’s really quite amazing. It will be a time saver,” she said.

That quick win in generating command codes led Wilton and Computational Biologist Nick Chia to think about other ways vibe coding could help. Chia mused, ​“If we have an AI agent generating hypotheses for experiments, could we create another AI agent to order the chemicals or samples needed to run those experiments?” Speeding up routine processes like these could help Wilton and her team track the spread of human pathogens with greater accuracy or engineer new enzymes and biosynthetic pathways faster than ever before.

3. Translating coding languages in science infrastructure

Zachary Sherman is a software developer who manages open-source Python tools for the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement group. He came to the hackathon looking for ways to quickly translate other coding languages into Python, a task that could take years of tedious manual coding.

“There are many different atmospheric tools in different coding languages and also databases with application programming interfaces for downloading and interacting with atmospheric datasets,” said Sherman. ​“Some of these tools are outdated. We think vibe coding can help us create tools in Python to interact with these interfaces to download and work with the datasets. We also think vibe coding will help us modernize these code bases so we can troubleshoot issues faster and save time and money as we maintain essential scientific infrastructure.”

4. Understanding the nature of the universe

Chiara Bissolotti is a nuclear physicist trying to understand how all known particles interact. Tim Hobbs is a theoretical particle physicist trying to identify unknown particles that can help us understand the nature of dark matter or other possible ​“new physics” in the universe. Both of their fields generate huge amounts of data from theoretical computer simulations, cosmological observations and experiments at research institutions such as CERN’s Large Hadron Collider and the planned Electron-Ion Collider at DOE’s Brookhaven National Laboratory. The information hidden where their data sets overlap could be the key to answering some of the biggest mysteries of the universe, from quarks to the cosmos. But merging those data sets is a monumental task if you’re coding and comparing them by hand.

“Can the data sets talk to each other?” asked Hobbs. ​“Might they be hiding common patterns, or guide us toward novel theoretical predictions or the automation of burdensome calculations?”

Bissolotti summed it up, ​“We have many, many ideas. Many more ideas than time. If vibe coding can help us build the scaffolding of the code or help us make the data comparisons more scalable and efficient, we can cut our time to solution by a huge factor.”

5. Collaborating on complex problems in national security

Jonathan Ozik is a computational scientist who uses supercomputers and simulations to understand large and complex systems across many scientific domains, such as biological systems, health care interventions and infectious diseases in urban settings. He said vibe coding can help him explain his work to the many collaborators from different backgrounds that he works with. He also sees it as a way that he can help himself switch between complex projects. ​“It could give me a two-minute reintroduction to the code and the context I’m working in,” he said. ​“There’s no reason not to try to make your daily tasks easier.”

Ozik predicts vibe coding will open research up to ideas we can’t yet begin to imagine: ​“If you have fewer perceived barriers, you create new possibilities. Things that were previously infeasible in science will become common.”",https://www.anl.gov/sites/www/files/2026-01/34276D_0034_CELS_AI%20Jam_PRINT_16x9.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 06:37:57.662590

Ørsted, Equinor, and Dominion Energy all got the green light from federal judges last week to resume work on their massive, multibillion-dollar wind farms off America’s east coast. The companies wasted no time restarting the installation of turbines, offshore substations, and other equipment — eager to make up for delays that had cost each of them millions of dollars a day and threatened to tank at least one project that is more than halfway complete.

The developers had been stuck in limbo since receiving the Dec. 22 suspension order from the U.S. Interior Department, which cited unspecified ​“reasons of national security” — a rationale that failed to convince federal judges as they weighed developers’ requests for relief. Two other in-progress projects remain mired by delays as they await hearings.

The late-December order was the culmination of the Trump administration’s yearlong assault on offshore wind, which has managed to freeze new development but has been less successful in stopping projects already underway. Most of the five projects are in advanced stages of construction and viewed as critical by grid planners for keeping electricity reliable and affordable. These offshore wind farms are likely the only ones that will get built nationwide in the coming years because of Trump’s interventions.

Dominion Energy, which is developing the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project, said it delivered the first batch of turbine components by ship to its leasing area off Virginia Beach, Virginia, last weekend and is now installing the first of its 176 turbines. All the turbine foundations are already in place for the $11.2 billion project, and the utility is working to start producing power in the first quarter of this year.

The wind farm is expected to supply 2.6 gigawatts of clean electricity to the grid when fully completed later this year — power that the region can’t afford to lose, according to the mid-Atlantic grid operator PJM Interconnection.

In a Jan. 13 court brief supporting Dominion Energy, PJM said the offshore wind project would help with the ​“acute need for new power generation to meet demand” in the 13-state region, much of which is being driven by the boom in AI data centers. ​“Further delay of the project will cause irreparable harm to the 67 million residents of this region that depend on continued reliable delivery of electricity,” according to PJM’s filing.

Meanwhile, off the coast of Rhode Island, Ørsted has resumed construction on the 704-megawatt Revolution Wind project, which was nearly 90% complete when the federal stop-work order came late last month. The Danish energy giant was hit with a similar order in August, which a federal judge lifted in September given the lack of any ​“factual findings” by the Trump administration.

Of Revolution Wind’s 65 wind turbines, 58 are already in place, as are the cables and substations needed to bring the power to shore. At the time of the December suspension, the $6.2 billion project had been expected to start generating power as soon as this month, according to Ørsted.

Equinor, which had also previously received a separate stop-work order, is back to work on its 810-MW Empire Wind project off the coast of Long Island, New York.

The developer recently warned that the $5 billion project, which is more than 60% complete, would likely face cancellation if work couldn’t resume by Jan. 16; it won a favorable ruling on Jan. 15. Molly Morris, president of Equinor Renewables America, said the project is using a heavy-lift vessel that is available at the project site only until February, The City reported. After that, Equinor wouldn’t have been able to lease the vessel for another year, creating untenable project delays.

A spokesperson for Equinor said the company now expects to complete work assigned to the vessel, which includes installing an offshore substation, following the injunction ruling.

Continuing construction on America’s offshore wind farms ​“is good news for stressed power grids on the East Coast,” Hillary Bright, executive director of the advocacy group Turn Forward, said in a statement last week. She added that if projects aren’t allowed to advance, the electricity system in the heavily populated region will be ​“more likely to experience reliability issues and see ratepayer bills soar.”

Americans’ utility bills are already climbing nationwide, owing in large part to the rising prices and constrained supplies of fossil gas. Residents in colder-climate states are especially feeling the squeeze this winter — though early data shows that existing offshore wind operations are helping reduce electricity costs in some places.

Vineyard Wind, a 800-MW wind farm off the coast of Massachusetts, has been sending power to the grid from 30 of its planned 62 turbines since last October. On Dec. 7, an especially chilly day, the project’s wind output helped displace a significant amount of fossil gas on the wholesale market, resulting in savings of more than $2 million for New England ratepayers over the course of the day, Amanda Barker, the clean energy program manager with Green Energy Consumers Alliance, said on a Jan. 21 press call.

Vineyard Wind is one of the two projects waiting to resume construction in the wake of Interior’s December suspension order. Its developers, Avangrid and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, sued the federal government on Jan. 15, becoming the last of the affected firms to seek legal relief from the Trump administration’s attacks. Vineyard Wind is now 95% complete, with all but one of its turbines now hovering over the Atlantic Ocean.

The second stalled project, Sunrise Wind, is an Ørsted development off the coast of New York. The 924-MW wind farm is almost 50% complete and, before the stop-work order, was expected to come online in 2026. A court hearing for the development is scheduled for Feb. 2, and the delay is costing Ørsted millions of dollars in the meantime.

Overall, the court orders from last week represent a win for getting more electricity onto the grid during a time of rising demand — and another round of setbacks for Trump’s efforts to destroy the fledgling sector.

Support For Statement Of Principles

Voices from across the energy economy are echoing the warning raised by the White House/governors’ Statement of Principles and endorsing the plan as the clearest path forward.

Utilities and Power Producers

-- Exelon President and CEO Calvin Butler: “But the high energy supply costs our customers face demand long-term solutions. This is the kind of early action needed to move beyond 20th-century approaches and toward modern energy solutions that meet today’s demands. Exelon is continuing our all-of-the-above efforts in states to address the insufficient energy supply and increasing demand at the heart of high energy supply costs through utility-generated power.”

-- PPL President and Chief Executive Officer Vincent Sorgi: “We continue to believe that whoever is able and willing to build new generation should be encouraged to do so. And at PPL, we are absolutely willing and able to be part of the solution.”

-- Talen Energy CEO Mac McFarland: “Not surprisingly, Friday’s announcement calls for large load customers to pay for this new generation. We agree with most observers that the costs of electricity should be paid by those that use the electricity. Electricity should be affordable and reliable for household consumers. The mechanisms for allocating these costs, however, need to be considered thoughtfully so they do not disincentivize the tremendous economic development that large loads, including data centers, can bring to our communities. We applaud the White House and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s efforts in this area and think reasonable minds can find the right means to allocate burdens appropriately.”

-- Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith: “Microsoft thanks President Trump and the governors for their leadership on this important issue, and we welcome the bipartisan effort to expand America’s energy generation capacity while protecting Americans from higher costs. This is a strong starting point, and we look forward to engaging with stakeholders as this important work moves forward.”

-- Google: “We agree data centers should pay their own way. For us, it is table stakes. When built responsibly, data centers can provide long-term, reliable demand that stimulates new investments in energy production and transmission in a way that helps all consumers.”

-- Amazon Chief Global Affairs and Legal Officer David Zapolsky: “[Amazon] is paying our full energy costs and is committed to ensuring our data centers don’t increase consumers’ electricity bills.”

Energy and Consumer Advocates and Experts

-- Vote Solar Mid-Atlantic Regional Director Elowyn Corby: “Holding data centers accountable and making them responsible for their own costs is a big step in the right direction… The Shapiro administration can and should point to the extension of the price cap that is part of this plan as a big win that honestly wouldn’t have happened without them.”

-- ITI Executive Vice President of Public Sector Gordon Bitko: “The tech industry remains committed to making investments to modernize the grid and working to offset costs for ratepayers as demand for digital and AI-powered services continues to grow.”

-- Advance Energy United CEO Heather O’Neill: “Advanced energy companies will be first in line to meet data center demand if this proposal is implemented in a way that’s fair and competitive. However, significant hurdles remain. We will never meet our growing energy needs until the grid operator PJM makes it easier for advanced energy projects to connect to the power grid.”

Extending Price Cap

If the price cap is implemented as proposed, the extended price cap would save more than 67 million consumers — including 13 million Pennsylvanians — within the PJM region approximately $27 billion over the next two years with $5 billion in Pennsylvania alone.

These savings would be in addition to the $18.2 billion already saved as a direct result of Governor Shapiro’s 2024 lawsuit.

Together, these reforms are designed to lower costs, strengthen reliability, and finally fix PJM’s broken process — allowing economic growth and data center development to continue without burdening ratepayers.

Levy compares it to the early days of commercial solar development.“This is an emerging issue the way solar was eight or nine years ago.","Editor’s note: This is part of a series called “Paved Over” that explores the impact of tech-driven development on U.S. farmland. Stories will focus on data center expansion, solar development, the impact to farmers losing land and possible solutions.

Rural communities across the United States are experiencing tech-driven development pressure as electricity-hungry technologies like artificial intelligence take center stage. While high-density regions are accustomed to curating development via local mechanisms like zoning and deed restrictions, others aren’t as prepared.

The federal government uses incentives, or the lack thereof, to broadly influence this development. In August, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins announced that the agency would nix Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act tax credits for wind and solar development on productive ag land by the end of 2027. The USDA also significantly rolled back its Rural Energy for America Program (REAP), which provides grants and loans to agricultural producers for renewable energy systems and efficiency improvements.

Rather than commercial solar developers, REAP beneficiaries are mostly individual farmers looking to lower on-farm energy costs by installing panels on farm shed roofs, according Samantha Levy, senior policy manager for conservation and energy at the advocacy organization American Farmland Trust.

“It’s one of those instances where the idea or the rhetoric is perhaps reflecting a sentiment that they would like to see achieved, but the policy thus far is not the tool that’s really going to be changing this broader challenge,” she said.

There are other policies, both favorable and restrictive, for tech-driven development in the legislative pipeline:

Protecting American Farmland Act. Introduced by Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., it would explicitly prohibit solar development on prime farmland as defined by the Farmland Protection Policy Act. It is currently in committee.

SPEED Act. Already passed by the House, the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act would streamline projects covered by the National Environmental Policy Act. This could benefit both oil and gas, and renewable energy, and is relevant given data centers’ skyrocketing energy needs.

Political rhetoric

Despite the Trump administration’s pivot away from clean energy, Jeff Risley, executive director of Renewable Energy Farmers of America, expects clean-energy development on rural land to find an “equilibrium” and continue “because [electricity] demand is greatly increasing.”

“The market is going to reward the cheapest and fastest that can come on line, and that’s wind and solar,” he said. Some farmers point toward alternative clean-energy sources like nuclear power as a better option; however, powerplants take decades to build, and more electricity is needed now.

Given that, Risley argued that solar is targeted “for political reasons and not practical reasons. Imagine standing up to one of your landowner neighbors and saying, ‘You can’t drill for oil on your land. I don’t want to see a pump jack out there.’”

Risley said this is also true of wind turbines, which take up minimal acreage and don’t impact crop production that much. He said farmers who want to sell or lease their land for clean energy or tech-driven development should be able to do so.

“Aesthetics are not a good argument. They’re just not. Viewshed is not a good argument. Of course, we believe in zoning. We believe that communities need to be involved in the process. They absolutely do. But it needs to be civil and it needs to be a rational conversation about what’s best for everybody,” he says.

States are also taking action. Many pay landowners to voluntarily restrict development on their property through Purchase of Agricultural Conservation Easements agreements. Others tax land on its agricultural value rather than market potential. Missouri is attempting more drastic action via “a bill that would put a moratorium on any solar development, even if it’s under construction at this point, to be able to write statewide regulations on this type of thing,” Risley continues. Rather than moratoriums, Risley emphasized a need for better local-level regulation because every community is unique.

In Ohio, broader protectionary policies are gaining traction. Gerry Puckett, director of communications and industry relations with Ohio Corn and Wheat, points to House Bill 15, which was recently codified into law by the Ohio General Assembly, as a good example. The legislation promotes energy generation on brownfields and abandoned sites. He says it’s good for both urban and rural residents.

“We have areas in our state that could use redevelopment for energy projects,” Puckett says. “That’s a benefit not only to the people who live in those communities, but to all Ohioans. And it helps protect land that will never return to farming otherwise.”

Data center support

Concurrent to sundowning its solar energy incentives, the federal government is working to rapidly expand data centers, which house artificial intelligence and cloud-based digital infrastructure. They’re driving the increasing energy demand that solar arrays and wind farms aim to feed. In July, Pres. Donald Trump streamlined regulation to encourage data center development with his Accelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure executive order.

“We will pursue bold, large-scale industrial plans to vault the United States further into the lead on critical manufacturing processes and technologies that are essential to national security, economic prosperity and scientific leadership,” Trump stated in the order. “It will be a priority of my administration to facilitate the rapid and efficient buildout of this infrastructure by easing federal regulatory burdens.”

Alongside this buildout, Trump’s order supports constructing the high-voltage transmission lines and adjacent power facilities that power the data centers.

“It’s incredible. Many of them are under construction already. We’re leading AI,” Trump said during a White House briefing in early January.

This push is taking America’s rural spaces by storm. Levy compares it to the early days of commercial solar development.“This is an emerging issue the way solar was eight or nine years ago. It took us time to ‘get over our skis on it’ and really understand it from a thoughtful perspective. What’s happening? What’s needed? How does this impact our mission?” Levy said. “Policymaking is trying to get on top of it",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt61a1feb8f1185447/69714beb66a9989ad3cbf12b/0119H1-5640A-1800x1012.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-22 05:37:57.202780

Even Saudi Arabia is ramping up its clean energy capacity, with the 2025 launch of its multibillion-dollar Greenfield solar projects. And in Latin America, nearly 70% of electricity now comes from renewables, as solar, wind, and biofuels see significant increases across the region.

3. The AI revolution needs clean energy to continue

OpenAI CEO and AI billionaire Sam Altman has called for an ""energy breakthrough"" to meet the voracious energy appetites for AI data centers, which are projected to consume as much electricity as the entire nation of Japan by 2030.

In a 2024 summit, Altman said that increased renewables, in particular cheaper solar power and storage, were the way forward. His comments are seconded by Elon Musk, who warned last year that AI's electricity needs could lead to rampant power shortages.

The world will turn to fossil fuels to meet some of this demand. But the energy shortage will further drive interest in renewables, which aren't locked into a zero-sum battle with fossil fuels as many people assume.

A ""catch-all"" way to play this trend

The iShares Global Clean Energy ETF could still be in the early days of its rally as the renewables transition accelerates in 2026.

As an exchange-traded fund, it has over 100 holdings, with broad exposure across renewable energy sectors from solar to wind power to fuel cells. Its largest holding, Bloom Energy, is up 534% over the last year, but at just 10.55% of its portfolio, this fuel cell company's surge isn't the reason for the fund's outperformance. Another holding, the wind power company Vestas Wind Systems, has returned 90% over the last 12 months. And SolarEdge, a producer of microinverters for solar panels, has returned 136% over the last year.

These big gains across a variety of companies in different sectors of renewable energy -- wind, solar, and fuel cells -- show that the fund is thriving from broad-based exposure. Meanwhile, its expense ratio of 0.39% is lower than the industry average of 0.56%. For investors looking for a low-cost, simple way to capture broad-based upside in the renewables transition, this fund looks like a buy.

With an outlay of INR181 billion (USD2.08 billion), the scheme aimed to establish 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) of advanced battery cell manufacturing capacity in India by 2025. However, as of October 2025, only 2.8% (1.4GWh) of the targeted capacity has been commissioned within the stipulated timeline—all by Ola Electric—shows a new report by JMK Research, and the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).

The report, ‘Assessing India’s incentive scheme to enhance the battery manufacturing ecosystem’, provides in-depth analysis of the scheme, its beneficiaries, and progress to date. It identifies key bottlenecks and suggests measures to improve the scheme’s effectiveness.

There is a substantial gap between the intended and actual outcomes of the ACC PLI scheme. Against an estimated 1.03 million jobs, it has generated only 1,118 jobs (0.12% of the target). Investment levels have also lagged, with around INR28.7 billion (USD330 million) committed so far, accounting for 25.58% of the targeted INR112.5 billion (USD1.29 billion).

“Although strong policy support led to substantial investment announcements and capacity plans outside the ACC PLI scheme, on-ground progress remained sluggish. For beneficiaries, the Centre has imposed a penalty of 0.1% of the performance security for each day of delay in commissioning. Moreover, with India’s dependence on imported battery cells still close to 100%, the scheme’s original objectives remain largely unfulfilled,” says Prabhakar Sharma, senior consultant, JMK Research, and a co-author of the report.

While the ACC PLI tenders attracted overwhelming interest, capacity allocation remains incomplete. The MHI initially allocated the full 50GWh in the first auction held in March 2022, but Hyundai Global Motors’ withdrawal from its 20GWh allocation prompted a second auction. In the September 2024 round, bidders secured only 10GWh. The government plans to tender the remaining 10GWh at a later stage.

As of October 2025, no incentives have been disbursed against the targeted INR29 billion (USD332 million). Reliance New Energy has indicated on-time commissioning of the capacity awarded under the second auction round (10GWh), while capacity allocated in the first auction round (5GWh) remains delayed. Ola Electric has scaled back its expansion plans and now aims to install only 5GWh of its 20GWh capacity by FY2029.

The report also highlights gaps in the scheme’s evaluation framework. Among all bidders across both auction rounds, only Exide Industries and Amara Raja had prior experience in battery manufacturing, yet neither qualified. The evaluation criteria placed greater emphasis on domestic value addition (DVA), proposed capacity, and subsidy benchmarks, where new entrants scored higher, resulting in the selection of firms without prior expertise.

“Going forward, improving the effectiveness of ACC PLI will require a holistic, multi-pronged strategy. This would include introducing robust cell testing and certification infrastructure; scaling up equipment manufacturing, and recycling; and developing skilled domestic talent, among other things,” says the report’s co-author Saif Jahangir, consultant, JMK Research and Analytics.

Moreover, a dedicated policy for critical minerals, covering both sourcing and refining,will be crucial.

“It is equally important to assess how India can attract global battery players to establish manufacturing facilities in the country. The government designed the scheme to encourage both domestic and international participation and bringing established global players into the ecosystem would strengthen capabilities, accelerate technology transfer, and help steer the industry in the right direction,” says Vibhuti Garg, Director – South Asia, IEEFA.

,EPA,2026-01-22 07:02:32+00:00,AP News,The EPA is easing pollution rules under Trump. Here's how it's affecting Texas | AP News,Alejandra Martinez/the Texas Tribune,,,,,https://apnews.com/article/lee-zeldin-industry-regulation-pollution-texas-u-s-environmental-protection-agency-1432dbbcd7edb4b62dabbbd298eba2af,"Methane rules put on pause A major EPA move centers on methane, a potent greenhouse gas that traps heat far more efficiently than carbon dioxide over the short term.
It accounts for roughly 16% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is a major driver of climate change.
Shelley said uniform EPA rules provided regulatory certainty for changes operators saw as inevitable.
Colin Leyden, Texas state director and energy lead at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, said eliminating the program could hurt Texas industry.
Leyden said tallying up the dollar value of lives saved when evaluating pollution rules is a foundational principle of the EPA since its creation.","The first year of President Trump’s second term has seen an aggressive rollback of federal environmental protections, which advocacy groups fear will bring more pollution, higher health risks, and less information and power for Texas communities, especially in heavily industrial and urban areas.

Within Trump’s first 100 days in office, his new Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Lee Zeldin, announced a sweeping slate of 31 deregulatory actions. The list, which Zeldin called the agency’s “greatest day of deregulation,” targeted everything from soot standards and power plant pollution rules to the Endangerment Finding, the legal and scientific foundation that obligates the EPA to regulate climate-changing pollution under the Clean Air Act.

Since then, the agency froze research grants, shrank its workforce, and removed some references to climate change and environmental justice from its website — moves that environmental advocates say send a clear signal: the EPA’s new direction will come at the expense of public health.

Cyrus Reed, conservation director of the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club, said Texas is one of the states that feels EPA policy changes directly because the state has shown little interest in stepping up its environmental enforcement as the federal government scales back.

“If we were a state that was open to doing our own regulations there’d be less impact from these rollbacks,” Reed said. “But we’re not.”

“Now we have an EPA that isn’t interested in enforcing its own rules,” he added.

Richard Richter, a spokesperson at the state’s environmental agency, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, said in a statement that the agency takes protecting public health and natural resources seriously and acts consistently and quickly to enforce federal and state environmental laws when they’re violated.

Methane rules put on pause

A major EPA move centers on methane, a potent greenhouse gas that traps heat far more efficiently than carbon dioxide over the short term. It accounts for roughly 16% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is a major driver of climate change. In the U.S., the largest source of methane emissions is the energy sector, especially in Texas, the nation’s top oil and gas producer.

In 2024, the Biden administration finalized long-anticipated rules requiring oil and gas operators to sharply reduce methane emissions from wells, pipelines, and storage facilities. The rule, developed with industry input, targeted leaks, equipment failures, and routine flaring, the burning off of excess natural gas at the wellhead.

Under the rule, operators would have been required to monitor emissions, inspect sites with gas-imaging cameras for leaks, and phase out routine flaring. States are required to come up with a plan to implement the rule, but Texas has yet to do so. Under Trump’s EPA, that deadline has been extended until January 2027 — an 18-month postponement.

Texas doesn’t have a rule to capture escaping methane emissions from energy infrastructure. Richter, the TCEQ spokesperson, said the agency continues to work toward developing the state plan.

Adrian Shelley, Texas director of the watchdog group Public Citizen, said the rule represented a rare moment of alignment between environmentalists and major oil and gas producers.

“I think the fossil fuel industry generally understood that this was the direction the planet and their industry was moving,” he said. Shelley said uniform EPA rules provided regulatory certainty for changes operators saw as inevitable.

Reed, the Sierra Club conservation director, said the delay of methane rules means Texas still has no plan to reduce emissions, while neighboring New Mexico already has imposed its own state methane emission rules that require the industry to detect and repair methane leaks and ban routine venting and flaring.

These regulations have cut methane emissions in the New Mexico portion of the Permian Basin — the oil-rich area that covers West Texas and southeast New Mexico — to half that of Texas, according to a recent data analysis by the Environmental Defense Fund. That’s despite New Mexico doubling production since 2020.

A retreat from soot standards

Fine particulate matter or PM 2.5, one of six pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act, has been called by researchers the deadliest form of air pollution.

In 2024, the EPA under President Biden strengthened air rules for particulate matter by lowering the annual limit from 12 to 9 micrograms per cubic meter. It was the first update since 2012 and one of the most ambitious pieces of Biden’s environmental agenda, driven by mounting evidence that particulate pollution is linked to premature death, heart disease, asthma, and other respiratory illnesses.

After the rule was issued, 24 Republican-led states, including Kentucky and West Virginia, sued to revert to the weaker standard. Texas filed a separate suit asking to block the rule’s recent expansion.

State agencies are responsible for enforcing the federal standards. The TCEQ is charged with creating a list of counties that exceed the federal standard and submitting those recommendations to Gov. Greg Abbott, who then finalizes the designations and submits them to the EPA.

Under the 9 microgram standard, parts of Texas, including Dallas, Harris (which includes Houston), Tarrant (Fort Worth), and Bowie (Texarkana) counties, were in the process of being designated nonattainment areas — which, when finalized, would trigger a legal requirement for the state to develop a plan to clean up the air.

That process stalled after Trump returned to office. Gov. Greg Abbott submitted his designations to EPA last February, but EPA has not yet acted on his designations, according to Richter, the TCEQ spokesperson.

In a court filing last year, the Trump EPA asked a federal appeals court to vacate the stricter standard, bypassing the traditional notice and comment administrative process.

For now, the rule technically remains in effect, but environmental advocates say the EPA’s retreat undermines enforcement of the rule and signals to polluters that it may be short-lived.

Shelley, with Public Citizen, believes the PM2.5 rule would have delivered the greatest health benefit of any EPA regulation affecting Texas, particularly through reductions in diesel pollution from trucks.

“I still hold out hope that it will come back,” he said.

Unraveling the climate framework

Beyond individual pollutants, the Trump EPA has moved to dismantle the federal architecture for addressing climate change.

Among the proposals is eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which requires power plants, refineries, and oil and gas suppliers to report annual emissions. The proposal has drawn opposition from both environmental groups and industry, which relies on the data for planning and compliance.

Colin Leyden, Texas state director and energy lead at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, said eliminating the program could hurt Texas industry. If methane emissions are no longer reported, then buyers and investors of natural gas, for example, won’t have an official way to measure how much methane pollution is associated with that gas, according to Leyden. That makes it harder to judge how “clean” or “climate-friendly” the product is, which international buyers are increasingly demanding.

“This isn’t just bad for the planet,” he said. “It makes the Texas industry less competitive.”

The administration also proposed last year rescinding the Endangerment Finding, issued in 2009, which obligates the EPA to regulate climate pollution. Most recently, the EPA said it will stop calculating how much money is saved in health care costs as a result of air pollution regulations that curb particulate matter 2.5 and ozone, a component of smog. Both can cause respiratory and health problems.

Leyden said tallying up the dollar value of lives saved when evaluating pollution rules is a foundational principle of the EPA since its creation.

“That really erodes the basic idea that (the EPA) protects health and safety and the environment,” he said.

As AI-driven power demand grows, market watchers are eyeing fossil fuels to beat the energy bottleneck.
""Across all the fossil fuels, gas is the most efficient and the cleanest one,"" he added.
To withdraw from fossil fuels in line with climate goals, energy storage must be ramped up.
The European Commission is betting on such gains across the whole energy system in what it has dubbed the ""twin potential of energy for AI and AI for energy.""","Stalled demand for energy in Europe pushed investors away from renewables, but artificial intelligence could see cash flow back into the sector, while also uplifting fossil fuels.

Global electricity generation from renewables is expected to jump by 60% in 2030, accounting for 45% of total electricity output, per the International Energy Agency. Almost 50% of European power came from renewables in 2024, and the region has a strong pipeline of solar and on- and offshore wind waiting to be connected to the grid.

""The problem we have now is integrating all of that variable supply into our power markets,"" Peter Osbaldstone, research director for European power and renewables at Wood Mackenzie, told CNBC.

Pressure on integration results in pressure on prices, ""which undermines the economics of investments, which makes the whole process of supporting a decarbonized power mix more difficult, more expensive for governments to bear,"" he said.

As AI-driven power demand grows, market watchers are eyeing fossil fuels to beat the energy bottleneck. The IEA revised its 2025-2030 growth forecast for renewables downward by 5% compared to 2024, reflecting the changing sentiment and policy, largely from the U.S.

Redeploying fossil fuel energy is a ""short‑term crutch"" that helps the AI roll-out get going, but ""renewable energy is the only way to win in the long term,"" Agate Freimane, partner at venture capital firm Norrsken, told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Jan. 8.

""China and the U.S. have both acknowledged the need for vast energy resources to power an AI future, and this is reflected in the adoption of renewables. Taking the global view — renewable energy prices have dropped by more than 90%, and in 2024, 91% of new renewable projects were cheaper than fossil alternatives,"" Freimane said in a follow-up email.

""This shift triggers a self-reinforcing cycle: cheaper clean power accelerates electrification, rising electrification boosts demand for storage and grid intelligence, and those upgrades push the cost of clean energy even lower. In this way, it can be argued that AI is accelerating the shift to renewables,"" she added.

Dealing with intermittency

For Alberto Faraco, a senior analyst who covers infrastructure at Morningstar DBRS, intermittency is still a fundamental issue with renewables. Investment needs to be made across the whole system — not just the energy-generating side, he told CNBC.

""Data centers should help the development of renewables, because that should push the price of electricity up, but transmission would need to be developed, battery storage would need to be developed,"" he said, adding that renewables alone will not be enough to serve the stable needs of the data centers.

""Gas for the time being would be impossible to phase out,"" said Faraco.

watch now

Nuclear energy is touted as a steady baseload option for renewables, but that doesn't account for volatility in their supply and demand. Nuclear can't be switched on and off when it's needed, Faraco said. ""Across all the fossil fuels, gas is the most efficient and the cleanest one,"" he added.

This is part of the reason why Wood Mackenzie expects gas — considered a transition fuel by the European Union — to remain part of the energy mix up as far ahead as 2060.

""There is a call to be made at some point by governments: What do I do with gas generation?"" Osbaldstone said. But ultimately, ""the lights have got to stay on.""

To withdraw from fossil fuels in line with climate goals, energy storage must be ramped up. Battery costs have fallen 90% in less than 15 years, per a 2024 IEA report, and newer chemistries are being developed for long-duration storage.

The investment case is not clear-cut, however.

""If you've got that long-duration battery storage, its utilization in a typical year is going to be very low, because you're not going to have that many opportunities to really deploy that asset,"" Osbaldstone said, noting that their use depends on the weather.

There's a price risk too, given operators don't know how much they will pay or make from storing and selling energy. ""As you add more batteries to the grid, this arbitrage margin may compress because there will be more batteries buying electricity at the low price and more batteries selling electricity at the higher prices,"" Faraco said.

A 'twin potential'

Supporters argue that AI could also serve as a critical enabler of smarter storage, allowing for better management.

""AI-driven data analytics could improve planning, project design and real-time operational decisions, resulting in reduced fuel consumption, lower CO2 emissions and extended asset lifetimes,"" according to an IEA report.

The European Commission is betting on such gains across the whole energy system in what it has dubbed the ""twin potential of energy for AI and AI for energy.""

The bloc's forthcoming roadmap for digitalization and AI in the energy sector will ""accelerate the uptake of digitalisation and AI in the energy sector while improving energy efficiency and system reliability,"" a Commission spokesperson said when approached about a rollback of climate policy to fuel soaring electricity demand from AI and data centers.

""As AI rapidly advances, its potential to strengthen Europe's energy resilience and accelerate the clean transition is becoming increasingly clear. At the same time, the growing electricity needs of AI technologies call for smart, forward-looking planning,"" they said.

""The European Commission aims to ensure the EU is fully prepared to seize these opportunities while safeguarding the stability and reliability of Europe's energy system.""

Agate echoed the ""huge opportunity.""

""As it stands, there are several examples of companies using AI to improve energy systems — Vind AI revolutionising wind energy, Granular Energy enabling greater transparency, and Juna.ai in manufacturing,"" she said, pointing to startups that Norrsken has invested in.

""Additionally, improving efficiency in heavy industry is one of the most powerful levers for emissions reduction. Heavy industry accounts for around a third of global energy consumption, and AI-driven optimisation is now pushing industrial efficiency forward by decades.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107321624-1698072093729-gettyimages-1466471704-dji_0067.jpeg?v=1768986820&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2026-01-22 02:37:30.492075

The bill in question, released Tuesday, would fund the departments of Homeland Security, Defense, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, Labor, Education and other related agencies.

It seeks to claw back $879 million that passed as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021 as part of an effort to fund a nationwide EV charging network. The law originally included billions in funding for the network.

An emerging point of contention in the new legislation, meanwhile, is more about what’s not in the bill, as opposed to what is.

Some lawmakers, including Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) are pushing for the inclusion of a provision that would include sales of high-ethanol gasoline year-round.

A spokesperson for Bacon confirmed Punchbowl’s reporting that he brought up sales of high-ethanol gas at a Republican conference meeting on Wednesday morning but is not planning to vote down the bill over the issue.

“I’ve heard from our NE farmers and this is their #1 priority,” Bacon wrote in a post on the social platform X.

Bipartisan lawmakers from the Midwest have pushed for sales of E15 gas, named for its 15 percent ethanol content, year-round. This type of gasoline has historically been restricted in the summer because of concerns about smog — which can form more easily from evaporation in the heat.

Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, told The Hill in an email there is a “full-fledged push to get year-round E15 in the final package.”

He said “several” Midwestern lawmakers are “drawing a line in the sand on this issue because it is vitally important to jobs and economic vitality in their districts and states.” He did not specify which lawmakers are doing so.

“This should not be controversial — E15 is a more affordable, American-made, cleaner-burning fuel that boosts the farm economy,” Cooper said.

Meanwhile, lawmakers are also seeking to rein in the administration’s cuts to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

A joint explanatory statement accompanying the funding bill calls for restoring positions eliminated over the past year and retaining staffing levels needed for the agency to complete its statutory missions, including Cadre of On-Call Response/Recovery (CORE) staffers.

The statement comes amid reports that the administration is considering eliminating half of its staff and that it is not renewing some CORE staffers’ positions.

India’s ambitious electric vehicle (EV) and energy storage targets have accelerated battery demand, underscoring the strategic importance of lithium-ion cells, almost all of which India currently imports, primarily from China. To reduce this dependence, the Ministry of Heavy Industries (MHI) launched the Advanced Chemistry Cell Production Linked Incentive (ACC PLI) scheme in October 2021 to catalyse domestic cell manufacturing. With an outlay of INR181 billion (USD2.08 billion), the scheme aims to attract large players by mandating a minimum investment of INR11.25 billion (USD129.3 million) and by adopting an evaluation framework that places significant weight on domestic value addition (DVA), capacity development, and subsidy benchmarks.

The 50-gigawatt hours (GWh) ACC PLI tenders attracted strong interest from domestic players, with auctions heavily oversubscribed. Ola Electric, Reliance New Energy, Hyundai Global, and Rajesh Exports emerged as the selected beneficiaries. However, the initial 50GWh allocation remains incomplete after Hyundai Global Motor pulled out of its 20GWh allocation from the first tender. This prompted the MHI to re-tender 10GWh in the second auction, while reserving the remaining 10GWh for a future tender.

As of October 2025, progress under the ACC PLI scheme has been limited. Only 2.8% (1.4GWh) of the targeted 50GWh capacity has been commissioned within the stipulated timeline, entirely by Ola Electric. However, this 1.4GWh, too, represents only a partial commissioning of Ola Electric’s awarded 20GWh capacity and is yet to meet the DVA requirements needed to qualify for incentive claims. As a result, zero incentives have been disbursed to any beneficiary against the targeted INR29 billion (USD332 million) by October 2025. Ola Electric has also scaled back its expansion plans and now aims to install only 5GWh by financial year (FY) 2029. The other beneficiaries are yet to commission their ACC battery manufacturing facilities. Rajesh Exports lags the most, with progress limited to land acquisition, while reports of financial discrepancies have further raised concerns about its ability to commission the facility in the near term.

Beneficiaries have also encountered major supply chain and implementation bottlenecks that have significantly delayed facility installation. India lacks a mature cell manufacturing ecosystem, including critical mineral refining and cell component production, which leaves the industry almost entirely dependent on imports from China. Industry stakeholders also highlight delays in visa approvals for Chinese technical specialists required for equipment installation, further slowing progress. In addition, scheme-related issues such as an aggressive two-year installation timeline and high DVA requirements pose significant challenges for PLI beneficiaries with no prior experience in battery manufacturing.

There is a substantial gap between the intended and actual outcomes of the ACC PLI scheme. Against an estimated 1.03 million jobs, the scheme has generated only 1,118 jobs (0.12%). Similarly, investments of approximately INR28.7 billion (USD330 million) account for just 25.58% of the targeted INR112.5 billion (USD1.29 billion). Although strong policy support and impetus from the central government have led to substantial investment announcements and capacity plans outside the ACC PLI scheme, on-ground progress across the sector has remained sluggish. For ACC PLI beneficiaries, the central government has imposed a penalty of 0.1% of the performance security for each day of delay in commissioning. Moreover, with India’s dependence on imported battery cells still close to 100%, the scheme’s original objectives remain largely unfulfilled.

Going forward, improving the effectiveness of the ACC PLI scheme and accelerating sectoral growth will require a holistic, multi-pronged strategy. The government could begin by extending implementation timelines for beneficiaries and waiving associated penalties for another one year.

To build a competitive ecosystem similar to one China developed over a decade (2000–2010), the government must introduce and effectively implement a dedicated scheme for critical minerals, covering both sourcing and refining, as well as for cell components. In addition, tariff protection measures such as basic customs duty (BCD) and anti-dumping duties along with focused talent development and research and development (R&D) support, will be essential for the cell manufacturing industry to achieve the intended outcomes of the ACC PLI scheme.

The government’s move to promote domestic cell manufacturing was well timed, but the policy focused primarily on making cells cost-competitive through sales-linked incentives. The core challenge, however, lies in setting up manufacturing facilities, where both ACC PLI beneficiaries and non-PLI players continue to struggle. Even after India builds adequate capacity, the industry will face sustained pricing pressure from China, which benefits from a mature ecosystem and significant overcapacity. Overall, India remains at least five to ten years away from establishing a robust and competitive cell manufacturing industry, assuming policy decisions and execution stay on track.",https://ieefa.org/sites/default/files/2026-01/hero%20graphic%20%2864%29.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 00:39:15.098017

It’s a huge, lucrative market — comprising around half of new-car sales in the United States — but one that few electric vehicles have managed to enter. In 2026, however, that will change. Carmakers are planning to roll out at least six new electric SUVs this year with price tags at or below $35,000, products that could help a ease a slowdown in EV sales.

“EVs have to move more into the mass market and there are launches that are now squarely hitting that,” said Nathan Niese, Boston Consulting Group’s global lead for electric vehicles. “It’s what’s going to prop up what otherwise would be a down year.”

EV sales have surged in recent years, as carmakers improved range and charging speed, while federal incentives helped entice buyers. Relatively high costs, however, remained the last speed bump to mass adoption. Of the roughly 60 electric cars and trucks for sale in the United States last year, only three could be had for less than $35,000; the median starting sticker price was $59,100, nearly $10,000 higher than the average price for all vehicles.

When federal subsidies disappeared in September, EV sales swooned. The message for the C-suites of Detroit was clear: Price is at least as important as powertrain preference, if not more. Many auto executives have since slowed their EV plans and shifted some production back to gas-powered models that they can build (and price) more affordably.

“Anything you can do to make a customer feel you’ve given them a more affordable product is an advantage to them right now,” said Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas Public Policy.

The good news for auto executives: a steady drop in battery prices has improved the economics of EVs, opening a lane for new small models.

“The end of the EV subsidies does not necessarily spell bad news across the board,” BloombergNEF analyst Huiling Zhou wrote in a recent report. “Carmakers that can cut costs and offer affordable models in the most desirable vehicle segments are likely to see sustained sales growth.”

Here’s a look at the EVs that will likely find plenty of interest in 2026.- - -

Nissan Leaf

Nissan has long known the sales magic of an affordable EV. Since its debut 15 years ago, the Leaf has parked itself in nearly 1 million households’ driveways and garages, despite its modest range and quirky hatchback design. For the 2026 iteration, Nissan overhauled the car for the first time in nearly eight years, upsizing it to the SUV category. The end result seems to have shed many of the model’s quirks and compromises.

For one, the new Leaf no longer looks “cartoonish”, according to reviewers. Gone is the near-obsolete CHAdeMo charging port that’s akin to a Betamax videotape, replaced by a traditional CCS charging receptacle on the driver’s side and a NACS port (better known as the Tesla plug) on the passenger’s side. It does retain one important feature of past Leafs: The new model still slips under the $30,000 threshold.

Chevrolet Bolt

General Motors Co. has a similar overhaul in the works for its Chevrolet Bolt, another affordable machine that won a crowd of buyers right up until the company pulled the plug on the model in 2023. Chevy revealed the resurrected iteration of the small SUV in October and it’s set to go on sale early this year. The car looks pretty much the same and the driving range is similar, but the reborn Bolt is powered by a new battery that will cost far less and charge far more quickly than the previous version. The Bolt also has GM’s hands-free driving system — dubbed Super Cruise — and is now capable of bidirectional charging, which means it can provide power in a blackout or whenever else you need it.

Toyota C-HR BEV

The company calls the coming C-HR a “coupe-like SUV.” While the description reads like an oxymoron, it’s one that plays well with U.S. tastes in car design. The machine is big enough for a hefty Costco run, but small enough to park in a compact space.

And the new Toyota ride offers nearly 300 miles of range while coming with standard all-wheel drive, which typically compromises efficiency. Toyota teamed up with Subaru to develop the platform for this new small electric SUV, a bit of cost-sharing that will help keep the sticker price around $35,000.

Subaru Uncharted

The Subaru side of the Toyota partnership is the Uncharted, an SUV that will be a little smaller than the brand’s other electric offering, the Solterra. With the base model — starting around $35,000 — buyers can forgo all-wheel drive for about 15 more miles between charges.

Among SUV owners, Subaru ranks second in brand loyalty, meaning Crosstrek and Outback drivers waiting to go electric will finally have more than one option.

Kia EV3

Kia has already checked the “medium” and “large” boxes in its EV product line; now, it’s steering for small. The EV3, which is expected to sell for about $35,000, will slide just behind the brand’s EV6 size-wise even as its boxy design echoes the EV9, a bulky, three-row SUV. Kia is also planning to give buyers some unique color choices, from “shale grey” to “frost clue.”

Slate

Cheap EVs aren’t just the realm of incumbents. Startup Slate is swooping in with plans to deliver its first machine by year-end. The company’s first vehicle, which can be converted from pickup to SUV, is to a Ford F-150 what an Ikea futon is to a Pottery Barn sectional. The base version — the company calls it “the blank Slate” — is best described by what it isn’t. It lacks a touchscreen, cooled seats, all-wheel drive and a stereo. What Slate promises in return is a sticker price in the mid-$20,000s.

At the company’s launch event last year, Chief Executive Officer Chris Barman delivered what has since become a bit of a stump speech for cheap EVs. “The definition of what’s affordable is broken,” she said.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/09/PDTN/86602424007-my-27-chevrolet-bolt-mcm-lt-ca-4680.jpg?crop=8022,4515,x0,y838&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-22 01:38:26.140965

Legislators in the major steel state of Ohio are currently considering the measure, said Bill Paxton, a national lobbyist for the iron and steel industry.
He’d rather have peace of mind that the steel going into public roads, bridges and buildings is going to hold up.
The U.S. steel industry has been floundering for decades, shuttering mills and laying off workers amid increased global competition.
The steel industry championed the tariffs on foreign steel but is now facing another hurdle as it rushes to build new mills.","COLUMBIA — South Carolina steel companies are pushing a bill to require state and local officials to build all taxpayer-funded projects using U.S.-made steel and iron.

A House panel voted unanimously to advance the bill Tuesday after hearing from steel giant Nucor Corp., as well as American SpiralWeld, a company with operations in Columbia that turns Nucor’s steel into pipe.

“If we’re going to spend our taxpayer dollars, we would rather it come back to places like Darlington County,” said Republican Rep. Richie Yow, whose district covers a Nucor steel plant in Darlington.

The federal government has had U.S. production requirements for federally funded road projects on the books since the 1980s. Congress has tightened those mandates over the years, including most recently in the Biden administration’s massive infrastructure law.

Yow said the bill, which he sponsored, takes those federal requirements and applies them to the state.

Texas passed similar legislation in 2017, and Florida did the same last year. Legislators in the major steel state of Ohio are currently considering the measure, said Bill Paxton, a national lobbyist for the iron and steel industry.

Rep. Robert Williams, D-Darlington, raised concerns about how the measure might raise the cost of public projects, which already have ballooned in recent years.

Scott Baier, an economist at Clemson University, said those concerns may be founded.

“While such mandates increase demand for domestic producers, they also raise input prices,” he said. “If the bill passes, and increased demand drives up the costs of the construction projects, then citizens may be impacted because the higher construction expenses may reduce the number of infrastructure projects, reduce overall spending flexibility or imply higher taxes in the future.”

American-made steel is the most expensive in the world. However, the price paid for foreign steel has risen to a more even level since the Trump administration increased import taxes, known as tariffs, imposed by the U.S. government on companies that import steel into the country.

The bill also seeks to address the issue by waiving the requirement if a government can’t get U.S.-made steel fast enough or if the use of American steel increases costs by more than 25%.

Those carveouts were enough to calm worries from state agencies, especially the S.C. Department of Transportation, said Rep. Mark Smith, R-Daniel Island.

No one testified against the bill. It advanced to the full House Labor Commerce and Industry Committee.

Yow said the higher costs don’t bother him. He’d rather have peace of mind that the steel going into public roads, bridges and buildings is going to hold up.

“If it costs $5 more a yard or $5 more a ton, it’s worth the life that it saves in the end,” he said.

The U.S. steel industry has been floundering for decades, shuttering mills and laying off workers amid increased global competition.

Vice President Vance touts ‘golden age’ of manufacturing in SC steel visit

That includes the Liberty Steel Mill in Georgetown, which closed for good in 2024 after nearly a decade of on-again-off-again operations.

“I wish that we had had this bill a few years ago and our steel mill would probably still be open,” said Democratic Rep. Carl Anderson, whose district includes the former mill site.

Paxton, along with Devin Webster, a Nucor vice president in the state, blamed cheaply made steel from Turkey, India and China for the industry’s decline.

Nucor employs some 2,500 South Carolinians at multiple locations across Florence, Laurens, Lexington, York and Berkeley counties, as well as in Darlington, Webster said.

While China is the world’s largest steel producer and exporter, it sends very little to the U.S. — less than 2% of total imports into the country, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. President Donald Trump passed a 25% tariff on Chinese steel during his first term, pricing the country out of the market. He’s since upped that to 50%.

Most steel coming into the country comes from Mexico and Canada, followed by Japan, South Korea and Germany. Imports make up about a fifth of all steel used in the U.S.

The steel industry championed the tariffs on foreign steel but is now facing another hurdle as it rushes to build new mills. Demand is not keeping up, the Wall Street Journal reported in August.

Interest rates and the rising cost of steel means less demand for cars and construction that the industry relies on to buy its product.

Baier said policies, such as this legislation, aim to increase that domestic demand. How much of a dent these proposals might make in the industry’s struggles remains to be seen.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/construction-worker-2048x1381.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 07:39:59.236162

Despite the energy dominance agenda of the White House.","On the campaign trail to the 2024 elections, Donald Trump made affordable energy for Americans a top priority—along with a boost for the country’s energy industry with a view to “energy dominance”. Now, conflicts are emerging between these priorities, making it difficult to follow them all.

Two of President Trump’s energy goals are compatible enough: cheaper oil makes for greater demand both at home and abroad, so cheap gasoline for Americans can go hand in hand with growing U.S. energy dominance through exports. The latter are being boosted through sanctions on Russia and pressure on India to switch from Russian to U.S. crude, and it’s working. The Venezuelan takeover will also go towards expanding the share of U.S. oil in the global mix.

In liquefied natural gas, the dominance is even more pronounced. Last year, the United States became the first country to export over 100 million tons of the superchilled fuel, largely thanks to shipments to Europe. There is a certain sense of irony in this situation because the European Union has adopted a new methane regulation that could see LNG deliveries from the Gulf Coast take a dip because of the effect the regulation will have on prices. U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has already called for its removal twice—as has Qatar’s energy minister.

Energy affordability, then, is perfectly compatible with energy dominance. The third priority, however, boosting the energy industry, is proving tougher to fit in with the other two—because oil and gas companies do not really thrive at low oil and gas prices. And when oil and gas companies don’t thrive, they start reducing production, which lifts prices, and there goes the affordable energy goal, along with the dominance, which needs the price-sensitive energy importers such as India to grow. Related: U.S. Natural Gas Prices Surge 45% in Two Days Due to Arctic Cold

The United States is the world’s biggest producer of crude oil and natural gas. The industry got to that position despite four years of a rather hostile federal government, proving that it can survive and do well even without the support of Washington. But, of course, such support is always welcome—up to a point.

Some expected oil and gas producers to go on a drilling spree once Trump was elected, but instead, they remained cautious. That new normal of strict capital discipline and pickiness about new investments was not a passing fad. It is, quite literally, the industry’s new normal. This is what prompted Exxon to call Venezuela “univestable” after the U.S. president prompted oil majors to go in and spend $100 billion to make Venezuelan oil great again over the next ten years.

Wood Mackenzie said earlier this month that upstream capex fell globally last year and is about to fall further this year—notably including in the United States. Despite the full support of the federal government. Despite the energy dominance agenda of the White House. Many are citing uncertainty about the years after Trump’s second term ends, and they are right to be worried about who will replace him. Caution is the new “Drill, baby, drill” in the oil and gas patch.

There are, however, fundamental factors at play as well. With all the predictions of a massive global oil glut, an oil company would be justified in not drilling at will. Weak prices are also not conducive to production growth, as evidenced by the slowdown in drilling activity last year. Of course, some of that was better efficiency that drove still-higher production, but the rate of growth in production has slowed substantially.

The energy dominance priority is also a bit complicated. In liquefied gas, for instance, the United States has become heavily reliant on Europe, which has been taking in over half of U.S. exports. Now, part of that surge in purchases has been an attempt to please President Trump and get better trade deal terms, which did not happen. Another part is that the EU does not really have many options, and it will have one fewer soon after the ban on Russian gas imports comes into effect. The U.S. and Europe, in other words, are dependent on each other in LNG. Even so, Asia remains a major market as well, and demand for energy from the tech sector amid the AI frenzy is rather bullish for demand—and for that dominance agenda.

In crude oil, there is no such close interdependency with a group of buyers, but there is more competition, notably from OPEC+ but also from non-OPEC producers. None of these comes even close to the production rates of the U.S., but they do add to a market that most analysts say is already oversupplied. This oversupply situation, coupled with the intense competition in oil, makes the dominance goal harder to achieve—and doesn’t do anything about the industry’s job satisfaction levels. The three energy priorities of the Trump administration, while individually admirable, are tricky to turn into reality all at once—because some come at the expense of others.

Zanskar in the Field

LDG Rig and Plant

SALT LAKE CITY, Jan. 21, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zanskar, a company using custom-built AI to become the world’s most successful geothermal explorer, today announced a $115 million Series C funding round led by Spring Lane Capital. The round included participation from Obvious Ventures, who led the Series B; Union Square Ventures and Lowercarbon Capital, who co-led the Series A; and more than a dozen other notable energy and technology investors, including Munich Re Ventures, Susquehanna Sustainable Investments, Clearvision Ventures, Orion Industrial Ventures, Safar Partners, Imperative Ventures, StepStone Group, University Growth Fund, Cross Creek, GVP Climate, Tranquillion, Carica Sustainable Investments, UP.Partners, and the All Aboard Fund; and brings Zanskar’s total equity funding to date to $180 million.

This Series C positions Zanskar for rapid growth by enabling the company to advance its gigawatt-scale pipeline through a historic geothermal exploration and development campaign. Zanskar will spearhead one of the largest ever expansions of American geothermal power supporting construction on multiple geothermal power plants throughout the Western U.S., which are slated to begin delivering power before 2030. Zanskar will also expand its industry leading discovery platform and exploration drilling programs, and establish new relationships with strategic partners and customers.

This round marks the largest venture investment to date into AI-enabled discovery of geothermal resources, signaling a decisive shift in market confidence toward the commercial potential of undiscovered, naturally-occurring geothermal systems. By uncovering gigawatts of new geothermal potential in just a few years, and at a fraction of the traditional cost, Zanskar has proven that high-grade natural systems aren't rare: they are just hidden. This disrupts conventional thinking that these systems are too risky or too constrained to develop at any meaningful scale, and sets the stage for rapid growth in the geothermal sector.

“We started Zanskar with the belief that AI would have as profound an impact on geothermal cost and scalability as modern drilling technologies have. It would do so by enabling us to find more hidden geothermal systems, and to produce more power from each of those systems, than legacy models assumed. The result is a terawatt-scale opportunity,” said Carl Hoiland, CEO and Co-founder of Zanskar. “We’ve already confirmed multiple large, previously unknown geothermal resources across the Western U.S., and deeper drilling has validated that these systems can produce far more energy than expected. Thanks to the support of forward-thinking investors across energy, infrastructure, and technology, and the exceptional progress of our world class team, we are ushering in a new wave of clean, firm, geothermal power.”

Zanskar’s AI-native platform is a unified operating system for geothermal discovery and development that lowers discovery costs and increases the size of each geothermal field. Zanskar’s unique approach of marrying boots-on-the-ground geoscience with custom built software and AI tools has empowered Zanskar to collapse discovery timeframes and costs relative to industry best practices. This has firmly established Zanskar as the leading geothermal exploration company.

“Spring Lane is excited to lead the Series C financing for Zanskar and join the Board of the company,” said Jason Scott, Partner and Entrepreneur in Residence, Spring Lane Capital. ""We are eager to support Zanskar because we believe there is a near infinite demand for firm, clean power around the world right now and geothermal energy is one of the only immediate ways to serve this enormous market. Zanskar is unique in that they have identified more geothermal anomalies in North America than any other company in decades. We believe that Spring Lane’s financial and operational support will enable them to rapidly develop enormous amounts of geothermal capacity, initially across the Western US.”

“The world class team at Zanskar is exactly what this country needs: fast, disciplined and very effective,” said Andrew Beebe, Managing Director at Obvious Ventures. “They are positioning geothermal to be one of the cheapest, cleanest and safest energy sources in America—right when we need it most.”

“We’ve always been inspired by the early, legendary explorers that came before us. Their resourcefulness and unfailing optimism laid the groundwork for discovery today. We like to think they’d be proud to see how we’ve resurrected and accelerated grassroots exploration with big data, modern computing, and more efficient field data collection, resulting in a pace of discovery not seen before,” said Joel Edwards, co-founder and CTO of Zanskar. “The resources we need are out there, hidden within the Earth's crust, and we’re working hard to find the most exceptional hotspots to build a new era of geothermal energy, starting in the United States.”

As the U.S. races toward meeting demand for baseload power, and hyperscalers seek out clean, firm power for their data centers, Zanskar is positioned to deliver gigawatts of power—proving AI has the ability to help meet its own power demands. As it builds out geothermal power plants across the U.S., Zanskar seeks out engineers, developers, financers and others to join the team to help discover and deliver geothermal power at a pace, scale, and cost that solves energy, forever.

About Zanskar

Zanskar is the first AI-native geothermal energy company using AI to transform how we find, assess, and deliver geothermal energy.

Although natural gas is only half the cost of electricity, the colder weather may increase the amount of natural gas you use, which will then lead to higher bills.

However, here are a few tips you can do at home to help save money on your upcoming energy bill:

Inspect your natural gas piping and appliances. You are responsible for any natural gas piping on your property from our gas meter to your house or business. As the owner of your home’s gas piping and appliances, it’s your responsibility to schedule regular inspections and maintenance.

To help keep your home safe and to improve energy efficiency, always operate and maintain your natural gas appliances according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Never use an oven or a gas stovetop to heat your home.

Save money and energy by setting your thermostat to 68 degrees during the day and 58 degrees when you are away from home, where it's safe to do so.

Reduce your shower and bath time. Showering and bathing can account for 40 percent of your home's hot water use.

Keep warm air inside. Unless a fire is burning, close your fireplace damper to prevent warm air from escaping up the chimney.

Protect natural gas meters. Natural gas meters are weather-proof; however, to help keep the meter working smoothly, remove snow and ice from natural gas meters with a broom or brush. Never kick or chip snow and ice away with a hard object. Call Atmos Energy's Emergency Number at 866.322.8667 if you have concerns about your meter.

Make sure external vents for dryers and other natural gas equipment are clear. Blocked vents can lead to a dangerous buildup of carbon monoxide gas. If you have questions about proper venting, contact a licensed plumber or qualified contractor.

Minimize the risk of frozen pipes. Leave faucets running at a trickle, open cabinet doors, and close all exterior doors and windows to keep heat inside.",https://media.wfaa.com/assets/WFAA/images/5b648dfb-2a70-4667-a0b9-a876fda395ae/20260119T233148/5b648dfb-2a70-4667-a0b9-a876fda395ae_1140x641.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 04:38:57.646993

As we enter 2026, the “Golden Age” of universal green subsidies has transitioned into a more complex, results-oriented landscape. While some early-adopter programs have sunsetted, new legislation like the 2026 Global Energy Resilience Act and local initiatives like the UK Warm Homes Plan have introduced billions in fresh funding targeted at middle-income households and grid-integrated technology.

At Grid Modernist, we believe that “incentive literacy” is the first step toward energy independence. Here is your master guide to the incentives available in 2026 and how to ensure you don’t leave money on the table.

1. North America: The US & Canada Shift

In the United States, the massive direct-to-consumer rebates of the mid-2020s have been replaced by the “Targeted Transition” model.

EV Tax Deductions (US): The flat $7,500 credit has largely shifted. For 2026, many buyers are now utilizing the Interest Deduction Rule, allowing up to a $10,000 deduction on loan interest for EVs assembled in North America. This significantly lowers the “Total Cost of Ownership” (TCO) for those financing their vehicles.

Alternative Fuel Refueling Credit: Good news for home chargers! If you install a bidirectional (V2G) charger before June 30, 2026, you can still claim a 30% tax credit (up to $1,000) on hardware and installation costs.

Canada’s “Tiered ZEV” Program: Following a brief subsidy dip in 2025, Canada has launched a 2026 program specifically for affordable EV models (under $45k CAD), offering up to $5,000 for eligible battery-electric models.

2. The United Kingdom: The “Warm Homes” Revolution

The UK has officially scrapped many older insulation-only schemes in favor of the 2026 Warm Homes Plan. This is a major win for the “modernist” home.

The £5bn Grant Pool: Low-income households can now access direct grants for Solar + Batterybundles.

Heat Pump Push: A massive £2.7bn has been allocated to help homeowners transition from gas boilers to heat pumps, often covering up to £7,500 of the installation cost.

Green Mortgages: Major UK banks now offer “Interest Rebates” if you can prove your home’s EPC rating has improved via the installation of a Home Energy Management System (HEMS).

3. European Union: Social Climate Fund (SCF) 2026

The EU has pivoted toward a “Fair Transition” model.

Low-Income EV Subsidies: Countries like Germany and France have launched 2026 programs offering up to €6,000 for fully electric cars, specifically for households with a taxable income below €80,000.1

CBAM Implementation: With the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism fully operational in 2026, locally manufactured green tech (EU-made solar panels) is now often cheaper than high-carbon imports, creating an “indirect subsidy” for European-made hardware.

4. Southeast Asia: The Rise of Solar ATAP (Malaysia)

Malaysia has become a regional leader in 2026 with the launch of Solar ATAP (Accelerated Transition Action Programme).2

The Continuation of NEM: Replacing the old Net Energy Metering, Solar ATAP allows homeowners to export excess solar to the grid and receive “ATAP Credits” to offset their evening bills.3

EV Road Tax: While the tax-free period for EVs ended on Dec 31, 2025, the new 2026 tiered system remains significantly cheaper than traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) taxes, rewarding high-efficiency models.

5. Summary Table: What Can You Claim?

6. How to Apply: The “Grid Modernist” Strategy

To ensure your application isn’t rejected, follow this 3-step audit:

Check the “Installation Date”: Most 2026 incentives are based on the date the equipment is placed in service, not the date of purchase. Ensure your installer provides a “Commissioning Certificate.”

Verify MSRP Limits: Many EV incentives (especially in the US and Canada) have strict price caps ($55,000 for sedans / $80,000 for SUVs). Adding too many “Luxury Options” could disqualify you from a $5,000 rebate.

Income Verification: In 2026, subsidies are increasingly “Means-Tested.”4 Have your 2025 tax returns ready to prove you fall below the eligibility thresholds.

The Modernist Verdict

In 2026, the most lucrative incentives are no longer about buying the car—they are about integrating the system. Governments are paying you to help balance the grid. By combining a V2G charger with a solar-backed HEMS, you can “stack” these incentives to cover up to 40% of your total home energy upgrade cost.

OFFICE OF SEN. GARY PETERS

*************************

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (Mich.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, secured funding for high-impact, local public projects and Michigan priorities in the Fiscal Year 2026 Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act that passed the Senate. The bipartisan legislation includes funding for protecting the Great Lakes, continued construction of the Soo Locks, strengthening our power grid, and flood prevention. The bill now heads to the President’s desk to be signed into law.

“This bipartisan legislation delivers crucial investments that will support Michigan’s economy and help protect our Great Lakes and precious freshwater assets,” said Peters. “I was proud to secure funding in the bill to build more resilient infrastructure, bolster clean energy production, and advance research that keeps our state at the forefront of innovation.”

The bill includes numerous measures led and supported by Peters, including:

Strengthening Critical Infrastructure

Robust Funding for Soo Locks Construction: Peters secured $176.6 million in the bill for the Soo Locks construction project. This funding will support ongoing construction of the new Poe-sized lock. Peters has prioritized securing the funding necessary to build the new lock. Last year, through his role on the Appropriations Committee, he secured more than $264 million through government funding legislation. In 2024, he toured the ongoing construction project after helping to secure $257.4 million for the project. In January 2022, Peters also helped to secure $479 million for modernizing the Soo Locks through the bipartisan infrastructure law.

Brandon Road Lock and Dam Funding: Peters secured $28 million for construction of numerous measures to counter invasive carp at the Brandon Road Lock and Dam, a critical choke point for halting the continued spread of invasive carp and preventing them from establishing in the Great Lakes.

Supporting U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: The bill provides over $10 billion for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to support critical projects that strengthen our nation’s waterways and protect communities from extreme weather events.

Strengthening Michigan Ports and Harbors: The bill provides a historic more than $3 billion, a $702 million increase over fiscal year 2025, to improve navigation and commerce on our nation’s waterways, including the Great Lakes. The bill also includes funding for inland waterway navigation projects, which help improve the transport of important commodities like grain, iron, and petroleum.

Protecting the Great Lakes, Access to Clean Water

Replacing Lead Service Lines in Detroit: Peters secured $9 million in funding for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to replace lead service lines throughout the City of Detroit, helping to ensure safe drinking water and public health.

Great Lakes Authority: The bill includes $5 million for the Great Lakes Authority (GLA), one of ten federal regional commissions that seek to address major economic distress in certain geographic regions. The funding will be used to make targeted investments in economically distressed communities across the Great Lakes Basin, helping to ensure communities throughout the region have access to quality public infrastructure, job training opportunities, and the general tools necessary for economic prosperity. The GLA encompasses counties throughout eight states: Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania, and Indiana.

Great Lakes Coastal Resiliency Study: The bill provides the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers with $3 million to continue conducting its Great Lakes Coastal Resiliency Study, which is developing a coordinated strategy and identifying aging infrastructure to protect 5,200 miles of Great Lakes coastline against flooding and erosion.

Bolstering U.S. Manufacturing and Innovation, Michigan’s Automotive Sector

Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB): The bill provides $110 million for FRIB operations and $15 million for the construction of the High Rigidity Spectrometer (HRS). The facility is housed at Michigan State University. The rare isotopes produced at FRIB will allow nuclear scientists and researchers to explore a range of potential applications in the fields such as energy, medicine, and national security, including diagnosing and curing diseases, improving next generation nuclear reactors for energy, and finding processes to destroy nuclear waste. Once completed, HRS will enable isotope harvesting and substantially increase FRIB’s scientific reach and productivity.

Supporting Scientific Discovery: The bill provides $8.4 billion in funding for the Office of Science. The Office of Science is the largest federal sponsor of basic research in the physical sciences and supports 22,000 researchers at 17 national laboratories and more than 300 universities, including in Michigan. The bill will advance research in the highest priorities including high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, biology, and clean energy to maintain and strengthen our global competitiveness. The bill also boosts funding for the Office’s work on artificial intelligence and advanced computing to help the Department of Energy implement the Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence for Science, Security, and Technology (FASST) initiative.

Renewable Energy: The bill provides $3.1 billion for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs that support all types of research, including into advanced manufacturing and building and industrial decarbonization. The bill rejects President Trump’s proposed cut of over $2.5 billion for this research, as well as his proposal to zero out funding for critical solar, wind, and hydrogen research programs. The bill maintains vital investments to bolster energy and manufacturing supply chains to help ensure our continued global leadership in energy technologies.

Protecting Our Energy Grid: The bill provides $190 million to help ensure the continued success of the Department of Energy’s programs aimed at strengthening the security and resilience of our energy sector and grid. It also provides robust funding for both the Office of Electricity and the Grid Deployment Office, rejecting President Trump’s proposed merger of the two offices. The bill will also support upgrades to critical electrical grid infrastructure, an essential investment when energy costs are skyrocketing due to President Trump’s policies, including the termination of renewable energy projects across the country.

Tribal Energy: The bill provides funding for the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs. The bill also rejects President Trump’s proposal to prohibit funding for wind, solar, and battery projects. This funding will help electrify the 30,000 Tribal homes that currently do not have access to power.

The commission on Thursday advanced two proposed rules for public hearing and public comment.
The rules would require industrial manufacturers to test for three types of PFAS and 1,4-Dioxane in their wastewater and create PFAS mitigation plans if necessary.
Smith said she voted not to advance the rules for public comment because she felt they needed to be more detailed before they were brought forward for public consideration.
“My feeling was that the rule drafts were not ready yet for public comment,” Smith said.","RALEIGH, N.C. — North Carolina's environmental agencies are taking steps to further address PFAS contamination across the state. Earlier this month, the Environmental Management Commission voted to approve new rules for how PFAS production is monitored.

Nationally, as the conversation continues on how to regulate these ""forever chemicals,"" North Carolina is facing a call for more transparency and set standards for PFAS being discharged in the state’s drinking water.

The commission on Thursday advanced two proposed rules for public hearing and public comment. The rules would require industrial manufacturers to test for three types of PFAS and 1,4-Dioxane in their wastewater and create PFAS mitigation plans if necessary.

Publicly owned treatment works (POTW) and industrial direct dischargers would be required to report data collected from their baseline sampling and mitigation plans directly to the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality. The public would be able to access this information through a website maintained by the DEQ.

The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program was a federal program established through the Clean Water Act in 1972. NPDES is authorized through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate dischargers and point sources that pollute waters.

NPDES’ projected schedule for implementing the proposed 1,4-Dioxane minimization rule could go into effect as early as July 2026. With minimization plans for industrial dischargers having to be updated every two years, the fiscal impact of both rules would be determined between 2026 and 2031.

POTWs would be given notice from N.C. Department of Environmental Quality’s Division of Water Resources within 60 days to begin baseline sampling by December 2026 through December 2027. Industrial dischargers notified of the monitoring and mitigation plan requirement would need to submit a plan for review by October 2028 to be approved and implemented by June 2029.

The projected timeline for the second rule addressing PFOS, PFOA and GenX above detection levels could be enacted as early as April 2026 and share a similar implementation period.

At Thursday's more than two-hour discussion, some members on the committee argued the rules did not provide a set limit for PFAS discharge levels or compliance expectations.

It is something NCDEQ deputy communications director Josh Kastrinsky noted in a statement to Spectrum News 1.

""The most effective way to protect people from the health impacts of forever chemicals, which are tied to numerous long-term health concerns, is to reduce pollution at the source,” Kastrinsky said. “The Environmental Management Commission’s proposed monitoring and minimization rules for three PFAS chemicals target pollution sources, but the rules lack numeric limits that would require specific reductions that DEQ believes are the best means for reducing forever chemicals discharged into our environment.”

Members on the commission who voted to advance the rules to public comment argued the need to address public health concerns was urgent and that the action would bring the board one step closer to a solution. Commission Chair JD Solomon said this was not a vote to approve the two rules and the board would address PFAS limits in future meetings.

Solomon said that several public hearings on the two rules would be scheduled through April. Spectrum News 1 reached out to Solomon and other members on the board who supported the rules, but they were not available for comment.

EMC Commissioner Robin Smith motioned to add the EPA’s enforceable limits on PFAS to both rules during Thursday’s meeting, but her request was rejected by a majority of the board. Smith said she voted not to advance the rules for public comment because she felt they needed to be more detailed before they were brought forward for public consideration.

“My feeling was that the rule drafts were not ready yet for public comment,” Smith said. “I thought there were some gaps that needed to be filled, and one of them was that the rule draft didn't really have any standards to meet for these minimization plans.”

According to the EPA, North Carolina ranks third for the highest concentrations of PFAS chemicals in its drinking water nationwide.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/Image_1-21-26_at_6_35_PM,N,,2026-01-22 00:40:49.246030

The court agreed with Sierra Club’s claims and found that EPA’s interpretation of the Clean Air Act—that allowed for the loophole that Michigan used to change the area’s designation to “attainment”—was not the best interpretation of the statute Absent further appeals or EPA action, the area will return to “nonattainment” status, requiring Michigan to issue stricter pollution standards for the area and a stricter permitting process for new pollution sources seeking an air permit.

The bill in question, released Tuesday, would fund the departments of Homeland Security, Defense, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, Labor, Education and other related agencies.

It seeks to claw back $879 million that passed as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021 as part of an effort to fund a nationwide EV charging network. The law originally included billions in funding for the network.

An emerging point of contention in the new legislation, meanwhile, is more about what’s not in the bill, as opposed to what is.

Some lawmakers, including Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) are pushing for the inclusion of a provision that would include sales of high-ethanol gasoline year-round.

A spokesperson for Bacon confirmed Punchbowl’s reporting that he brought up sales of high-ethanol gas at a Republican conference meeting on Wednesday morning but is not planning to vote down the bill over the issue.

“I’ve heard from our NE farmers and this is their #1 priority,” Bacon wrote in a post on the social platform X.

Bipartisan lawmakers from the Midwest have pushed for sales of E15 gas, named for its 15 percent ethanol content, year-round. This type of gasoline has historically been restricted in the summer because of concerns about smog — which can form more easily from evaporation in the heat.

Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, told The Hill in an email there is a “full-fledged push to get year-round E15 in the final package.”

He said “several” Midwestern lawmakers are “drawing a line in the sand on this issue because it is vitally important to jobs and economic vitality in their districts and states.” He did not specify which lawmakers are doing so.

“This should not be controversial — E15 is a more affordable, American-made, cleaner-burning fuel that boosts the farm economy,” Cooper said.

Meanwhile, lawmakers are also seeking to rein in the administration’s cuts to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

A joint explanatory statement accompanying the funding bill calls for restoring positions eliminated over the past year and retaining staffing levels needed for the agency to complete its statutory missions, including Cadre of On-Call Response/Recovery (CORE) staffers.

The statement comes amid reports that the administration is considering eliminating half of its staff and that it is not renewing some CORE staffers’ positions.

Here are five key facts about the L.A. homeless count this year: 1.
At an event Tuesday, LAHSA’s interim CEO Gita O’Neill said this year’s homeless count comes at a pivotal time.
“This year’s homeless count is more important than ever,” said Amber Sheikh, chair of the LAHSA Commission.
That means the homeless count now affects city budgets in a way it never has before.","Thousands of volunteers are out on streets and sidewalks this week tallying people, tents, vehicles and shelters as part of the annual Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count.

The yearly count of the local unhoused population has become increasingly consequential and controversial in Los Angeles County. The area is home to the largest unhoused population in the U.S., estimated at more than 72,000 last year.

But it’s also one of the few places where homeless population estimates are shrinking. For the past two years, homelessness declined slightly in both the city and county of Los Angeles — even as homelessness surged 18% nationally in 2024, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Whether that trend will continue is far from certain. This year's count comes amid a major transition period for L.A.’s homelessness response system. Serious funding shortfalls threaten homeless services across the region.

Meanwhile, questions are mounting about whether the count itself can be trusted, with some local officials openly expressing doubts about its accuracy and usefulness.

The 2026 results are expected to be released in late spring or early summer.

Here are five key facts about the L.A. homeless count this year:

1. Stakes are high

Last year's count found homelessness dropped for a second consecutive year, down 3.4% in the city of Los Angeles and 4% countywide. Local officials touted those results as evidence the region’s investments in shelter and homeless services were paying off, after years of increasing homelessness.

At an event in July, L.A. Mayor Karen Bass took credit for the numbers going down.

“ For the first time in our city's recent history, homelessness has gone down two years in a row,” Bass said. “ This lasting change was only possible because we chose to act with urgency and reject the status quo.”

Now, local homelessness officials warn the L.A. region’s unhoused population may be growing again, as some state and local funding for homeless services and housing is disappearing.

The L.A. region’s lead homeless agency, known as LAHSA, is responsible for conducting the count. At an event Tuesday, LAHSA’s interim CEO Gita O’Neill said this year’s homeless count comes at a pivotal time.

“Across Los Angeles, the homeless services system is undergoing major changes, from funding shifts and program transitions to the way outreach, shelter, and housing are delivered,” O’Neill said. “Those changes, combined with ongoing economic pressures, may put the progress we’ve made over the last couple of years at risk.”

Thousands of Angelenos are set to lose federal housing vouchers this year as pandemic era emergency grant funding expires. A large number of homeless services and programs are facing cuts, because of shortfalls in state, county and city budgets.

Officials and service providers say this year’s count will be crucial for understanding the impacts of cuts.

“This year’s homeless count is more important than ever,” said Amber Sheikh, chair of the LAHSA Commission. “With looming funding cuts at all levels of government, this will give us critically needed data to allow us to advocate effectively.”

There's also a new concern this year: Councilmember Eunisses Hernandez's office said heightened activity by federal immigration enforcement officers might add challenges, if more people meant to be counted are laying low.

“Regardless of what the topline numbers show, the urgency remains the same,” a spokesperson for Hernandez told LAist. ""We need sustained investments in permanent housing, tenant protections, and mental health care to actually reduce homelessness over time.""

2. Regional homelessness agency faces scrutiny, reduced funding

In addition to conducting the count, LAHSA has been responsible for administering most homeless service programs across the region, but that’s in flux.

Recent audits and reports found LAHSA mismanaged funds and failed to collect accurate data on its vendors or properly hold them accountable for providing services.

Last April, L.A. County leaders redirected more than $300 million in funding away from LAHSA and formed a new county homelessness department to oversee the funding itself. The county’s Department of Homeless Services and Housing launched Jan. 1.

LAHSA will continue conducting the annual count with a reduced budget. The agency’s former CEO once warned those funding declines could jeopardize this year’s count.

“ Our team is working to reduce costs for next year's count given this situation,” Va Lecia Adams Kellum said last May. “But even with cost saving adjustments, we anticipate that the current allocations will not provide enough funding for LAHSA to conduct an unsheltered count in 2026.”

The proposed L.A. County homelessness budget for next fiscal year includes $2.3 million for the Homeless Count.

3. Count determines Measure A funding for cities

This year's count will help determine how much money each of Los Angeles County's 88 cities receives from Measure A, the voter-approved half-cent sales tax expected to generate about $1 billion annually for homeless services and affordable housing.

About $96 million from Measure A goes into a Local Solutions Fund divided among all cities. The funding formula is based 90% on each city's homeless count results from the past two years and 10% on the number of extremely low-income households.

That means the homeless count now affects city budgets in a way it never has before.

Based on its unhoused population estimates, the city of Los Angeles got roughly $55 million in the current budget year, 57% of the entire local fund. Smaller cities with fewer unhoused residents are getting far less. Rancho Palos Verdes is allocated about $38,000 and Manhattan Beach $41,000.

Some cities have argued the funding formula is unfair and should be more proportional to a municipality’s tax contributions.

The mayor of Torrance told LAist that the city expects to generate about $26 million annually through the Measure A sales tax and received about $559,000 in local funding. There were 355 unhoused people living in Torrance in February, according to last year’s official estimate.

4. Organizers made some technology updates

LAHSA has made several changes to this year's count following volunteer complaints about the mobile app, which has been plagued by glitches since its introduction in 2023.

“The app as it has been particularly glitchy over the years,” a spokesperson for L.A. City Councilmember Bob Blumenfield told LAist. “We tend to always do a paper count, as well as count through the app, just in case there are any discrepancies.”

For the 2026 count, LAHSA says it has simplified volunteer training, created improved maps in partnership with community stakeholders and assigned more staff to provide technical support at deployment sites.

The agency is also coordinating with county health services and emergency response teams to better count hard-to-reach areas like river embankments, deserts and parks. For example, the Sepulveda Basin in the San Fernando Valley is counted during a specialized daytime operation.

5. Concerns about the annual count’s accuracy

Even with improvements, some remain skeptical about the count's accuracy and usefulness.

L.A. City Councilmember John Lee told LAist the count “falls short of accurately portraying the situation on our city streets” and cautioned against “relying too heavily on a single annual snapshot that may not reflect day-to-day reality.”

“Rather than focusing on a single set of numbers once a year, we should be working year-round to gather consistent data that tracks outcomes like housing placements, retention, and system capacity,"" Lee said. “That kind of information would be far more valuable in evaluating what's actually working.”

A RAND Corporation analysis released in October found that the annual LAHSA tally has been increasingly inaccurate in recent years. RAND found LAHSA undercounted more than 30% of the population in Skid Row, Hollywood and Venice last year. The analysis was based on RAND’s own professional counts of those neighborhoods.

An LAist investigation last year found that LAHSA used inconsistent data processing methods, without clear documentation or written policies. This led to volunteer app observations being excluded from the data at a higher rate than the year before — and at a higher rate within L.A. city limits than in the rest of the county.

“There have been results in prior years that didn't make sense,” Blumenfield’s spokesperson said, referencing a recent example when count results showed way more RVs in a Reseda corridor than the office’s staff had observed during regular outreach.

Several representatives from smaller cities said they don’t rely solely on the count to understand the crisis on their sidewalks and streets. Santa Clarita officials called the count “one of the many tools used to guide local and regional responses to homelessness.”

Metro’s Board of Directors is set to vote Thursday on a $2.7 billion project that would extend light rail farther into the South Bay.

The Board will also consider a competing proposal that takes a different route for the extension than the one staff for the countywide transportation agency recommended and studied extensively.

Three members of Metro’s Board formally asked their colleagues to approve the alternate route Friday, less than a week before the meeting.

Some transit advocates have warned that approving the last-minute motion, which would make the project more expensive and more difficult to construct, could set the extension back years.

“All of a sudden, we have this alternative motion out of left field that did not come out of a committee process,” Scott Epstein, policy and research director of Abundant Housing L.A., said to LAist. “This is really concerning. I urge the Metro Board to return to common sense and stay the course on a high-quality project.”

The news of the motion inspired the opposite feeling in Chelsea Schreiber, who founded a group that’s in favor of the alternate route for which the motion advocates.

“I fell to my knees and cried when I read it,” Schreiber, a Lawndale resident, said to LAist.

The background

The goal of the extension as a whole is to improve connectivity between the South Bay and greater transit network. Metro staff said in a report to its Board that the extension would expand access to jobs, housing, and education.

Before any shovels hit the ground with regional transit projects, Metro studies several routes, collects public input and conducts technical analyses. Based on their work, agency staff then approach the board with their recommendation for the route they believe best serves the project’s goals.

In this case, staff recommended in 2024 a route that would operate on tracks already owned by the agency and includes stations at transit hubs in Redondo Beach and Torrance. In May the same year, Metro’s Board voted in favor of the recommendation and directed agency staff to focus on that route for further analysis.

The dueling route

Before last Friday, the Board was primed to approve those additional studies for the staff-recommended route and advance the project to its design and pre-construction phase.

L.A. County Supervisor Holly Mitchell, whose district represents some of the project area, and her Metro Board colleagues, Tim Sandoval and Jacquelyn Dupont-Walker, don’t want to see that happen.

Instead, according to the motion they introduced, Mitchell and her colleagues want the Board to further a different alignment for the extension that would have the train run along Hawthorne Boulevard, a major commercial corridor.

Their motion shares the concerns of the chief advocacy group in favor of the Hawthorne route, the South Bay Environmental Justice Alliance.

That group, which was founded by Schreiber, claims the staff-recommended route runs too close to homes and would eliminate green space. The group says pollution and noise associated with construction would negatively affect local residents.

The cities of Hermosa Beach, Lawndale, Hawthorne and Redondo Beach have also expressed support for the Hawthorne route whereas the city of Torrance has advocated for the Metro staff-recommended route.

In a statement, Mitchell told LAist she fully supports expanding transit access in the South Bay and thinks the Hawthorne option is the best way to do that “without having to make trade-offs on the safety and quality of life communities.”

Metro staff disagree. According to a report to the Metro board, agency staff determined the Hawthorne alignment wouldn’t provide the same access to local transit, would require additional environmental clearance and cost $737 million more than the route it recommended.

Metro staff also also put forward a suite of mitigation measures, including sound walls, sidewalks and bike paths, to assuage concerns over the route it recommended.

It’ll also consider selecting a route for the Sepulveda Transit Corridor for further study. That project would create a rail connection between the Valley and Westside.

At home, I'm in charge of making dinner. Most nights it's the usual rotation of staples that I know my small children will actually eat. I’ve got a routine in the kitchen, prepping vegetables in advance, batch cooking proteins, but some days, there’s just too much to do. You have to finish up a project for work, then you’ve gotta straighten up the house, then pick up the kids, and you didn’t get a chance to make dinner! That’s why I’m always grateful that there are restaurants out there that help feed our families in a pinch and on a budget.

On nights when I’m not cooking, you can call me “the King of the Family Meal Deal.” You can find me waltzing around the Costco food court looking for a large $9.95 pizza, or scouring the weekly supermarket circulars for El Pollo Loco coupons. I’m meticulously watching the instagram reels of local food influencers looking for leads. I’m always on the hunt for ways to expand the to-go options to feed four to six people for under $60.

I’ve searched far and wide and found a variety of tasty bargain takeout solutions from throughout Southern California. Here's a list of places that can affordably cater tonight’s dinner (with a few leftovers for tomorrow).

Stonefire Grill (12 locations in the Southland)

There are a dozen Stonefire Grill locations from Ventura to Rancho Cucamonga and on down to Irvine. They’ve got a distinctly Southern California menu of pizza, tri tip barbecue, and fresh salads. I think this might be a holdover from the early 2020s lockdown era, but a hungry family can still order the Stonefire Grill 'Stimulus Package.’ It’s no longer publicized on their main menu, but you can access it when you order online. This great deal includes a whole chicken or half tri tip, a 12-inch two-topping pizza or shareable pasta, plus a garden or caesar salad, and eight breadsticks for $45.29 (though the price slightly varies by location.) It’s easily enough for 4-6 people. Sometimes we’ll pay a few bucks more for their BBQ Chopped Chicken Salad and The Works Pizza with sausage, pepperoni, bell peppers, mushrooms, and red onions.

Locations: Torrance, Chatsworth, West Hills, Lakewood, Pasadena, Valencia, Thousand Oaks, Brea, Fountain Valley, Irvine

Panini Kabob (30 locations throughout Southern California)

Whenever we celebrate a birthday with my wife’s family we’ll order in from Panini Kabob. Their Persian-style skewers, fresh salads and side dishes always hit the spot. We’ll typically pick up the Family Kabob Combo. It comes with four chicken kabobs grilled alongside tomatoes, green peppers and onions. It also includes a tray of rice, and salad. You can feed four to six people for $69.99. I like splitting the rice between basmati and bulgur wheat pilaf. For the salad option we’ll usually get a half caesar salad / half romaine avocado. We’ll also add two a la carte koobidehs. Everybody is festively well-fed and the bill comes out to around $100.

India Sweets & Spices (five locations in Los Angeles)

If you’re looking for a filling vegetarian option at a nice price point head to India Sweets & Spices. It’s a small chain of South Asian grocers with an excellent cafeteria-style restaurant in the back. The menus differ at each location, but if you pick up a few lunch specials you can feed a family for days. At the Northridge store the Food Combo #2 is $9 and comes with your choice of white or yellow rice, samosa, naan, papadam, pickle, yogurt, and a dessert which is usually gulab jaman. It also comes with two of the many entrees on the steam table. I’ll usually get chana masala, aloo gobi, saag paneer and paneer tikka masala. If I get two orders for $18, that’s enough for my wife and kids (but my kids are only gonna eat the rice and naan. So I usually order a few more foils of naan.)

Tikiyaki (City of Orange)

Tikiyaki in the City of Orange is one of those places that people whisper about in online forums for having delicious food with absurdly enormous portions. They do offer party trays, but if you’re trying to pick up dinner for the family, just order a few of their combo plates. They generously stuff a mountain of rice, meat, vegetables, and an egg roll into the container. The #12 Chicken & Steak Plate will set you back $11.99, but it feeds two to three people. Other popular items include the short ribs, coconut shrimp, tropical orange chicken and the extra spicy version, ‘Volcano Chicken.’ If you need a good vegetarian option, they also serve tofu. Mix-and-match and easily get enough food for 6 people for under $40.

King Pollo (Anaheim)

At King Pollo, the beloved Orange County chicken shack, you can get great burgers, boba, burritos and teriyaki bowls but a family of 6-8 is gonna want to order the famed Family Pack. For $45.49 you’ll get two whole chickens, plus large orders of beans, rice and potato salad. It also comes with tortillas and two containers of salsa. If you need a third pollo rostisado plus extra large sides, you can get the Super Family Pack for $67.49. If you need less, there’s always the single chicken’d Mini Pack for $26.49.

This new EPA proposal presents a threat to communities’ groundwater by allowing toxic coal companies to operate past their planned retirement dates. With coal ash contaminating groundwater with harmful chemicals such as arsenic, chromium, lithium, and more, citizens deserve the utmost protection. Without accountability, more toxic waste will enter our water, making cleanup more costly and difficult when coal plant retirement inevitably arrives.

We urge you to submit a comment to the EPA voicing your concern over their proposal to delay compliance and closure of retiring coal plants. Below is a sample message that we encourage you to modify to make your own. Then go here to submit your comment on this issue via the EPA’s public comment portal.

As a concerned citizen, I oppose the US Environmental Protection Agency’s proposal to delay the closure of toxic, poisonous coal ash ponds.

Coal ash harms people and contaminates groundwater, as articulated and regulated under the 2015 Coal Ash Rule. The EPA’s recent proposal is simply extending a loophole for coal plants to continue polluting.

While the proposal would currently apply to 11 coal plants, the impacted facilities still heavily pollute surrounding communities with little oversight. For example, the Naughton Power Plant in Wyoming violated the Coal Ash Rule with 2022 exceedances of Lithium (x242), Selenium (x150), and Sulfate (x66). If the proposal is accepted as-is, this plant would get an additional three years to close the coal ash pond leaking 242 times the federally allowable level of Lithium into the groundwater.

People do not need excuses; they need protection. Coal-fired power generation has been in decline for years, along with its performance and reliability. The EPA has already given coal plants over a decade to transition away from coal-fired facilities or retrofit the coal ash impoundments. Delaying compliance deadlines will only cost Americans who will pay with their health and pocketbooks.

I oppose the EPA’s proposal to delay the compliance and closure of certain coal ash ponds. I urge the EPA to rescind the proposal so it can hold polluters accountable and protect citizens from harmful coal.",https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/public_citizen_shared_link.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 00:39:48.507902

In court last week, three of the five offshore projects that were blocked won injunctions to continue construction.
While a bill passed in the House, Senate debate broke down after the administration’s Dec. 22 stop-work orders for all five offshore wind projects under construction on the East Coast.
“President Trump has been extremely transparent: wind energy is the scam of the century,” said White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers.
Companies have argued for decades that onerous restrictions make it too difficult to build infrastructure such as big energy projects, power lines and highways.","On his first day in office, President Donald Trump launched a campaign against wind energy with an executive order to stop leasing and permits for offshore wind farms.

The administration went on to block wind farms already under construction, while Trump himself vowed in Cabinet meetings that he would not allow any to be built under his watch, as he criticized them for being ugly, inefficient and harmful to animals.

A year later, Trump appears to be losing his war on wind on several fronts. In court last week, three of the five offshore projects that were blocked won injunctions to continue construction. Two remaining cases are expected to be heard soon.

And in recent months an informal coalition of companies has emerged across the energy industry, including oil and clean energy firms, to push for an end to the targeting of wind energy, fearing they could fall prey to the same tactics in the future.

“We know what administrations can do to our projects when they have opposition to building pipelines or other energy infrastructure. This has never just been about wind,” said Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute lobby group.

The blocked wind projects have become inextricably linked to a push in Congress to overhaul the system for permitting infrastructure projects, a top legislative objective for oil firms. While a bill passed in the House, Senate debate broke down after the administration’s Dec. 22 stop-work orders for all five offshore wind projects under construction on the East Coast. Negotiations remain on hold.

“It’s time for both sides to put their weapons down and let’s work on getting comprehensive permitting reform done in this Congress,” Sommers said.

Still, analysts agree that Trump’s personal preferences are driving the anti-wind policy. More than a decade ago, he unsuccessfully sued to stop offshore wind turbines built near a Scottish golf course he owned and has apparently nursed a grudge ever since. The mounting court losses and industry pressure may not change his mind.

“Given the legal rulings so far, we can expect the projects that are under construction to finish and to ultimately start operating,” said Julia Hoos, an analyst at Aurora Energy Research. “That said, I think this is a war of attrition more than a war of a single ruling … the administration might very well succeed in doing long-term damage to the industry as a whole.”

Legal defeats

Trump officials last year began targeting individual wind projects, generally citing unspecified concerns that their permits were improperly granted, a move that companies were able to fend off.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) negotiated an agreement in May to lift a stop-work order on Empire Wind, slated to help power half a million homes in the New York City area, in exchange for reconsidering her stance against natural gas pipelines.

Revolution Wind, off the coast of Rhode Island, successfully sued to lift a stop-work order in September, winning a preliminary injunction that allowed construction to resume.

And in early December, a federal judge struck down the administration’s order to halt permitting for wind projects, ruling that it was “arbitrary and capricious.”

The administration quickly pivoted to targeting offshore leases instead of permits. On Dec. 22, the Interior Department announced stop-work orders for all five projects under construction, citing national security concerns in a classified report that has not been publicly released.

Last week, separate courts delivered a swift rebuke by granting preliminary injunctions to Revolution, Empire and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, with all companies announcing intentions to quickly restart construction. Sunrise Wind, off the coast of New York, and Vineyard Wind, near Massachusetts, are also awaiting a hearing.

It’s unclear what effect the court losses have had on the administration’s wind policy.

“President Trump has been extremely transparent: wind energy is the scam of the century,” said White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers. “The Administration looks forward to ultimate victory on the issue.”

Rogers did not comment on the court losses or pending litigation.

“The likelihood of the administration continuing to lose in court, hopefully, would factor into their recognition that supporting all forms of American energy is actually their job,” said Jason Grumet, chief executive officer of the American Clean Power Association.

A Senate stalemate

Immediately after the Dec. 22 stop-work orders, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-Rhode Island) halted negotiations over a permitting reform bill.

“The illegal attacks on fully permitted renewable energy projects must be reversed if there is to be any chance that permitting talks resume,” Whitehouse said in a joint statement with Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-New Mexico). “There is no path to permitting reform if this administration refuses to follow the law.”

Whitehouse’s office said earlier this month that permitting reform is “dead in the water,” and congressional aides confirmed that negotiations on the bill have not resumed since the stop-work orders were issued.

Permitting reform is a shorthand for overhauling how infrastructure projects are vetted and authorized under a constellation of laws including the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Clean Air and Water acts.

Companies have argued for decades that onerous restrictions make it too difficult to build infrastructure such as big energy projects, power lines and highways. They particularly want shorter time limits for filing lawsuits to challenge their permits.

Democrats want assurances written into the law that projects will be evaluated fairly, regardless of whether they involve oil, gas, wind or solar energy. They, along with industry, also want guarantees that once a permit is issued, it cannot later be revoked just because another political party wins the White House.

Energy firms across the board, including oil companies, are trying to stop the war on wind in exchange for a more stable and predictable business environment.

“If you’ve got a project that’s gotten all of its approvals and started construction, there ought to be some kind of safe harbor, so that we don’t have the next administration coming back and rethinking or stopping it,” said Marty Durbin, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Global Energy Institute.

“All sides here, the oil and gas industry, the renewables industry, and everyone else involved are saying, ‘Yeah, we all get it,’” he added.

“If there’s a flip in administration and the Democrat president follows the Trump approach of weaponizing the permitting process, the impacts on oil and gas would be profound,” Grumet said.

The oil industry has made the case to the administration that all companies will benefit from neutrality regardless of energy source and certainty that issued permits will be honored, even if that would rule out blocking the offshore wind projects, according to one industry representative who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private.

Lobbyists say that permitting reform hinges on Trump changing his position on blocking renewables projects, although there are no signs of that happening. Even if Republicans broke ranks to pass permitting reform that included constraints on targeting wind, Trump could still veto it or direct staff to reject renewables permits.

And a looming energy crunch

Industry groups and analysts say what’s at stake is the ability of the United States to meet surging electricity demand from artificial intelligence, data centers and the increasing electrification of society in general.

Headed into the midterm elections later this year, the White House is also feeling pressure to respond to voters’ concerns about rising prices and affordability, including ballooning electricity bills.

PJM, the electricity authority in 13 states and the District of Columbia, said last week in a court filing that delaying Dominion Energy’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project will hurt the 67 million customers in their region.

Those concerns are real, as PJM struggles to maintain electricity capacity at 20% above peak demand, said Hoos, the energy analyst, a margin that ensures there will be enough power to prevent blackouts even in a crisis. In its most recent auction with electricity producers, PJM has been able to reach only 15% above peak demand. CVOW could help close the gap.

Responding to the December stop-work orders, New England’s electricity authority similarly said that stopping Revolution Wind as well as Vineyard Wind would hurt grid reliability and increase costs for consumers.

Durbin and others in the energy sector say the only way to alleviate the expected shortfall in electricity through the end of the decade is to build more energy projects, regardless of the source. Bureaucratic delays and bottlenecks will just drive prices up, he said.",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2026/01/Wind-Power.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 07:40:04.145296

Consider just two of the states analyzed in The Western Way report – South Dakota and Arizona – which have some of the most reliable power grids in the country.
The lesson from states like South Dakota and Arizona is that energy decisions cannot be made based on broad-brush national arguments.","Sometimes the debate over U.S. energy policy feels more like a shouting match, instead of a factual discussion about how to meet the nation’s rapidly growing needs.

In one corner, there’s the push for 100% renewables. In the other corner, it’s almost all about oil and gas.

But outside the competing echo chambers on the left and the right, a quiet success story is unfolding in America’s rural – and yes, more politically conservative – communities.

It turns out that keeping the lights on isn’t about picking a side. It’s about picking all the energy sources that can deliver affordable and reliable electricity based on local conditions.

That was the major finding of a new report issued by The Western Way, a non-profit that seeks pro-market solutions to energy and environmental challenges, on power grid reliability in rural America.

The report reviewed 10 rural and conservative-leaning states – Arizona, Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming. It concluded the power grids in those states are 2 to 7 times more reliable than the national average, according to data on electrical outages from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

What is their secret? It isn’t a singular reliance on coal or natural gas, nor is it a blind rush toward renewables and battery storage. The data reveals that there is no “one-size-fits-all” solution. Instead, these states are harnessing a range of energy sources to keep their power grids reliable.

Consider just two of the states analyzed in The Western Way report – South Dakota and Arizona – which have some of the most reliable power grids in the country.

In South Dakota, the number one source of electricity is wind (58%), followed by hydropower (22%) and natural gas (11%), with coal and other sources making up the remainder. When working together, these sources make South Dakota’s grid the 2nd most reliable in the country.

But in Arizona, the top source of electricity is natural gas (45%), followed by nuclear (27%) and solar (13%), with coal and hydropower making up most of the balance. Arizona also has more than 2 gigawatts of battery storage capacity, which allows solar power generated during the day to be used after the sun goes down.

Despite looking nothing like South Dakota, the Arizona power grid is also highly reliable, ranked 3rd in the country – and the reliability difference between the two states is less than 0.001%.

Two very different models for keeping the lights on. Both highly effective.

But that’s not all. The Western Way report also finds that the Trump administration’s policy on energy is a lot more nuanced than the mainstream media would have you believe.

Back in July, the U.S. Department of Energy published a study outlining what it will take to keep America’s power grid stable by the end of the decade if the nation’s rising appetite for energy – led by data centers and the reshoring of manufacturing – continues.

The study called for the continued operation of coal and natural gas-fired power plants that have previously been slated for retirement. While most media coverage of the DOE study focused on that recommendation, there was much, much more to the story.

Keeping older plants running longer would close less than a third of the looming reliability gap. The rest of the gap would have to be closed with a range of different energy sources, including 187 gigawatts of solar, wind and battery storage, according to the DOE.

For scale, those projections would increase U.S. renewable electricity capacity by around 40% and the nation’s battery storage by more than 80%, according to September data from the EIA.

The lesson from states like South Dakota and Arizona is that energy decisions cannot be made based on broad-brush national arguments.

Yes, the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress opposed federal tax subsidies for wind and solar and started to phase them out. But tax policy is a completely separate conversation from the engineering reality of keeping a regional grid running during a blizzard or a heatwave.

As we face a future of higher demand, no energy source should be sidelined because of rhetoric that doesn't reflect conditions on the ground. A stable power grid requires a mix of energy sources working together as efficiently as possible – in other words, “all of the above.”

If we truly care about keeping the lights on, let’s stop fighting over the “right” kind of energy and embrace the idea of building a grid that uses it all.",https://assets.realclear.com/images/70/707482_6_.jpeg,N,,2026-01-22 00:41:14.096927

As our example, we’ll respond to the proposed rollback of clean car standards: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has proposed reversing the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for cars and trucks.
The 2022 CAFE rule has made cars more fuel-efficient, saving drivers money at the pump and reducing air pollution.
For example: “I’m here because I’m concerned that reversing the CAFE standards will increase costs for millions of families like mine.
For example: “I oppose the proposal to reverse the CAFE standards because it will make driving even more expensive while we are already struggling with higher costs.","Are you looking for more ways to take action on the environmental issues that you care about? In this series, we’re exploring overlooked ways to advocate for our environment and communities. We believe that the more people participate in the workings of our government, the better outcomes will be for people and the planet!

First up in our series: speaking truth to power – regulatory power, that is. You can give federal agencies your thoughts on their proposed rules and regulations – like those that impact our air, water, and climate. We first explored how to submit a public comment online. Today, we’re diving into how you can speak directly to policymakers by testifying in a public hearing.

You will have up to three minutes to give your remarks. A good rule of thumb for drafting testimony is that one minute = about 150 words. Plan your comments for no more than 450 words. Write your comments down and practice them so you are familiar with what you want to say and how long it will take.

Here’s how to structure your testimony. As our example, we’ll respond to the proposed rollback of clean car standards:

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has proposed reversing the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for cars and trucks. The 2022 CAFE rule has made cars more fuel-efficient, saving drivers money at the pump and reducing air pollution. Reversing it would allow automakers to make less fuel-efficient cars that are more expensive to drive. The comment period closes February 4, 2025.

Introduction: Introduce yourself and say why you are there.

For example: “Thank you for the opportunity to testify. My name is [your name here] and I am here today as a private citizen. [You can also include your job title; where you’re from; that you’re a parent, grandparent, aunt or uncle, etc; and any expertise or affiliations you have]. I urge DOT to not finalize this proposal to take away fuel economy standards that save consumers money.

Give your personal reason for testifying: Explain why the proposal is important to you and the impacts it will have. Use examples from your own life – this will make your testimony compelling and memorable! The agencies would rather hear about your specific concerns and story than just hear the same talking points repeated.

For example: “I’m here because I’m concerned that reversing the CAFE standards will increase costs for millions of families like mine. Our costs for groceries, electricity, and other expenses are already skyrocketing. We can’t afford to spend more on gas for less fuel-efficient cars. I have a long commute to work and have to fill my tank every week. I worry how I would afford it if I had to fill up more often.”

Conclusion: Reiterate your position and thank the panel.

For example: “I oppose the proposal to reverse the CAFE standards because it will make driving even more expensive while we are already struggling with higher costs. On top of that, it will increase air pollution that makes people sick and unsafe. Thanks for the opportunity to testify today.”

Keep an eye out for an email from the rulemaking agency. They will send a speaker list with specific timeslots a few days before the hearing.

Plan to log on 20-30 minutes in advance of your scheduled time to access the virtual room. It is possible that they will be running ahead of schedule. But, also be prepared for a wait. Depending on the number of speakers, there may be a delay. Often, the people running the hearing will announce the next 3-5 speakers in a block, so you’ll have an additional heads up before they call your name to speak.

Remember to keep your testimony to three minutes or less. The hearing administrators will be strict about this time limit.

When it’s your turn, take a deep breath and speak slowly! Remember, this is an influential moment in the rulemaking process. Officials want to hear about how this rule would impact you personally.

For more inspiration, check out the testimony LCV’s Darien Davis gave at the recent hearing on the CAFE rule:

Testimony of Darien Davis, Government Advocate for Climate and Clean Energy at the League of Conservation Voters,

before the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Department of Transportation (DOT),

at the Public Hearing for The Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule III for Model Years 2022 to 2031 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks

January 7, 2026

Hello and thanks for giving me the opportunity to testify today. My name is Darien Davis, and I’m a Government Affairs Advocate at the League of Conservation Voters, or LCV. I’m here today on behalf of LCV’s members across the country to oppose the inaccurately-named Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles rule.

The SAFE vehicle rule will actually do the exact opposite of its name; it will gut fuel economy standards that for decades have helped to reduce fuel costs for drivers and air pollution for everyone. These money-saving standards, known as the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or “CAFE”, Standards, help to ensure that new cars are more efficient and can go longer distances on a single tank of gas.

At a time when the costs of basic goods and services are already sky-high, and steadily increasing, the Trump administration should not be increasing costs even further by gutting miles per gallon standards. Electricity costs are up 13% over the past 12 months, and I’ve seen my electricity bill rise significantly, despite my usage staying mostly the same. Fortunately, I am a single person with enough support and job benefits that I can adjust my budget to absorb these higher utility bills. I would be hard-pressed to do this if I had the additional, rising expense of owning and operating a car.

People across the country are doing the same thing that I’m doing – they’re examining their budgets and looking for places to cut back just to make ends meet. Working families need access to affordable and reliable transportation options in order to make a living. Unfortunately, transportation is the second largest household expense, just behind housing.

Even so, the existing efficiency standards for cars and trucks have been providing relief to drivers for decades; a recent NRDC study found that fuel economy improvements over the past fifteen years have saved the average household hundreds of dollars per year. The Trump administration is misguided to eliminate this relief for families’ transportation costs.

Rolling back fuel-economy standards would also have steep costs for our health. The current standards for cars and trucks have the added benefit of reducing dangerous, health-harming air pollution. Eliminating these cost-saving standards means decreased air quality, and lower air quality means families, especially those suffering from asthma or heart disease, could see more frequent hospital visits.

In summary, I oppose the proposed SAFE Vehicles rule because it will make driving a car even more expensive while we are in the midst of an affordability crisis, and will increase the pollution that makes people sick and unsafe.

In this article, we explain the main sources of these market imbalances and offer strategies for companies to harness returns from natural gas trading—both today and as the sector shifts in the future.
We expect gas demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports to increase rapidly, as well.
Demand for roughly three BCFD—more than half of the additional gas demand for power—is expected to come from data centers.
They combine weather, production output, logistics, and regional demand patterns into real-time forecasts that enable traders to anticipate volatility.","The energy landscape in the United States and Canada is entering a defining decade. Electricity demand is outpacing supply, driven by data center consumption, industrial electrification, and population growth. Meanwhile, the use of renewables and nuclear energy is expanding too slowly to fill the gap. As a result, natural gas is becoming a more important part of meeting the region’s electricity needs. Gas already provides baseload generation in many places and will play an increasing role in managing demand peaks.

With this increase, regional imbalances in gas demand and pricing mean that stakeholders will need to prepare strategically to capture part of the trading opportunity—a projected $7 billion by 2040—within the natural-gas-industry value pool. In this article, we explain the main sources of these market imbalances and offer strategies for companies to harness returns from natural gas trading—both today and as the sector shifts in the future.

The gas industry in the United States and Canada

In the United States alone, power demand is expected to grow by up to 3.5 percent per year through 2040, and emerging power sources can offer only limited near-term relief. Proprietary McKinsey analysis suggests that such sources will provide approximately 30 percent of total power generation by 2030 (Exhibit 1). The next wave of nuclear capacity, including small modular reactors, is unlikely to arrive until the late 2030s. Renewables, predicted to continue to expand in the United States, may face slowed deployment as incentives expire and as the reemergence of nuclear power stokes competition for long-term power contracts.

Against this backdrop, our analysis shows about 4.1 billion cubic feet per day (BCFD) of additional gas demand expected for power generation across the United States and Canada by 2030 (Exhibit 2). We expect gas demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports to increase rapidly, as well.

Demand for roughly three BCFD—more than half of the additional gas demand for power—is expected to come from data centers. These centers will likely cluster in corridors near natural gas supplies, such as the PJM interconnection in the eastern United States and supplies in Texas and the US Southeast (Exhibit 3).

Gas is well positioned to meet the coming demand but will have some difficulties. Gas-turbine-manufacturing backlogs are delaying new generation capacity. Permitting hurdles, cost inflation, and community opposition are slowing pipeline and transmission development. Following the addition of pipelines in the region, the Permian Basin now risks overbuilding and declining returns from oversupply, while pipeline-constrained US regions such as Appalachia and the Gulf Coast lack the infrastructure to carry gas to regional demand centers. The result of these competing pressures is a market defined by volatility, regional divergence, and physical bottlenecks.

Opportunities for trading, arbitrage, and optionality

Understanding the crosswinds of volatility, regional divergence, and physical bottlenecks can enable well-established traders to acquire value through arbitrage and optionality in the following areas:

Wider nodal spreads: Distinct regional consumption patterns, from seasonal heating to consistent 24/7 loads from clustered data centers, are expanding price gaps between grid nodes.

Shifting spark spreads: The difference between the electricity price and corresponding gas price varies by location and time, largely because of load variation, power composition mix, and uneven infrastructure development.

Volatility from LNG exports: Expanding export capacity along the US Gulf Coast is producing fresh price differentials, including the influence of global gas prices and transport risk premiums. The large gas needs for LNG production create concentrated demand in a few locations in western Louisiana and eastern Texas. This concentration can generate additional dislocations and increase potential volatility.

Natural gas equivalents as proxy hedges: Equivalents, such as compressed gas and emerging e-methane, are gaining traction as proxy hedges for power market exposure, creating an additional lever for portfolio diversification.

Optionality through physical holdings: Fuel and land assets offer important optionality. Stored onshore gas holdings hedge against unexpected load or outages from extreme weather. Land near major interconnections or pipelines is gaining strategic importance, particularly where infrastructure access aligns with data center or industrial development.

These opportunities are dynamic. The underlying drivers will change over time, creating new spreads and hedges for trading and value creation.

Essential capabilities for stakeholders

Navigating these persistent yet shifting structural differentials will require organizations to react quickly across a range of financial and physical markets. Success at securing the potential benefits will likely depend on three capabilities—sufficient trading scale, infrastructure access, and analytics-driven optimization:

Trading scale: Leading organizations are building scale and breadth by expanding both their positions and their trading desks across commodities. Scale allows traders to improve their capture of market opportunities and management of risk across markets.

Infrastructure: Owning or controlling access to key infrastructure (including pipelines, backhaul capacity, and storage) allows traders to balance portfolios, manage event risk, and create their own optionality. These assets also enable participation in secondary capacity markets, which often remain liquid in downturns and can reduce exposure to long-term take-or-pay contracting. Investing to ease congestion and align asset locations with deliverability can unlock additional advantage. Integrating gas connectivity into power plant and data center planning can help ensure reliable fuel supply and price stability.

Data and analytics: Advanced data platforms ingest comprehensive data sets and leverage AI-powered analytical tools and dashboards to provide traders with fresh and reliable market insights. They combine weather, production output, logistics, and regional demand patterns into real-time forecasts that enable traders to anticipate volatility. These capabilities can improve trading outcomes through higher decision speed and accuracy. They also help organizations design long-term fuel and tolling agreements and optimize behind-the-meter supply contracts to stabilize returns.

The coming decade will be a defining one for US and Canadian gas. Rising energy demand, constrained power infrastructure, and the limited pace of scaling for renewables all create risk—but they also create a rich trading environment. Organizations that act decisively now will be in a position to capture an outsize share of this expanding energy value pool, not just today, but for years to come, as opportunities shift in this rapidly evolving sector.",https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/oil%20and%20gas/our%20insights/capturing%20the%207%20billion%20dollar%20value%20in%20canadian%20and%20us%20natural%20gas%20trading/trading%20the%20power%20gap-2232329170-thumb-1536x1536.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 19:59:24.361336

And at least one state that had resisted the program — Wyoming — is now supportive.
In unfreezing the program’s funding, Trump issued new guidance that relaxed rules on station locations that Wyoming said didn’t make sense for more rural states.
Now Wyoming is building charging stations on routes between its national parks and EV-loving California.
The move underlines the ongoing challenge of curbing carbon pollution amid climbing prices, spiking energy demand and a Trump administration opposed to renewable energy, writes Adam Aton.","Even before Donald Trump returned to the White House, a Biden-era program to build a national network of electric vehicle chargers was struggling to take off.

Four years and a funding freeze later, states have spent only 2 percent of the $4.4 billion available to them under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, writes David Ferris. Estimates vary, but that amounts to between 120 to 150 charging stations nationwide — out of the roughly 1,600 needed to achieve the program’s aim of a station every 50 miles on major highways.

The program initially suffered from run-of-the-mill bureaucracy during the Biden era — state transportation departments had to figure out how to build chargers — and then ran into the Trump administration’s funding freeze. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy paused the money for seven months, prompting station builders to back out and throwing states’ plans into disarray.

Arkansas, for example, saw 19 awarded contracts dwindle to just seven.

“All that time was lost and we are now playing catch-up,” Jared Wiley, director of the Arkansas Department of Transportation, told David.

But with the Trump administration back on board — Duffy lifted the freeze in August, following an adverse court ruling that the administration chose not to appeal — state officials and experts say the program is turning a corner.

States have firm plans for $1.4 billion of the funds, with construction set to ramp up later this year and into 2027 and 2028.

And at least one state that had resisted the program — Wyoming — is now supportive. In unfreezing the program’s funding, Trump issued new guidance that relaxed rules on station locations that Wyoming said didn’t make sense for more rural states.

Now Wyoming is building charging stations on routes between its national parks and EV-loving California.

“Assuming no new political hurdles arise, it wouldn’t be a stretch to see the current open site count double by the end of the year,” wrote Steve Birkett, an independent EV-charging-station analyst, in a post on LinkedIn.

Still, the obstacles — and political hurdles — are significant.

Five states — Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Nevada and Wyoming — have spent no money. And Congress just announced a bipartisan bill that would reallocate $500 million of the program’s funds, diverting it to other federal highway programs.

On top of that, Republicans have already axed federal incentives for EVs and other clean energy programs. Already, Americans are buying fewer EVs, with sales hitting a three-year low in November.

Trump insults Europe, makes his Greenland pitch

Trump assailed Europe’s pursuit of green energy, bragged about axing wind projects and made a forceful case for U.S. ownership of Greenland during a speech to world leaders Wednesday, writes Robin Bravender.

Trump’s main message: Other countries should follow his playbook of boosting fossil fuels and firing government bureaucrats.

His comments come as Trump takes a victory lap celebrating his first year in office, which has been marked by dramatic swings on energy production and foreign policy. They also come at a turbulent moment when Trump’s quest for control of Greenland has escalated tensions with European allies.

EPA’s proposal seeks to limit the scope of state-issued water quality certifications (WQCs) under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) to water quality impacts associated with discharges authorized by federal agency actions. The Proposed Rule also addresses concerns raised by applicants for federal licenses and permits (including for hydroelectric projects, natural gas pipelines, and other energy and infrastructure projects) that certain states have overstepped their Section 401 authority to impose onerous terms and conditions unrelated to water quality and artificially extended the statutory time limits for issuing WQCs.

CWA Section 401 requires any applicant for a federal license or permit that may result in any discharge to waters of the United States (WOTUS) to obtain a state certification that “any such discharge will comply with the applicable provisions” of sections 301, 302, 303, 306, and 307 of the CWA — all of which relate to effluent limitations. States may impose conditions on such certifications, including to comply with “any other appropriate requirement of State law” as provided in CWA Section 401(d). Over time, however, many states have used this conditioning authority to address issues unrelated to water quality.

Scope of Certification – EPA notes the current 2023 Rule “provides States with sweeping authority to decide the fate of nationally important infrastructure projects, such as natural gas pipelines and hydropower dams, based on potentially speculative water quality impacts not linked to a point source discharge into waters of the United States.” To correct this, and consistent with the 2020 Rule, the Proposed Rule would scrap the 2023 Rule’s provision that the WQC can relate to the “activity as a whole” and instead limit state certifications to addressing discharges “from a point source into waters of the United States.” This, in turn, would prevent states from using Section 401 to address nonpoint source impacts, impacts to purely state waters that are not considered WOTUS, and non-water quality policy concerns such as land use, endangered species, and climate change. The preamble to the Proposed Rule describes in detail how limiting WQCs in this way is consistent with the legislative history and plain language of the CWA, relying heavily on the Supreme Court’s landmark 2024 decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo curtailing judicial deference to agencies’ statutory interpretations.

Request for Certification – The Proposed Rule would create a uniform, national standard for what a permit applicant must submit in a “request for certification” to establish, with certainty, the start of the one-year statutory period for states to act on a WQC request. Conversely, the Proposed Rule would bar states from imposing their own “completeness” criteria that control when the clock starts — although they may still request additional information from applicants.

Timing of Review – The Proposed Rule reiterates that the failure of a state to act on a WQC request within one year results in a waiver, while imposing several restrictions on states’ ability to extend the one-year certification deadline. Extensions would require the approval of the federal agency and only be allowed for specified reasons, and state certifying authorities would be barred from orchestrating withdrawal and resubmittal of requests to extend the one-year “reasonable period of time” cap — a maneuver that has long been criticized by applicants as gamesmanship that further facilitates the injection of non-water quality policy priorities into the certification process. Notably, the Proposed Rule does not foreclose another form of gamesmanship: denial of WQC applications without prejudice.

Contents of Certifications – Among other changes, the Proposed Rule would require states to explain how each condition of a certification relates to a CWA effluent limitation and would mandate any WQC denial to cite the specific water quality requirement at issue, which may deter certain states’ efforts to prolong the WQC process by denying applications without prejudice. Notably, EPA explains that WQC conditions should be limited to “water quality requirements” defined as applicable provisions of sections 301, 302, 303, 306 and 307 of the CWA, and any applicable and appropriate state water quality-related regulatory requirements for discharges. In explaining what water quality-related requirements are “applicable and appropriate,” EPA expressly provides that it is not limiting state regulatory provisions to only EPA-approved provisions — although it requests comment on this point. The Proposed Rule continues to allow states to incorporate narrative water quality standards and other regulatory requirements that apply to point source discharges, declining to limit conditions to just “numeric water quality criteria.”

Modifications – The Proposed Rule would allow states to modify a previously granted WQC only when the federal permitting agency and the applicant agree to the modification, including the content of that modification.

Neighboring Jurisdictions – The Proposed Rule would streamline the process by which other states may object to a discharge that “may affect” their water quality under CWA Section 401(a)(2), including establishing a 60-day deadline for the other state to file an objection and a 90-day deadline for the permitting agency to act on a valid state objection.

In aggregate, the proposed amendments would create a WQC process that is more predictable, provides long-term certainty for WQC holders, and significantly constrains states’ ability to bootstrap other policy concerns onto their Section 401 authority. However, EPA notes in the preamble that if a state imposes conditions in a WQC that exceed the scope outlined in the 401 Rule, the remedy would be found in court. This means litigation of both the Proposed Rule and individual WQCs is likely to continue.

EPA did not include several regulatory changes suggested by industry during past comment periods in the Proposed Rule, indicating that there are still opportunities for further improvement before EPA adopts a final rule. For example, the Proposed Rule is silent on the issue of who (states and/or action agencies) has the authority to enforce WQC conditions incorporated into the federal license or permit, as well as the extent to which EPA or the federal permitting agencies can serve as a “gatekeeper” for WQC conditions that exceed the scope of CWA Section 401.

PJM, which operates the 13-state grid serving one-fifth of Americans, proposed Tuesday to accelerate federal approval of so-called co-located power plants. The plan seeks to ensure adequate supply as massive data-center campuses gobble up unprecedented amounts of electricity, straining the system.

Not only has that surging demand driven up power prices, but the speed at which data centers are trying to connect to the grid has created reliability concerns. Mounting worries about affordability and energy security prompted the White House and 13 governors last week to propose an emergency power auction that would compel tech giants to bid for electricity supplies.

Subject: Support Reauthorization of Vital Water Infrastructure Programs

Dear Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, Chairman Guthrie and Ranking Member Pallone,

The National Conference of State Legislatures, the bipartisan organization representing the legislatures of our nation's states, territories, writes to express our support for the reauthorization of the Drinking Water and Clean Water State Revolving Funds (SRFs).

Our nation’s water infrastructure is essential to the strength of American communities. For decades, Congress has worked with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the states to provide billions of dollars in loans, principal forgiveness and technical assistance for clean water and drinking water projects. This investment, along with billions of dollars in supplemental funding provided through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, has gone a long way to ensuring water systems can continue to serve their communities.

However, recent EPA surveys and assessments show that further investment will be needed over the next 20 years to fund necessary drinking water infrastructure projects across the country, as well as wastewater, stormwater, wastewater treatment and nonpoint source control projects. These needs, compounded by a 31 percent decrease in federal capital investment in water infrastructure over the last few decades—as reported by the Value of Water Campaign and the American Society of Civil Engineers—has put a strain on states and local governments, who now must choose between keeping water rates affordable and deferring critical maintenance.

When communities can leverage low-interest loans from the SRFs, they save on average an estimated $960 million in interest rates over the life of the loan and can cut the cost of financing by more than 50%, according to the testimony of Jeff Walker on behalf of the Council of Infrastructure Financing Authorities to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on March 11, 2025.

These long-standing programs are an important part of protecting human health and keeping our economy moving. Preventing water infrastructure failure could save billions in cumulative healthcare costs over the next 20 years. Additionally, completing critical infrastructure repairs and replacements on schedule, rather than deferring maintenance, saves money in the long run. By having access to state revolving loan funds and direct federal grants, communities can provide safe, reliable infrastructure at an affordable rate.

The Drinking Water and Clean Water SRFs are essential for maintaining reliable access to affordable financing and providing clean and safe water for residents and businesses. We urge you to reauthorize the SRFs at no less than current funding levels. If you have any questions regarding the priorities outlined above, please do not hesitate to contact Ben Nasta at 202.624.3596 or ben.nasta@ncsl.org.

Sincerely,

Tim Storey

However, it can take time for big changes like a new data center to be reflected on your bill, says Stein: “Rate increases filter down to consumers over the course of years, so the rate increases we're seeing today are the result of investment decisions or policy actions taken two, three, or five years ago.”

Stein warns that electricity rate hikes, painful as they are, are often needed to keep the electricity grid reliable—even more so now with increased demand.

(the “Company”) (NASDAQ:GSBC), the holding company for Great Southern Bank (the “Bank”), today reported that preliminary earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2025, were $1.45 per diluted common share ($16.3 million net income) compared to $1.27 per diluted common share ($14.9 million net income) for the three months ended December 31, 2024. Full-year preliminary earnings for 2025 were $71.0 million, or $6.19 per diluted common share, compared to $61.8 million, or $5.26 per diluted common share, for 2024.

For the quarter ended December 31, 2025, annualized return on average common equity was 10.16%, annualized return on average assets was 1.16%, and annualized net interest margin was 3.70%, compared to 9.76%, 1.00% and 3.49%, respectively, for the quarter ended December 31, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2025, return on average common equity was 11.38%, return on average assets was 1.22%, and net interest margin was 3.67%, compared to 10.55%, 1.05% and 3.42%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Key Results :

Significant Expense Items : During the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company recorded expenses related to adjustments to asset values for branch closures and certain leased facilities. Expenses totaling $259,000 and $287,000 were recorded in Other Income and Net Occupancy and Equipment Expense, respectively.

Net Interest Income : Net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2025 decreased $371,000 (or approximately 0.7%) to $49.2 million compared to $49.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, largely driven by the completion of accounting recognition in October 2025 of interest income from a previously-terminated interest rate swap, partially offset by lower interest expense on deposit accounts and other borrowings. Annualized net interest margin was 3.70% for the quarter ended December 31, 2025, compared to 3.49% for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, and 3.72% for the quarter ended September 30, 2025.

Asset Quality : Non-performing assets and potential problem loans totaled $9.5 million at December 31, 2025, a decrease of $7.1 million from $16.6 million at December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2025, non-performing assets were $8.1 million (0.15% of total assets), a decrease of $1.5 million from $9.6 million (0.16% of total assets) at December 31, 2024. See “Asset Quality” below.

Liquidity : The Company had secured borrowing line availability at the FHLBank and Federal Reserve Bank of $1.32 billion and $305.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2025.

Capital : The Company’s capital position remained strong as of December 31, 2025, significantly exceeding the “well-capitalized” thresholds established by regulatory agencies. See “Capital” below.

Loans : Total net loans, excluding mortgage loans held for sale, decreased $333.5 million, or 7.1%, from $4.69 billion at December 31, 2024 to $4.36 billion at December 31, 2025. This decrease was primarily driven by decreases in other residential (multi-family) loans, construction loans, one- to four-family residential loans, and commercial business loans. Compared to September 30, 2025, net loans decreased $110.8 million. The Bank experienced significant loan repayments in the 2025 fourth quarter and year.

Selected Financial Data:

Three Months Ended December 31, December 31, September 30, 2025 2024 2025 (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net interest income $ 49,163 $ 49,534 $ 50,773 Provision (credit) for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments 882 1,556 (379 ) Non-interest income 7,188 6,934 7,062 Non-interest expense 36,000 36,947 36,116 Provision for income taxes 3,194 3,043 4,346 Net income $ 16,275 $ 14,922 $ 17,752 Earnings per diluted common share $ 1.45 $ 1.27 $ 1.56

Joseph W. Turner, President and CEO of Great Southern, commented, “Our fourth quarter and full year 2025 results reflect the sustained success of our core banking operations and our commitment to long-term tangible book value appreciation, despite a volatile economic environment. Throughout the year, we remained focused on preserving net interest margin, protecting credit quality, controlling non-interest expense, and opportunistically repurchasing our stock. That discipline translated into solid profitability in the fourth quarter, with net income of $16.3 million, or $1.45 per diluted common share, compared to $14.9 million, or $1.27 per diluted common share, in the prior year period. For the full year, net income was $71.0 million, or $6.19 per diluted common share, compared to $61.8 million, or $5.26 per diluted common share, in the prior year.”

Turner noted, “Core performance remained solid during the quarter, supported by resilient net interest income, a steady net interest margin, continued moderation in funding costs, and disciplined asset-liability management. Net interest income totaled $49.2 million for the 2025 fourth quarter, down modestly from the prior-year quarter, due mainly to the end of quarterly recognition of interest income from a previously-terminated interest rate swap, as we had disclosed in prior filings. The quarterly recognition had been $2.0 million in prior quarters and was only $134,000 in the fourth quarter of 2025, since it ended in early October 2025. Despite lower interest income, effective management of funding costs reduced interest expense and mostly offset the decrease in interest income. The effective management of loan repricing and funding costs resulted in net interest margin expansion, reaching 3.70% in the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to 3.49% in the same quarter in 2024. Core deposits remained stable during the quarter, underscoring the strength of our customer relationships and the enduring value of our community banking franchise. Compared to the third quarter of 2025, net interest income decreased $1.6 million, due mainly to the ending of income recognition from the previously-terminated interest rate swap.”

Turner added, “Loan production remained active during the quarter, though total net loans declined modestly due to heightened paydown and refinancing activity. These repayments were primarily within the multi-family, construction, one- to four-family residential, and commercial business loan portfolios. While we continue to be selective with loan originations, our pipeline of unfunded commitments remained solid, particularly within construction and commercial real estate lending. Additionally, our credit discipline, emphasis on relationship-based lending, and conservative underwriting standards remain evident in our excellent asset quality metrics.”

Turner further commented, “Non-performing assets were 0.15% of total assets at year-end 2025, and net charge-offs were negligible for both the fourth quarter and the full year. We did not record a provision for credit losses on loans during 2025.”

Turner continued, “Operating discipline remained a priority in the fourth quarter. Non-interest expense totaled approximately $36.0 million, in line with the prior-year quarter and the third quarter of 2025. As part of our focus on controlling operating costs, we continue to strategically invest in technology, infrastructure, and personnel, enabling efficiencies and ultimately expanding capabilities for our customers. The fourth quarter of 2025 also included certain facility-related costs incurred during the period which were not normal operating costs. In 2026, we expect to continue investing in technology. Non-interest income for the quarter totaled $7.2 million, supported by recurring fee-based revenue streams and increased loan-related fee income.”

“As we begin 2026, we remain focused on maintaining strong capital and liquidity positions, deploying capital thoughtfully, maintaining strong credit metrics, and supporting our customers and communities. At December 31, 2025, our tangible common equity ratio was 11.2%, and book value per common share was approximately $57.50, reflecting the benefit of consistent earnings and disciplined capital management, including share repurchases during the quarter and throughout 2025. While economic conditions and market interest rate levels may fluctuate throughout 2026, we believe our conservative approach, sound balance sheet, and dedicated associates position Great Southern to continue delivering long-term value for our stockholders,” Turner concluded.

NET INTEREST INCOME

Three Months Ended December 31,

December 31,

September 30, 2025 2024 2025

(Dollars in thousands) Interest Income $ 73,435 $ 82,585 $ 79,079 Interest Expense 24,272 33,051 28,306 Net Interest Income $ 49,163 $ 49,534 $ 50,773 Net interest margin 3.70 % 3.49 % 3.72 % Average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities 129.5 % 127.0 % 128.1 %

Net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2025 decreased $371,000 (0.7%) to $49.2 million, compared to $49.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2024. This decrease was driven primarily by the $1.9 million net reduction in quarterly interest income associated with a previously-terminated interest rate swap (income ended on October 6, 2025). Additionally, interest income declined due to lower loan balances and lower market rates, which primarily impacted the interest rates on variable-rate loans and new originations of fixed-rate loans. Mostly offsetting the decrease in interest income was reduced interest expense, due to the strategic management of maturing/repricing brokered deposits and interest-bearing demand deposits. Also, there was no interest expense on subordinated notes in the quarter ended December 31, 2025, as those notes were redeemed in June 2025. Correspondingly, annualized net interest margin was 3.70% in the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to 3.49% in the same period of 2024 and 3.72% in the third quarter of 2025. The average interest rate spread was 3.16% for the three months ended December 31, 2025, compared to 2.87% for the three months ended December 31, 2024 and 3.13% for the three months ended September 30, 2025. Net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2025 decreased $1.6 million (3.2%) compared to $50.8 million for the third quarter of 2025, primarily due to the impact of the end of income recognition on the previously-terminated interest rate swap.

The average yield on total interest-earning assets decreased from 5.83% in the 2024 fourth quarter to 5.53% in the 2025 fourth quarter, with the average yield on loans decreasing 34 basis points, the average yield on investment securities increasing 12 basis points and the average yield on other interest earning assets (primarily funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank) decreasing 91 basis points. The average rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities decreased from 2.96% in the 2024 fourth quarter to 2.37% in the 2025 fourth quarter, with the average rate paid on interest-bearing demand and savings deposits, time deposits and brokered deposits decreasing 26 basis points, 50 basis points and 76 basis points, respectively. The average rate paid on short-term borrowings decreased 70 basis points.

Market interest rates, primarily the federal funds rate and SOFR rates, declined in the fourth quarter of 2024, and remained lower through the fourth quarter of 2025, with additional federal funds rate cuts in September, October, and December of 2025, totaling 75 basis points. This market rate decline reduced the average yield on loans, though the impact was tempered as cash flows from lower-rate fixed rate loans originated a few years ago were deployed into residential and commercial real estate loans with comparably higher rates of interest. The decline in market interest rates also resulted in lower average rates paid on deposits and borrowings, compared to the prior-year fourth quarter.

To mitigate exposure to the risk of fluctuations in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates (primarily related to falling interest rates), the Company has strategically utilized derivative financial instruments - primarily interest rate swaps - as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.

The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the effect of cash flow hedge accounting included in interest income in the consolidated statements of income:

Three Months Ended December 31,

December 31,

September 30, 2025 2024 2025

(In thousands) Terminated interest rate swaps $ 134 $ 2,047 $ 2,047 Active interest rate swaps (1,364 ) (2,172 ) (1,761 ) Increase (decrease) to interest income $ (1,230 ) $ (125 ) $ 286

The Company entered into an interest rate swap in October 2018, which was terminated in March 2020. Upon termination, the Company received $45.9 million, inclusive of accrued but unpaid interest, from its swap counterparty. The net amount, after deducting accrued interest and deferred income taxes, was accreted to interest income on loans monthly until the originally scheduled termination date of October 6, 2025. With this date having passed, the Company no longer has the benefit of that income from the terminated swap. At December 31, 2025, the Company had two active interest rate swaps with a combined notional amount of $400 million. These swaps resulted in a reduction of interest income of $1.4 million and $2.2 million in the three months ended December 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Market rates for time deposits for much of 2024 were elevated, but have declined as the FOMC cut the federal funds rate by 100 basis points in late 2024, 25 basis points in the third quarter of 2025 and 50 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2025. As of December 31, 2025, time deposit maturities over the next 12 months were as follows: within three months — $591.3 million, with a weighted-average rate of 3.53%; within three to six months — $262.9 million, with a weighted-average rate of 3.13%; and within six to twelve months — $38.7 million, with a weighted-average rate of 1.87%. Based on time deposit market rates in December 2025, replacement rates for these maturing time deposits are likely to be approximately 2.70-3.10%, depending on term.

NON-INTEREST INCOME

For the quarter ended December 31, 2025, non-interest income increased $254,000, to $7.2 million, when compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2024, primarily as a result of the following item:

Late charges and fees on loans : Late charges and fees on loans increased $289,000, or 218.9%, from the prior-year quarter. This increase was primarily due to prepayment fees on one large commercial real estate loan, which paid off in the 2025 fourth quarter.

Additionally, Other Income, which decreased by $67,000, includes $259,000 in contra-income associated with leased facility asset disposals, mentioned in the ‘Significant Expense Item’ section above.

NON-INTEREST EXPENSE

For the quarter ended December 31, 2025, non-interest expense decreased $947,000, to $36.0 million, when compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2024, primarily as a result of the following items:

Other operating expenses : Other operating expenses decreased $2.0 million, or 49.0%, from the prior-year quarter. In the 2024 period, the Company expensed $2.0 million due to developments related to a litigation/contract dispute matter.

Net occupancy and equipment expenses : Net occupancy and equipment expenses increased $1.2 million, or 13.9%, from the prior-year quarter. Various components of computer license and support expenses, related to upgrades of core systems capabilities and disaster recovery site, collectively increased by $593,000 in the fourth quarter of 2025 compared to the fourth quarter of 2024. During the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company recorded expenses totaling $287,000 related to adjustments to asset values for branch closures and certain leased facilities. Also, during the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company recorded a total of $219,000 of seasonal expenses for snow removal and adjustments to real estate taxes.

The Company’s efficiency ratio for the quarter ended December 31, 2025, was 63.89% compared to 65.43% for the same quarter in 2024. The Company’s ratio of non-interest expense to average assets was 2.56% for the three months ended December 31, 2025, compared to 2.46% for the three months ended December 31, 2024. Average assets for the three months ended December 31, 2025, decreased $381.1 million, or 6.4%, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to the decline in the average balance of net loans.

INCOME TAXES

For the three months ended December 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company's effective tax rate was 16.4% and 16.9%, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company's effective tax rate was 18.7% and 18.1%, respectively. These effective rates were below the statutory federal tax rate of 21.0%, due primarily to the utilization of certain investment tax credits and the Company’s tax-exempt investments and tax-exempt loans, which reduced the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company’s effective tax rate may fluctuate in future periods as it is impacted by the level and timing of the Company’s utilization of tax credits, the level of tax-exempt investments and loans, the amount of taxable income in various state jurisdictions and the overall level of pre-tax income. State tax expense estimates continually evolve as taxable income and apportionment between states are analyzed. The Company currently expects its effective tax rate (combined federal and state) will be approximately 18.5% to 19.5% in future periods.

CAPITAL

December 31, December 31, September 30, 2025 2024 2025 Consolidated Regulatory Capital Ratios (Preliminary) Tier 1 Leverage Ratio 12.2 % 11.2 % 11.9 % Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio 13.6 % 12.3 % 13.3 % Tier 1 Capital Ratio 14.1 % 12.8 % 13.8 % Total Capital Ratio 15.3 % 15.4 % 15.1 % Tangible Common Equity Ratio 11.2 % 9.9 % 10.9 %

As of December 31, 2025, total stockholders’ equity was $636.1 million, representing 11.4% of total assets and a book value of $57.50 per common share. This compares to total stockholders’ equity of $599.6 million, or 10.0% of total assets, and a book value of $51.14 per common share at December 31, 2024. The $36.6 million increase in stockholders’ equity from December 31, 2024, was primarily driven by $71.0 million in net income, a decrease in unrealized losses on investments and interest rate swaps, and a $6.7 million increase from stock option exercises, partially offset by $18.8 million in cash dividends declared on the Company’s common stock and $44.5 million in common stock repurchases. The decreased unrealized losses on the Company’s available-for-sale investment securities and interest rate swaps, which totaled $32.2 million and $54.4 million (net of taxes) at December 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, increased stockholders’ equity by $22.2 million during 2025. These net unrealized losses primarily resulted from increased intermediate-term market interest rates in prior periods, which generally decreased the fair value of the investment securities and interest rate swaps. In 2025, these market interest rates decreased, resulting in increases in the fair value of the Company’s investment securities and interest rate swaps.

The Company had unrealized losses on its portfolio of held-to-maturity investment securities, which totaled $16.6 million and $24.7 million at December 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, that were not included in its total capital balance. If held-to-maturity unrealized losses were included in capital (net of taxes) at December 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, they would have decreased total stockholder’s equity at those dates by $12.5 million and $18.6 million, respectively. These amounts were equal to 2.0% of total stockholders’ equity of $636.1 million at December 31, 2025, compared to 3.1% of total stockholders’ equity of $599.6 million at December 31, 2024.

In April 2025, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the purchase, from time to time, of up to one million additional shares of the Company’s common stock. As of December 31, 2025, approximately 687,000 shares remained available under this stock repurchase authorization.

During the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company repurchased 241,301 shares of its common stock at an average price of $59.33, and the Company’s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.43 per common share, which, combined, reduced stockholders’ equity by $19.2 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2025, the Company repurchased 755,759 shares of its common stock at an average price of $58.35, and the Company’s Board of Directors declared regular quarterly cash dividends totaling $1.66 per common share, which, combined, reduced stockholders’ equity by $63.3 million.

LIQUIDITY AND DEPOSITS

Liquidity is a measure of the Company’s ability to generate sufficient cash to meet present and future financial obligations in a timely manner. The Company’s primary sources of funds are customer deposits, FHLBank advances, other borrowings, loan repayments, unpledged securities, proceeds from sales of loans and available-for-sale securities and funds provided from operations. The Company utilizes some or all of these sources of funds depending on the comparative costs and availability at the time. The Company has from time to time chosen not to pay rates on deposits as high as the rates paid by certain of its competitors and, at management’s discretion, supplements deposits with alternative sources of funds. Management believes that the Company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors’ requirements and meet its borrowers’ credit needs.

At December 31, 2025, the Company had the following available secured lines and on-balance sheet liquidity:

December 31, 2025 Federal Home Loan Bank line $1,320.6 million Federal Reserve Bank line 305.2 million Cash and cash equivalents 189.6 million Unpledged securities – Available-for-sale 338.5 million Unpledged securities – Held-to-maturity 24.4 million

During the year ended December 31, 2025, the Company’s total deposits decreased $122.8 million. Interest-bearing checking balances increased $74.7 million (3.4%), primarily in certain money market accounts, and non-interest-bearing checking balances decreased $1.4 million (0.2%). Time deposits generated through the Company’s banking center and corporate services networks decreased $87.3 million (11.3%). Brokered deposits, obtained through a variety of sources, decreased $108.7 million (14.1%). During the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company’s total deposits decreased $45.3 million, $16.6 million of which was in brokered deposits and $35.2 million of which was in retail time deposits. As total assets (primarily loans receivable) decreased, the Company elected not to replace some of its maturing brokered deposits.

At December 31, 2025, the Company had the following deposit balances:

December 31, 2025 Interest-bearing checking $2,289.4 million Non-interest-bearing checking 841.5 million Time deposits 688.4 million Brokered deposits 663.4 million

At December 31, 2025, the Company estimated that its uninsured deposits, excluding deposit accounts of the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries, were approximately $720.1 million (16.1% of total deposits).

LOANS

Total net loans, excluding mortgage loans held for sale, decreased $333.5 million, or 7.1%, from $4.69 billion at December 31, 2024 to $4.36 billion at December 31, 2025. This decrease was primarily driven by decreases in other residential (multi-family) loans of $161.8 million, construction loans of $96.5 million, one- to four-family residential loans of $51.3 million and commercial business loans of $41.8 million. Compared to September 30, 2025, net loans decreased $110.8 million.

The pipeline of the unfunded portion of loans and formal loan commitments remained strong, with the largest portion of these unfunded balances represented by the unfunded portion of outstanding construction loans ($605.5 million at December 31, 2025). See the table below.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

During the three months ended December 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company did not record a provision expense on its portfolio of outstanding loans. During the year ended December 31, 2025, the Company did not record a provision expense on its portfolio of outstanding loans, compared to a provision expense of $1.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2024. Total net recoveries were $22,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2025, compared to total net charge-offs of $155,000 during the same period in the prior year. Total net recoveries were $11,000 for the year ended December 31, 2025, compared to total net charge-offs of $1.6 million during the prior year. Additionally, for the quarter ended December 31, 2025, the Company recorded a provision for losses on unfunded commitments of $882,000, compared to a provision for losses on unfunded commitments of $1.6 million for the same period in 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2025, the Company recorded a provision for losses on unfunded commitments of $45,000, compared to a provision for losses on unfunded commitments of $1.0 million in 2024.

The Bank’s allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.46%, 1.36% and 1.43% at December 31, 2025, December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025, respectively. Management considers the allowance for credit losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the Bank’s loan portfolio at December 31, 2025, based on recent reviews of the portfolio and current economic conditions. However, if challenging economic conditions persist or worsen, or if management’s assessment of the loan portfolio changes, additional provisions for credit losses may be required, which could adversely impact the Company’s future financial performance.

ASSET QUALITY

At December 31, 2025, non-performing assets were $8.1 million, a decrease of $1.5 million from $9.6 million at December 31, 2024 and an increase of $319,000 from $7.8 million at September 30, 2025. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets were 0.15% at December 31, 2025, compared to 0.16% at December 31, 2024 and 0.14% at September 30, 2025.

BUSINESS INITIATIVES

The Company maintains its focus on technology initiatives and advancements with its current core provider. Several projects to improve customer-facing online services and delivery continue to move forward.

At the end of January 2026, the Company will consolidate operations of its Edina, Minn., banking center, located at 3400 W. 66th St., in Edina, Minn., with its banking center at 10880 175th Court in Lakeville, Minn.

Average Balances, Interest Rates and Yields

The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the total dollar amounts of interest income from average interest-earning assets and the resulting yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, expressed both in dollars and rates, and the net interest margin. Average balances of loans receivable include the average balances of nonaccrual loans for each period. Interest income on loans includes interest received on nonaccrual loans on a cash basis. Interest income on loans also includes the amortization of net loan fees, which were deferred in accordance with accounting standards. Net fees included in interest income were $1.0 million and $1.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Net fees included in interest income were $4.1 million and $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Tax-exempt income was not calculated on a tax equivalent basis. The table does not reflect any effect of income taxes.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

This document contains certain financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), specifically, the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets.

In calculating the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets, we subtract period-end intangible assets from common equity and from total assets. Management believes that the presentation of this measure excluding the impact of intangible assets provides useful supplemental information that is helpful in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, as it provides a method to assess management’s success in utilizing our tangible capital as well as our capital strength. Management also believes that providing a measure that excludes balances of intangible assets, which are subjective components of valuation, facilitates the comparison of our performance with the performance of our peers. In addition, management believes that this is a standard financial measure used in the banking industry to evaluate performance.

This non-GAAP financial measurement is supplemental and is not a substitute for any analysis based on GAAP financial measures. Because not all companies use the same calculation of non-GAAP measures, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures as calculated by other companies.

An emerging point of contention in the new legislation, meanwhile, is more about what’s not in the bill, as opposed to what is.

Some lawmakers, including Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) are pushing for the inclusion of a provision that would include sales of high-ethanol gasoline year-round.

A spokesperson for Bacon confirmed Punchbowl’s reporting that he brought up sales of high-ethanol gas at a Republican conference meeting on Wednesday morning but is not planning to vote down the bill over the issue.

“I’ve heard from our NE farmers and this is their #1 priority,” Bacon wrote in a post on the social platform X.

Bipartisan lawmakers from the Midwest have pushed for sales of E15 gas, named for its 15 percent ethanol content, year-round. This type of gasoline has historically been restricted in the summer because of concerns about smog — which can form more easily from evaporation in the heat.

Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, told The Hill in an email there is a “full-fledged push to get year-round E15 in the final package.”

He said “several” Midwestern lawmakers are “drawing a line in the sand on this issue because it is vitally important to jobs and economic vitality in their districts and states.” He did not specify which lawmakers are doing so.

“This should not be controversial — E15 is a more affordable, American-made, cleaner-burning fuel that boosts the farm economy,” Cooper said.

Meanwhile, lawmakers are also seeking to rein in the administration’s cuts to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

A joint explanatory statement accompanying the funding bill calls for restoring positions eliminated over the past year and retaining staffing levels needed for the agency to complete its statutory missions, including Cadre of On-Call Response/Recovery (CORE) staffers.

That is how much pollution will spew from Project Jupiter, a $165 billion dollar data center being built in Santa Teresa, New Mexico.

One EPA official awarded grant funding to his former employer.","JEFFERSON CITY, Mo — Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway joined a coalition of 24 state attorneys general in challenging potential Biden-era grant fraud and supporting the EPA’s cancellation of billions of questionable grants. Biden’s Environmental Protection Agency handed out $20 billion in grants as part of its “Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund,” a program that had little to no oversight and awarded political allies huge sums of money.

“I’m proud to stand with other attorneys general to fight back against potential Biden-era fraud and violations of ethical standards. We will continue to step in to protect Missourians against unconstitutional government overreach,” said Attorney General Hanaway. “Our Office supports the EPA’s move to cancel these grants, reinforcing accountability and integrity in federal spending.”

The Trump administration’s EPA tried to cancel the grants due to new oversight findings, but was blocked by a district court. The coalition of 24 state attorneys general filed an amicus brief supporting the Trump administration’s move.

The states argue that the EPA has both the right and the duty to cancel these grants after mismanagement was discovered. However, the program’s structure limits the EPA’s ability to oversee or terminate grants. The states propose this structure was intentionally designed to evade oversight and accountability.

Grants should be awarded competitively, and these grants allegedly went to political allies. One EPA official awarded grant funding to his former employer. Another recipient had only $100 in assets the year before being awarded $2 billion.

The states write in the brief, “When federal grant programs operate without meaningful oversight—as the House Oversight Committee found the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund did—States bear the consequences of projects that may be poorly conceived, executed, or managed. Taxpayers in amici States deserve to know that federal climate spending is subject to proper oversight and accountability, not rushed out the door as ‘gold bars off the Titanic.’”

The states are asking the en banc United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to vacate the district court’s preliminary injunction order. A panel of the D.C. Circuit earlier sided with the Trump administration and vacated the order.

On Tuesday, the city council gave preliminary approval to rent the unused building at 649 S. River St. to the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act Workforce Development Hub run by the College of DuPage.

“This 100% is the right kind of space,” Callie Matheny, the hub’s director, told the council.

CEJA was designed to help Illinois transition to using 100% “clean” energy by 2050.

COD’s program is 180 hours of entry-level bridge training. Students earn basic first aid and CPR, OSHA-10 job-site safety, and National Center for Construction Education and Research Core Construction certificates.

Then they can advance to job-specific training in solar energy, energy auditing, heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration, and weatherization. Those courses take place at the college’s campus.

The hub has been offering the bridge training at Waubonsee Community College’s downtown Aurora campus, but it needs more room, and a space appropriate for working with power tools.

The hub started training students about a year ago, Matheny said.

The 548 Foundation will also use the building. It provides programs to certify students as solar voltaic system installers. Its students will earn credentials from the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners, an OSHA 30-hour construction certification, and basic construction skill certification.

The city will charge the 548 Foundation and COD $5,000 a month.

The Aurora hub is one of 13 throughout the state. A 14th will soon start in Kankakee, Matheny said.

The hubs are located in equity investment-eligible communities. Those are areas where people have “historically been excluded from economic opportunities, including opportunities in the energy sector” and “environmental justice communities,” where residents have been subject to disproportionate burdens of pollution, including pollution from the energy sector, according to the CEJA law.

Experts say the shift to private equity ownership will only exacerbate the power imbalance between power companies and public utilities commissions.
“Prior to the acquisition,” Robinson says, “the vast majority of stock ownership in Minnesota Power was outside of Duluth, outside of Minnesota.
On the other hand, investor-owned power companies are disincentivized to promote energy efficiency and self-reliance, as it reduces their profits.
Farrell says that individual consumers concerned about rising electricity costs can guard against predatory utility companies by becoming energy self-sufficient through solar energy.","Power companies have long had a reputation for being stable, if unsexy, investments. They’re typically granted exclusive operating rights in their service districts and have a tried-and-true playbook for skirting accountability from the state-level public utilities commissions tasked with regulating them. While today this status quo allows utility investors to reap billions in profits annually on the backs of ratepayers, it brought stable electricity to the vast majority of American households for relatively affordable prices throughout the twentieth century.

But in Northeast Minnesota, this hundred-year-old arrangement came to an end in October 2025, when the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission voted to hand the reins of Minnesota Power, an electric company serving about 150,000 customers, over to private equity investors—despite warnings from consumer advocacy groups, environmental organizations, and an administrative law judge. These groups expressed concerns about the potential for large rate hikes down the line, a decline in service quality due to cost cutting measures, and the possibility of investors saddling the utility company with debt before making an untimely exit.

On December 15, Allete, Minnesota Power’s parent company, announced that the acquisition was complete, with 60 percent going to a BlackRock subsidiary called Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), and the remaining 40 percent going to the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, a government-owned pension fund, marking a turning point in the history of American energy.

The majority of American power companies, including Minnesota Power prior to its acquisition, are investor-owned and typically operate as regulated monopolies, meaning they are the sole provider within a specific region, unencumbered by competition. Each state’s investor-owned utility companies are regulated by a public utilities commission—a state-level government agency, whose members are either elected or appointed by the governor or legislature, tasked with protecting consumers from blackouts and unnecessary rate hikes. But as a recent report from the Harvard Electricity Law Initiative indicates, investor-owned utilities use a number of strategies to convince or even trick state regulators into approving unnecessary rate hikes and subsidizing expensive industrial infrastructure projects. Experts say the shift to private equity ownership will only exacerbate the power imbalance between power companies and public utilities commissions.

To understand private equity’s sudden interest in Minnesota Power, just look seven miles west of the company’s Duluth headquarters to Hermantown, Minnesota, where an unnamed Fortune 50 tech company is reportedly planning to build a 1.8 million-square-foot data center campus directly adjacent to a Minnesota Power substation. Large hyperscale data centers like the one proposed in this area can easily consume 7.2 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per month—nearly 500 times as much as the average Minnesota resident consumes in an entire year.

Given private equity’s recent interest in data centers and artificial intelligence (AI), it’s perhaps unsurprising that these firms would widen their focus to encompass power companies as well. As Alissa Jean Schafer, climate and energy director at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, told the American Prospect about the Allete buyout, “We see BlackRock positioning itself very aggressively to take advantage of the entire supply chain when it comes to AI and data centers, and power generation is a really key part of that.”

Duluth local Buddy Robinson, who spent his career advocating for Minnesota Power customers with the Minnesota Citizens Federation and now sits on the board of a consumer advocacy nonprofit called the Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota, tells The Progressive he believes Minnesota Power had a clear interest in making up for future revenue loss in its industrial sector. The taconite mines in Minnesota Power’s service district have long made up a significant portion of its retail energy usage, but the industry is on a downward trajectory, with two mines pausing operations in the last year. Between 2024 and 2025, taconite customers went from 35 percent of Allete’s total energy sales to 28 percent.

With no indication that this trend will reverse, Robinson says, “The extremely logical thing in Minnesota Power’s interest is to find some other industrial source that could use a huge amount of electricity and basically compensate for the loss of these others. Bingo: a data center.” Robinson’s theory was confirmed in September 2025 by a publicly released email in which Hermantown City Administrator John Mulder directly states Minnesota Power introduced the data center project to Hermantown City Officials, despite claims by Allete’s manager of financial planning that, “the company does not have any specific plans related to data centers.”

In response to Mulder’s email, which was sent in September 2024 and discovered through a public records request, citizens advocacy group CURE formally petitioned the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission to reassess its approval of the Allete sale. In a January 6, 2026, press release, Hudson Kingston, legal director for CURE, said, “The official record is incomplete, and the utility should account for what it hasn’t told the [public utilities commission] and the public regarding its plans” for the Hermantown data center.

Robinson says he suspects Minnesota Power colluded with GIP/BlackRock to secure the data center proposal in Hermantown. “There is great competition for data centers around the country and not as many will get built as everyone hopes will,” he says. “If [Minnesota Power] made a deal with [GIP], ‘Hey you buy us out and promise that you will get us a data center,’ then the problem’s solved for their long term future.” While GIP’s involvement in the Hermantown data center remains unconfirmed, CURE’s petition hints at possible conflicts of interest, noting that, in the time since the October 3 vote, GIP/BlackRock has announced several billion-dollar investments in data center projects around the world, on top of their large previous investments.

For Allete’s board of directors, the last year has been a massive success: Board members received a multimillion-dollar windfall from the sale and, by bringing a data center to Hermantown, secured the company’s financial future. (Allete has not responded to a request for comment.) And for GIP and the Canadian Pension Plan, the proposed data center—which would necessitate new infrastructure projects to fuel it—all but guarantees returns on investment.

In the terms of the sale, the two firms made a few concessions to consumers, including a one-year freeze on base electricity rates and $50 million in additional rate credits. But these protections are temporary and difficult to enforce. John Farrell, codirector of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance and the director of its Energy Democracy Initiative, tells The Progressive, “There were very few legally binding things that were in the settlement agreement or in the ultimate order that protect consumers over a long period of time.”

According to Robsinson, the Duluth community was left in the dark about the potential sale until it was nearly finalized. For many in the community, he says, the sale means the loss of local control over the utility. “Even though the company remains intact [with] the same management team,” he says, “the notion that the real control is now far removed . . . . That made people very concerned.”

But while Minnesota Power has a history of outreach and charitable giving in the community, it has never been under true local control. Like nearly 75 percent of electric utilities in the United States, it was an investor-owned, publicly traded for-profit company up until the recent buyout. “Prior to the acquisition,” Robinson says, “the vast majority of stock ownership in Minnesota Power was outside of Duluth, outside of Minnesota. So it’s very obvious that profits were being extracted through our rates to go outside of Duluth and outside of Minnesota.”

According to Farrell, the massive gap in resources, expertise, and information between utility companies and public utilities commissions makes it difficult for commissioners to adequately protect consumers. “Utilities have all the knowledge and information about the grid, and commissions only get it through pulling teeth,” he says. “[The commissioners] are political appointees, and they don’t know a whole lot. And I’m not saying they don’t try very hard. But . . . this is basically a job that nobody does well.”

The transition from investor ownership to private equity ownership, Farrell believes, is a turn from bad to worse. “This is a continuation of the privatization of a public good, and with less public scrutiny, because it’ll be harder to get information out,” he says. Like all publicly traded companies, investor-owned utilities are legally obligated to publish their finances, operations, and liabilities, while private firms are exempt from even the most basic disclosure requirements. “Once it’s private, it will just become more difficult to effectively regulate,” Farrell says.

What’s more, Farrell is skeptical of the idea that a clean energy transition can be made compatible with the rapid proliferation of data centers. On one hand, he points to home electrification nonprofit Rewiring America’s argument that, if hyperscale data center companies were to pay for household energy efficiency upgrades on a mass scale, the reduced residential energy consumption would sufficiently offset the electricity needed by those data centers, reducing strain on the power grid and keeping electric rates stable or lower for residential consumers. On the other hand, investor-owned power companies are disincentivized to promote energy efficiency and self-reliance, as it reduces their profits. “Our whole system is designed to be top-down and not to even consider it,” he says. “And the people who have the most power in the system also have no financial incentive to pursue it.”

In February 2023, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz signed a bill requiring public utilities to supply 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2040. While the state was previously on track to meet its goals, the explosion in data center proposals and projects has threatened to stall its progress. Pete Wyckoff, a deputy commissioner at the Minnesota Department of Commerce, told utility regulators in October 2024, “My analysts are skeptical about rapidly delivering power of any sort, much less clean power, in the size and time frames that the data centers are likely to request.” Minnesota Power justified the buyout, in part, by arguing the company needed private equity’s access to capital in order to build the clean energy infrastructure needed to meet the state’s goals. However, the company had previously told shareholders it was poised to meet its capital needs through the public market. Further, the two firms made no binding commitments to fund clean energy projects.

BlackRock’s acquisition of Allete appears to be just the beginning of private equity’s increased interest in utility companies: Blackstone, the largest private equity firm in the world, is now vying to acquire TXNM Energy, which serves customers across Texas and New Mexico, for $11.5 billion. Just like BlackRock’s acquisition of Allete, Blackstone’s proposal coincides with plans to build an enormous new data center campus in the Texas and New Mexico service district.

Private equity firms aim for a higher rate of return than public market investors, and often unload their investments after just a few years, meaning they often take extreme cost cutting measures with little regard for the longevity of the company. In the case of Allete, the two firms overpaid for their shares by upwards of $1.5 billion, and must recoup this cost before they can begin turning a profit for stakeholders.

Robinson says he hopes that private equity’s negative reputation will galvanize Duluth residents and city leaders to be more skeptical of proposed infrastructure projects and rate hikes, but only time will tell how successfully they can hold the world’s largest asset manager accountable.

Farrell says that individual consumers concerned about rising electricity costs can guard against predatory utility companies by becoming energy self-sufficient through solar energy. “If [you] have the wherewithal to buy solar panels, now might be a good time,” Farrell says. “If you’re worried about your rates being jacked up a lot over time, making an investment now in solar is going to last twenty-five or thirty years.”

But there’s a limit to what individuals can accomplish in the face of an all-powerful monopoly. “You cannot, as an individual, boycott or a protest or petition in a way that is likely to make a meaningful difference,” he says. “You can do something on your own property to reduce your exposure, and then you can organize.”",https://progressive.org/downloads/22472/download/MinnesotaPower.jpg?cb=127def75c5fa54dec77fe89c49c8e047&w=1200,N,,2026-01-21 18:00:42.594999

Republicans’ attempt to gut Clean Air Act protections will eliminate over half a century of economic and public health progress.
The assault on Americans' health continues with those bills, as they only increase pollution that affects people's health.","Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ) delivered the following opening remarks at today's Full Committee markup of 11 bills, including from the Environment and Communications and Technology subcommittees:

Today the Committee is considering 11 bills – some of them out of our Communications and Technology Subcommittee will be bipartisan, while bills out of our Environment Subcommittee will be partisan as Republicans continue to assault Americans' health care.

We will begin by considering seven Republican bills that strike at the heart of the Clean Air Act and make Americans sicker, solely to increase corporate polluter profits. Four of the bills we are considering today will undermine the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, or NAAQS – a suite of health-based standards that let us know what level of pollution is safe to breathe. These bills would turn the NAAQS from standards that protect public health to ones that protect special interests.

Republicans are also taking aim at the New Source Review Program. H.R. 161 would simultaneously allow polluters to cook the books on how they measure cancer-causing emissions and remove the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to review the public health and environmental impacts of major projects.

If that wasn’t enough, H.R. 6373 gives the President the ability to waive Clean Air Act permit requirements for his pet projects and creates a pay-to-pollute scheme that lets large industrial sources of pollution off the hook for the harm they cause by simply paying their way into compliance.

Looking at this slate of bills, it appears my Republican colleagues have forgotten that air pollution is dangerous and poses significant health risks, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and over 100,000 premature deaths every year. They also ignore the fact that the Clean Air Act is one of the most successful public health laws in history. It has dramatically cut air pollution since 1970, while the U.S. Gross Domestic Product has nearly quadrupled in that time. Republicans’ attempt to gut Clean Air Act protections will eliminate over half a century of economic and public health progress.

To add insult to injury, Republicans continue to ignore the affordability crisis. American families are struggling to afford their groceries, their utility bills, and their health insurance premiums. Instead of working to address this crisis, Republicans are advancing harmful bills that fundamentally undermine EPA’s ability to protect human health and the environment.

Once again, Republicans are focused on their corporate interest friends, not hardworking everyday Americans. These bills push policies that benefit their billionaire buddies and sell out Americans’ health for industry profit. Republican inaction has already sent health care premiums skyrocketing for millions of Americans, and now they want to make people even sicker as they struggle to afford care.

That’s why I continue to oppose these bills, and I strongly urge my colleagues to do the same.

We will also consider several bills out of the Communications and Technology Subcommittee. The Emergency Reporting Act, from Subcommittee Ranking Member Matsui and Representative Bilirakis, will improve processes at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to assess communications failures caused by natural disasters like hurricanes and wildfires. This effort is a critical step to ensure that policymakers and regulators are equipped with detailed information to identify trends and inform efforts to address points of vulnerability in preparation for future disasters.

We will also consider the Kari’s Law Reporting Act that builds upon a 2018 law. Kari’s Law requires providers of multi-line telephone systems, which serve entities like office buildings and hotels, to reconfigure their systems to enable callers to simply dial 9-1-1 without a prefix to reach emergency assistance. Unfortunately, providers have yet to fully comply with Kari’s Law, so this bill provides Congress and the FCC with the tools necessary to track down delinquent providers and ensure they comply with the law.

I appreciate the bipartisan cooperation that went into bringing these bills up, but again, I express my deep disappointment in the bills out of our Environment Subcommittee. The assault on Americans' health continues with those bills, as they only increase pollution that affects people's health.

And with that, I yield back the balance of my time.

Christian Smith,,,,,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2026/01/21/aurora-looking-to-create-hub-for-clean-energy-job-training/,"Both organizations are funded by the state to run clean energy-related job training programs, but those programs do not yet have a permanent location in Aurora.
“We’re excited to say we found an important alliance in the city of Aurora,” said the College of DuPage’s director of the Aurora CEJA Aurora Workforce Hub, Callie Matheny, at a launch event on Tuesday.
If the Aurora City Council approves the leases at its meeting next Tuesday, they will go into effect on Feb. 1.
In a press release, city officials said the Aurora CEJA Workforce Development Hub will act as a magnet for living-wage job creation and innovative green job training.
Aurora is also actively looking for additional partners to further expand the CEJA Workforce Development Hub, the city’s press release about the launch event said.","The city of Aurora has announced it will be launching a new center that will offer job training in green energy-related fields through a partnership with two educational organizations.

Aurora’s CEJA Workforce Development Hub, set to be located in a currently unused city facility at 649 S. River St., will bring together the existing workforce development programs of the College of DuPage and the 548 Foundation. Both organizations are funded by the state to run clean energy-related job training programs, but those programs do not yet have a permanent location in Aurora.

“We’re excited to say we found an important alliance in the city of Aurora,” said the College of DuPage’s director of the Aurora CEJA Aurora Workforce Hub, Callie Matheny, at a launch event on Tuesday. “This is city government at work. They have been an extreme, fast-moving partner.”

The programs offered by the two organizations get their funding through the state Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, which also gives the Aurora center its name. The act was signed into law in 2021 and specifically notes Aurora as one of the 13 statewide locations to have such a job-training hub.

Mavis Bates — who is a Kane County Board member, chair of the local chapter of the Sierra Club and on the city’s Sustainable Aurora Advisory Board — called the newly-announced physical location of the Aurora CEJA Workforce Development Hub a “big fancy deal” when she spoke at Tuesday’s launch event.

“I was so excited five years ago when I saw that Aurora’s name was on the list,” she said during her speech. “At that time, I did not realize it was going to be five years before this day would finally happen.”

And although the city did host a “launch” event, Mayor John Laesch in his own speech was quick to point out that the day Mavis spoke about still hasn’t come yet. The leases for the College of DuPage and the 548 Foundation to rent out the building, formerly used by the city’s water and sewer division, have yet to pass the Aurora City Council.

If the Aurora City Council approves the leases at its meeting next Tuesday, they will go into effect on Feb. 1.

In a press release, city officials said the Aurora CEJA Workforce Development Hub will act as a magnet for living-wage job creation and innovative green job training.

Alison Lindburg, Aurora’s director of sustainability, noted in a speech at Tuesday’s launch event that her division is within the city’s economic development department in part because sustainability offers an opportunity for job creation. In Illinois, there’s over 132,000 people working jobs related to clean energy, which is more than the number of lawyers, web developers and real estate agents combined, she said.

Those jobs might include the installation of efficient lighting, connecting heat pumps and other efficient HVAC systems, completing energy audits of homes and commercial buildings, installing electric vehicle charging stations, solar panels and battery storage, and helping to modernize the energy grid, according to Lindburg.

The building set to hold the hub is planned to one day contain both classroom and work space. The classroom is set to be a “living laboratory,” Lindburg said, with its own HVAC system for students to work on and empty spaces in the walls for students to install insulation in.

“We’re lucky to have found a space that can provide for both classroom and workshop in one concise location,” Matheny said. “On a program management level, we’re super excited to have staff, students and all of our stuff in one place. It’s going to be a game changer.”

From the new physical hub in Aurora, the College of DuPage is set to run its seven-week entry-level CEJA Bridge Program, which earns students various certificates related to construction and first aid, Matheny told the Aurora City Council’s Committee of the Whole on Tuesday. After completing that training, students can then choose to go on to more advanced, job-specific training in solar installation, energy auditing and HVAC work, she said.

In total, the college has the capacity to run about six of these programs each year, according to Matheny. More information can be found at: www.cod.edu/academics/continuing-education/career-professional-training/climate-equitable-jobs.html

The planned Aurora hub is also planned to hold a training program from the 548 Foundation, which sets graduates up to become first-year apprentices in the Mid-America Carpenters Regional Council with training in construction and solar systems. Founder AJ Patton said at Tuesday’s launch event that his organization’s program offers $500 weekly stipends to its students to “earn while you learn,” helping to carry them through the training.

The 548 Foundation is open to partnership and doesn’t care about taking the credit, Patton said, so any who have ideas on how to create jobs or have job opportunities are encouraged to reach out. More information about the program can be found at: 548foundation.org

The College of DuPage is on the “workforce development” side of things, which means they are more specific to meeting the needs of local employers, while the 548 Foundation is more on the “climate works” side, which is more in-tune with what the unions would like to see, according to Matheny’s presentation to the Committee of the Whole on Tuesday. She said that both programs rely on Goodwill, which works to educate the community about the programs and guide interested people towards them.

Aurora is also actively looking for additional partners to further expand the CEJA Workforce Development Hub, the city’s press release about the launch event said.

Sustainability and living-wage job creating, particularly through green building, was a large part of Laesch’s campaign platform last year.

As a mayoral candidate, he told The Beacon-News that he would work to attract higher-paying jobs by “positioning Aurora for the green collar economy that’s coming,” at least in part by encouraging businesses that create innovative building materials to move to the city. Later, during his inauguration speech, Laesch spoke about partnering with the local CEJA Workforce Hub to help train students for that coming “green collar economy.”

The training is only the first step, Laesch said at Tuesday’s launch event. The next step will be creating the living wage jobs for Aurora residents, he said, and the city is working hard at finding ways to do that.

One way city officials are hoping to encourage the creation of green energy jobs is through a proposed Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy financing program, commonly called C-PACE. Through the lending program, the owners of commercial properties can borrow at a fixed, low interest rate for renovation or new construction projects related to energy efficiency and similar types of things.

The ordinance allowing the Illinois Finance Authority to manage a C-PACE program from Aurora, alongside the leases for the new CEJA Workforce Development Hub, are set to go before the Aurora City Council at its meeting on Tuesday. Those items are likely to pass since they are all on the meeting’s consent agenda, which is typically reserved for routine or non-controversial items that are all approved with a single vote.

“Each year, global emissions become increasingly concentrated among a shrinking group of high-emitting producers, while overall production continues to grow.
Much of the global carbon emissions in 2024 came from state-owned entities, which represented 16 of the top 20 emitters.
Historically, ExxonMobil and Chevron rank in the top five for fossil carbon emissions generated from 1854 through 2024, accounting for 2.79 percent and 3.08 percent of overall carbon pollution, respectively.
Nearly two-thirds of the 32 entities responsible for over half of CO2 emissions in 2024 saw their emissions increase compared to 2023.","As fossil fuel-based carbon dioxide emissions continue to rise to record levels, a new analysis shows that a majority of these emissions can be traced back to a shrinking number of large corporate entities.

Just 32 companies accounted for over half of global fossil carbon emissions in 2024, according to a report published Wednesday by the U.K.-based think tank InfluenceMap. That is down from 36 companies responsible for half the global CO2 emissions in 2023, and 38 companies five years ago.

The analysis is the latest update to the Carbon Majors database, which tracks the world’s largest oil, gas, coal and cement producers and uses production data to calculate the carbon emissions from each entity’s production. The database, first developed by researcher Richard Heede and now hosted by InfluenceMap, quantifies current and historical emissions attributable to nearly 180 companies and provides annual updates. It is the only database of its kind tracking corporate-generated carbon emissions dating back to the start of the Industrial Revolution, research that’s being used in efforts to hold major polluters accountable for climate harms.

“Each year, global emissions become increasingly concentrated among a shrinking group of high-emitting producers, while overall production continues to grow. Simultaneously, these heavy emitters continue to use lobbying to obstruct a transition that the scientific community has known for decades is essential,” Emmett Connaire, senior analyst at InfluenceMap, said in a press statement. The findings of the new analysis, he added, “underscore the growing importance of this kind of rigorous evidence in efforts to determine accountability for climate-related losses.”

Despite dire warnings from scientists about the consequences of accelerating climate change, fossil fuel production is continuing apace. Last year, fossil fuel CO2 emissions reached a record high, topping 38 billion metric tons. In 2024 these emissions were 37.4 billion metric tons—up 0.8 percent from 2023—and traceable to 166 oil, gas, coal and cement producers, according to the report.

Much of the global carbon emissions in 2024 came from state-owned entities, which represented 16 of the top 20 emitters. The five largest emitters overall—Saudi Arabia’s Aramco, Coal India, China’s CHN Energy, National Iranian Oil Co. and Russia’s Gazprom—were all state-controlled, and accounted for 18 percent of the total fossil CO2 emissions in 2024.

ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, ConocoPhillips and BP—the top five emitting investor-owned companies—together were responsible for 5.5 percent of the total emissions in that year.

Historically, ExxonMobil and Chevron rank in the top five for fossil carbon emissions generated from 1854 through 2024, accounting for 2.79 percent and 3.08 percent of overall carbon pollution, respectively. According to the analysis, the 178 entities in the database have generated 70 percent of fossil CO2 emissions since the start of the Industrial Revolution, and just 22 entities are responsible for one-third of these emissions.

The report further indicates that many of the largest emitters are increasing their fossil fuel output, and hence their emissions, while lobbying against climate policies and blocking climate action. Nearly two-thirds of the 32 entities responsible for over half of CO2 emissions in 2024 saw their emissions increase compared to 2023.

“The latest Carbon Majors data shows once again that large emitters are on the wrong side of history. When we need to accelerate progress to the clean energy future that would give us greater energy security, affordability and freedom, these emitters continue to block our way,” Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and a chief architect of the Paris Agreement, said in a press statement. “While clean energy and electrification is already receiving nearly twice the investment of fossil fuels globally, carbon majors are clinging on to outdated, polluting products and continue to mislead the public on the urgent real-world consequences of their actions.”

In the U.S., Big Oil executives are touting the long-term demand for oil and gas. American Petroleum Institute president and CEO Mike Sommers proclaimed last week at an industry event that “the next ten years are shaping up to be the Demand Decade,” while ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods, speaking at a recent White House meeting on Venezuela, said: “We’re in a depletion business for a product that is in great demand and will be in demand for many, many, many decades to come.”

Scientists say that fossil fuels must be phased out if we are to avoid the most catastrophic outcomes. In a paper titled “The 2024 state of the climate report: Perilous times on planet Earth,” scientific experts note that “stiff resistance from those benefiting financially from the current fossil-fuel based system” is holding back progress on mitigating the climate problem. “Rapidly phasing down fossil fuel use should be a top priority,” they say.

At the COP28 U.N. climate summit in Dubai in 2023, countries agreed, at least in principle, on the need to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems. But at the most recent U.N. climate summit, COP30 in Brazil last November, petrostates and major fossil fuel-producing countries blocked a proposed roadmap for this transition, which had the backing of more than 80 countries. According to the latest Carbon Majors analysis, 17 of the top 20 carbon emitters in 2024 were controlled by countries that opposed a roadmap for phasing out fossil fuels. These countries included Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, Iran, United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Iraq, Qatar and India.

Tzeporah Berman, chair and founder of the Fossil Fuel Treaty Initiative, said the analysis reveals that “a powerful, concentrated group of fossil fuel corporations are not only dominating global emissions but are actively sabotaging climate action and weakening government ambition.”

“Their increasing output and blatant opposition to a fossil fuel phase-out, as witnessed at COP30, reveal a systemic barrier to progress,” she said in a press statement. “This is precisely why a Fossil Fuel Treaty is not merely an option, but the indispensable mechanism to hold these giants accountable, break their stranglehold on climate policy, and ensure a fast and fair global transition away from the products threatening our very existence: oil, gas, and coal.”

The first steps on negotiating a fossil fuel phaseout treaty will begin to take shape this spring. The governments of Colombia and the Netherlands announced at COP30 that they will co-host the world’s first International Conference on the Just Transition Away from Fossil Fuels, which will take place April 28 and 29 in Santa Marta, Colombia.

“This will be a broad intergovernmental, multisectoral platform complementary to the UNFCCC designed to identify legal, economic, and social pathways that are necessary to make the phasing out of fossil fuels,” Irene Vélez Torres, Colombia’s minister of environment and sustainable development, said in the announcement.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2256127814-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 17:02:38.289321

South Carolina public power utility Santee Cooper on Jan. 20 said that its personnel are making preparations for the effects anticipated winter weather may have on Santee Cooper’s electric system.

Approximately 2 million South Carolinians depend on the state-owned electric and water utility as their power source, either directly or through the state’s electric cooperatives.

As of noon Jan. 20, Santee Cooper moved to Operating Condition (OpCon) 4 alert status. This means there is a possible threat to Santee Cooper’s electric system, but effects may be limited or uncertain.

Santee Cooper is preparing for effects from a cold weather and freezing precipitation event that could enter South Carolina this weekend, Jan. 24 and 25.

At OpCon 4, the utility is primarily:

• Completing freeze protection checklists for generating station equipment.

• Preparing to have additional personnel on site at generating stations in the event of road closures, and securing additional personnel, including contractors, for transmission and distribution crews.

• Checking and fueling vehicles, including line trucks.

• Checking inventory and procuring supplies as needed, such as utility poles, electric transformers and associated equipment.

""Santee Cooper is monitoring the weather and preparing accordingly to help us be best positioned to keep the lights on for all of our customers across the state,” said Marty Watson, Senior Director, Commercial and Customer Service. “In addition, the extreme cold weather means customers may be using more electricity, which could cause their bills to increase. We encourage customers to consider ways they can save energy to help combat higher bills.""

Estimates of deployment of fabric measures, low-carbon heating technology, and energy generation and storage technology in the ‘Warm Homes Plan’ are the result of the aggregating impacts across multiple policies. We use the National Buildings Model (NBM), a housing stock model based on the English Housing Survey, supplemented by other policy-specific models. For each policy, we identify the households in scope and estimate the measures installed as a result of that intervention, taking into account interactions between policies.

While the NBM and policy-specific models go through continuous review and robust quality assurance, the results of the modelling are subject to uncertainties, real world behaviour may not match the modelled outcomes for several reasons. Therefore the actual deployment depends on final policy design and choices made by households, landlords and developers.

The following sections provide more detail on specific metrics and targets presented in the ‘Warm Homes Plan’:

Heat pump market target

Our aim is to grow the heat pump market to deliver more than 450,000 annual heat pump installations in existing and new buildings by 2030. For new build, the analysis uses estimates of the new homes to be constructed to Part L 2021 or Future Homes Standard (FHS) performance standards which use a heat pump route to compliance. In 2030 around 200,000 heat pumps are estimated to be installed in new build homes. Build rate assumptions should be taken as an indicative trajectory and do not represent an official forecast of housing supply. In existing homes, the analysis uses modelled heat pump installations supported by government policies over the current Spending Review period, with an extrapolation made to 2030 informed by historic year-on-year growth in the heat pump market. This is a UK-level ambition and assumes proportionate heat pump deployment in existing homes within the devolved administrations, equivalent to that projected under UK government policies.

Homes upgraded

The analysis presented includes estimates of homes upgraded from July 2024 – December 2030 based on Official Statistics of scheme delivery published to date and modelling of potential future policy impacts at the geographic scope of the policy. The estimate includes homes treated under:

capital funding schemes and retrofit schemes (including the Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS), the Warm Homes: Social Housing Fund (WH:SHF), the Home Upgrade Grant, the Warm Homes: Local Grant (WH:LG), Energy Company Obligation (ECO) and the Great British Insulation Scheme (GBIS) to the end of March 2026, provisional estimates of the impact of the additional low income £1.5bn capital delivery route announced at Budget 2025 from 2027/28 onwards, and HMG backed low-interest loans through the Warm Homes Fund (WHF) and other market-led domestic solar photovoltaic (PV) installations

investment from Private and Social landlords to meet the Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards (MEES) proposals, based on estimates provided in the regulatory impact assessments and adjusted for overlaps with other policies to avoid double counting; and;

estimates of the number of new build homes constructed to FHS performance standards which use a heat pump route to compliance or are built with solar panels. Build rate assumptions should be taken as an indicative trajectory and do not represent an official forecast of housing supply

The estimate of low-income households benefitting from these policies was based on the number of households in the bottom 4 income deciles (equivalised, after housing costs) modelled to receive measures. New build homes were not included in this estimate.

Solar PV installations

Estimates of future domestic solar PV installations up to and including 2030 are comprised of modelled deployment from Private Rented Sector and Social Rented Sector MEES regulatory impact assessments ; estimated new build homes built to the FHS performance standards with solar PV; the WH:SHF and the WH:LG; the continuation of market-led deployment based on domestic retrofit installs in 2024/25, and provisional estimates of the impact of the new low income £1.5bn capital delivery route from 2027/28 onwards and the Warm Homes Fund.

Estimated deployment under new schemes reflects latest analysis or published positions where applicable but is subject to final policy design. Geographic coverage varies by policy. For example, Private Rented Sector MEES applies to England and Wales; Social Rented Sector MEES and FHS to England only. The deployment estimates include assumptions around landlord choices. For example, assuming all Social Rented Sector landlords choose smart readiness (proxied for with solar PV) secondary to meeting a primary fabric performance target, under the £10k cap per home. The element of choice amongst landlords means that the degree of solar PV deployment realised may differ from that in the modelled projection.

Deployment from these schemes is additional to historic domestic solar PV deployment, sourced from DESNZ published statistics, and future market led deployment where homes take up solar PV outside of government schemes.

Heat networks

The National Zoning Model identifies buildings in England, where heat networks are expected to offer the lowest-cost solution for decarbonising heat. Using outputs from this model, we expect around 20% of UK heat supply to come from heat networks by 2050. Interim targets have been set in order to be consistent with the trajectory required to meet this level.

Targets are presented in 2025 terms, i.e. they are not adjusted for future changes in heat demand due to factors such as changes in population, temperature or energy efficiency.

Bills

Estimates of domestic bill savings are calculated through one of the following approaches:

dynamic simulation of typical housing archetypes, building on the Cost Optimal Domestic Electrification (CODE) study

NBM based estimates of example archetypes under different policies

CODE

Our estimate of a typical household being able to save up to £550 a year from adopting a package of a heat pump, solar PV and battery is based on CODE. The following assumptions have been applied:

the coefficient of performance for the heat pump is 2.8

the modelled PV installation is equivalent to 4 kW of PV panels, and the battery is equivalent to 4 kWh of storage

4 kW of PV panels represents a common installation size which can fit on most roofs, though PV installations smaller than 4 kW for terraced and semi-detached houses would result in lower estimated bill savings

with a conventional tariff the battery is run to maximise self-consumption of the generated PV

solar PV installations are not optimally laid out, with PV laid on the East and West facing roofs. It may be possible for an optimally installed PV array to generate more electricity than modelled

the model assumes that archetypes have had a basic level of energy efficiency measures applied (cavity and loft insulation of 100mm) to begin with as well as double glazing

model assumes that households adopting a heat pump no longer pay the gas standing charge. Households which continue to use gas, such as in cooking appliances, would therefore experience lower bill savings

Additional analysis has been undertaken to estimate the potential savings from adopting an illustrative time-of-use tariff and setting up the battery to charge during off-peak hours. The estimated additional bill savings from adopting a time-of-use tariff - alongside a heat pump, solar PV, and battery - is based on the following assumptions:

figures are based on average energy prices for 2024, for a household in Yorkshire (selected to reflect weather conditions representative of the country overall)

time-of-use tariff assumed to offer 8 hours of electricity at off-peak rate, 13 hours at standard rate and 3 hours at peak rate

the battery charges during off-peak hours and aims to maximise self-consumption of solar PV and avoid peak hours

Estimates on bill savings, including those from time-of-use tariffs, are presented separately. Combining or aggregating estimates on bill savings would lead to misinterpretation and therefore all figures should be considered independently.

Example archetype bill savings

Example housing archetypes have been derived from the Quarterly Energy Prices (QEP) Statistics, NBM and CODE, with projected prices for 2028 applied as set out below. The example archetype bill savings for each policy represent a specific set of installations in a specific dwelling to give an example of how a household could see bill reductions under a ‘Warm Homes Plan’ policy. This is different to the average savings expected across a policy, which will average across a larger set of homes combining smaller and larger impacts. For example, the average PRS MEES bill saving across the policy are estimated to be £210/year per household while the example archetype has bill saving of £410/year.

Gas price projections for 2028, used to estimate bill savings for the example archetypes, have been taken from the Green Book supplementary guidance. To split prices into standing charge and unit rate an illustrative future standing charge projection for gas and electricity has been estimated based on 2024 average standing charges from QEP. An implied gas unit rate was then estimated from green book gas prices using 2024 average actual consumption. To produce an electricity unit rate price series more reflective of current prices, the electricity to gas ratio from the Q1 2026 Ofgem’s default price cap was applied to estimated unit gas prices.

The following policy adjustments were then made to reflect the announcements to remove particular costs from gas and electricity prices at Budget 2025. These impacts have been calculated against baseline prices produced using 2025 values taken from Ofgem’s default price cap , using summer and winter demand weights to produce an annual average value paid by those on single rate metering arrangements. Future £/MWh prices have been adjusted to account for changes in aggregate sales, using the DESNZ Energy and Emissions Projections gas and electricity demand projections.

75% of Renewable Obligation (RO) funded by exchequer from April 2026 until March 2029. Baseline RO cost projections have been taken from Office for Budget Responsibility November 2025 Economic and fiscal outlook

Energy Company Obligation (ECO) and Great British Insulation Scheme (GBIS) levy funding ends in April 2026. Baseline ECO/GBIS costs have been assumed to remain flat in real terms until 2030

The illustrative impact of a higher performing heat pump with a Time of Use (TOU) tariff demonstrates what some households could achieve in the nearer term from switching from a gas boiler to a higher performing heat pump. This is based on average actual electricity and gas consumption for 2024 taken from QEP statistics. Prices are based on the Q1 2026 price cap, adjusted for changes announced at Budget 2025. Gas demand converted to heat-pump consumption based on 8% demand uplift, 84% boiler efficiency and 311% heat pump efficiency and assumes heat pump household no longer pays the gas standing charge. Savings from adopting a time of use tariff are consistent with a 10% reduction in the unit rate for electricity, based on a review of evidence of time of use tariffs in relation to heat pumps and adjusting for the role of other demand shifting technologies in shifting electricity to lower price periods.

Jobs supported

Estimates of jobs supported by the ‘Warm Homes Plan’ includes estimates of both direct and indirect jobs, which can be defined as:

Direct jobs: the roles involved in the deployment, installation and maintenance of technologies such as heat pumps, heat networks, energy efficiency measures and solar PV and batteries

Indirect jobs: intermediary roles in the supply chain, such as manufacturing

The 2030 estimates are for jobs supported by the Plan but do not measure net additional jobs across the sector. The 2030 figure is inflated by the assumption that a large proportion of private rented sector homes will be treated in that year, in time for the regulations. The overall job impact, from this policy, estimated at 180,000, may be more spread out, reducing the 2030 figure. Further details of how the number of for jobs supported are estimated are detailed in the ‘Clean Energy Jobs Plan Technical Annex’. This applies to both UK and regional estimates, with equivalent policy actions assumed in devolved governments.

Investment

Estimates of investment over 2024 to 2030 are calculated by aggregating estimates of gross capital expenditure for multiple policies (new build standards use net capital expenditure to avoid counting the impact of general construction costs). Estimates include both public investment through spending review settlements and private investment, for example Housing Association Co-funding.

The gross capital expenditure for each policy is calculated based on measures costs; it therefore does not include additional costs needed to administer policies. The capital expenditure is calculated based on the geographical scope of the policy, however, where devolved governments are expected to take similar actions, an appropriate scaling factor is applied to the gross capital expenditure to account for this.

The public funding committed in the ‘Warm Homes Plan’ - £15bn this Spending Review period – is the largest capital allocation to schemes improving the energy efficiency and heating of homes to date. This is based on a comparison of the £15bn committed under the ‘Warm Homes Plan’ to the following comparable historic funding commitments and outturn funding:",https://www.gov.uk/assets/frontend/govuk-opengraph-image-4196a4d6333cf92aaf720047f56cfd91b3532d7635fc21ebcf0d5897df6b5f77.png,N,,2026-01-21 17:00:56.005783

About Louisiana Innovation<LA.IO> We’re here to ensure that our state’s unique business and policy strengths support an ongoing tradition of Louisiana innovation.","Project returns former federal campus to active use through affordable housing, innovation, and long-term neighborhood investment.

NEW ORLEANS — The transformation of the former Naval Support Activity East Bank site officially began today as project partners broke ground on a multi-phase effort to return the long-dormant federal campus to active use as a center for innovation, housing, and neighborhood-serving spaces. Led by Brian Gibbs Development, the redevelopment will reimagine the historic riverfront site as a modern, mixed-use campus that supports New Orleans’ role in the future of energy and industry while delivering tangible community benefits and long-term economic growth.

The redevelopment of the former Naval Support Activity East Bank site represents one of the most significant mixed-use investments in New Orleans in decades. The multi-phase plan will deliver affordable housing, neighborhood-serving retail, a world-class venture platform, and shared community spaces that reconnect a long-isolated riverfront campus to the surrounding neighborhood. Together, these elements are designed to strengthen connections between residents, workers, and the broader Bywater community — establishing a place that supports daily life as much as long-term economic growth.

“This groundbreaking marks an important step in putting long-idle public land back to work for New Orleans,” said New Orleans Mayor Helena Moreno. “Through partnerships like Newlab New Orleans, we’re building on Louisiana’s strengths in energy, maritime, and industrial innovation to help local talent and businesses grow, while also delivering real community benefits, including much-needed affordable housing for the Bywater community.”

A key initiative of this development is Newlab New Orleans, an innovation and technology hub designed to help startups and industry partners develop, test, and scale the critical technologies that will shape future industries in the State. Newlab New Orleans is anchored by a public-private partnership that includes Louisiana Economic Development, the City of New Orleans, Future Use of Energy in Louisiana (FUEL), Louisiana State University, Greater New Orleans, Inc., and Shell.

“Reactivating the former Naval Support Activity site reflects how Louisiana is rethinking innovation, industry, and community,” said LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois. “By embedding advanced technology development within our legacy industries, Newlab New Orleans will help new companies scale, modernize existing industries, and deliver sustained economic benefits to communities. This is Louisiana innovation — driven by purpose and anchored in partnership.”

Newlab’s platform is built around a simple but powerful premise: scaling the next generation of critical technologies will require deep public-private collaboration, purpose-built infrastructure, flexible capital, and real-world deployment opportunities. Newlab New Orleans will focus initially on advanced energy and power solutions, carbon management, industrial efficiency, and maritime innovation – sectors where Louisiana’s existing assets and workforce create a clear competitive advantage. Through structured programming with industry and government partners, the platform will help founders move from technology development and lab-scale testing to first field deployments and commercial scale.

“Today marks a defining moment in Newlab’s long-term commitment to anchor industrial innovation in the region,” said Newlab CEO David Belt. “We see in New Orleans, and the State more broadly, both the capability and the momentum required to lead — making this region and the NSA site the perfect place to build a home for scaling critical technologies.”

Newlab New Orleans is being built specifically for industrial-scale innovation. The new facility will support startups as they fabricate, assemble, and pre-commission first-of-a-kind systems, allowing technologies to be tested and proven in real-world conditions before being deployed at commercial scale. By lowering the cost and risk of early deployment, Newlab accelerates commercialization timelines and helps attract companies that might otherwise build and scale elsewhere.

“Today is more than a groundbreaking – it is the start of a redevelopment that will transform the neighborhood and the city,” said Michael Hecht, President and CEO of Greater New Orleans, Inc. “The NSA site will seamlessly combine the practical with the aspirational, providing hundreds of units of affordable housing, while launching Newlab – the most successful venture platform in the world – right here in New Orleans. We are grateful to all of the committed and creative partners who have brought us to this day.”

Newlab’s approach has delivered measurable results in other legacy industrial cities like Detroit, MI, and Brooklyn, NY, where its hubs have supported high-growth startups, generated billions in economic activity, and anchored high-wage jobs. In New Orleans, the goal is to apply Newlab’s model in a way that is tightly aligned with the state’s economic development strategy, manufacturing base, and skilled workforce, positioning the region as a launchpad for scaling critical technologies.

“FUEL’s investment in the Newlab partnership will put Louisiana energy startups on a faster path from lab to market,” said Mike Mazzola, Executive Director of Future Use of Energy in Louisiana (FUEL). “When combined with FUEL’s other investments, our founders will have access to the tools, capital, and partnerships needed to scale.”

Newlab New Orleans is one of several major components of the broader NSA redevelopment, a multi-phase effort led by Brian Gibbs Development to transform the former military operations site into a vibrant new campus that delivers housing, retail, and long-term community and economic value for New Orleans. Designed as an integrated campus, the redevelopment aligns these elements to create community and economic activity while delivering long-term value for the surrounding neighborhood.

Lincoln Avenue Communities’ NSA East Bank Apartments will anchor the housing component of the redevelopment through an adaptive-reuse project that will deliver 294 units of affordable housing and approximately 30,000 square feet of ground-floor retail. The development will include 1-, 2-, and 3-bedroom units serving individuals and families earning between 20% and 60% of Area Median Income, including 74 Project-Based Voucher units.

At $197 million, the Lincoln Avenue Communities investment represents the largest affordable housing development in Louisiana history, setting a new benchmark for scale, preservation, and long-term affordability. By transforming former military facilities into high-quality homes, the project expands access to housing in a high-opportunity area while ensuring that the NSA redevelopment delivers immediate and lasting benefits for local residents.

“This project will be transformative for the New Orleans Bywater community and will bring new life to this historic property,” said David Garcia, LAC Vice President and Project Partner. “LAC along with Brian Gibbs Development are proud to play a role in preserving New Orleans’ architectural heritage while creating sorely needed affordable housing for New Orleans residents.”

With construction now underway, the redevelopment will proceed in phases to deliver new homes, ground-floor retail, and shared community spaces, returning the former Naval Support Activity East Bank site to active use and creating a riverfront campus that supports daily life in the Bywater while positioning New Orleans for long-term growth in industrial sectors. Together, these investments represent a long-term commitment to local residents and the region’s economic future.

It accounts for roughly 16% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is a major driver of climate change.
Shelley said uniform EPA rules provided regulatory certainty for changes operators saw as inevitable.
Colin Leyden, Texas state director and energy lead at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, said eliminating the program could hurt Texas industry.
Leyden said tallying up the dollar value of lives saved when evaluating pollution rules is a foundational principle of the EPA since its creation.","The first year of President Trump’s second term has seen an aggressive rollback of federal environmental protections, which advocacy groups fear will bring more pollution, higher health risks, and less information and power for Texas communities, especially in heavily industrial and urban areas.

Within Trump’s first 100 days in office, his new Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Lee Zeldin, announced a sweeping slate of 31 deregulatory actions. The list, which Zeldin called the agency’s “greatest day of deregulation,” targeted everything from soot standards and power plant pollution rules to the Endangerment Finding, the legal and scientific foundation that obligates the EPA to regulate climate-changing pollution under the Clean Air Act.

Since then, the agency froze research grants, shrank its workforce, and removed some references to climate change and environmental justice from its website — moves that environmental advocates say send a clear signal: the EPA’s new direction will come at the expense of public health.

Cyrus Reed, conservation director of the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club, said Texas is one of the states that feels EPA policy changes directly because the state has shown little interest in stepping up its environmental enforcement as the federal government scales back.

“If we were a state that was open to doing our own regulations there’d be less impact from these rollbacks,” Reed said. “But we’re not.”

“Now we have an EPA that isn’t interested in enforcing its own rules,” he added.

Richard Richter, a spokesperson at the state’s environmental agency, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, said in a statement that the agency takes protecting public health and natural resources seriously and acts consistently and quickly to enforce federal and state environmental laws when they’re violated.

Methane rules put on pause

A major EPA move centers on methane, a potent greenhouse gas that traps heat far more efficiently than carbon dioxide over the short term. It accounts for roughly 16% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is a major driver of climate change. In the U.S., the largest source of methane emissions is the energy sector, especially in Texas, the nation’s top oil and gas producer.

In 2024, the Biden administration finalized long-anticipated rules requiring oil and gas operators to sharply reduce methane emissions from wells, pipelines, and storage facilities. The rule, developed with industry input, targeted leaks, equipment failures, and routine flaring, the burning off of excess natural gas at the wellhead.

Under the rule, operators would have been required to monitor emissions, inspect sites with gas-imaging cameras for leaks, and phase out routine flaring. States are required to come up with a plan to implement the rule, but Texas has yet to do so. Under Trump’s EPA, that deadline has been extended until January 2027 — an 18-month postponement.

Texas doesn’t have a rule to capture escaping methane emissions from energy infrastructure. Richter, the TCEQ spokesperson, said the agency continues to work toward developing the state plan.

Adrian Shelley, Texas director of the watchdog group Public Citizen, said the rule represented a rare moment of alignment between environmentalists and major oil and gas producers.

“I think the fossil fuel industry generally understood that this was the direction the planet and their industry was moving,” he said. Shelley said uniform EPA rules provided regulatory certainty for changes operators saw as inevitable.

Reed, the Sierra Club conservation director, said the delay of methane rules means Texas still has no plan to reduce emissions, while neighboring New Mexico already has imposed its own state methane emission rules that require the industry to detect and repair methane leaks and ban routine venting and flaring.

These regulations have cut methane emissions in the New Mexico portion of the Permian Basin — the oil-rich area that covers West Texas and southeast New Mexico — to half that of Texas, according to a recent data analysis by the Environmental Defense Fund. That’s despite New Mexico doubling production since 2020.

A retreat from soot standards

Fine particulate matter or PM 2.5, one of six pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act, has been called by researchers the deadliest form of air pollution.

In 2024, the EPA under President Biden strengthened air rules for particulate matter by lowering the annual limit from 12 to 9 micrograms per cubic meter. It was the first update since 2012 and one of the most ambitious pieces of Biden’s environmental agenda, driven by mounting evidence that particulate pollution is linked to premature death, heart disease, asthma, and other respiratory illnesses.

After the rule was issued, 24 Republican-led states, including Kentucky and West Virginia, sued to revert to the weaker standard. Texas filed a separate suit asking to block the rule’s recent expansion.

State agencies are responsible for enforcing the federal standards. The TCEQ is charged with creating a list of counties that exceed the federal standard and submitting those recommendations to Gov. Greg Abbott, who then finalizes the designations and submits them to the EPA.

Under the 9 microgram standard, parts of Texas, including Dallas, Harris (which includes Houston), Tarrant (Fort Worth), and Bowie (Texarkana) counties, were in the process of being designated nonattainment areas — which, when finalized, would trigger a legal requirement for the state to develop a plan to clean up the air.

That process stalled after Trump returned to office. Gov. Greg Abbott submitted his designations to EPA last February, but EPA has not yet acted on his designations, according to Richter, the TCEQ spokesperson.

In a court filing last year, the Trump EPA asked a federal appeals court to vacate the stricter standard, bypassing the traditional notice and comment administrative process.

For now, the rule technically remains in effect, but environmental advocates say the EPA’s retreat undermines enforcement of the rule and signals to polluters that it may be short-lived.

Shelley, with Public Citizen, believes the PM2.5 rule would have delivered the greatest health benefit of any EPA regulation affecting Texas, particularly through reductions in diesel pollution from trucks.

“I still hold out hope that it will come back,” he said.

Unraveling the climate framework

Beyond individual pollutants, the Trump EPA has moved to dismantle the federal architecture for addressing climate change.

Among the proposals is eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which requires power plants, refineries, and oil and gas suppliers to report annual emissions. The proposal has drawn opposition from both environmental groups and industry, which relies on the data for planning and compliance.

Colin Leyden, Texas state director and energy lead at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, said eliminating the program could hurt Texas industry. If methane emissions are no longer reported, then buyers and investors of natural gas, for example, won’t have an official way to measure how much methane pollution is associated with that gas, according to Leyden. That makes it harder to judge how “clean” or “climate-friendly” the product is, which international buyers are increasingly demanding.

“This isn’t just bad for the planet,” he said. “It makes the Texas industry less competitive.”

The administration also proposed last year rescinding the Endangerment Finding, issued in 2009, which obligates the EPA to regulate climate pollution. Most recently, the EPA said it will stop calculating how much money is saved in health care costs as a result of air pollution regulations that curb particulate matter 2.5 and ozone, a component of smog. Both can cause respiratory and health problems.

Leyden said tallying up the dollar value of lives saved when evaluating pollution rules is a foundational principle of the EPA since its creation.

“That really erodes the basic idea that (the EPA) protects health and safety and the environment,” he said.

By 2023, data centers represented 4.4% of total electricity demand.

Challenges of concern include: Sharp forecasted growth, driven in large part by data centers and resulting in projected cost increases and capacity shortfalls.
At the conclusion of the meeting, representatives from the Governors’ offices took the stage to announce a joint statement of intent to create a PJM Governors’ Collaborative, signed by 11 Governors, to develop a PJM Governors’ Collaborative to promote greater state and consumer representation in both decision-making processes at PJM.","The American economy, communities, public health and national security are all dependent on a reliable, affordable and abundant supply of electricity. Electricity is delivered to consumers through a complicated and interconnected network of generators, transmission lines and distribution networks. Thousands of companies contribute to a robust, multi-resourced supply of electricity – from the generators that produce electrons to the electric companies that deliver those electrons where they are needed, not to mention the thousands of contractors and suppliers supporting this critical infrastructure.

Demand for power has remained relatively flat for the last several decades, helping these entities balance supply with demand and mitigate against sharp price increases. However, this era of flat demand appears to be ending, with electricity demand forecasted to grow by 5.7% annually over the next five years – reaching 32% by 2030. This growth is being driven largely by new data centers powering the boom in artificial intelligence (AI). By 2023, data centers represented 4.4% of total electricity demand. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory forecasts that this will grow at an accelerating rate, reaching between 6.7% and 12.0% of total demand by 2028.

While Governors support economic growth in their states, many are concerned about the potential for new costs to supply data centers being shouldered by consumers. Meeting this demand will require an unprecedented and rapid buildout of new generation and transmission infrastructure.

Nowhere is this more apparent than in the mid-Atlantic, where recent auctions for new generating capacity have hit record highs, driven in large part by demand from data centers, according to the regional grid operator, PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM). Even with these record high prices being paid to incentivize new generation, PJM risks not procuring adequate supply to meet demand, with applications for interconnection so backlogged that the queue was temporarily closed to new projects in February 2022. Challenges of concern include:

Sharp forecasted growth, driven in large part by data centers and resulting in projected cost increases and capacity shortfalls.

Constrained new generation, 40 GW of conventional fossil generation at risk of retiring by 2030, and a backlogged queue of projects awaiting interconnection studies, in many cases for multiple years. The Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) reported that projects that became operational in 2025 spent an average of over 8 years getting interconnected.

Questions remain regarding who should pay for the new infrastructure powering new large loads, with concerns that current customers will be saddled with higher costs to power data centers.

Uncertain and variable load forecasts, which add risk and uncertainty to new grid infrastructure investments. This is complicated by growing facility sizes and the emergence of new, gigawatt-scale data centers.[1]

Bipartisan Solutions: Governors Take Action to Fast Track Investment

As electricity prices continue to rise in the region and reliability is threatened, Governors of the PJM states – Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia – came together in a show of bipartisanship to brainstorm solutions and governance reform to better address future needs.

In June 2025, after hearing acute concerns from Governors of both parties, the National Governors Association (NGA) convened representatives from each of the PJM Governors’ offices in Washington, D.C., to discuss regional planning and governance to address rising prices and resource adequacy challenges in the region. At this meeting, Governors’ teams identified three solutions to accelerate reforms in PJM. These included:

States taking a more active role in PJM governance through the appointment of two members of the PJM board;

A state-hosted technical conference with leaders from across the region and nation to identify technical, planning and governance solutions to the region’s energy challenges; and

Exploring the formation of a new “PJM Governors’ Collaborative” to continue bipartisan, executive branch coordination.

Building off the inaugural meeting, 10 out of the 13 Governors drafted and sent letters[2] to the PJM Board of Managers requesting a meeting with the eight members of the Nominating Committee to share their proposal for board seat candidates and encouraged PJM to allow for the state’s input into these two board seats going forward.

On September 22, 2025, with support from NGA and the Great Plains Institute, all 13 states convened a first-of-its-kind PJM Multi-State Technical Conference at the Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. More than 500 participants attended the conference, with an additional 500 attending virtually. Attendees heard directly from Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro in addition to NGA Vice Chair Maryland Governor Wes Moore, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy and Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin. Other speakers included state leaders, PJM leadership, critical stakeholders and experts from across the region. Technical sessions, each of which was moderated by a bipartisan pair of Governors’ office representatives, addressed resource adequacy challenges, innovative solutions to supply and demand constraints, governance lessons learned from across the country, and solutions for governance reform in PJM.

At the conclusion of the meeting, representatives from the Governors’ offices took the stage to announce a joint statement of intent to create a PJM Governors’ Collaborative, signed by 11 Governors, to develop a PJM Governors’ Collaborative to promote greater state and consumer representation in both decision-making processes at PJM.

Latest Actions: Governors and the Administration Issue Joint Principles Regarding PJM

On January 15, all 13 regional Governors joined U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum and U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, both of whom lead President Trump’s Energy Dominance Council, to sign a Statement of Principles Regarding PJM to address ongoing affordability and reliability concerns in PJM.

These principles aim to (1) cut through the backlog of projects pending interconnection and accelerate the speed at which new power comes online, (2) have data centers cover their share of the costs of any new resources, and (3) stem the increase in auction prices to bring affordability back to the PJM region.

More specifically, these principles include:

Trigger a reliability backstop auction by September 2026, an emergency mechanism to procure adequate generation resources to fill the gap left by the last base residual auction (BRA) and put in place a 15-year price guarantee to provide revenue certainty for generators.

Allocate the costs of this additional backstop power to data centers through a two-part process:

The principles direct PJM to allocate the cost of new capacity to load serving entities[3] (LSEs).

Governors agreed to then use their authorities to have state regulators design new, large load rate classes that would allow the LSEs to allocate their share of new generation costs to data centers. Data centers that have procured their own power or agree to curtail their power usage during times of high demand are not expected to shoulder the costs from the Reliability Backstop Auction.

Protect rate payers by continuing the existing price restrictions over to the next two base auctions, intended to freeze prices through 2030.

Refine PJM’s load forecasting projections to only include real new demand,[4] improving the ability of states and the markets to project future power needs and avoid double-counting future energy-users.

Institute a 150-day time limit for interconnection studies, vastly accelerating the interconnection process and bringing PJM into compliance with FERC Order No. 2023, which aimed to accelerate interconnection for electric generation and storage projects.

Meaningfully engage stakeholders to reform the capacity market and return PJM to “market fundamentals” in time for the May 2027 auction.

As a non-binding set of principles, there is much work that remains to be done to ensure success. However, with bipartisan coordination and improved regional governance, Governors will continue working to protect their constituents from increasing electricity rates, develop their states’ economies, and ensure that power remains reliable and affordable into the future.

[1] An analysis by Grid Strategies found that nationwide, aggregated utility forecasts for new demand by 2030 were potentially overstated by as much as 40%, with utilities collectively projecting 90 GW of new power demand and other analysts projecting closer to 65 GW.

[2] Nine Governors signed the initial letter to the PJM Board of Governors. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine followed with a letter of his own supporting the previous, multi-Governor letter.

It also raises concerns about resource adequacy and reliability, as slower renewable integration affects capacity planning and readiness for peak demand.
To more actively participate in the future of clean energy tax incentives, join the Renewable Energy Working Group, bringing bipartisan industry stakeholders together to drive policy on the clean energy transition.","The deployment of clean energy will be essential for meeting the historic electricity demand surge, which is forecasted to require more than 150 gigawatts (GWs) in additional capacity within five years, by 2030, according to Grid Strategies’ November 2025 report. The explosive growth of artificial intelligence (AI), reshoring of heavy industry to build up American manufacturing, increasing electrification and the planned retiring of aging energy generation facilities necessitate this new generation be added as quickly as possible across the country.

The federal extension of operations of fossil generation facilities planning to retire, namely coal plants, have in fact only increased costs and prolonged emissions. A significant expansion of generation will require modernization and all available, economically viable resources. A diverse, efficient, well-regulated and affordable energy mix will bring down costs while supporting the data centers necessary for the race to develop AI and strengthen U.S. national, economic and energy security.

Low-cost zero-emissions renewable resources that can be promptly deployed are a critical element of this framework. Solar, wind and battery storage facilities can be sited closer to or within communities because of their flexible scalability and site engineering and lack of emissions. Facilities can be tailored to a variety of locations, such as agrivoltaics solar farms and canopy and rooftop solar in more urban environments and including brownfield sites. However, a significant barrier stands in the way. Delays in processing new generation facilities in the grid interconnection queues are a systemic challenge that is severely inhibiting a vast capacity of proposed renewable generation from coming online. Continued delays only hinder U.S. energy, economic and national security ambitions.

Interconnection Queues are Hindering Clean Energy

Interconnection queues are a critical part of the clean energy ecosystem in the United States. It refers to the process by which new energy generation facilities request permission to connect to the transmission grid. Regional grid operators, known as Independent System Operators (ISOs) and Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs), and utilities are responsible for managing these queues. Their role is to ensure that new projects can be safely and reliably integrated into the grid, but the procedures for doing so have become increasingly complex and time-consuming.

In recent years, the scale of the backlog in these interconnection queues has reached unprecedented levels. As of the end of 2023, an astonishing 2,600 GWs (2.6 terawatts) of proposed generation and storage projects were waiting for grid access, with typical wait times stretching to five years or more. More than 95% of this queued capacity consists of zero-carbon resources, including solar (1,080 GW), battery storage (1,030 GW) and wind (366 GW). Delays in connecting these resources not only slow the transition to clean energy but also compromise U.S. energy security and hinder the nation’s ability to compete in the global AI race, particularly against China.

The interconnection queue backlog is rooted in several longstanding structural challenges. Traditionally, a first-come, first-served process has allowed speculative facilities to occupy queue positions ahead of those ready to build, incentivizing “queue clogging” and slowing progress. The absence of standardized, transparent data and processes has further lengthened study timelines and complicated coordination among stakeholders. Transmission system limitations and mismatches in regional planning often mean that grid expansion lags behind actual resource interconnection needs. Additionally, regulatory and procedural inefficiencies, such as inconsistencies across ISOs and RTOs and a lack of clear penalties for delays, have compounded the problem, making it harder for renewable energy projects to move forward efficiently.

Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s annual interconnection review, published in December 2025, found that while queue capacity dropped for the first time in 2024, it was not solely due to increased efficiency. Though record amounts of large-scale solar (31 GWs) and battery storage (11 GWs) completed interconnection and began operating, new solar and battery storage capacity entering the queue declined sharply along with an increase in withdrawals. Solar and battery storage declined by 47% and 32%, respectively, and a record 112 GWs of solar and storage capacity combined withdrew from the queue in 2024 due to factors like political uncertainty, high interest rates, tariffs and local permitting challenges. The decrease in backlogged capacity then, is also equally due to the impacts of other regulatory and political externalities taking their toll on the renewable energy industry, in addition to some gains in queue processing speed. There is therefore still work to be done to truly address interconnection and the significant capacity stalled in the queues.

FERC’s Order No. 2023 was a Major Step but there is More to Do

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) Order No. 2023, “Improvements to Generator Interconnection Procedures and Agreements,” issued in 2023, marked a significant advancement in reforming generator interconnection procedures and agreements, aiming to reduce backlogs and improve project timelines. The rule introduced a cluster study process to evaluate groups of projects together, firm deadlines and penalties for transmission providers that miss study deadlines, and stronger financial and site control requirements to discourage speculative projects. Advanced technology integration, such as improved storage modeling, was also emphasized. The subsequent Order 2023-A reaffirmed most reforms and set compliance deadlines for transmission providers in 2024, with FERC now reviewing and approving proposals. Some grid operators, like the California ISO (CAISO), have reported reduced interconnection study delays, while others remain in negotiations with FERC to finalize effective reforms.

Despite the progress made by Order 2023, it is widely recognized as not sufficient alone, as it primarily addresses process improvements rather than the underlying lack of transmission capacity. Industry experts and FERC have described the order as setting a floor but not a ceiling for interconnection reform. Persistent challenges include lagging data transparency and queue visibility, which could be improved through better dashboards and metrics. Future reforms could draw from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Interconnection Innovation e-Xchange (i2X) initiative, designed to complement and extend beyond Order 2023, with ideas such as enhanced coordination of affected system studies, additional data transparency requirements, queue processing automation and refined infrastructure cost-sharing among clustered projects. Crucially, interconnection reform must be paired with transmission modernization and expansion, including grid-enhancing technologies, to ensure renewables can reach demand centers efficiently.

In 2023, FERC also issued Order 901 (Docket No. RM22-12-000), “Reliability Standards to Address Inverter-Based Resources.” In response the North American Electric Reliability Corporation proposed reliability standards which the Commission approved in July 2025. The Commission issued Order 1920 in 2024, “Building for the Future Through Electric Regional Transmission Planning and Cost Allocation,” as amended, requiring transmission providers address how they conduct long-term planning for regional facilities and determine how to pay for them, and Order 909 in July 2025 (Docket No. RM25-3-000), “Reliability Standards for Frequency and Voltage Protection Settings and Ride-Through for Inverter-Based Resources.” Order 909 building on Order 901. While these orders have begun to illicit progress, further facilitation for building intra- and interregional transmission capacity is needed to accelerate renewable integration.

The backlog’s consequences are far-reaching, slowing capital deployment, increasing costs and discouraging investment in renewables. It also raises concerns about resource adequacy and reliability, as slower renewable integration affects capacity planning and readiness for peak demand. For consumers, the impact is tangible, slow interconnection processes, such as those seen in PJM, the largest RTO in the country, have driven up interconnection charges, making clean energy less affordable. As Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) and many others have noted, the interconnection process in PJM, serving more than 65 million people across 13 east coast states and Washington, D.C., has become drastically untenable. Projects that became operational in 2025 spent an average of eight years in the queue waiting to connect. PJM runs its auctions, however, on a two- to three-year forward-looking basis. New generation simply cannot respond fast enough to new demand and the pace of the capacity auctions. PJM’s cumbersome process, skyrocketing interconnection requests, surging demand (due in large part to data centers) and retiring assets, have caused prices to soar.

The PJM July 2025 capacity auction prices soared from about $29 per megawatt (MW)-day for the entire region for the 2024 to 2025 Delivery Year (DY) to about $270 per MW-day for DY 2025 to 2026 everywhere except two zones which cleared at about $466 and $444 per MW-day. Prices for DY 2026 to 2027 hit the FERC cap of $329 per MW-day for the entire PJM footprint. A 22% rise for most zones except for the same two zones, which would have been priced even higher but actually experienced a price decrease due to the cap. Analysis published in October 2025 commissioned by GridLab and executed by Aurora Energy Research concluded that if just 10% of the 107 GWs of land-based renewables in the queue before 2024 had been built in time for the 2026 to 2027 auction, this would have added 1.5 GWs in net supply to the auction and saved PJM consumers $3.5 billion in costs.

The Midcontinent ISO (MISO) in the Midwest saw an even larger price increase earlier this year. The price for summer 2025 shot up to $666.50 per MW-day from just $30.00 per MW-day in summer 2024. Consumers are starting to feel the effects of tightened supply and the significant, accumulating price increases in the markets across the country. According to the Energy Information Administration’s Electricity Monthly Update, which tracks supplies and pricing and reports national-level metrics, the 2024 to 2025 year-over-year change in the national average residential retail electricity price likely peaked in September 2025, based on the data available so far through October 2025, reaching a 7.4% increase from September 2025. The prior summer months were not far behind. August 2025 was up 6.1%, July was up 5.2% and June was up 6.6%. The data for October shows that cooler temperatures somewhat tempered demand but the average still grew 5.2% since 2024.

PJM held another capacity auction in December 2025 for DY 2027 to 2028. The auction concluded at the price cap again and also failed to secure enough capacity to meet the reliability criterion of maintaining a 20% reserve margin during a one‑in‑10‑year event, procuring only a 14.8% reserve margin.

Proposed Interconnection Reforms

Across these analyses of U.S. grid interconnection, stakeholders converge on a set of reform recommendations aimed at speeding access to the grid, reducing cost and uncertainty, and better aligning interconnection with broader transmission planning and clean-energy deployment. Experts stress that while cluster study reforms and strengthened queue requirements provide an important baseline, further structural reforms are needed. This includes proactive rather than reactionary planning, enhanced data transparency, queue automation, better coordination of “affected system” studies, and refinements to how network upgrade costs are allocated to meaningfully reduce the massive backlog and integrate renewables more efficiently.

Another January 2025 Lawrence Berkeley Lab analysis highlights the need to tighten linkages between long-term transmission planning and the project-level interconnection process so that the grid can accommodate burgeoning clean energy and storage queues without imposing excessive costs or delays on developers. Increased transparency of interconnection outcomes and costs, better data for monitoring process health, and stronger integration of transmission planning into interconnection decisions emerge as key recommendations.

Similarly, the previously noted November 2025 RMI analysis of PJM, “PJM’s Speed to Power Problem and How to Fix It,” identifies practical reforms to shorten study timelines and reduce costs. Recommendations include deploying modern third-party automation and software tools to accelerate interconnection studies, reforming the Energy Resource Interconnection Service (ERIS) process to be a truly faster and lower-cost pathway, rigorously considering advanced and grid-enhancing technologies in network upgrade planning, and prioritizing proactive rather than ad hoc planning and analysis. These reforms are aimed at further unleashing thousands of queued projects and alleviating the cost and reliability pressures caused by long interconnection delays.

Collectively, experts are advocating for reforms that go beyond the FERC rules so far to improve transparency, further develop and integrate planning processes, adopt new technologies and automation, and redesign underlying cost-allocation and study methodologies so that the interconnection process can more reliably and affordably bring new energy resources online.

Permitting Reform in Congress is an Opportunity

Permitting reform has been a focal point for the last few Congress’ and is atop the agenda once again at the start of the second session of the 119th Congress, presenting a policy window to address interconnection, transmission buildout, and permitting challenges in a comprehensive manner for both clean and traditional energy generation. Ever increasing industry angst and urgency is now coupled with a nationwide affordability crisis going into midterm elections in November 2026. Skyrocketing electricity costs have made the situation even more dire and the stakes higher for reaching a deal that could bring down costs.

The primary legislative vehicle, the SPEED Act, H.R. 4776, led by House Natural Resources (HNR) Committee Chair Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, could significantly unlock renewable energy deployment if it also incorporates interconnection and transmission reforms into the final version. Streamlined and aligned permitting and interconnection processes paired with expedited transmission buildout and modernization would bring critical, stalled capacity online to stabilize the grid and bring down costs.

The House passed the SPEED Act Dec. 18, marking a significant step forward. While the bill was amended to address concerns from anti-offshore wind factions, allowing the administration to pursue legal action against previously approved projects, it still garnered bipartisan support, with 11 Democrats voting in favor. HNR chair Westerman hailed the passage as a bipartisan achievement, building momentum as the Senate prepares to take up the issue in the new year.

A counterproposal from a bipartisan group of House members, Reps. Scott Peters, D-California; Gabe Evans, R-Colorado; Gabe Vasquez, D-New Mexico; and Andrew Garbarino, R-New York, seeks to again propose protections for projects that are delayed by agencies and for final permitting decisions. The CERTAIN Act, a discussion draft, proposes shielding lawfully issued permits from being overturned due to political decisions and enhancing permitting certainty by enabling court challenges against agencies that miss deadlines or review milestones. It would require agencies to publicly disclose and justify any permit delays.

Addressing permitting interference and delays are the top priorities for Democrats as the SPEED Act advances to the Senate for negotiations. Democratic members have also released other proposals that lay out more of their priorities, which include recommendations for reforming interconnection and transmission processes and incentivizing deployment. Rep. Peters introduced his SPEED and Reliability Act of 2025, H.R. 5600, while Reps. Sean Casten, D-Illinois, and Mike Levin, D-California, introduced a broader package, the Cheap Energy Act, as a discussion draft in September 2025. The SPEED and Reliability Act focuses on transmission expansion while the Cheap Energy Act seeks to address transmission as well as delayed and expensive interconnections, reinstatement of energy tax credits, affordability, modernization, supply chains, public land deployment, wildfire security and community engagement. These proposals lay the groundwork for negotiating further possible reforms such as how interconnection queues are managed and transmission modernization and expansion could be expedited.

Looking ahead, the Senate’s Environment and Public Works Chair Shelley Moore Capito, R-West Virginia, has signaled interest in further strengthening protections for project permits for all types of energy. Industry groups and Democrats are advocating for the Senate to bolster safeguards for both existing and new projects, supporting grid reliability and investment.

However, the administration’s attempted cancellations and pauses of offshore wind facility permits, as well as heightened restrictions for renewable energy deployment on public lands through the U.S. Department of the Interior and restricted funding for rural renewable energy through the U.S. Department of Agriculture, discussed in this previous Notes from Novogradac post, have complicated negotiations. Democrats have communicated that reversing and preventing future permit cancellations and lifting the restrictions on public land deployment are a requirement for any bipartisan deal. The CERTAIN Act discussion draft will lay a bipartisan foundation for continued discussion. Key senators anticipate robust but difficult bipartisan negotiations ahead, emphasizing the need for certainty and durable solutions for energy producers.

To more actively participate in the future of clean energy tax incentives, join the Renewable Energy Working Group, bringing bipartisan industry stakeholders together to drive policy on the clean energy transition.

The energy equation,Pedro Casas Alatriste,,,,,https://mexiconewsdaily.com/opinion/opinion-could-mexico-make-america-great-again-the-energy-equation/,"Today, Mexico exports more than $620 billion, with oil representing just 3.5% of the total, while manufacturing accounts for nearly 90%.
This transformation has tied Mexico and the United States together through energy flows that are structural, not optional.

Mutual benefits embedded in infrastructure As documented by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, this integration is neither temporary nor marginal.
Mexico is not peripheral to U.S. energy security — it is central to it.","Energy may be the most foundational pillar behind everything we’ve discussed so far: re-industrialization, nearshoring, AI and North American competitiveness. You don’t run factories, servers or supply chains without reliable, scalable and affordable power. Energy isn’t a side story — it’s the operating system of modern economic activity.

Mexico’s role in this system is often framed through an outdated oil lens.

Forty years ago, that framing made sense. In 1982, Mexico exported roughly $24 billion, and almost 65% of that was crude oil. Today, Mexico exports more than $620 billion, with oil representing just 3.5% of the total, while manufacturing accounts for nearly 90%. In other words, Mexico’s economy has transformed from being oil-dependent to manufacturing-driven — and manufacturing is, above all, energy-intensive.

This transformation has tied Mexico and the United States together through energy flows that are structural, not optional.

Natural gas: The backbone of integration

Looking only at imports, the integration is even clearer: virtually all of the natural gas Mexico imports — over 99% — arrives via pipeline from the United States, reflecting a high degree of physical and commercial interdependence between the two energy systems, particularly U.S. producers in Texas, for whom Mexico has become a critical and stable export outlet.

Natural gas now anchors Mexico’s electricity generation, industrial production, and export manufacturing — much of which directly supports U.S. supply chains.

Refined products & crude: A circulatory system

The result is clear: under many trade measures, the United States now runs an energy surplus with Mexico, meaning the value of U.S. energy exports to Mexico exceeds the value of Mexican energy exports to the U.S. This surplus supports U.S. GDP, sustains jobs in energy production and refining, and strengthens America’s position in global energy markets.

Mutual benefits embedded in infrastructure

As documented by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, this integration is neither temporary nor marginal. Pipeline shipments of U.S. natural gas to Mexico have increased by an order of magnitude since the early 2000s, and today the majority of U.S. pipeline exports flow south of the border rather than overseas.

U.S.-Mexico Border Crossing Natural Gas Pipelines and Expansions of Mexico’s Domestic Pipelines

Why policy certainty matters

This is why energy policy cannot be an afterthought in debates about economic strategy or geopolitical competition. Mexico is not peripheral to U.S. energy security — it is central to it. American energy production, refining, and export capacity are increasingly linked to Mexican demand, infrastructure, and industrial growth. Likewise, Mexico’s ability to sustain its manufacturing base and capture nearshoring opportunities depends on continued access to U.S. energy and predictable investment conditions.

If the United States wants to remain an energy powerhouse, it cannot do so alone. It’s not just about drilling in Texas or New Mexico — it’s about smart partnerships, strong trade frameworks and working closely with reliable neighbors.

Seen this way, energy fits naturally with the other themes in this series. If AI is the brain of the future economy, energy is the bloodstream. And today, that bloodstream flows across North America.

State. Sen. Eric Koch, R-Bedford, authored Senate Bill 258, which would make changes to the state code about how the Indiana Department of Environmental Management issues permits to nuclear-powered generating facilities and fuel processing plants.

The changes include repealing a prohibition from constructing or operating a nuclear facility without an IDEM permit and repealing the authorization for the commissioner to conduct a public hearing on environmental effects. The bill would require the facility operator to file an environmental feasibility report to IDEM.

Senators had no discussion on Senate Bill 258 on Tuesday. No amendments were made to the bill.

Alex Goodnight, deputy legislative director for IDEM, previously said the bill makes common sense changes to Indiana Code and eliminates “outdated and unnecessary provisions,” according to Post-Tribune archives.

“These proposed changes reflect existing laws and establish appropriate division of responsibilities between the state and Nuclear Regulatory Commission,” Goodnight said. “The federal government maintains exclusive authority over radiological safety and the construction and operation of nuclear facilities under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.”

According to its website, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission was created in 1974 and ensures the safe use of radioactive materials for “beneficial civilian purposes” and protects people and the environment. The commission regulates commercial nuclear power plants and other uses of nuclear materials.

State laws conflict with and are preempted by the Atomic Energy Act, according to Post-Tribune archives.

Gov. Mike Braun has been dedicated to bringing nuclear power to the state. In November 2025, Braun announced that First American Nuclear would bring its headquarters, manufacturing facilities and an energy park to Indiana, according to Post-Tribune archives.

First American Nuclear is dedicated to building small modular reactors, or SMRs, which are advanced nuclear reactors that have about one-third the generating capacity of traditional nuclear reactors, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.

A First American Nuclear spokesperson told the Post-Tribune in November that the company is looking for sites for its corporate headquarters, manufacturing facility and energy park, but none have been decided yet. Construction for the manufacturing and energy park sites is expected to start in 2028.

Some activists have expressed concerns with nuclear power, saying that it might not meet energy demands and might not be as clear as nuclear power companies say.

“Indiana has no experience whatsoever operating nuclear facilities,” Kerwin Olson, executive director of the Citizens Action Coalition, previously said. “We have great concerns about eviscerating the abilities of (IDEM).”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ctc-l-nuclear-plant.jpg?w=1024&h=752,N,,2026-01-21 16:00:16.997820

Nestled in a redwood forest atop a hill overlooking the Pacific Ocean, UC Santa Cruz stands out not just for its remarkable setting, but for its unconventional approach to research and higher education. Since its inception 60 years ago, the university consistently strives to support socially-engaged collaborations between traditionally distinct disciplines.

“I think it’s the Santa Cruz spirit,” said Jennifer Parker, professor of art and founding director of OpenLab, a collaborative research center supporting interdisciplinary innovation in the arts, sciences, and technology. “This campus has always celebrated its difference,” she said. “There’s a freedom in shaping something new, rather than fitting in.”

Where some institutions might have shirked that reputation, UCSC leaned in, rewarding professors for creative, interdisciplinary research and education and encouraging student activism. The result can be seen in UCSC’s rich ecosystem of art and science collaborations that are addressing some of the biggest challenges facing society today. That includes climate change, the effects of which Santa Cruz is already feeling, with forests on fire, streets flooding, and roads washing away into the sea.

Facing a challenge as big as the climate crisis requires new ways of thinking and seeing. Though their disciplines are conventionally seen as distinct, artists and scientists alike ask questions, make observations, and interpret findings. Where science systematically and empirically investigates to draw conclusions, art engages and moves people through felt expression. Art can transform raw data or an abstract idea into a tangible, viscerally understandable experience. Together, art and science can drive collective action and reshape our understanding of how we interact with the world around us, and each other.

From a 15-foot augmented reality sculpture of a global ocean current to imaginative visual interpretations of marine mammal vocalizations, here are some of the visionary art and science collaborations flourishing at UCSC.

Jennifer Parker and Karolina Karlic

When UCSC’s Genomics Institute building opened in 2019, Parker and Karolina Karlic, associate professor of art, merged their passions for socially engaged art to create Intersecting Data Fields, an installation and gallery space in the new building. Using photography — an important tool for both science and art that transforms the way we see the world — the two envisioned a site-specific installation together where Karlic made portraits of the Institute’s scientists and photographed objects that had personal significance to them. Together, Parker and Karlic collaborated on the conceptual framework for the project where Parker’s sculptural pieces and Karlic’s photography converged, hanging throughout the halls of the building. The works explore the impacts of the Institute’s research and the diversity of the people doing it.

Parker launched OpenLab to dissolve barriers between disciplines, giving artists opportunities to tell stories that spark curiosity and build empathy for ideas like environmental change. With a practice rooted in sculpture and new media, she ran the experimental Mechatronics research group from 2009-2016, integrating mechanical, electronic, and information technologies to create multimedia art. One of Parker’s current projects is The Algae Society, a bioart and design lab composed of an international group of artists, scientists, and designers creating work — like a stop motion animation inspired by two scientists’ desert ecology and algal research in Joshua Tree National Park, or blown glass sculptures of intricate seaweed forms reimagined by AI — to expand people’s understanding of the interdependence of all life on this rapidly changing planet.

Karlic, who is also the art and science director of the Kenneth S. Norris Center for Natural History, aims to bring art and science research together to explore our relationship to place in the post-Industrialized world. As the founding director of Unseen California, she leads a research initiative and artist in residence program that integrates arts, sciences, and humanities to explore environmental and social issues across California. Based in the UC Natural Reserve System, the largest network of field stations in the world, Unseen California supports field-based arts research, teaching, public programming, and the creation of site-specific artworks that highlight the state’s cultural and ecological landscapes.

California’s creative capital spans from fashion and film, to agriculture, and technology. “It’s enormous, and I think we’re just starting to recognize that,” Parker said. “The role that art plays within a research institute as creative capital for understanding knowledge is huge.”

Karlic has already seen the impact of this shift in interdisciplinary thinking on students using archives and ecological field research to redefine what arts field research can be. As the director of the Graduate Studies Environmental Art + Social Practice MFA program, she has also seen a growing support network of faculty in the Environmental Studies, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, and Humanities who want to engage with the arts in a more direct manner.

Art is more than just a commodity that belongs in galleries, Karlic said. “I think of these interdisciplinary collaborations as a way of changing the siloed ways of thinking current western culture is structured and addressing some of the most pressing questions of our time with a multitude of perspectives which are in my opinion our only way forward .”

micha cárdenas

An augmented reality video game, a science fiction novel, a 3D-printed conceptual particle accelerator — micha cárdenas’ work transcends mediums, disciplines, and boundaries. As the director of Critical Realities Studio, a hybrid studio/lab for critical theory and art practice, and professor of performance, play and design, and professor of critical race and ethnic studies, cárdenas’ multidisciplinary work focuses on virtual and augmented reality, critical race and ethnic studies, environmental justice, digital arts and media, gender studies, and transgender theory. The questions that unite cardenas’ practice and guide her work come from studying not just science and theory, but also activism.

cárdenas was inspired to create her latest project after reading a 2022 scientific paper stating that just 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming above pre-industrial levels would set off a series of catastrophic ecological tipping points. “It was something I just wanted to shout from the rooftops,” said cárdenas. “It’s important for artists to be doing work about climate change or engaging with different questions in science because most people are not reading scientific journals,” she said, “and I wanted everyone to know that we are on this very dangerous precipice.”

In 2023, cárdenas created The Probability Engine: Using Augmented Reality and 3D Printing to Envision Futures of Resilience to Sea Level Rise — one of 15 projects to receive a pilot grant from the Center for Coastal and Climate Resilience which funds research projects, collaborations, and creative works that address coastal climate-related impacts and solutions. The Probability Engine uses augmented reality to imagine possible realities based on the various degrees of temperature above pre-industrial levels. “With the probability engine, I’m asking, how do we envision futures of climate justice that can help us build resilience, in particular here on the California coast?” she said.

One work in the series is Atlantic Overturning, a 15-foot tall undulating sculpture depicting the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a vast global current that defines global temperatures, carrying warm water from the South to the North hemisphere, and is on the verge of collapsing and reversing as soon as this year. The sculpture debuted last Fall at Toronto’s Nuit Blanche, the city’s annual all-night contemporary art festival that attracts more than 1 million attendees, according to attendance reports, which is a lot of people who are probably encountering this vital issue for the first time, cárdenas said. It was exhibited at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center in October.

Sin Sol similarly interrogates the impacts of climate change via an augmented reality video game cárdenas designed, wrote, and directed. The game won the 2020 Impact Award at the Indiecade festival of independent games. Guided by a trans latinx AI hologram, players can find, see, and hear a story told through poetry about living through climate change-induced wildfires. The work came out of cárdenas’ own experience living through wildfires in Seattle and thinking about how wildfires disproportionately harm certain groups of people, like trans people, immigrants, and disabled people.

cárdenas draws on the lineage of UCSC alum and faculty emeritus Donna Haraway who founded the field of feminist science studies and asked important questions about science itself, like who decides what questions are allowed to be investigated, and what questions get funded?

“Often, science reflects the hegemonic values of society,” said cárdenas. “As an artist approaching science, I can bring different values, like queer and trans liberation or gender and racial justice, to how I think about science, and not be restricted by the influences science is usually restricted by.”

Ari Friedlaender and Rachel Nelson

Professor Ari Friedlaender teamed up with director and chief curator of the Institute of the Arts and Sciences, Rachel Nelson, to create An Aesthetics of Resilience, a multi-year interdisciplinary initiative working with artists from local and Indigenous communities in California to explore how scientists study and communicate the impacts of climate change through the lens of marine mammals. The project includes research, artworks, and a series of exhibitions, the first one exhibited at the IAS in Spring 2025, and is supported by a $2 million grant from the California Climate Action Seed Grant.

The Institute of the Arts and Sciences is an interdisciplinary hub that brings together artists, scientists, and scholars to engage with urgent social and environmental issues. Through exhibitions, public events, acclaimed and emerging artist residencies, and collaborations with UCSC faculty and students, the IAS fosters creative, cross-disciplinary approaches to research and public engagement.

“Science hits a bit of a ceiling if we keep it in our scientific communities,” Friedlander said, “and if we’re interested in studying animals and ecosystems that need protection, we need to be able to communicate our science and the things that we think are important to broad audiences.”

Part of the grant supports Friedlander’s lab in conducting three distinct research projects focused on marine mammals and climate change. PhD student Chloe Liu is working with an Indigenous community in Prince William Sound, Alaska, using underwater microphones to track the timing and distribution of marine mammals based on their vocalizations. This research will help the community understand where animals are throughout the year, how changing environmental conditions impact their movements, and what that means for their ability to hunt and fish these traditional food sources.

Postdoc Natalia Botero-Acosta is tracking migrating humpback whales to better understand how whales use the California coastline, how their migration corridors overlap with human activities like vessel traffic and noise pollution, and how climate change may be affecting their habitats. The third project, led by postdoc Logan Pauline in collaboration with researchers across California, will collect and analyze tissue samples from sea otters, California sea lions, and humpback whales to assess the impact of environmental contaminants on marine ecosystems and the species that depend on them.

Friedlander and Nelson are collaborating with several artists, like Imani Jacqueline Brown, Christine Howard Sandoval, and Carolina Caycedo, who are working with the scientists to create art that reflects the research findings. The result will be a series of exhibitions at IAS.

To Friedlander, An Aesthetics of Resilience demonstrates that there are very tangible ways art and science can work together to create something greater than the sum of its parts. Working with artists allows scientists to unlock from traditionally rigid experimental design structures and ask new and different kinds of questions, he said. “At UC Santa Cruz, we have a lot of freedom to to try new things, to experiment, and to not think of these diversifications as a watering down, but as enhancement of our collective impact.”",https://news.ucsc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Seaweed-Wallpaper-2-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 16:00:12.608170

Heading into President Donald Trump’s second term, coal looked like an industry nearing the end of its life. Utilities planned to retire more than half of the nation’s coal-fired power plants by 2028, no new facilities were coming online, and production had been flat for years.

Trump’s first year back in office has given the industry an opportunity to retrench. The president is an avowed supporter of coal, and his Department of Energy has repeatedly intervened to prevent plants from shutting down. At the same time, a Trump-supported boom in the construction of artificial intelligence data centers has led to a surging need for power, prompting many utilities to postpone coal facility closures.

The combination of federal intervention and rising energy demand may have stalled coal’s decline, at least for the moment. Consumption increased 13 percent last year, reversing a long downward slide and causing a bump in domestic carbon emissions. Of the 11 coal-fired plants slated for retirement last year, just two shuttered. But one of them may return: A Utah facility closed in November after losing its primary customer, but the legislature hopes to save it by finding another buyer. Many of the utilities that committed to shutdowns over the next two years have abandoned those plans.

The administration has combined this effort to prop up coal with delays and rollbacks of rules governing pollution and miner safety, actions central to its heavily pro-coal agenda of “Unleashing American Energy.”

Still, these efforts may not reverse a decline that started nearly 20 years ago. The nation’s aging coal plants — more than 200 in all — are increasingly expensive to run, even as methane, more commonly known as natural gas, and solar become cheaper and more abundant. And although the Trump administration has promised to boost employment, layoffs have continued amid the industry’s ongoing contraction.

Coal may see a short-term reprieve, but experts see little hope of a lasting revival. “When you have to get the government to step in to put its thumb on the scale in order to help your industry,” said Sean Feaster of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, “it’s a sign that you’re not particularly competitive, right?”

Chris Wright, a former fracking executive, has played a central role in this revival by turning the Department of Energy into an industry lifeline. He has issued emergency orders delaying the retirement of at least five of the 11 plants slated for closure, and has renewed them every 90 days. That has sparked legal challenges, drawn scrutiny from regulators, and could saddle utilities and ratepayers with millions in added costs.

Wright argues that keeping them open is necessary to avoid blackouts and price spikes. Few beyond his agency are convinced. Environmental groups, energy experts, and state regulators have accused the department of misrepresenting data in its emergency claims.

“It’s just not justified,” said Michael Goggin, an analyst with Grid Strategies. “They’re grasping at what they can.” He has studied the impact of the emergency orders on behalf of Earthjustice and other groups suing to contest the delay order Wright issued in May for the J.H. Campbell coal power plant in Michigan.

Goggin warns the orders could impose significant costs on utilities. He estimates that keeping all of the various fossil fuel plants slated for retirement through 2028 open could cost ratepayers as much as $6 billion — on top of a $6 billion increase in coal-fired generation costs from 2021 to 2024. He calls the extra expense an involuntary subsidy paid by ratepayers to utilities that neither needed nor requested them.

“You’re making [the utilities] keep these plants that most likely they’re not going to need, and are very likely a waste of money,” he said. While plants like Campbell still generate a positive return from selling power, high maintenance costs make them unprofitable. That’s why many utilities have replaced them with methane or renewables.

Under the DOE orders, plant operators can seek approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to recover these costs from customers. Campbell’s owner, for instance, will spread the expense across millions of ratepayers in the Midwest. Other utilities, however, may struggle. A representative of Colorado’s Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, a rural co-op, said the organization has no idea how it will pay the expenses associated with a federal order to keep its coal plant in northwest Colorado running.

“We have no information available yet on cost recovery,” the representative said. “At this time, there is not a clear path for doing so.”

The Department of Energy did not respond to requests for comment.

Other utilities are postponing closures to meet projected demand from AI data centers. There have been at least half a dozen such delays by investor-owned utilities in the Southeast. The largest of them in Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, and Mississippi have retooled their investment plans over the last two years, pushing planned retirements into the 2030s.

Trump and Wright have endorsed this trend, arguing that coal should play a key role in powering these energy-hungry facilities. In an April executive order intended to revitalize the industry, Trump declared, “Our Nation’s beautiful clean coal resources will be critical to meeting the rise in electricity demand due to the resurgence of domestic manufacturing and the construction of artificial intelligence data processing centers.”

The situation is most extreme in Virginia, which is home to more than 600 of these operations and handles 70 percent of the world’s internet traffic. Experts believe the surge in power demand will force Dominion Energy to import more energy from fossil fuel plants beyond the state, extending the life of polluting facilities in Ohio and West Virginia.

“That region is pretty constrained in terms of supply, so that additional electricity is coming from … additional coal-fired electricity,” said Joe DeCarolis, former head of the Energy Information Administration and now a professor of engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. According to his analysis, “there’s 25 gigawatts of this aging and costly coal capacity that [will continue] to operate to meet the incremental demand that’s coming from data centers” through 2030.

In South Carolina, for instance, the utility Santee Cooper said it would need to push the closure of its Winyah Generation Plant in Georgetown from 2028 to the mid-2030s so it can meet demand from data center development. The plant has received numerous state citations for violating air emissions of sulfur dioxide and has been criticized for operating with expired wastewater discharge permits.

“I think they’re responding to market conditions and political atmosphere, and the political atmosphere is creating the market conditions,” said Marilyn Hemingway, the head of the Gullah Geechee Chamber of Commerce, who lives in Georgetown a few miles from the plant.

Hemingway is a member of a state-mandated transition council overseeing the shutdown of Winyah and Santee Cooper’s other coal assets. She said the utility has repeatedly delayed closing the plant and has yet to decide what energy source will replace coal.

“I’m not naive about this at all,” she said. “I know you have to replace it, but I find it problematic because it’s dragging this transition out.”

Living near coal plants like these may become more dangerous because of Trump’s interventions. Even as the Department of Energy has moved to keep such operations open, the Environmental Protection Agency has rolled back a suite of rules governing their air and water pollution. Over the past year, the agency repealed limits on mercury and other toxic pollutants, scrapped greenhouse gas limits, and extended deadlines allowing coal plants to dump waste, called coal ash, in unlined pits — a move that spared 11 facilities from imminent shutdown. Meanwhile, the Department of the Interior opened 13 million acres of public land for mining.

Emily Arthen, CEO of the American Coal Council, said such regulations were onerous, unnecessary, and contributed to coal’s decline. “Doing the right thing without having to be told is forefront for the industry,” she said, adding that minimal oversight allows the industry to preserve jobs.

Some miners and their families feel the sector hasn’t taken much initiative with regard to worker safety. They are particularly frustrated by the administration’s inaction on a regulation limiting exposure to silica dust, a carcinogen that causes a chronic, fatal condition called silicosis but known more commonly as black lung disease. The rule, finalized during the Biden administration after decades of advocacy, remains stuck in limbo even as the number of cases of the terminal condition skyrockets among young miners.

Vonda Robinson, vice president of the National Black Lung Association, said her only option is to keep fighting. She and her husband John Robinson, a retired coal miner, feel betrayed by an administration whose coal production goals they initially supported. Over the past year threats to mine safety offices and layoffs at the federal agency that runs black lung screenings disrupted protections for miners. Vonda Robinson even wrote to Vice President J.D. Vance, urging him to confront the epidemic. She never received a response.

“If we don’t take care of those miners that’s in there now, we’re not gonna have coal, we’re not gonna have a coal industry,” Robinson said. Her husband, who is awaiting evaluation for a double lung transplant, said he felt abandoned by the industry that fed his family.

“The coal miner’s your workhorse,” he said of the industry’s attitude toward men like him. “When you fall over dead, we’re gonna get another horse.”

Efforts to spur new coal extraction, meanwhile, are faltering. When the Interior Department opened public lands to mining, bids came in below market rate, and three projects in the West collapsed within a month. With no new coal-fired plants planned, the market for thermal coal they burn — much of it mined in the West — remains bleak. So does the market for metallurgical coal, used to make steel, which comprises most coal mined in the Eastern U.S.

Coal mining employment held relatively steady in 2025; the mining workforce stands at around 40,000 workers, less than a quarter of its size in the 1980s. But Erin Bates, communications director for the United Mine Workers of America, warned of trouble ahead. China has stopped importing metallurgical coal used to make steel, undercutting demand for ore mined largely in Appalachia. Overall coal exports fell 14 percent between January and September 2025, and international demand is expected to plateau in the coming years as renewable energy continues to expand; coal power generation fell in both China and India last year after rising for decades.

“It’s something that will trickle down,” Bates said. “The end result is, if they can’t export this coal, and the cost of coal plummets because no one’s buying it, that’s going to mean layoffs, that’s going to mean shutdowns.”

Though one stated goal of Trump’s “Unleashing American Energy” agenda is to “create jobs and prosperity” in extraction and energy production, Harvard labor economist Gordon Hanson doubts the administration’s moves will deliver. What’s actually being built, he said, are gas plants, along with wind and solar projects approved under, and funded through, the Biden administration. Renewable energy generated more electricity than coal power for the first time last year, and Hanson said any effort to revive coal relies less on economics than on nostalgia.

“Many Trump administration policies seem more symbolic than realistic,” Hanson said.

The Novi-based firm said in a notice to Michigan's employment agency that it laid off engineers, managers, technicians and others on Jan. 6. The state didn't get the layoff notice until a week later, but Our Next Energy said it wasn't able to provide the usual 60 days of notice required by federal law due to the unnamed EV customer's sudden departure.

Our Next Energy representatives didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.

On Jan. 7, a day after the layoffs, the company said it was suspending its EV battery investments and would focus on making batteries used for rail, defense and utility-scale energy storage systems instead. It said the changes resulted in a 45% workforce reduction.

The Our Next Energy pivot comes as the U.S. EV battery industry at large struggles with demand that hasn't met expectations. The company, however, sees growing demand in the other areas for domestically-made batteries, which ""is expected to enable cash-flow breakeven by the end of 2026.""

“Our business turnaround in 2025 focused on fundamentals — reducing operational costs, diversifying away from automotive EVs, and securing new purchase orders that demonstrate strong product-market ﬁt,” Founder and CEO Mujeeb Ijaz said in the Jan. 7 announcement.

Our Next Energy originally planned to outfit a large building in Van Buren Township for EV and other battery production, and it was awarded up to $237 million in state taxpayer subsidies for the project. But much of the building remains vacant and is listed for lease. Ijaz told The Detroit News in November that about 50 employees were working on battery cell production in one part of the building, but 60% of the building, originally slated for EV battery production, was being repurposed by the landlord.

As of late last year, the Michigan Economic Development Corp. said it had disbursed $70 million in subsidies for the project. Payments were paused as the agency sought to understand the company's next plans. The agency said Wednesday it has made no further payments to the company.

The company said it's finished retooling to make a new type of lithium iron phosphate battery cells at the Van Buren Township facility. The new type of batteries are ""engineered for extreme operating environments,"" the firm said, for defense drones, underwater systems and deep-sea mining platforms.

Imagine if the most effective climate solutions weren’t coming from Congress or global summits, but from mayors working city by city, block by block …

In this episode, co-hosts Cleo Carney and Victoria Riskin have a conversation with Eric Garcetti, former mayor of Los Angeles and U.S. Ambassador to India — and Victoria’s longtime friend. “I was thrilled to reconnect with my good friend Eric, whom I’ve known and admired since the beginning of his career,” Victoria says. “Eric remains a wellspring of inspiration for me, and even more so when I learned other new things about my old friend in this conversation.”

In this part-interview, part-conversation-among-friends, Eric reminds us to focus on local action, because cities have become the real engines of climate progress, and community resilience and everyday leadership matter now more than ever. He reveals how mayors quietly kept the U.S. in the climate game even when the federal government stepped out, in part because of the rise of Climate Mayors, a coalition that began with a handful of leaders and has since exploded into hundreds of cities across red, blue, and purple states. “I knew the depth of his commitment to human rights,” Vicki says. “But I was so excited to hear how he has galvanized hundreds of mayors in the U.S. and the world to work together on the climate in their communities … sharing ideas and supporting one another.”

We also explore how practical, local solutions cut through partisanship, the global climate crossroads in India, L.A.’s vision for the first carbon-reducing Olympics, and the emotional side of leadership: courage, joy, and staying connected to community during moments of crisis.

Transcript

Hosts: Victoria Riskin and Cleo Carney

Guest: Eric Garcetti

Eric Garcetti: Most pollution out of a gas-powered car really comes from the acceleration at a stoplight. By having roundabouts, there's a huge reduction in emissions. They also work better for traffic, by the way. That's not Democratic; that's not Republican. We used to joke that there's no such thing as a Democratic or Republican pothole. There really isn't when it comes to climate resilience, despite climate deniers and people trying to make it partisan.

Victoria Riskin: Hi everyone. Welcome back to the Bluedot Living podcast, where we imagine if people were actually making progress on climate change because they are. Every episode we talk to great people in the trenches doing big and small things to make a difference. As you just heard, today we'll be talking to former L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti. Imagine if mayors around America or around the world shared ideas of how to address climate change on the ground in their community.

I love Eric Garcetti. He was a great mayor for Los Angeles for nine years, and then he was U.S. ambassador to India, where he was wildly popular. Before he left, he built an amazing coalition of hundreds of mayors across the United States to work on climate resiliency and then went global, bringing together mayors from cities like Paris, Mumbai, and Boston to tackle climate solutions. We know action has to happen locally. And not least of all, he's a devoted father and husband. That's important too. Alright, let's do it. As always, I'm Vicki Riskin, founder of Bluedot Living.

Janet Kraus: She is so humble. Founder of Bluedot Living, founder of this incredible movement, frankly. I'm so proud to be here with you, Vicki. I'm Janet Kraus. I'm a serial entrepreneur, I'm a coach of CEOs and growing businesses, and I'm a board member of Bluedot. I'm so excited for our podcast.

Ally Giebutowski: Hi everyone. I'm Ally Giebutowski. I am a Bluedot intern, and I am also a freshman at Lafayette College. I'm studying environmental studies and economics. I'm also the daughter of Janet Kraus.

Cleo Carney: Hi guys. I am Cleo Carney. I actually began working for Bluedot Living in high school, and now I'm a sophomore at Harvard studying social studies with a minor in economics. I continue to work for Bluedot Living. I'm also on the board of Bluedot Institute, so I love the Bluedot-verse.

Janet Kraus: The Bluedot-verse?

Ally Giebutowski: Oh, that was…

Janet Kraus: The Bluedot-verse!

Victoria Riskin: Yay. Good for you.

Cleo Carney: I'm trying to stay hired.

Victoria Riskin: OK, we'll see about that because now we need to battle it out to see who's the one to interview our guest, my longtime friend, Eric Garcetti.

Janet Kraus: All right. Now let me just say it. I think it's great that you really like him and that he's your pal, but I don't think you're right to interview him. I think it is me. I think you are crazy and do so many things. This guy is everywhere and feels so right. I'm excited to talk to him.

Victoria Riskin: Yeah.

Janet Kraus: Battle me out for it, girls.

Ally Giebutowski: Well, here's what I'll say. I'm nervous; he's a mayor. I'm 18. Do I have the capabilities to talk to a mayor? But because I feel that way, because I'm a little bit scared about it, maybe that's important. I need to lean into my discomfort. So that's my stake. That's why I feel I need to face that challenge.

Cleo Carney: Well, what I will say is I definitely think Vicki can't interview him alone because she is a great friend of his, and there might be some bias there. However, I do think Vicki, being a good friend of his, will know where to push him, where we can get the most out of him. I would say my benefit, my unique angle, is that I am not American. I have a different perspective on the political system. I grew up in Canada and the UK, so that might be interesting. I've been to L.A. once. However, Ally, you also have a good point.

Janet Kraus: Well, here's the thing I've got going on in my mind. Ally, you're scared of talking to mayors, and I don't know, Cleo, if we're allowed to let it out of the bag, but you talk to leaders of countries on a regular basis. I don't know, just saying.

Cleo Carney: I yell at leaders of countries on a regular basis. “Talk” is too diplomatic.

Janet Kraus: Oh, that's very funny. So is this going to make you … you're not really bound by the normal expectations of how we treat the leaders of cities, states, and countries?

Cleo Carney: Gotta keep them in check.

Victoria Riskin: I just have to make my own case here a little bit. I haven't seen him since he left for India. It's been a long time, and I would just really love to spend time with him. If I can't do it, I'm out of here.

Ally Giebutowski: As in out of Bluedot? Oh no!

Cleo Carney: That's an ultimatum if I ever heard it.

Victoria Riskin: Put it to the vote. Everybody writes on a piece of paper who you think should be the two interviewers. OK.

Janet Kraus: All right. All right.

Ally Giebutowski: Ready? Are we ready?

Cleo Carney: One, two, three. Yay!

Janet Kraus: We don't have to go to war. Look, we're bridging. We're bridging.

Cleo Carney: This was not predetermined at all.

Janet Kraus: No, it wasn't.

Victoria Riskin: Alright, it's Cleo and me, and we're going to interview Eric, and then we'll report back our thoughts afterwards if that's okay. So, hey everybody, stay with us.

Ally Giebutowski: Can't wait to hear.

Cleo Carney: Perfect.

The Interview

Victoria Riskin: Hi. Hey, Eric.

Eric Garcetti: Vicki!

Victoria Riskin: So nice to see you, Eric.

Eric Garcetti: Nice to see you.

Victoria Riskin: It's been so long.

Eric Garcetti: How are you doing?

Victoria Riskin: I'm doing great. Thank you for coming to join us today.

Eric Garcetti: Of course.

Victoria Riskin: The requirement here is that we have dinner in Los Angeles when I come.

Eric Garcetti: Absolutely.

Victoria Riskin: Can you tell the audience who you are? Who are you?

Eric Garcetti: So, I'm Eric. I am a father of Maya, a 13-year-old, a husband, son, and brother. I'm an Angeleno, first and foremost a rare fourth-generation native of Los Angeles, one of the world's great cities. But I'm also a committed activist, urbanist, and artist, somebody who believes in creativity and joy in celebrating our accomplishments and fighting for the values we believe in. I've dedicated my whole life to either human rights or political work, engaging my fellow citizens so that we can break down the idea that there are those who govern and those who are governed, and try to find joy in every single day.

Victoria Riskin: Yeah. And you do it beautifully. I always like to start at the beginning. Eric, if you don't mind, I want to take you back to your childhood. What did you envision for your future?

Eric Garcetti: It's so funny that we always ask that, and it's a very professional and work-oriented question where we identify ourselves by what we do. It's funny, having lived around the world where one of the first things Americans ask, to some degree less so with Europeans, and the further you get away, even not at all, is “What do you do?” It was interesting living in India for the last two and a half years because people might get around to what you do the third or fourth time you meet them. They actually meet people first and then try to figure out what you do.

When I was young, I had some professional ideas, but it was more interesting. I think I had impulses of who I wanted to be, not what I wanted to be. I grew up in a very loving family — half Jewish, half Mexican-American, great-grandson of immigrants — and they impressed upon me the idea that you need to be in and of the world. My parents met on opposite sides of the tracks in L.A. My mom on the ritzier Westside; her father owned a clothing company. Dad was the son of a barber and a meatpacker in South Los Angeles. But they both met at Pan Am Airlines. They raised my sister and me with the idea of traveling not as vacations, but trips. Whenever they had an extra nickel or dime, it wasn't going into a nicer home or a fancier car. It was: “Let's go to China now that it's just opened.” “Let's go to India.” “Let's go to Egypt.” “Let's see Morocco.” “Let's go to Rwanda.”

They impressed upon me that I wanted to be in and of the world. I was trained as a musician; I thought I'd maybe be a musician, maybe an actor, maybe an astronaut. I had no idea. Maybe a baseball player, if I look at my old notebooks. I have been able to do many of those things, and my advice for anybody listening is you don't have to be something. You can do lots of things in life, and you don't have to assign yourself one track. I think this generation knows that you're going to have many different careers, experiences, engagements, and connections. That's probably what I wanted to do as a kid. And so far, so good.

Victoria Riskin: So far, you are doing a fantastic job. It makes me think about how I wanted to be a school teacher or a mom or something. It was a very narrow vision, but I also felt I could see people gravitated to me and that I had leadership skills. Like you obviously have had all your life, Eric. You begin to see you have a much bigger mission, which is to bring people together to do good things.

Eric Garcetti: It's funny, some people call it leadership skills. I think half the people called leaders just have a volunteer impulse. When nobody else says “I'll do it,” you go, “I'll do it.” And they're like, “Oh, you're a leader.” It's just because everybody stepped one step back and you're the only one still forward sometimes.

Victoria Riskin: So you and Amy have fostered seven kids. Can you touch on that?

Eric Garcetti: Yeah, I think a couple more than that, actually, in the end. Thinking of the things you want to do or things you want to be, I never considered growing up what a foster parent would be or what that experience would be like. My wife, Amy, grew up in a family that had halves and steps and some kind of unofficial fostering of siblings. She grew up with a much more fluid understanding of what family was. It was one of her goals. She said, “I always wanted to be a foster parent.”

At that point, I was an elected official, which made things a little bit complicated. But as a city council member, I said, “I've inflicted this life of politics on you. If you want to do this, it's the least I can do to say absolutely.” And it wound up being the best thing that I've ever done in life being a father and a foster parent. It's funny, people distinguish between those two. I think we've just been parents.

Victoria Riskin: Beautiful. Would you mind telling me, when was that first moment when you said, “I really need to focus on climate change?”

Eric Garcetti: I don't know if there's ever been just one. I think my work as an environmentalist started small and just kept continually building without one spiking moment. I think it was when I became an intern in high school at something called the TreePeople. Andy Lipkis is this great hero who transformed everyone's thinking about trees — that trees weren't just trees, they were shade. In a dry area like Los Angeles that has paved over all of our land and water can't infiltrate, they are places that absorb water and create so much good. That transformed me in a very personal way to work around climate and connectivity.

Then I think the real thing that sparked it was my human rights work, which brought us together, Vicki. Looking at the multiple generations of human rights, it started with civil and political, went to economic and social and cultural rights, but then people were talking about third, fourth, and fifth-generation rights — group rights, Indigenous rights, and environmental rights. The idea that connection to the environment was a human right.

I spent two summers that were very formative. When I graduated from college and as I was studying for my master's in human rights and international law, I was in the jungles of Burma working with the democratic resistance. They had risen up and were about to overthrow the government democratically, but the government started killing them, mowing them down, and imprisoning them. They fled to the jungles, where ethnic minority groups had for a long time been in conflict with the central government. Living there in the jungle, I came across some Greenpeace people and others working on the environment in one of the last remaining countries that still had amazing teak reserves, which unfortunately have been decimated in Burma. I saw that impact on climate.

The last thing I'll say is I was also really lucky to try to take the easiest science class I could take at Columbia. It was called “Design and Maintenance of a Habitable Planet” and was taught by Wallace Broecker — Wally. He was the professor who coined the term “global warming.” I took that class when the first U.N. scientist report came out on global warming. When I look back, I still have my book and notes from that class. That changed everything for me. He's passed away now, but Wally's predictions of what would happen with the rising heat of the Earth have come within 0.1 or 0.2 degrees; they have been exactly on time. The good news is he predicted we will curve that down. The question for all of us is when. But that was so far ahead of its time, before people were commonly using the terms global warming and climate change. That certainly had a huge impact.

Victoria Riskin: Powerful how a teacher can have such an important impact on a student for the rest of their lives.

Cleo Carney: I've just finished my first year and I've taken some courses that have changed the way I've thought about life and society. University is an amazing experience. We are very fortunate, particularly in the States where higher education is of such high caliber. But I want to shift from your time as a student to your time as the mayor of Los Angeles. In that capacity, you started the Climate Mayors. First of all, if you could explain to our audience what that is, that'd be great. And then we'd love to know, where did that idea come from and how did you actualize it?

Eric Garcetti: Thank you, Cleo. To me, one of the nicest things in life you can do is to work with others to start something. I started a couple of organizations in college; some of them survived, some didn't. I've done that as a city council member and as a mayor. One of the best feelings in life is to come back to something. By the way, if you find something, don't stick around forever. Pass it on to the next generation. One of the most satisfying feelings you can ever have is to have had a hand in starting something that others then take forward.

Our world needs a lot more institutions and structures than we do today. Most of our activism is like, “OK, I tweeted something, I made a comment, I'm done for the day.” It's armchair activism as opposed to real-world action. Climate Mayors was something that came out of three of us who were mayors: the mayor of Houston, the mayor of Philadelphia, and myself. We saw a need for work across cities. I love mayors, I love cities, and I love the sub-national level because it moves so quickly. There's a joke we make: “Good mayors borrow, great mayors steal.” Constantly, whether you're in Mexico City or Topeka, you're looking at the sidewalk, the bus line, the architecture of the buildings, and you're like, “I want to take that. I want to do that. Tell me how you did that.” I remember talking to a mayor in the South, I think in Alabama, who set up a system for reading because literacy rates were low. In all the restaurants, there were just kids' books when you came in. Kids could read them and then take them if they wanted. The library moved to the restaurants. Things like that are just so smart.

Climate Mayors came out of that. The three of us were very committed to bringing together a nonpartisan, bipartisan, tri-partisan group of mayors who would be focused on solutions. We brought our buying power together to purchase electric vehicles when those were still new and expensive, helping smaller towns that didn't have the buying power to get the same price as a big city. We looked at how we could begin to count our carbon — both of the people in our city and of the operations of our governments — and set goals to do the hard work necessary to arrest the damage.

It isn't just about science and carbon reduction; it's about real communities. What do we do when there are fires? What do we do with floods? How do we prepare communities to be resilient and adapt? We started as a few dozen mayors. Then when President Trump was elected the first time and said the U.S. would be the only country to withdraw from the Paris Accords, I was in Madison, Wisconsin, giving a speech. Instead of crying in a corner, we decided to pick up the phone and start calling. That day we went from a few dozen to over a hundred members. The pitch was this: “If he says we're out, then as a country we're going to be in as communities.” Within a week we had two or three hundred. We were getting calls from mayors saying, “My constituents are harassing me. Why haven't I signed on to Climate Mayors?” By the end, we had mayors from 49 states. Democrats, Republicans, independents — over 737 mayors and cities have now signed on to this. It's become this force for good, to play defense in times like this, but also to be on offense together when we have those opportunities.

Victoria Riskin: So many of the problems that people are going to be facing are very local, and they have to be dealt with on a local basis.

Cleo Carney: I took a climate course last semester where we learned all about state and local solutions and how those can blossom on a larger scale. What came to mind for me when you were talking about the original coalition being bipartisan is: How did you overcome some challenges that inevitably came up? We want to learn from past successful initiatives to hear about how we can continue to work together with anyone of any political ideology, particularly on matters of climate.

Eric Garcetti: Constituents want to not be harmed. They want to be safe. The greatest threats, besides things like poverty and crime, are usually the disasters that come from and are accelerated by climate change or the suffering of living through extreme heat. When I lived in New Delhi serving as ambassador for the last two years, New Delhi hit a new high. It was 125 Fahrenheit one day with close to 100% humidity. We had the most rain, the most pollution, and the most heat that city had ever experienced, all in a single year.

Those practical things bring the conversation back to what this is really about: human survival. Then there's a whole bunch of geeky stuff. We had a Republican mayor who was part of the Obama task force on climate with me, Mayor [James] Brainard in Carmel, Indiana. He became the go-to guy on roundabouts. Roundabouts are used all around the world, but not really in the U.S. The most pollution out of a gas-powered car really comes from the acceleration at a stoplight. By having roundabouts, there's a huge reduction in emissions. They also work better for traffic. That's not Democratic or Republican. There is no such thing as a Democratic or Republican pothole. Bring those conversations back to what a sea wall in New York or Miami has in common; people will lose their homes otherwise, regardless of whether it's a red or blue state.

Victoria Riskin: Yeah. I think that's what's exciting: there are ways that people can feel bonded and find solutions. At Bluedot, we try very hard not to be political, but that doesn't mean we don't focus on policy. That's a different matter.

Cleo Carney: You brought the bid for the 2028 Olympics to Los Angeles. Can you tell me what that means for the city and how that fits in your vision for the climate future of Los Angeles?

Eric Garcetti: We're an Olympic-crazy city. We're now going to join London and Paris as the only cities to host the Olympics three times. We've always been “games changers.” In 1932, it was the first profitable Olympics, the first Olympic Village, and the first photo finish. In 1984, the model was broken; the Montreal Olympics had almost bankrupted them. We brought private sponsorship and showed how the Olympics could be sustainable, earning $350 million in profit. We put that into a foundation that has funded youth sports ever since.

When we came back to this, it was actually my first day as mayor. The first letter I wrote on anything was to the U.S. Olympic Committee saying we want to host. I was 13 when it came in 1984. The civic pride and the way people volunteered was unforgettable. Environmentalism really won us the bid this time. We looked at the Olympic Village; usually, everyone builds housing that turns into dorms or family homes, but they build subway lines that aren't used afterward. Places like Athens and Rio have empty venues.

We said, “Let's take all that off the table. Let's do the most sustainable games by using what we already have.” Nothing permanently new will be built. We'll do temporary stuff that will be recycled. For the athletes' village, we'll use the dormitories at UCLA where students already are. We're going to see not only the first carbon-neutral games but the first carbon-reducing games. We'll show what a green sustainable model can be. Paris went first in 2024, and we were given 2028. We're going to take the profit and put it back into sustainable communities. Environmentalism isn't just about carbon; it's about communities that thrive. In too many communities in Los Angeles, kids don't have access to a park, a coach, or uniforms. Our vision is to make sustainability about greening those communities to make them healthy too.

Victoria Riskin: It's so exciting. My mother was at the 1932 Olympics, and I have a picture of her sitting next to Amelia Earhart. If that's not a blast from the past!

Eric Garcetti: That's incredible.

Cleo Carney: This last Olympics, break dancing was there for the first time. Vicki, do you have any…

Victoria Riskin: Yeah, we heard a rumor. Well, first of all, Eric, you loved your time in India. There's no question. I saw your love letter to India, which was so beautiful. It's clear you love the culture. However, we also saw a clip of you doing some I don't know, do you call it break dancing? Could we run that clip?

[clip of Eric Garcetti dancing]

Victoria Riskin: What ambassador does this? I don't think anyone in the history of ambassadorships has done that.

Cleo Carney: Sorry, Eric, we didn't tell you we were going to share this.

Eric Garcetti: Oh yeah, that's bhangra dancing and some Hindi film dancing. We stole some moves. I didn't even know this was ever going to be on the internet. There's a big celebration every year for Diwali at the U.S. Embassy. It was a really great way to connect with Indian people. It's tough to be in the public light; it's a pretty merciless place to be. I tell young people who want to go into politics to really consider it hard. But on the flip side, if you can figure out a way to be active, make sure you connect with people. Don't be a formal elected official; don't be somebody who doesn't show your heart.

Victoria Riskin: I was visiting the Indian Embassy in Washington under Biden, and I said to somebody, “What do you think of your American ambassador to India?” And he said, “Oh, we love him.” They pulled out a little video you had done. It was very funny. But I think, Eric, you just took off all the artifice about that position and were able to connect heart-to-heart.

Eric Garcetti: India is a tremendous place for our climate work, to both learn from and work with. By some measures, 40% of the delta of carbon change in the next 20 years will happen in India. If we do it right, we can help India and India can help itself. There's a lot of opportunity technologically and energy-wise if they can produce low-cost green energy.

Then there are also incredible environmental assets like the Himalayas. There's a great Himalayan forest that is second only to the Amazon; we should be collectively enhancing this green lung of the Earth. I talked to women in my first month in the western state of Gujarat, in Ahmedabad. There's an organization called SEWA, the Self-Employed Women’s Association. I was talking to a bricklayer, and she said, “It's so hot here now that even with my gloves on, I can't hold the bricks, and I don't know how I'm going to support my family.” It was women's work, environmental work, and anti-poverty work all coming together.

The flip side is, a foundation from the U.S. helped do something where there's insurance now for those workers. On days that it's too hot, they get paid. Their family doesn't have to worry when they're living paycheck to paycheck. We know these are predictable things. Let's get insurance for those days. That kind of creativity is coming out of India.

Victoria Riskin: And do you feel like there's support at the highest levels of the government in India?

Eric Garcetti: The goals are slower there, but their point is that they have further to go, and they're still growing. India is adding population. There's really no country besides the U.S. where there's any debate about climate change. So even in India where they produce coal and refine oil, they are doing both at the same time. People from the outside say “stop doing that,” and it's true, we need solutions so they don't add coal on top of renewables. Renewables are almost 40% there now in capacity. We need to help with battery technology, water batteries, and even nuclear power plants. I grew up thinking it was bad, but technologies now are there; it's one of the few zero-emission technologies that can replace coal in a steady-state way. It's going to be challenging because they are going to add almost another America to their population.

Victoria Riskin: You came back to Los Angeles after big swaths of Los Angeles had burned from climate change. People you and I know lost their homes. How are you processing that?

Eric Garcetti: It's devastating. We have to take these moments as wake-up calls. I'm now working as a C40 Ambassador and with the Global Covenant of Mayors, representing cities and regions in climate negotiations. Three-quarters of those cities are on track or ahead of Paris science. If cities can do this and they're complex and political, so can countries. When people get depressed, I would say if we had done nothing, we would be on track for a four-degree rise. We're on track for a two-degree rise right now. That's too much, but it shows human beings actually have power.

Cleo Carney: Yeah.

Eric Garcetti: I think it's time for us to feel that power we have.

Victoria Riskin: Yeah. Take it in, adjust, and help each other. Help your neighbors. This has been a wonderful conversation, Eric. Cleo and I have one closing question for you. Our podcast is called “Imagine If,” and I'd like you to fill in the blank. Imagine if… do you have an “Imagine if” you would share with us?

Eric Garcetti: It's a small one and a personal one. I imagine if you found joy in every day and felt your power every day. We're living through a moment with so little joy where people feel powerless. Do something and smile at something. Today you will feel that joy and power. If everybody did that, we would feel collectively in a very different place, and our ambition would soar.

Victoria Riskin: Absolutely. A perfect closing because that's exactly what we need right now. A great medicine.

Victoria Riskin: All right, so Cleo, what did you think of my friend Eric?

Cleo Carney: Well, first off, I thought he was lovely. He was so sociable and interesting and really a humble person. But I had three main takeaways. The first was about our scope of action. I really liked how he talked about us hitting two degrees of warming instead of four degrees. While that's still warmer than we would like, it shows how much impact our small daily habits can have. We're making a change even if we don't feel like it's necessarily fast enough.

Victoria Riskin: Right. He's basically saying things would be much worse if we didn't do the things we have been doing. So we have to do those things and more.

Cleo Carney: I couldn't agree more. One of my other takeaways was about action — that we can come together. When there are wider issues at play, like the Climate Mayors coming together after the U.S. pulled out of the Paris Accords, it shows that individuals have advocacy. Whether you're a mayor or an everyday person, together we're strong.

Victoria Riskin: Together you're strong. I like that. I love the fact that even though it was disappointing that they pulled out of the Paris Accords, it mobilized a bunch of mayors who said, “OK, let's jump in.”

Cleo Carney: Yeah, I couldn't agree more. And so, Vicki, now it's your turn to be on the hot seat. What is your third and final takeaway?

Victoria Riskin: Well, I thought it was pretty interesting that they put so much time and thought into how to decarbonize during the Olympics. That's exciting, and it led me to think about how we can decarbonize in our own little orbit. And of course, I loved his “Imagine if.” Imagine if we found joy in every day, especially since we're going through so much in the country right now. That really touched my heart.

Cleo Carney: I couldn't agree more.",https://bluedotliving.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/eric-garcetti-imagine-if-1024x1024.png,N,,2026-01-21 18:00:26.372739

Data centers evolved and expanded quickly, with few checks, says Abe Silverman, an assistant research scholar at Johns Hopkins’ Ralph O’Connor Sustainable Energy Institute.
Virginia was an early adopter and now hosts the largest cluster of data centers in the country, with 663 operating and nearly 600 more planned.
Data centers need just as much energy to cool down as they do to run their computer systems.
How AI will reshape society remains an open question, but how its data centers will reshape our energy system is no longer theoretical.","Merriam-Webster’s word of the year for 2025 was “slop”: low-quality, AI-generated content. That feels apt.

If the public wasn’t fully aware of AI when it entered the lexicon roughly three years ago, it is now impossible to miss. AI-created commercials aired during the NBA finals. Google pushes Gemini into searches. You can’t miss the scourge of anthropomorphized polar bears and cute “amphiblets” on social media feeds. At least 35 million people pay for pro subscriptions to OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

There’s a real argument that AI will unlock advances across science, technology, and business. But this brave new world of 12-fingered, AI-generated images and deepfake videos is coming at a steep cost to our pocketbooks—and our environment.

Americans got a collective reality check last year when electric bills soared across the United States. Those rates are still climbing, and a central culprit is what’s driving AI, cloud storage and crypto mining: data centers.

There are now roughly 4,000 data centers operating across the U.S., with another 3,000 planned or under construction.

They exist in every state, often hidden in plain sight—warehouses on former farmland in Ohio, unused office buildings in downtown Los Angeles, shuttered malls in Louisiana. You might not notice them, but you’re paying for them.

Nationally, average electricity rates have risen more than 30% since 2020. In 2025 alone, bills climbed faster than the national average in Virginia (13%), Illinois (16%), and Ohio (12%)—all states with heavy data center concentrations.

Data centers evolved and expanded quickly, with few checks, says Abe Silverman, an assistant research scholar at Johns Hopkins’ Ralph O’Connor Sustainable Energy Institute.

“A data center can go from [being] a field to [consuming] a city’s worth of electricity in two years. That’s just unprecedented,” says Silverman.

Tech companies have pushed aggressively to scale AI since ChatGPT’s debut, often taking advantage of states and counties that offer tantalizing tax breaks. Virginia was an early adopter and now hosts the largest cluster of data centers in the country, with 663 operating and nearly 600 more planned. Texas ranks second.

The energy footprint is already enormous. In 2023, U.S. data centers consumed about 4.4% of the nation’s electricity—more than the state of New York uses in a year. That demand has exploded: Estimates suggest data center grid demand rose 22% in 2025, and this year could reach nearly 76 gigawatts—enough to power roughly 40% of U.S. homes.

Historically, utilities haven’t judged or regulated how electricity is used. The rates they set per kilowatt hour don’t distinguish between, say, a factory using a huge portion of the grid or a small household.

“Utilities are really deeply ingrained in that they don’t make value judgments over their customers’ use of energy,” Silverman says. “Utilities do not want to be in the business of saying, ‘Hey, you’re just using that electricity to play video games, so you have less social utility than, you know, an orphanage.’”

But data centers may force a reckoning.

President Trump last week took to Truth Social to blame Joe Biden for rising power prices and vowed to work with tech companies so American households don’t foot the bill for data centers. On Friday, governors from 13 states joined Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in urging PJM—the nation’s largest grid operator—to rein in costs.

At the state level, Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger rode cost-of-living concerns to victory last fall, pledging to make tech companies “pay their own way.” Democrats see energy prices as a ticket to voters in this year’s midterms.

Even tech companies are starting to acknowledge the problem. Microsoft Vice Chair Brad Smith wrote in a post last week that it would be “unfair and politically unrealistic” to ask the public to shoulder AI’s electricity costs, and that tech firms should pay for the demand they create.

None of this points to slowing data center growth. In fact, the Department of Energy last fall pushed regulators to speed up data-center connections to the grid. Meeting that demand will mean more power plants.

To power the data centers, some companies are reviving nuclear facilities. Others are building their own gas turbines. States like Georgia are keeping aging coal plants online. Clean energy options could be on the table, but Trump has already fought actively to derail some of the biggest offshore wind options. So, more energy likely means more emissions.

“Increased demand is being met through burning fossil fuels and through fossil fuel power plants, especially gas,” said Michael Cork, a postdoctoral research fellow in biostatistics at Harvard University. “We know that that leads to higher emissions of harmful air pollutants that are directly linked to heart and lung disease.”

In a paper, Cork’s lab found that 56% of current U.S. data center energy consumption was derived from fossil fuels, which generated more than 2% of U.S. emissions in 2023.

What’s even less visible is water usage. Data centers need just as much energy to cool down as they do to run their computer systems. In other words, data centers use lots of clean water.

Some cities are already feeling the squeeze. In The Dalles, Oregon, for example, Google data centers in 2024 accounted for nearly 33% of the city’s water use after tripling consumption in just five years. Facing shrinking reserves, the city is now exploring additional water sources in the Mount Hood National Forest.

How AI will reshape society remains an open question, but how its data centers will reshape our energy system is no longer theoretical.

Last year might have been the year of “slop,” but hopefully 2026 is the year of action—before the costs and emissions rise beyond recognition.",https://atmos.earth/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ca-raha-allaroundus016_hor-1280x719.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 15:03:35.186571

This award is part of Press Ganey’s annual ranking of the top hospitals and health systems in the country, according to performance in Patient Experience.

As a winner of the Press Ganey HX Guardian of Excellence Award®, AVALA is in the top 5% of healthcare providers in delivering an excellent patient experience in the last year. Press Ganey works with more than 41,000 healthcare facilities in its mission to reduce patient suffering and enhance caregiver resilience to improve the overall safety, quality, and experience of care.

“This recognition belongs to the people who show up for our patients every single day,” said Joy Melgar, MSN, RN, AVALA Chief Nursing Officer. “Real care happens in the small moments. Taking the extra time to educate and making sure patients feel safe and respected. That’s the experience we hold ourselves accountable to at AVALA.”

AVALA leaders say many patients arrive for surgery with fear and uncertainty, a reality that shapes how care is delivered from the moment they enter the facility. The organization describes its care model as one that prioritizes reassurance, clear communication and patient comfort throughout the surgical experience.

According to AVALA, the facility’s environment is intentionally designed to be calm and welcoming, with an emphasis on minimizing stress for both patients and their families. Staff members are trained to take time to listen, explain procedures and respond to concerns so patients do not feel rushed or overlooked. AVALA notes that family members frequently comment on feeling supported and informed during the process.

The approach, AVALA says, reflects its broader commitment to restoring patient confidence in healthcare by emphasizing comfort, communication and trust as central components of care delivery.

“AVALA is showing what it truly means to deliver compassionate, person-centered care,” said Patrick T. Ryan, Chairman and CEO of Press Ganey. “Their deep commitment to both patients and caregivers is creating a culture where empathy drives action—and where people feel seen, heard, and supported. It’s a privilege to stand beside them on this journey.”

There were 283 electric vehicles registered in Humboldt County in 2025.
“We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating the California electric vehicle mandate once and for all,” Trump said.
Trump similarly tried to curb California’s electric vehicle rules and allow new offshore oil drilling in his first term from 2017 to 2021.
Two weeks ago, Newsom announced in his state budget proposal that he would allocate $200 million to a new electric vehicle rebate program.","In 2012 — when there were about 30,000 electric vehicles on the road in California, Tesla was a small new company that mostly appealed to hobbyists and the hybrid Toyota Prius was still a novelty in many areas — former Gov. Jerry Brown signed an executive order setting an audacious goal: 1.5 million EVs sold statewide by 2025.

There were lots of skeptics, given that Brown was calling for a 50-fold increase in the status quo. But, as it turned out, California achieved it easily.

With the final sales numbers tallied for 2025, more than 2.5 million electric vehicles have been sold in the state since 2012, according to data released Tuesday by the California Energy Commission.

“We invested in this future when others said it was impossible,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement.

Newsom highlighted the number — 2,551,121 to be exact — during his appearance Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

For the past two decades, California has led the nation in electric vehicle sales. The state has provided rebates, tax credits and other incentives as part of its efforts to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases.

As technology has improved, allowing much farther battery range — with many models able to travel more than 300 miles when fully charged — EV sales now make up 22.9% of all new car sales in California. Santa Clara County has the highest rate in the state, with 41.1% of all new vehicles sold being electric in 2025. There were 283 electric vehicles registered in Humboldt County in 2025. Teslas account for nearly 23% of the vehicles purchased locally.

But electric vehicles face major headwinds. President Donald Trump has reversed or blocked many of the federal incentives put in place by former President Joe Biden.

This past year, Trump and Republicans in Congress eliminated the federal tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of new electric vehicles. They let a law expire that allowed states to permit solo EV drivers in carpool lanes on federally funded highways, ending that perk nationwide.

And in June, Trump signed a resolution blocking California’s first-in-the-nation regulations banning the sale of new gasoline-powered passenger vehicles by 2035, which Newsom had put in place in 2020.

Trump held a White House ceremony June 12, saying California’s rules limited consumer choice. He revoked federal permission for the ban, called a “waiver,” that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had given to the state when Biden was in office.

“We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating the California electric vehicle mandate once and for all,” Trump said. “They said it couldn’t be done. It’s had us tied in knots for years. They passed these crazy rules.”

Republicans said California’s rules were overly broad and would effectively set a national standard because the state is the largest car market in the United States and, under the Clean Air Act, other states are allowed to copy its rules.

Environmental groups and Democratic leaders said Trump’s rollbacks will lead to more air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and health problems for Californian residents.

Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit over the issue minutes after Trump acted. California was joined by 10 other states — Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. The lawsuit is pending.

In the months since, several large automakers have pulled back on some EV models. In December, Ford announced it would cease production of its all-electric F-150 pickup truck, and would focus instead on hybrid vehicles and a new line of smaller, cheaper EVs.

“When the market really changed over the last couple of months, that was really the impetus for us to make the call,” Ford CEO Jim Farley told Reuters in an interview.

In California, 408,731 EVs sold in 2025. That’s double the number from 2022, but down 8% from 2024, when 443,374 sold.

Sales surged in the weeks before Sept. 30, when the federal tax credits expired, and then dropped off in October, November, and December.

Even though two of the top three highest-selling vehicles of all types in California last year were the Tesla Model Y and the Model 3, the other being the gas-powered Toyota Camry, Tesla has seen some softening of sales in the state. Some residents of the blue state, angry that Tesla CEO Elon Musk contributed $250 million to Trump’s re-election campaign and led an effort called DOGE to reduce federal staffing through firings and early retirements, have resisted buying Teslas, put stickers on the vehicles denouncing Musk, or purchased other EVs, like Hyundais, Hondas or Rivians instead.

The Trump administration’s fight over electric vehicle rules stands as one of the major environmental clashes between his administration and California during the first year of his second term, along with Trump’s proposal to allow new offshore oil drilling along the state’s coastline.

Trump similarly tried to curb California’s electric vehicle rules and allow new offshore oil drilling in his first term from 2017 to 2021. But California sued in both cases. The lawsuits were pending when Biden took office, and he reversed Trump’s positions.

On Tuesday, Newsom, who is considering a run for president in 2028, cast Trump’s resistance to electric vehicles as putting the United States at a competitive disadvantage in a world where Europe, Japan, Canada, China, and other countries have passed similar laws to encourage the sale of electric vehicles, reduce oil consumption and phase out the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035 or 2040.

“While Washington now cedes the global clean vehicle market to China, California is ensuring American workers and manufacturers can compete and win in the industries that will define this century,” Newsom said.

Two weeks ago, Newsom announced in his state budget proposal that he would allocate $200 million to a new electric vehicle rebate program. Details, including how much motorists will receive, which cars are eligible and what income limits may apply, have not yet been finalized.

“California isn’t slowing down, we’re still leading the pack,” said California Air Resources Board Chair Lauren Sanchez. “It’s not just about clean air, it’s smart economic policy.”",https://www.times-standard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LDN-L-TESLA-DINER-0725-DC-4.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2026-01-21 15:03:27.226283

OBBBA boosts growth over the long run primarily by extending the expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), including lower income tax rates across five of the seven tax bracketsA tax bracket is the range of incomes taxed at given rates, which typically differ depending on filing status.
In a progressive individual or corporate income tax system, rates rise as income increases.
It does not reflect any increase in aggregate demand that may arise from “putting more cash in people’s pockets,” such as through higher tax refunds, which many analysts emphasize.
The permanent features of OBBBA, primarily the extension of TCJA’s pro-growth tax cuts, put the economy on a sound footing.","The US economy is on a tear lately, boosted by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s (OBBBA) income taxA tax is a mandatory payment or charge collected by local, state, and national governments from individuals or businesses to cover the costs of general government services, goods, and activities. cuts signed into law in July but undercut by the administration’s erratic and punitive tariffTariffs are taxes imposed by one country on goods imported from another country. Tariffs are trade barriers that raise prices, reduce available quantities of goods and services for US businesses and consumers, and create an economic burden on foreign exporters. policy. While the net effect is positive, it appears much of the economy’s surprising strength over the last year and in recent forecasts is coming from the boom in artificial intelligence (AI). Over the long run, OBBBA’s permanent extension of lower marginal tax rates on work, saving, and investment lays a solid foundation for stronger economic growth.

The economy has substantially outperformed most forecasters expectations over the last year, with real GDP growth averaging 2.5 percent in the first three quarters of 2025 versus 2.0 percent in the baseline projection provided by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) at the beginning of the Trump administration. The Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank currently estimates real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2025 will hit 5.3 percent, which (if it holds) would result in an average growth rate of 3.2 percent for 2025 compared to CBO’s forecast of 1.9 percent. Many economists attribute this outperformance in large part to AI, including capital expenditures on data centers, as well as a wealth effect from a rising stock market leading to higher consumer spending. For instance, Barclays estimates that about half of growth in output in the first half of 2025 came from AI spending.

Forecasts for 2026 are also looking up. In the December meeting of the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee, the median forecast for real GDP growth in 2026 was 2.3 percent, up from 1.8 percent in September’s meeting and 1.7 percent projected for 2025. This comes close to matching CBO’s latest forecast (released January 8th) of 2.2 percent growth in 2026, up from 1.8 percent in CBO’s estimate from a year ago. CBO expects growth to taper in both 2027 and 2028 to 1.8 percent annually.

CBO notes that OBBBA “spurs additional economic activity” in 2026 that is “partially offset by the effects of higher tariffs, which continue to weigh on trade flows and economic growth, and by changes in immigration policy that slow labor force growth.” In 2027 and 2028, “growth is supported by increases in the labor supply and in investment that result from the 2025 reconciliation act and by the positive effects on productivity stemming from the adoption of generative artificial intelligence. Those factors are offset by other forces, including the fading of the reconciliation act’s boost to aggregate demand and the slower growth in the labor force due to reduced net immigration.”

Our modeling of the economic effects of OBBBA and the Trump tariffs are consistent with CBO’s analysis. We estimate that OBBBA will boost GDP by 1.2 percent in 2026, 1.4 percent in 2027, and 1.5 percent in 2028, before trailing off to an increase of 1.2 percent over the long run. The initial surge is due to temporary tax cuts that expire over the next four years, including tax deductions for overtime and tipped income as well as expensing for factories and other buildings used in manufacturing and production. OBBBA boosts growth over the long run primarily by extending the expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), including lower income tax rates across five of the seven tax bracketsA tax bracket is the range of incomes taxed at given rates, which typically differ depending on filing status. In a progressive individual or corporate income tax system, rates rise as income increases. There are seven federal individual income tax brackets; the federal corporate income tax system is flat., expensing for short-lived assets (bonus depreciationDepreciation is a measurement of the “useful life” of a business asset, such as machinery or a factory, to determine the multiyear period over which the cost of that asset can be deducted from taxable income.

These are supply-side effects that boost labor and capital, resulting in a 0.7 percent increase in the capital stock, a 0.4 percent increase in wages, and a rise in hours worked equivalent to 938,000 full-time jobs. It does not reflect any increase in aggregate demand that may arise from “putting more cash in people’s pockets,” such as through higher tax refunds, which many analysts emphasize.

The effect of the new tax cuts will be muted to the extent taxpayers are uncertain about how the new rules work. While the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service continue to issue guidance, there remains a lack of clarity on some of the key provisions that went into effect in 2025. For instance, taxpayers still await Treasury guidance on the new expensing provision for structures used in manufacturing and production, where there is ambiguity about which assets and which activities qualify.

OBBBA’s positive economic impacts are substantially offset by the Trump administration’s ever-evolving tariff policy. Assuming the current tariff policy remains in place, we estimate it will reduce GDP by 0.5 percent over the long run, shrink the capital stock by 0.4 percent and eliminate 503,000 full-time equivalent jobs. Accounting for retaliation by other countries—which thus far has been less than most anticipated—further reduces long-run GDP by 0.2 percent. The full brunt of the tariffs has not yet taken effect, as importers and other businesses have relied on un-tariffed inventory and delayed price adjustments to account for the higher costs. Furthermore, the policy remains highly uncertain as taxpayers await a Supreme Court ruling on the legality of the tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

As discussed in an earlier post, the tariffs also offset about half of the fiscal cost of OBBBA. However, even if the current tariffs remain in place, debt as a share of GDP will reach a record high by 2028 and continue growing indefinitely, reaching 120 percent of GDP by 2034 versus 117 percent under CBO’s pre-OBBBA baseline. The unsustainable debt trajectory represents the greatest threat to sustained economic growth and by worsening the fiscal outlook OBBBA adds risk to the economic outlook, increasing the potential for higher interest rates, higher inflationInflation is when the general price of goods and services increases across the economy, reducing the purchasing power of a currency and the value of certain assets. The same paycheck covers less goods, services, and bills. It is sometimes referred to as a “hidden tax,” as it leaves taxpayers less well-off due to higher costs and “bracket creep,” while increasing the government’s spendin, or abrupt policy adjustments.

Tax policy developments over the last year have been dramatic, to say the least, but the offsetting effects of OBBBA and tariffs make the net effects on the economy and the fisc less consequential in aggregate. The permanent features of OBBBA, primarily the extension of TCJA’s pro-growth tax cuts, put the economy on a sound footing. It remains a major challenge for lawmakers to address the unsustainable fiscal trajectory while maintaining or improving the ability of the tax code to support economic growth over the long run.

There was a buzz in town in late October when Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, visited, though it was unclear what drew him to Homer City.
It also urged state utility regulators, who are drafting a policy on data centers, to issue one that does not saddle data centers with costs that might “push” them out of state.
“From start to finish, the Homer City Energy Campus will be developed in partnership with skilled local craftsmen and will bring quality, good-paying jobs back to the Homer City community,” Gorman said.
But in Homer City, it’s clear that there’s an appetite for the promise of a new, job-producing industry, regardless of hurdles.","As the September evening inched along, the line of residents waiting their turn for the microphone held steady. Filing down the auditorium aisles at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania, they were armed with questions about a new gas plant slated for their community.

Sitting quietly in the audience was John Dudash. For decades he’s lived in Homer City, a southwestern Pennsylvania town that was once home to the largest coal-fired power plant in the state. The plant, which shares its name with the town, closed nearly three years ago after years of financial distress.

Dudash, 89, has lived in the shadow of its smokestacks — said to be the tallest in the country before they were demolished — for much of his life. At its peak, the Homer City power plant employed hundreds of people and could deploy about 2 gigawatts of energy, enough to power 2 million homes

It was also a major source of air pollution, spewing sulfur dioxide and mercury, both of which pose serious health risks. Today, Dudash wonders if the pollution might have exacerbated the lung issues that claimed his wife’s life six years ago.

The proposed gas plant, expected to be up and running in 2027, will replace the old coal-fired power station, but with more than double the energy output — 4.5 gigawatts of energy. The new plant also will have the potential to emit 17.5 million tons of planet-heating greenhouse gasses per year, the equivalent of putting millions of cars on the road.

And it will serve a new purpose: Rather than primarily sending electrons to the regional grid to power homes or businesses, the new power plant will exist mainly to feed data centers planned on the site.

As the hearing wore on that September night, Dudash, a conservationist, did not stand to speak; instead, he sat quietly, taking mental notes. The next morning, he emailed two staffers at the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.

“First of all, the project will not be stopped,” he began, with resignation. He went on to offer a few caveats — among them, advice about air monitoring.

His letter reached the agency alongside more than 550 comments on a key air permit for the proposed plant, a testament to the project’s complexity. After the permit was approved Nov. 18, Dudash’s prediction began to look remarkably accurate — though the Homer City plant still has about a dozen additional permits awaiting approval before the project can be completed, including one that would impact several acres of wetlands and hundreds of feet of a local stream.

Though it is among many energy sites popping up to power the artificial intelligence boom across Pennsylvania, the Homer City facility is unique for its size, its advertised economic potential — the owners have promised the project will generate more than 10,000 construction-related jobs — and for its likely environmental impact. It has earned the backing of President Donald Trump, who called it “the largest plant of its kind in the world,” a distinction its owners could not verify. There was a buzz in town in late October when Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, visited, though it was unclear what drew him to Homer City.

“I don’t really trust the people who are coming in to build and run the place,” Dudash said. “I do not agree with the artificial intelligence portion of it.”

“They’re going to have to sacrifice the environment for these jobs,” he added. “In Appalachia, we’ve been doing that for years.”

When the old plant sputtered to a close in 2023, it left the surrounding community — which was built on the local abundance of coal — in search of an economic lifeline. Now, the data center boom sweeping the country brings promise of such a rebirth for communities like Homer City — though this promise is one that some experts say may be less than billed. And, it comes with risks.

The new power plant will be much larger than its predecessor and is permitted to emit more than twice as much of some pollutants as its predecessor did. The data center, or centers, it powers would also consume a tremendous amount of water — perhaps more than its host townships can spare, some fear.

Artificial intelligence requires vast amounts of electricity and has the potential to offer a lifeline to the fossil fuel industry. Though some in the community are sanguine about the promise of jobs, experts say the reality for many living around data centers may fall short. Some are left wondering exactly who the new plant is for — them or some faraway tech companies.

The Homer City project is far from alone in its emergence: The nonprofit Fractracker has identified 39 planned data centers in the works across Pennsylvania. Tech companies like Microsoft and Amazon are moving in, alongside others intrigued by the state’s rich legacy of power production, deep natural gas reserves and generous subsidies. In July, Republican U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick, from eastern Pennsylvania, held a conference in Pittsburgh during which companies announced more than $90 billion in data center investments and related energy infrastructure.

This tech boom largely has bipartisan support, including from Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat who said at a June press conference that he is committed to “ensuring the future of AI runs right through Pennsylvania.” Legislators in Harrisburg, meanwhile, are introducing bills that would both spur the burgeoning industry and give it guardrails.

The extent to which the Homer City facility’s owners have lobbied for supportive legislation is not clear. The company’s lobbying registration with the Pennsylvania Department of State goes back only to January 2025. It has, however, spent at the local level. In November, for instance, the company gave a community nonprofit $25,000 for a holiday food drive. It also urged state utility regulators, who are drafting a policy on data centers, to issue one that does not saddle data centers with costs that might “push” them out of state.

Meanwhile, communities are pushing back and the environmental nonprofit Food & Water Watch recently called for a nationwide moratorium on new data center construction. More than 200 other groups later joined them in making such a plea to Congress. On the ground in Homer City, a coalition of neighbors have formed Concerned Residents of Western Pennsylvania to oppose the project.

The Homer City proposal is the brainchild of the same private equity owners that closed the plant in 2023 — after years of financial difficulty and two bankruptcies. Two firms own close to 90% of the plant, with New York City-based Knighthead Capital Management holding the vast majority of that. It’s part of a wave of private equity investment in the data center industry. In March, the owners, operating under an LLC called Homer City Redevelopment, toppled the plant’s signature smokestacks. A few weeks later, they announced that the plant would reopen with a data center customer, or suite of customers, to be announced as soon as 2026.

Critics fear the new plant will require a lot more water than its predecessor. The supercomputers that data centers house whirr away around the clock, and need to be routinely cooled down. Some data center companies have introduced recycled water into their systems. Homer City Redevelopment has not said if their data center clients will be among them.

In 2014, U.S. data centers used 21.2 billion liters of water, enough to fill nearly 9,000 Olympic-size swimming pools. That number tripled by 2023, with the vast majority of the water consumed by “hyperscale,” or large, facilities like Homer City. In states like Colorado, where water use has, for decades, been meticulously planned and negotiated, data centers are threatening to strain such finely tuned systems.

Dudash, the longtime Homer City resident, is concerned about a similar fate. “I’m not sure how they’re going to handle the water,” he told Capital & Main after the September hearing.

The power plant has, since 1968, been allotted an uncapped amount of water from Two Lick Reservoir, a 5 billion gallon, dammed-off portion of a creek that the plant’s former owners built explicitly for its use.

The power plant shares the water with a utility that serves two local communities — Indiana borough and the broader White Township — as part of a 1988 drought management plan to prevent and respond to catastrophic weather conditions. The borough of Homer City gets its water from Yellow Creek, a tributary of Two Lick Creek, which serves the reservoir and picks up the slack in the event of a drought.

“Should the Two Lick Creek Reservoir be emptied, [the water utility] would not be able to provide sufficient water to protect public health and safety in their service area,” the drought management plan reads.

In 1985, the delicate system between Two Lick and Yellow Creek was strained when the then-Homer City plant drew so much water from the reservoir that it led to a drought. “Had a significant rainfall not occurred … the reservoir may have faced total depletion,” the drought management planreads.

A report from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection shows that the water utility drawing from Two Lick has, in recent years, routinely used nearly half its allotted amount. But critics fear that allocation could be at risk once a data center opens and starts drawing water.

Robin Gorman, a spokesperson for Homer City Redevelopment, told Capital & Main that it plans to leave cooling and water-use decisions to its data center clients, making it unclear how much water will be needed to keep all the computers running, or where that water would come from.

Rob Nymick, Homer City’s former borough manager, who serves as manager of the Central Indiana County Water Authority, told Capital & Main that he is confident local municipalities can share water resources with the planned gas plant. But the data centers could be a different story.

“I do know that data centers do require a tremendous amount of water,” Nymick said. “That’s something we probably cannot provide.”

Nymick said that community officials are operating with “limited knowledge,” and that during the handful of meetings they have held with Homer City Redevelopment, “The only thing that they wanted to discuss is the actual power plant.”

Eric Barker, who grew up in Homer City, attended the September hearing with restrained optimism. “The power plant was a source of pride and is a source of pride for the community,” he said. “There’s not too many large employers in Indiana County,” he added.

But he found little comfort at the September hearing.

The Department of Environmental Protection “seemed woefully, woefully, comically underprepared,” Barker said, citing a response he received to a question about the types of pollutants that would increase under the new Homer City proposal, compared to what was emitted by the old plant. Barker was told the agency would look into it and get back to him.

“Some questions and concerns were raised at the public meeting regarding the plan approval about matters beyond the limited scope of the meeting,” said Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection spokesperson Tom Decker in a statement. “Interested parties are encouraged to look to the DEP’s extensive website, including its community page dedicated to the Homer City project, for resources addressing such questions and concerns.”

Despite the questions that followed, the department, on the whole, signaled satisfaction with the Homer City plant’s air permit application at the hearing. “What’s being proposed is what we consider state-of-the-art emission controls,” said Dave Balog, environmental engineering manager at the department’s northwest regional office.

Environmental nonprofits Citizens for Pennsylvania’s Future, Clean Air Council, the Sierra Club and Earthjustice countered in a 44-page comment on a draft of the key air permit that the application does not incorporate the best tools for mitigating pollutants such as ammonia, which is known to cause respiratory issues and other health risks. The Department of Environmental Protection agreed with Homer City Redevelopment’s analyses of its best available technology, and the permit was granted.

As Homer City’s smokestacks imploded and fell to the ground last March, leaving only a gray cloud, Dudash wondered what particulates might be in the dusty mix. While there were rumors in town that asbestos might be among them, the Department of Environmental Protection told Capital & Main that the site was inspected for the substance before it was demolished and none was found.

Still, coal dust, fly ash and silica particulates are all possible during such implosions, an agency representative said. In the months since, residents have complained of repeated blasts from the site rattling their houses. As of January, the blasts occurred daily.

But the particulates that drift from the old plant during the blasts may pale in comparison to the carbon dioxide emissions the new power plant is predicted to release. The key air permit the Department of Environmental Protection issued to the facility allows it to release up to 17.5 million tons of the heat-trapping gas, like carbon dioxide, per year — the equivalent of putting 3.6 million gas-powered vehicles on the road annually. In 2010, according to federal data, the plant emitted just over 11 million tons of greenhouse gasses. In 2023, when it was operating at a fraction of its capacity, it emitted 1.3 million.

In their comment to regulators, the nonprofit environmental groups said that the carbon dioxide emissions would be triple those of any polluting facility in the state, representing 6% of Pennsylvania’s total emissions. The new plant will emit sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides, two classes of respiratory irritants, but at rates lower than the old plant. The nonprofit Clean Air Council condemned regulators’ issuance of the air permit, calling it a “death sentence.” Along with PennFuture and the Sierra Club, the Council appealed the permit in December.

The owners said the emissions from the new plant will result in a 35%-40% reduction in carbon dioxide compared to the old plant, but the calculation does not account for the new plant’s larger size. Instead, it is per-megawatt hour, meaning per unit of energy generated. Natural gas is less emissions-intensive than coal when burned, but because the Homer City plant will generate more than double the energy of its predecessor, its overall emissions profile is expected to be higher.

As the state grapples with extreme weather events such as flooding due to global warming, locking in carbon emissions is the wrong direction to go, the environmental nonprofits argue. On an annual basis, the plant will be permitted to emit hundreds of tons of respiratory irritants like particulate matter and nitrogen oxides, and dozens of tons of formaldehyde, a carcinogen. It will also emit health-harming compounds like toluene, xylene, and ethylbenzene.

Additional emissions are likely to come from the natural gas drilling that will be required to power the site.

In 2024, Nymick told Capital & Main that the borough was struggling to find a new economic engine. “We’re fighting for our survival,” he said at the time. Data center industry advocates contend that the data center gold rush will be a boon for communities like Homer City, where boarded-up storefronts line the main street.

“For every one job in a data center, six jobs are supported elsewhere in the economy,” said Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy for the Data Center Coalition, an industry trade group, at a hearing in the state Capitol in October.

Sean O’Leary, senior researcher at the nonprofit thinktank the Ohio River Valley Institute, said the reality isn’t that rosy. The average data center employs as few as 10 people and as many as 110, per his own calculations based in part on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The computers inside them can generally run on their own with limited maintenance.

Even in a rural county like Indiana, O’Leary said, “One hundred is a rounding error. It just doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter if they’re paid $200,000 a year. It’s not enough to make a significant change in the status of the local economy.”

In a recent report on the data center boom in natural gas economies in Appalachia, O’Leary said gas-powered data centers represent the combination of “three non-labor-intensive industries” — fracking, power plants and data centers. “Stacking [them] on top of each other does not alter the underlying dynamic which ties them together.”

Ron Airhart, a former coal miner and executive assistant to the secretary-treasurer of the United Mine Workers of America, is more optimistic about the economic potential of the new Homer City facility.

Still, he concedes that it will never be what the old plant was. “Yes, building a gas fired power plant is going to create a lot of construction jobs, there’s no doubt about that,” he said. “But once it’s done, how many actual employees are you going to have working there?”

He quickly added, “But, I’m glad they are doing something with the old power plant there.”

Gorman told Capital & Main that Homer City Redevelopment and its construction partner, Kiewit, are planning to hire from local unions and building trades. They foresee 10,000 construction jobs. They also anticipate the site will create 1,000 “direct and indirect” permanent jobs, including those hired at the facility itself and those brought aboard for supportive positions, such as suppliers.

“From start to finish, the Homer City Energy Campus will be developed in partnership with skilled local craftsmen and will bring quality, good-paying jobs back to the Homer City community,” Gorman said.

O’Leary said the jobs numbers such as those projected by the Data Center Coalition are inflated, similar to the employment projections made before the fracking boom in rural Appalachia. He said such projections are a detriment to communities, in part because taxpayers shoulder the cost of subsidies to attract the industry to the state, such as a sales and use tax exemption for data centers that Pennsylvania codified in 2021. Gov. Shapiro has estimatedthat the credit will expand to about $50 million per year for the next five years.

Local residents are also burdened with rising utility bills. The surging demand for electricity is straining the region’s power supplies, increasing what utilities pay for electricity. New power plants coming onto the grid must install transmission equipment, the costs of which they share with consumers. These economic factors, in sum, could outweigh the benefits of the new jobs the data center creates, O’Leary said.

Earlier this year, the grid operator for the region that encompasses Pennsylvania, PJM, saw electricity prices surge by roughly 1,000% from two years ago. Some of that cost is expected to be passed onto customers.

“We have a problem, and that problem is real, and it is exponential electricity load growth causing exponential price increases for consumers,” said Patrick Cicero, former consumer advocate for the state of Pennsylvania and now an attorney for the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project, at the October hearing in Harrisburg.

“In the context of Grandma versus Google,” Cicero said, referring to older residents faced with high bills, “Grandma should win every day. That should be the policy statement of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.”

Federal and state lawmakers are still determining how and whether to regulate the additional costs that data centers pass onto consumers, including for fees associated with transmission throughout the grid. A bill that would create such a process while establishing renewable energy mandates for data centers is now being weighed by Pennsylvania representatives.

Dennis Wamsted, energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, predicts such costs add complications for data centers, and has argued that their demand as a whole is overblown. Supply chain delays spurred by surging demand for turbines, including thosethat Homer City will be using, could also create additional costs and lag times, he said.

“If there is an AI bubble and it bursts,” he said, “you would have built all this capacity that wasn’t needed.”

Homer City’s owners said the plant is better positioned than others in the industry since it isn’t starting from scratch.

“Much of the critical infrastructure for the project is already in place from the legacy Homer City coal plant, including transmission lines connected to the PJM and NYISO power grids, substations and water access,” Gorman, the spokesperson, said.

Communities on the front lines of these projects would be the first hurt by a project that fails to materialize.

But in Homer City, it’s clear that there’s an appetite for the promise of a new, job-producing industry, regardless of hurdles.

At the September hearing, many in the crowd wore neon shirts with union logos — a signal of the region’s fierce pride in its industrial past, and deep thirst for an economic boon. After an evening peppered with skepticism over the plant, Shawn Steffee, a business agent at the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, stepped to the microphone.

“Everybody speaking about jobs,” he cried, “there will be jobs, and there will be local jobs.”

LONGi Green expects a loss of RMB6-6.5 billion in 2025, down 25-30% from the RMB8.618 billion loss recorded in 2024.
LONGi attributes this improvement to the advantages of its technological routes, which have become the core driver of the company’s loss reduction.
Meanwhile, it leads the industry in loss reduction, with its deficit narrowing by 64-77%, demonstrating the remarkable results of its technological upgrade.
Several companies disclosed that they had achieved varying degrees of loss reduction in the first three quarters of 2025.","While the industry’s deep adjustment continues, the loss amounts and trajectories of the five companies diverge significantly. Tongwei is expected to post the largest loss of the five, of RMB9-10 billion. Notably, it is the only company with a widening loss margin. Pressures across multiple business lines and asset impairments have emerged as the primary drag on its performance.

The announcement indicates that the company incurred an operating loss of RMB7.5-8 billion in 2025, representing a year-on-year increase in losses of RMB1.2-1.7 billion. Within this, losses from the industrial silicon business amounted to approximately RMB900 million, while losses from the cell and module segments grew by RMB1.2 billion compared to the previous year. Coupled with external factors such as the slowdown in new PV installations in H2 of the year and the sharp rise in silver prices, the loss range was further enlarged, along with an impairment provision for long-term assets of RMB1.5-2 billion.

TCL Zhonghuan follows with an estimated loss of RMB8.2-9.6 billion, representing a reduced deficit compared with 2024. However, the company continues to face significant operational challenges due to persistently low prices in the core PV industry chain, poor cost pass-through and mounting pressure from the rising prices of raw materials such as polysilicon and silver in Q4.

LONGi Green expects a loss of RMB6-6.5 billion in 2025, down 25-30% from the RMB8.618 billion loss recorded in 2024. LONGi attributes this improvement to the advantages of its technological routes, which have become the core driver of the company’s loss reduction. Through the cell technology upgrade and product structure optimisation, the company’s profit margins have been restored.

However, the significant price rise of core raw materials such as silver paste and polysilicon in Q4 somewhat weighed on performance, preventing a more substantial reduction in losses.

JA Solar expects a loss of RMB4.5-4.8 billion in 2025, roughly flat compared with the RMB4.65 billion loss in 2024 (representing a year-on-year change of -3.09% to +3.09%). In 2025, the supply-demand imbalance in the PV industry persisted, and end-market module prices remained depressed. JA Solar achieved a phased reduction in losses in the first three quarters, but the surge in raw material prices and pricing pressure in Q4 erased these gains, bringing the full-year performance back to the same loss level as last year.

Aiko Solar, with an estimated loss of RMB1.2-1.9 billion, emerges as the best performer among the five in terms of loss control. Meanwhile, it leads the industry in loss reduction, with its deficit narrowing by 64-77%, demonstrating the remarkable results of its technological upgrade. Focusing on ‘ABC ‘all back contact’ (ABC) cell technology, Aiko Solar saw its ABC module sales more than double in 2025 compared to the previous year, with its market share and brand recognition growing steadily both domestically and internationally. This has driven the optimisation of its shipment mix and improved profitability. Despite remaining in the red due to structural overcapacity in the industry and poor cost pass-through between upstream and downstream, the significant loss reduction validates the correctness of its technological route and lays a solid foundation for future profitability.

In addition to the supply-demand imbalance, cost pressure has emerged as the key factor behind the losses. Several companies disclosed that they had achieved varying degrees of loss reduction in the first three quarters of 2025. However, since Q4, the sustained rise in prices of core raw materials, such as silver and polysilicon, coupled with depressed end-product prices and slumping operating rates across the industry chain, has severely squeezed corporate profit margins.

Judging from the performance of the five companies, the PV industry has been mired in widespread losses for several consecutive quarters, with the cyclical supply-demand imbalance still not being alleviated. However, the trend of corporate divergence has further intensified. Tongwei and TCL Zhonghuan, which reported larger losses, are more directly affected by fierce upstream competition and inadequate cost pass-through in the wafer segment. In contrast, LONGi Green and Aiko Solar have achieved significant loss reduction thanks to their technological advantages.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tongwei-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 18:00:15.974366

One of the key points of contention in these ongoing legal disputes is a fundamental jurisdictional question: should companies that acted under federal wartime authority be judged in federal court or state court?
If state courts can retroactively punish federal wartime operations, then any company assisting the government in a future crisis—from energy to defense manufacturing—faces enormous legal risk.
Wartime energy production is one integrated national operation—from crude extraction to refining and fuel delivery.
The state’s LNG export terminals at Sabine Pass and Calcasieu Pass, its offshore platforms supplying the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and its refineries stabilizing global markets are critical to national defense.","When America goes to war, its strength depends not only on soldiers and ships but on the partnership between government and private enterprise. From the refineries of Baton Rouge to the Gulf’s industrial corridors, civilian energy producers have long powered U.S. defense. However, that partnership is now threatened by a wave of lawsuits in Louisiana that could weaken wartime readiness and discourage the very companies America relies on in times of crisis.

Over 40 lawsuits – driven in large part by the Pelican State’s powerful trial lawyers – have been filed by several Louisiana parishes in an attempt to hold energy companies liable for coastal damage that is alleged to have arisen from a result of their oil and gas production. But much of the activity they target took place under federal orders during World War II, when Washington directed producers to extract crude oil for aviation fuel. These companies worked under federal authority and in service to the nation. Punishing them decades later for following lawful wartime directives sends a dangerous message: answering the call of duty can lead to financial ruin. This is a national-security risk we cannot afford—and one that must be avoided.

One of the key points of contention in these ongoing legal disputes is a fundamental jurisdictional question: should companies that acted under federal wartime authority be judged in federal court or state court? The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Monday January 12th about this very matter. It is important that they get this question right as the decision will have sweeping consequences for America’s national security.

Louisiana parishes want these cases heard in state court, where state-law claims and plaintiff-friendly procedures give them a strategic advantage. The companies argue that because the conduct occurred under federal direction and involved national wartime procurement, the cases belong in federal court, where questions of federal authority, national defense, and historical wartime directives can be properly evaluated.

This is not just a procedural dispute. If state courts can retroactively punish federal wartime operations, then any company assisting the government in a future crisis—from energy to defense manufacturing—faces enormous legal risk. That reality has alarmed senior American military leaders.

In an amicus brief to the Supreme Court, former Joint Chiefs of Staff General Richard Myers and Admiral Michael Mullen wrote, “From our perspective garnered through decades of service and leadership throughout all levels of our military, it seems obvious to us that suits relating to federally mandated and directed oil production must be adjudicated in a federal forum.” They warned that “the Fifth Circuit’s opinion entirely misses the mark when it holds that production of crude oil is separate from production of refined high-octane aviation gasoline.”

Their point is simple. Wartime energy production is one integrated national operation—from crude extraction to refining and fuel delivery. To suggest otherwise ignores the coordination between the Petroleum Administration for War (PAW), War Production Board (WPB), federal regulators, and private industry that made victory in World War II possible. As Myers and Mullen noted, “The Fifth Circuit ignored the circumstances in which the parties entered and fulfilled these contracts, including federal regulations, PAW and WPB demands, and the end-product contracts themselves.”

The findings of the courts may very well decide the future energy course America will chart. Energy abundance allows the United States to sustain allies, impose sanctions on adversaries, and act without fear of shortages. Louisiana remains central to America’s energy security. The state’s LNG export terminals at Sabine Pass and Calcasieu Pass, its offshore platforms supplying the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and its refineries stabilizing global markets are critical to national defense. But litigation like Louisiana’s coastal erosion lawsuits threaten to curb domestic production, strengthening OPEC’s leverage and giving regimes like Iran and Russia greater control over global energy flows.

The contradiction is clear. While Washington works to rebuild the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and expand LNG exports to Europe, Louisiana’s leadership is suing the very companies making those efforts possible. Potential future conflicts in the Indo-Pacific or Middle East will demand vast quantities of jet fuel and diesel but every dollar spent on litigation is a dollar not invested in new LNG capacity, refinery upgrades, or hardened infrastructure that would be needed to support that effort.

The Supreme Court now has an opportunity to restore balance. As Myers and Mullen warned, “Remanding to state court creates a serious risk that, in the future, private industry will not readily answer the federal government’s call when the nation needs it most.” Confirming that federally directed wartime operations belong in federal court is more than procedural—it is essential to strengthening our readiness.

As Myers and Mullins concluded in their brief “our nation needs private parties to answer the call when asked to use their expertise to assist our national defense.” From the Liberty ships of World War II to the LNG tankers supplying allies today, America’s strength has always depended on its ability to produce energy at home. Louisiana’s lawsuits threaten to break that link. Protecting our future means protecting those who power it.

The charger money, which was originally included in the 2021 Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act that was a signature law signed by former President Joe Biden, is part of $2.3 billion in ""wasteful Democrat priorities"" that would be redirected to another priorities, according to Republican leaders on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.

The Biden-era EV charger money has been at the center of legal fights since the start of the second Trump administration in January 2025. The Trump administration initially attempted to eliminate the funding unilaterally, but a court ordered the U.S. Department of Transportation to move forward with the funding that was previously appropriated.

What will the elimination of charger money mean for EV drivers?

Car buyers have been telling pollsters for years that they have major concerns about the battery range of electric cars. The concern has bubbled so often that it has been dubbed ""range anxiety.""

According to new poll released on Monday, Jan. 12 by the EVs for All America group, which is an advocacy group that works with car manufacturers to push U.S. and state lawmakers to adopt EV-friendly policies, 20% of 600 respondents to a poll intended to survey potential EV buyers in 2025 said their top concern about plug-in models is the charger networks being unreliable.

The same poll showed 65% of respondents said they would rather charge their batteries at home for a seven-to-eight-hour period to achieve a full charge, while only 29% said they would rather opt for a 30-minute charge at a public facility that would achieve 80% battery life.

The funding in the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program that was included in the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law that is now on the chopping block was supposed to help fix that. The law included $5 billion in funding for states to boost U.S. charging infrastructure that is set to wind down in 2026. The law also included another $2.5 billion that was set aside for competitive grants that would allow states to build chargers in alternative fuel corridors and under privileged areas.

The funding was hailed at the time as a game changer for the task of building out a nationwide network of chargers that would be placed along federal highways as the Biden administration was trying to boost U.S. EV adoptions.

The U.S. Department of Transportation said in an August 2024 press release that was issued under Biden that the number of publicly available EV chargers had doubled under the previous administration.

The DOT said at that time there were ""over 192,000 publicly available charging ports with approximately 1,000 new public chargers being added each week.""

Will EV adoption suffer if the charger money is eliminated?

The charger money has long been a target of President Trump and Congressional Republicans, along with $7,500 tax credits for EV car buyers that were eliminated last year.

After the elimination of the $7,500 tax credit in September 2025, U.S. EV sales declined sharply.

Carmakers sold more than 1.2 million electric cars in 2025, despite major headwinds in the form of disappearing federal tax credits for plug-in models and tariffs imposed on imported cars and parts.

According to new data released on Tuesday, Jan. 13 by Cox Automotive, carmakers sold 1,275,714 electric cars in 2025, which was good enough to compose nearly 8% of overall U.S. auto sales for the year. But the industry-wide EV sales number was also down 2% from the 1,301,441 electric cars that auto manufacturers sold in 2024.

Cox said the overall EV sales number for 2025 was padded by a rush among car buyers to buy electric models in the third quarter of 2025 before the expiration of the popular $7,500 tax credit. Carmakers sold 365,830 EVs in the third quarter, compared to just 234,171 in the fourth quarter.

What people are saying about the potential charger funding cut

Republican leaders have said all the Biden-era moves to boost plug-in cars amounted to an ""EV mandate"" that Trump promised to repeal on the first day of his second presidency.

Once it was under Trump's control, the Federal Highway Administration in February 2025 suspended the program in one of several actions directed by President Donald Trump to eliminate federal support for wider adoption of EVs by consumers. A federal court in June 2025 blocked the suspension, ruling that the Transportation Department’s move overstepped its authority and attempted to override the will of Congress.

Congress is now attempting to codify the elimination of the EV charger funding in the new funding bill for the Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development.

The Sierra Club environmental group countered that the move to eliminate the federal charger money would imperil efforts to build out the promise nationwide charger network that EV manufacturers have said they desperately need to convince more Americans to consider buying plug-in models.

“Americans shouldn’t be punished for the Trump administration’s attempts to rob states of reliable electric vehicle charging that will benefit our wallets, air, and climate,"" Sierra Club Clean Transportation for All Director Katherine García said in a statement.

""We urge members of Congress to leave this funding alone,"" García continued. ""States must be able to access the full amount they were promised and are relying on as they work to build essential infrastructure in our communities.”","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/NRRS/86751583007-2177843462.jpg?crop=7738,4354,x0,y402&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-21 14:00:40.110462

It’s a huge, lucrative market — comprising around half of new-car sales in the U.S. — but one that few electric vehicles have managed to enter. In 2026, however, that will change. Carmakers are planning to roll out at least six new electric SUVs in the U.S. this year with price tags at or below $35,000, products that could help a ease a slowdown in EV sales.

“EVs have to move more into the mass market and there are launches that are now squarely hitting that,” said Nathan Niese, Boston Consulting Group’s global lead for electric vehicles. “It’s what’s going to prop up what otherwise would be a down year.”

EV sales have surged in recent years, as carmakers improved range and charging speed, while federal incentives helped entice buyers. Relatively high costs, however, remained the last speed bump to mass adoption. Of the roughly 60 electric cars and trucks for sale in the U.S. last year, only three could be had for less than $35,000; the median starting sticker price was $59,100, nearly $10,000 higher than the average price for all vehicles.

When federal subsidies disappeared in September, EV sales swooned. The message for the c-suites of Detroit was clear: Price is at least as important as powertrain preference, if not more. Many auto executives have since slowed their EV plans and shifted some production back to gas-powered models that they can build (and price) more affordably.

“Anything you can do to make a customer feel you’ve given them a more affordable product is an advantage to them right now,” said Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas Public Policy.

The good news for auto executives: a steady drop in battery prices has improved the economics of EVs, opening a lane for small new models.

“The end of the EV subsidies does not necessarily spell bad news across the board,” BloombergNEF analyst Huiling Zhou wrote in a recent report. “Carmakers that can cut costs and offer affordable models in the most desirable vehicle segments are likely to see sustained sales growth.”

Here’s a look at the EVs that will likely find plenty of interest in 2026.

Nissan Leaf

Nissan has long known the sales magic of an affordable EV. Since its debut 15 years ago, the Leaf has parked itself in nearly 1 million households’ driveways and garages, despite its modest range and quirky, hatchback design. For the 2026 iteration, Nissan overhauled the car for the first time in nearly eight years, upsizing it to the SUV category. The end result seems to have shed many of the model’s quirks and compromises.

For one, the new Leaf no longer looks “cartoonish”, according to reviewers. Gone is the near-obsolete CHAdeMo charging port that’s akin to a Betamax videotape, replaced by a traditional CCS charging receptacle on the driver’s side and a NACS port (better known as the Tesla plug) on the passenger’s side. It does retain one important feature of past Leafs: The new model still slips under the $30,000 threshold.

Chevrolet Bolt

General Motors has a similar overhaul in the works for its Chevrolet Bolt, another affordable machine that won a crowd of buyers right up until the company pulled the plug on the model in 2023. Chevy revealed the resurrected iteration of the small SUV in October and it’s set to go on sale early this year. The car looks pretty much the same and the driving range is similar, but the reborn Bolt is powered by a new battery that will cost far less and charge far more quickly than the previous version. The Bolt also has GM’s hands-free driving system — dubbed Super Cruise — and is now capable of bidirectional charging, which means it can provide power in a blackout or whenever else you need it.

Toyota C-HR BEV

The company calls the coming C-HR a “coupe-like SUV.” While the description reads like an oxymoron, it’s one that plays well with US tastes in car design. The machine is big enough for a hefty Costco run, but small enough to park in a compact space. And the new Toyota ride offers nearly 300 miles of range while coming with standard all-wheel drive, which typically compromises efficiency. Toyota teamed up with Subaru to develop the platform for this new small electric SUV, a bit of cost-sharing that will help keep the sticker price around $35,000.

Subaru Uncharted

The Subaru side of the Toyota partnership is the Uncharted, an SUV that will be a little smaller than the brand’s other electric offering, the Solterra. With the base model — starting around $35,000 — buyers can forgo all-wheel drive for about 15 more miles between charges. Among SUV owners, Subaru ranks second in brand loyalty, meaning Crosstrek and Outback drivers waiting to go electric will finally have more than one option.

Kia EV3

Kia has already checked the “medium” and “large” boxes in its EV product line; now, it’s steering for small. The EV3, which is expected to sell for about $35,000, will slide just behind the brand’s EV6 size-wise even as its boxy design echoes the EV9, a bulky, three-row SUV. Kia is also planning to give buyers some unique color choices, from “shale grey” to “frost clue.”

Slate

Cheap EVs aren’t just the realm of incumbents. Startup Slate is swooping in with plans to deliver its first machine by year-end. The company’s first vehicle, which can be converted from pickup to SUV, is to a Ford F-150 what an Ikea futon is to a Pottery Barn sectional. The base version — the company calls it “the blank Slate” — is best described by what it isn’t. It lacks a touchscreen, cooled seats, all-wheel drive and a stereo. What Slate promises in return is a sticker price in the mid-$20,000s.

At the company’s launch event last year, Chief Executive Officer Chris Barman delivered what has since become a bit of a stump speech for cheap EVs. “The definition of what’s affordable is broken,” she said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a7141db/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6548x3438+0+464/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F67%2F05%2Fd6e89b3741ada602592b1fe2bec3%2F1523819-fi-oc-auto-show-ev-demand-gxc-0480.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 13:01:59.710197

Policy makers at the US Department of Energy have their hearts set on restoring coal to a commanding place in the nation’s power generation profile, but the effort is doomed to fail. The domestic coal industry took a hit from natural gas in the early 2000s, followed by a fresh round of competition from low-cost wind and solar, and now it is about to get a drubbing from geothermal energy.

The US Geothermal Industry Is Beginning To Spread Its Wings

If you don’t have a geothermal power plant in your part of the US, join the club. Until recent years, geothermal energy was limited to just a handful of locations concentrated in the Western states, where nature provides economical combinations of heat, rock, and water.

New drilling technology is beginning to open up new territories for geothermal exploitation, and the US startup Zanskar has come up with another way to tease more renewable energy from deep within the Earth. The company has developed its own custom-built AI to find new fields.

Identifying previously unknown fields is just one part of a broader challenge. The other part is to find them efficiently and economically, and that’s where AI comes in.

“We started Zanskar with the belief that AI would have as profound an impact on geothermal cost and scalability as modern drilling technologies have,” explains Zanskar co-founder and CEO Carl Hoiland. “It would do so by enabling us to find more hidden geothermal systems, and to produce more power from each of those systems, than legacy models assumed.”

Follow The Money To The Geothermal Anomolies

Zanskar surfaced briefly on the CleanTechnica radar in 2024, as part of a suite of startups engaged by the US Air Force to plumb for renewable energy on its facilities.

In the latest development, earlier today Zanskar announced a new round of Series C funding to the tune of $115 million, with Spring Lane Capital taking the lead.

“Zanskar is unique in that they have identified more geothermal anomalies in North America than any other company in decades,” Spring Lane Partner Jason Scott says of the company’s AI-driven business model.

In a show of confidence, Series B leader Obvious Ventures also participated in Round C, as did Series A co-leader Lowercarbon Capital.

“While other more costly approaches dig deep enough until heat is hopefully found, Zanskar can efficiently identify and unlock the more than 40 GW of untapped geothermal potential in the US much closer to the surface,” Lowercarbon Capital explains.

“Their precise subsurface vision halves the failure rate and drops drilling costs to $2m per well. Their suite of tools can be used for failing wells (repower), new wells at existing sites (brownfield), and new wells at new sites,” the firm adds.

The list of Round C participants also includes Munich Re Ventures, Susquehanna Sustainable Investments, Clearvision Ventures, Orion Industrial Ventures, Safar Partners, Imperative Ventures, StepStone Group, University Growth Fund, Cross Creek, GVP Climate, Tranquillion, Carica Sustainable Investments, UP.Partners, and All Aboard Fund, among others.

Regardless of the abrupt U-turn in federal energy policy, Zanskar plans to leverage its Series C haul to expand its current operations to multiple locations in the Western US, with the aim of delivering the clean kilowatts before 2030. That easily beats the timeline for constructing new coal, gas, and nuclear power plants.

“This Series C positions Zanskar for rapid growth by enabling the company to advance its gigawatt-scale pipeline through a historic geothermal exploration and development campaign,” Zanskar emphasizes, adding that plans for engaging additional strategic partners and customers are also in the works.

US Air Force Hearts Geothermal Energy

It’s no surprise to see the US Air Force emerge as a geothermal energy supporter. They have been on the prowl for energy resources that can be harvested on site, reducing their reliance on outside resources, including grid-supplied electricity as well as the fossil fuels needed for on-site power and heating systems. The Air Force was an early adopter of solar energy, and now attention has turned to geothermal.

In 2023 the Air Force began planning for two prototype-level projects at Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho and Joint Base San Antonio in Texas, with Zanskar assigned to Mountain Home and the Canadian firm Eavor taking Joint Base San Antonio.

“We are in an era of strategic competition with China, which means that our installations are no longer a sanctuary from the full spectrum of threats,” observed Dr. Ravi Chaudhary, who served as Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Energy, Installations, and Environment at the time.

“We need to ruggedize our installations with redundant energy systems and make use of clean energy sources that reduce our fuel demands,” Chaudhary added. “Geothermal sources strengthen our energy grids and give us the ability to isolate threats before they impact our operations. This type of capability will translate into victory in a high-end fight.”

From The US Air Force To Your Backyard

As of 2023, both the Zanskar and Eavor projects had a long way to go, with feasibility studies to be conducted before construction. In the meantime, though, the Air Force was already anticipating that its early-adopter status would help support a broader uptake of new geothermal systems across the US.

“The use of these technologies has the potential to expand beyond Air Force and Department of Defense installations to benefit communities across the United States,” the Air Force stated.

I’m reaching out to Zanskar to see if any updates are available on the Mountain Home project. In the meantime, the company emphasizes that its new system can also give existing geothermal facilities a fresh shot of adrenaline, as illustrated by the Lightning Dock project in New Mexico.

“We’ve already confirmed multiple large, previously unknown geothermal resources across the Western U.S., and deeper drilling has validated that these systems can produce far more energy than expected,” Hoiland adds.

What’s Next For Geothermal Energy

If you’re wondering how all this comports with the current US focus on fossil energy, that’s a good question. Despite the insistence on “beautiful” coal, in January of 2025, the White House announced that biomass and hydropower are also deserving of federal support, alongside fossil and nuclear energy. In February, Energy Secretary Chris Wright added geothermal energy to the list.

That’s not just Wright’s lips moving. On January 7 of this year, the Energy Department announced its intention to ramp up geothermal activity in Western states and help the geothermal industry expand eastward, with an initial focus on Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawai’i, Idaho, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, and West Virginia.

Last year, El Paso Electric quietly submitted paperwork to the PUC to build the natural gas power plant for Meta.
The Meta power plant would increase the share of natural gas in El Paso Electric’s portfolio.
El Paso Electric CEO Kelly Tomblin told the El Paso Times in 2024 that Meta requires its data center to be powered by solar or other renewables.
“Meta’s Data Center in El Paso, Texas is not obligated to protect local residents,” a Sembrando Esperanza handout states.","EL PASO—In October 2025, local officials celebrated the groundbreaking of a 1-gigawatt, $1.5 billion data center for the tech giant Meta.

El Paso Electric had previously stated that existing infrastructure would support the data center and that Meta was looking to tap into a new solar farm. El Paso gets more than 300 days a year of sun, hence its nickname, the Sun City.

So it came as a shock to many El Pasoans that the electric utility is instead seeking approval for a 366-megawatt natural gas plant, called the McCloud facility, to power the data center. Advocates in El Paso worry that a new gas plant could drive up utility rates, worsen the region’s air pollution problem and set back efforts to transition to renewable energy.

The Sembrando Esperanza Coalition, an El Paso economic and environmental justice group, is calling for the city, county and utilities to terminate their contracts with Meta.

“We were not told that El Paso Electric would be building a power plant powered by fossil fuels,” said Coalition organizer Verónica Carbajal. “To the contrary, we were told that Meta is going green and would rely on renewable energy. When we looked at the contracts ourselves, we realized that was an illusion.”

El Paso, population 700,000, is consistently ranked among the worst cities for ozone, or smog, in the nation. Existing water sources in the desert city are already stretched thin. Another data center, called Project Jupiter, is being developed across the state line in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, and will be fueled by natural gas. Taiwan-based Wiwynn Corp. has also announced a data center in the nearby town of Socorro, Texas. The data center build-out comes as both El Paso Electric and the city water utility are seeking rate increases.

“El Paso Electric’s obligation is to reliably serve every customer who requests service, including large employers bringing jobs and economic activity to the region,” said utility spokesperson Jacob Reyes. “In this case, the customer requested and is funding a natural gas resource as the fastest available option to meet a large, time-sensitive power need. At the same time, Meta has stated that its data center will be matched with 100 percent clean and renewable energy, consistent with its public sustainability commitments.”

Meta has invested in renewable energy projects in states where it operates data centers, including Texas. Meta did not respond to questions and El Paso Electric did not respond to questions about how energy will be “matched” for the new data center.

The data center is expected to employ about 100 people after construction is complete. Agreements with the city only require 50 full-time jobs.

The city has intervened to weigh in on the utility’s application to the Public Utility Commission (PUC) for the power plant. As an intervenor, the city will be able to make legal arguments and file testimony during PUC proceedings for the application. A city spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.

“The company has made public commitments to power their project with renewable energy sources including on-site solar generation, and I think they need to be held to those commitments,” El Paso Councilman Chris Canales told Inside Climate News. “As the data center industry has shifted over the last few years toward larger and more intensive projects, I have definitely started to have a lot more concerns, as I think the public has as well.”

City Deal with Meta Face Scrutiny

The City of El Paso entered an agreement with Wurldwide LLC, a Meta affiliate, in December 2023 to provide financial incentives for a data center on a 1,000-acre property in Northeast El Paso.

The incentive package would abate city property taxes to entice the company to build in El Paso. Under the agreement, if the company invested $800 million, the city would abate up to 80 percent of property taxes for 15 years. El Paso County also offered property tax abatement. The El Paso Times reported these incentives could be worth up to $110 million.

The deal also stated that while the company was exploring alternative energy sources, including solar, it “shall not be obligated to pursue” these energy sources.

Meta subsequently decided to increase its investment to $1.5 billion as the AI industry grew. The tech giant officially announced the deal in October 2025. Once operational, the data center would be the largest power user in El Paso.

Last year, El Paso Electric quietly submitted paperwork to the PUC to build the natural gas power plant for Meta. The McCloud gas plant will be exclusively connected to the data center for the first five years, according to regulatory filings. Then it would be connected to the broader El Paso Electric transmission system. Meta would be responsible for all the costs during the first five years.

The regulatory filing states that large-scale solar and battery storage could “theoretically” supply the data center’s power, but “such an installation would require thousands of acres adjacent to the Data Center site which are not available.”

The filing goes on to say that larger-frame gas turbines could also supply the site but would take too long to procure.

The plant will require approvals from both the PUC and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. If approved, it is expected to be operational by 2027.

The Meta power plant would increase the share of natural gas in El Paso Electric’s portfolio. El Paso Electric has committed to 80 percent carbon-free energy by 2035 and 100 percent by 2045. El Paso Electric did not respond to questions about how it would achieve its carbon-free energy targets while expanding natural gas generation.

As of 2024, the utility supplied 41.7 percent carbon-free energy. Nuclear power, which is non-renewable, makes up 37 percent of that share, while solar contributed only 4.7 percent, according to the utility’s 2024 sustainability report.

“El Paso Electric continues to expand renewable generation, electrification programs, load management efforts and community solar while responding to rapid load growth, evolving policy conditions and customer priorities, particularly affordability and reliability,” the spokesperson said.

While El Paso receives abundant sunshine, the city is connected by pipelines to the Permian Basin oil and gas fields, some 200 miles east. Gas producers see a potential bonanza in the energy demand from data centers.

Matthew Rodriguez, an organizer with the El Paso environmental justice organization Amanecer People’s Project, said that the power demands of the Meta data center represent a “massive step backward” for El Paso Electric’s sustainability commitments.

“This basically wipes out all the progress [El Paso Electric] has supposedly made in the last five years,” he said.

The City of El Paso also submitted a climate action plan to the Environmental Protection Agency in December aiming to cut emissions 50 percent by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050.

Councilman Canales said that the city did not anticipate the utility’s application to build a new gas power plant. “As such, the impact of this newly proposed gas plant is not considered in the Climate Action Plan, and in my opinion it would run contrary to the City’s goals,” he said.

Local advocates are angered by the mixed messages about the data center.

“What’s really distressing about the Meta power plant is the lack of transparency, both from Meta, El Paso Electric and our elected officials,” said Carbajal of Sembrando Esperanza. “We suspected that this would happen, but we’re disappointed that no one notified the community” about the power plant.

El Paso Electric CEO Kelly Tomblin told the El Paso Times in 2024 that Meta requires its data center to be powered by solar or other renewables. Then during a rate case hearing before the Public Utility Commission of Texas in 2025, an El Paso Electric representative said that the Meta data center would likely be powered by solar, according to El Paso Matters.

At an industry conference in Las Cruces this month, CEO Tomblin struck a different tone. She questioned the efficacy of renewables to power data centers.

“Unfortunately, it wants power around the clock, and it’s hard to do that with just renewables and storage,” she said, according to Albuquerque Business First.

Carbajal said the Sembrando Esperanza Coalition has repeatedly asked for assurances that data centers would not drive up electric rates for El Pasoans. The group intervened in El Paso Electric’s rate case and is now calling for the city and utilities to terminate contracts with Meta.

Councilman Canales said that he doubts the majority of the council would be interested in terminating the contract “given the massive amount of tax revenue that the project will bring in.”

“That said, if we continue to see deviations from Meta’s public commitments, then I hope the City Council will take notice,” he said.

Carjabal is also concerned about water consumption at the proposed power plant. El Paso Electric is already one of the city’s biggest water consumers at its existing power plants.

“Meta’s Data Center in El Paso, Texas is not obligated to protect local residents,” a Sembrando Esperanza handout states. “To the contrary, El Pasoans will be subsidizing one of the richest companies in the world.”

Amanecer’s Rodriguez called the city’s agreements with Meta “a bad deal.”

“This is not benefitting anybody in El Paso,” Rodriguez said. “Only Meta benefits.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ElPasoMeta.jpeg,N,,2026-01-21 13:02:03.399046

Environmental DNA helps researchers collect evidence for an animal without having to disturb the creature. It can be especially useful for studying species, like hellbenders, that are hard to find. It’s like forensics for ecosystems.

Ostensibly, I joined Whitman to collect water samples. But I had an ulterior motive. I wanted to see my first wild hellbender. I’d learned about the species the summer before my senior year of college, when I worked at a nature center in Banner Elk, North Carolina. In the back office there was a large poster of a lizard with his tail curved into the shape of a U. The tips of his toes were bulbous and white. When I asked my supervisor what it was, he told me all about hellbenders—how the giant salamanders are elusive, primordial, and breathe through their skin. These creatures are right here, he said, nearly in disbelief himself, in these mountains.

The word ‘giant’ stuck with me because I thought the poster was life-sized. When I think back on that summer, I picture monster lizards as long as my leg and almost as thick. I’m embarrassed to admit that this image, though false, stayed with me for years; I didn’t research hellbenders because I thought it might ruin the mystery. I liked the idea that Appalachian rivers were so wild and unmapped that they could hide salamanders almost as large as alligators.

After nearly a decade of clinging to my belief in the improbable, a friend popped my hellbender bubble. While explaining hellbenders to an acquaintance, she held her hands about two and a half feet apart. They can get this long, she said. But even after I understood that hellbenders weren’t alligator-sized, they still occupied mythic proportions in my mind.

By my late-October excursion with Whitman, the traditional sampling method of removing large rocks from rivers to find the salamanders was already over for the year. Autumn is breeding season for hellbenders and agitating them during this time can disrupt their reproductive cycle. Even so, sometimes people get lucky. That’s what I kept telling myself.

My second favorite thing about hellbenders is that they are elusive.

We started the day in Whitman’s Honda CR-V, a rolling zoo with plastic amphibians, reptiles, and birds plastered to the inside. A stuffed hellbender, bleached from the sun, rested on the dashboard.

One of our sampling sites was near a gravel pit on the North Toe River in Penland, North Carolina. In September of 2024, Hurricane Helene dumped over thirty inches of rain in the region, causing catastrophic flooding and more than a hundred fatalities across North Carolina. Helene widened the channel width of the North Toe River and washed sediment into the watershed; an orange, slimy silt now covers the banks. Whitman’s research examines how Helene may have damaged hellbender populations there.

Whitman handed me three plastic bags labeled with the day’s date in black Sharpie: 10/25. Decked in gaiters, he waded into the middle of the North Toe, opened one of the bags, and dunked it into the river facing the current. We sampled ten sites in his area of interest, which included three watersheds of northwestern North Carolina.

Once, while standing in the North Toe, Whitman’s foot dislodged a pebble. It went rolling down the riverbed. For a moment I imagined that its movement, distorted by the reflection of the trees in the water, was a hellbender crawling to its den.

“It’s really crazy to me sometimes that this is my life now,” Whitman said. “I spent so much of my summers when I was a little kid just running around, snorkeling through random creeks, hoping to see [a hellbender].”

Whitman grew up in North Carolina, but he spent summer breaks with his great-grandmother Lucy in the Greenbrier River Valley of West Virginia. He never saw a hellbender in West Virginia, but not for lack of trying. By the time Whitman was born, hellbender populations were all but gone in the Greenbrier, a loss Whitman attributed to coal-mining pollution.

The historic range of the eastern hellbender, which spans from southern New York state to the northern tips of Georgia and Alabama, is shrinking. (There is a smaller, more vulnerable subspecies called the Ozark hellbender, which is federally endangered and can only be found in a pocket of southern Missouri and northern Arkansas.)

Researchers from Kentucky’s Department of Forestry and Natural Resources found that less than half of the streams that used to contain hellbenders still had environmental DNA in 2025. All amphibians are vulnerable to environmental change, but hellbenders are uniquely so because they breathe through their skin, spending their entire lives underwater. The sides of their bodies are frilly, like the edges of lasagna, an adaptation that increases surface area. “The more surface area, the more oxygen they’ll be able to intake,” Whitman said.

Cutaneous respiration, or breathing through the skin, allows hellbenders to stay underwater and thereby avoid predation from animals like birds. But a characteristic that helps them survive also makes them more susceptible to floods, which dump silt into watersheds. Whitman said siltation can “choke hellbenders to death.”

The Cherokee name for Tusquitee Bald, a mountain west of Franklin in Clay County, North Carolina, roughly translates to “where the water-dogs laughed.” On top of this mountain, water dogs, a common name for hellbenders, told each other jokes and walked on their hind legs, so the story goes. “Any time a group of people anthropomorphize an animal, they revere it,” said Caleb Hickman, supervisory fisheries and wildlife biologist for the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. Hickman, whose ancestors were forced west on the Trail of Tears, grew up as a member of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma.

Newcomers didn’t always have the same regard for hellbenders, however. A 1906 article in an Illinois newspaper called hellbenders “hideous enough to suggest all sorts of horrid dreams and nightmares.” Hellbenders have also been described as poisonous bait stealers, a myth that led one Pennsylvania reporter to refer to hellbenders as enemies of fishermen. In actuality, hellbenders are harmless.

Since the 1980s, the broad American perception of hellbenders “went from being this kind of gross ugly thing to this endearing ugly thing,” Hickman said. He told me that reverence for hellbenders emerged concomitant with increasing research budgets for previously persecuted species.

Western North Carolina is perhaps the best example of this shift in public perception. In August, downtown Boone unveiled a hellbender mural as part of the Endangered Species Mural Project, an art program through the Center for Biological Diversity. The mural, created by Appalachian State University alum Josh Johnston, immerses the viewer in the hellbender’s habitat, portraying kingfishers diving into a stream of salamanders and brook trout.

A week after the mural unveiling, Spruce Pine hosted the first annual Hellbender Festival, drawing a crowd of more than 5,000 and more than doubling the size of the town for the day. The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission displayed Rocky, a seventeen-year-old rescue hellbender. (Seventeen is not particularly old for hellbenders; they can live to be more than thirty years old.)

“I was a bouncer for Rocky at one point,” said Spencer Bost, executive director of Downtown Spruce Pine, the community development nonprofit that hosted the festival. Bost told me that Rocky will need a dedicated volunteer to manage the line to see him next year, the demand was so high. Artists from the nearby Penland School of Craft also created a larger-than-life hellbender sculpture—roughly five feet long—using kudzu and wisteria.

A gully leads down to the South Toe River at a sample site in Micaville, an unincorporated community in Yancey County. Whitman slid down a path of loose rock and clay, plastic water-sample bags in hand. Across the street was a pasture once inundated by Helene’s surge. Whitman told me that, shortly after the storm, he found dead hellbenders in fields like this one, hundreds of meters away from the actual river.

I began to wonder if I would find my first wild hellbender dried out in a pasture. I imagined a herd of Dexter cows circled around a sheet of decaying flesh. How many hellbenders were ploughed under hay fields last spring? Whitman speculated that some of the dead hellbenders might have originally come from several miles upstream but were washed down through the valleys by the storm.

“But right here in the South Toe, they’re doing just fine,” Whitman said. Whitman’s research team, which primarily consisted of other graduate students, was pleasantly surprised to find hellbenders in unexpected places, like near the downtown areas of Spruce Pine and Boone.

My third favorite thing about hellbenders is that they are resilient.

“If a cat has nine lives, then the hell-bender must surely have eighteen,” according to a 1903 Washington Post article. Spencer Bost of the Hellbender Festival said that, after the storm, resilience became the main message of the event. “If this weird, squishy lasagna amphibian can survive Hurricane Helene, surely we can, too,” Bost said.

Carter Norris, who also worked on the festival, said a hellbender recently visited her during a swim on the Davidson River near Brevard. She dunked her phone underwater to capture a video of the creature crawling along a sandy river bottom. “It was really exciting to see [a hellbender] because it is one of our indicator species,” Norris said.

Biologists refer to hellbenders as indicator species because their presence usually indicates high-quality water. “There’s an old saying in the mountains here that you don’t drink from a branch unless it’s rolled over five rocks and a lizard’s back,” said Hickman, the fisheries biologist.

Whitman taught me how to identify suitable hellbender habitat with my eyes. The next time you’re standing in an Appalachian river, ask yourself the following questions. Do I see lush vegetation on the riverbanks? Are there boulders large enough to host underwater caverns? Is the river flowing freely, unobstructed by dams? Is the water clear and rid of sedimentation? If you answered yes to these questions, you might be standing in prime hellbender habitat.

Many of our sample sites were also adjacent to one-room churches named after the closest body of water. When I pointed this out to Whitman, he told me, chuckling, that hellbenders love Jesus.

We concluded our excursion at a higher elevation near the headwaters. Here, the stream channels were narrower, the banks were steeper, and the water was cooler. As Whitman took his final sample, I watched a leaf float down the river.

I did not see a hellbender that day. To me, hellbenders are still as thick as my leg and almost as long. Maybe the not seeing lets the mystery stay with me. “I hope there’s an animal somewhere that nobody has ever seen,” said Wendell Berry’s daughter in the prelude to his poem, “To the Unseeable Animal.” “And I hope nobody ever sees it.”",https://oxfordamerican.org/media/pages/oa-now/from-hell-and-bent-on-returning/d1cdf25709-1768939983/hellbender-in-the-salamander-exhibit-of-the-tennessee-aquarium-600x-crop-52-6-50-5.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 15:04:38.583868

Ruhani Arya is the vice president of infrastructure and sustainable finance at Bank of America.

The world’s biggest energy challenge isn’t technological — it’s financial.

America knows how to build nuclear power plants. More than 400 commercial reactors operate globally, including proven Generation III+ designs like the AP1000. Yet not a single large-scale plant is under construction in the United States today.

The barrier is not safety, nor capability, but structure. Decades of on‑balance‑sheet nuclear investments delivered financial pain, regulatory paralysis and public skepticism. The next wave of nuclear must be financed differently — through project finance, not corporate balance sheets — if it is to scale fast enough to meet demand from data centers and other industries.

The coming demand shock

Under current policies, annual U.S. industrial electricity demand is forecasted to grow 13% from 2025 through 2050, according to an analysis by the Rocky Mountain Institute. Under a high emissions reduction scenario, total annual electricity demand is forecasted to grow 139% over the same period, it said.

AI and hyperscale data centers are already reshaping load growth curves. By 2030, those facilities could consume up to 12 percent of U.S. electricity, according to McKinsey.

Their demand is continuous and thus impossible to meet with wind and solar energy alone; they need baseload power. Enter nuclear: carbon‑free, 24/7 and grid‑stabilizing. But without a viable way to finance new reactors, this resurgence will stall before it starts.

What project finance solves

Traditional corporate financing concentrates exposure. If a nuclear plant’s cost doubles — as it did for Georgia Power’s Vogtle Units 3 and 4, rising from about $14 billion to more than $30 billion — shareholders and ratepayers, not the asset, take the hit, sometimes triggering credit downgrades and inflating utility debt borrowing costs.

Project finance addresses this issue. Each facility sits in a dedicated special‑purpose vehicle (SPV), separating debt and liabilities from the parent’s balance sheet. Investors fund an asset, not a utility. Lenders rely on contractual cash flows, not corporate guarantees. Project finance involves a risk allocation structure that disciplines cost estimation and aligns incentives among builders, operators and financiers.

This model fuels nearly every major energy infrastructure investment outside nuclear — from LNG export terminals to solar and wind projects. There is no reason nuclear should remain the exception.

Structuring nuclear project finance

A realistic approach would mirror today’s large‑scale data center development with a hybrid of project, infrastructure and real‑estate finance:

Reactor designer, developer and engineering, procurement and construction companies: Provide standardized designs and fixed‑price, turnkey construction.

Equity partners: Infrastructure funds, pension investors and sovereign capital contribute equity through construction, earning higher returns for assuming early‑stage risk. Private markets currently sit on $350 billion in dry powder — an enormous potential pool for nuclear. Upon commercial operation, utilities or long‑term asset owners/operators can potentially acquire the stabilized asset.

Debt providers: Banks and insurers lend long‑tenor debt, supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, which can guarantee up to 80% of eligible cost. Insurance capital, particularly from life insurers seeking duration‑matched assets, can provide supplemental debt tranches.

Offtakers: Tech or industrial companies sign long-term power purchase agreements for baseload nuclear power. As AI and cloud demand surge, three to five major offtakers could easily underwrite several reactors’ output, providing predictable revenue streams and unlocking cheaper financing.

Government incentives: The 30–40% tech-neutral investment tax credit established via the Inflation Reduction Act applies to the fair market value, not the initial cost estimate. This structure effectively provides a cushion against budget overruns, a feature that could boost confidence of nuclear investors to move forward with new projects.

This blend of stakeholders produces bankable capital structures and, crucially, decouples nuclear investment from utility risk.

Lessons from Vogtle

Vogtle’s difficulties stemmed from timing, rather than technology.

At financial close, the AP1000 design was incomplete, the U.S. supply chain immature and the workforce untrained. By 2017, after management reorganization, costs stabilized near ~$26 billion, roughly aligning with post‑COVID final numbers. If anything, Vogtle’s final price tag of $32–$36 billion confirms the need for project-level scrutiny, rather than discrediting the technology.

The upside: Vogtle created a trained workforce of 30,000 people and validated a now‑mature supply chain. The next series of reactors could capture at least 20% cost reduction and 30% higher efficiency through standardization — the same learning curve that was observed from Vogtle Unit 3 to 4.

Reforming regulation and capital costs

Cost escalation in nuclear has often stemmed from regulation. The ALARA (“as low as reasonably achievable”) principle, though well intentioned, has enforced excessive conservatism.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has a single mandate: safety. By contrast, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration balances safety with societal benefit. A similar dual mandate for the NRC could align nuclear policy with national economic and environmental goals, reducing investor risk premiums and project discount rates. Overregulation that ignores these realities deters capital, slowing progress toward environmental and industrial security.

A stable regulatory environment lowers project discount rates, directly improving competitiveness. Every 100‑basis‑point reduction in cost of capital cuts the levelized cost of electricity by roughly five to six dollars per megawatt‑hour. With available tax credits, government loans and standardized project financing, nuclear LCOE could approach $60–$70 per MWh, putting it well within commercial viability.

Why it matters now

America’s grid faces booming demand. Nuclear energy can be part of the answer — and project finance is the key to building more reactors. It allows capital markets, not utilities, to shoulder construction risk and aligns modern investors’ appetite for long‑duration, asset‑backed returns with national industrial and environmental goals.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/sU1ZMAwrikwcMogub6zfUmxib8fAdBd6IrRpoUQ1Jms/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9NaWNvcnNvZnRfYW5kX0NvbnN0ZWxsYXRpb25fbnVjbGVhci5qcGc=.webp,N,,2026-01-21 14:01:32.754643

“No state in the union can match California’s five-year growth in ZEV sales,” California Energy Commissioner Nancy Skinner said in a statement.
In the latest Clean Transportation Program Investment Plan Update, the California Energy Commission allocated $98.5 million for light-duty, zero-emission vehicle infrastructure for fiscal year 2025-26.
In 2023 the state was powered by two-thirds clean energy, the largest economy in the world to achieve that level.
California has also run on 100% clean electricity for part of the day almost every day last year, officials said.","During his visit to this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland, Gov. Gavin Newsom emphasized California’s stability “amid federal chaos” as he announced a benchmark in electric vehicle sales.

According to the governor’s office, California has surpassed 2.5 million cumulative new sales of zero-emission vehicles, or ZEVs — far exceeding the state’s goal of 1.5 million ZEVs by 2025.

“California didn’t reach 2.5 million zero-emission vehicles by accident — we invested in this future when others said it was impossible,” Newsom said in a statement. “While Washington now cedes the global clean vehicle market to China, California is ensuring American workers and manufacturers can compete and win in the industries that will define this century.”

Officials said the sales milestone is the result of decades of California pioneering the clean-car market, leading to a solid foundation that continues to drive electric-vehicle sales and the world’s fourth-largest economy, “despite the Trump administration’s efforts to derail our clean transportation future.”

Since the end of 2019, cumulative new ZEV sales in California have increased more than 300%, driven by effective clean transportation policy and various ZEV incentives, according to Newsom’s office. California stands as the nation’s undisputed leader in emission-free transportation, proving that consumer demand for electric vehicles remains strong despite federal headwinds.

“No state in the union can match California’s five-year growth in ZEV sales,” California Energy Commissioner Nancy Skinner said in a statement. “This serves as a reminder of how far we’ve come thanks to historic levels of state investment and Californians’ strong demand for clean cars. Each quarter, even in the face of increasing federal headwinds, tens of thousands of consumers are purchasing a ZEV in the Golden State, enjoying a great driving experience, and knowing they never have to go to a gas station again.”

Officials noted the state’s commitment to establishing a robust network of ZEV infrastructure.

“While the federal government reversed and put up roadblocks, the global zero-emission vehicle market surged ahead last year,” California Air Resources Board Chair Lauren Sanchez said in a statement. “Governor Newsom’s new rebate proposal sends a clear message: California isn’t slowing down, we’re still leading the pack. It’s not just about clean air, it’s smart economic policy.”

ZEV market resilience

During last year’s fourth quarter after federal tax credits expired Sept. 30, Californians bought 79,066 new ZEVs, which was 18.9% of new car sales statewide, according to the governor’s office. Prior to the tax credit expiration, sales surged in the third quarter of 2025 to 29.1% of new car sales, “likely softening sales in the fourth quarter as a result,” officials said.

As the loss of federal support set off a nationwide decline in EV sales — from 10.5% in Q3 to 5.8% in Q4, according to Cox Automotive — California’s market stayed resilient.

“This resilience reflects a market turning point,” according to Newsom’s office. “After decades of strategic state investment in charging infrastructure, consumer incentives, and manufacturer standards, California has built a strong, mature, resilient ZEV ecosystem grounded in policy certainty and sustained investment. Consumers are buying electric vehicles in part because the technology works, the vehicles perform, and the charging infrastructure continues to grow rapidly.”

Despite the lack of financial incentives from federal government, ZEV sales were strong in Q4. Officials noted the ZEV market’s diversity, and electric vehicles’ cost-effectiveness.

“With 149 ZEV models available in California in Q4 of 2025, consumers are buoyed by the diversity in the ZEV market,” according to the governor’s office. “Not only do ZEVs produce zero tailpipe pollution, but they are also fun and powerful to drive, and cost less to operate and maintain compared to gas-powered vehicles.”

Officials suggested this website for prospective ZEV buyers: ElectricForAll.org.

Clean transportation spending

State officials are “doubling down” on clean transportation spending.

In his Jan. 9 budget, Newsom proposed launching a $200 million incentive program to accelerate ZEV adoption and respond to the loss of the federal tax credit. According to the governor’s office, the move would support “American automotive innovation at a critical moment — just as the Trump administration has abandoned the good-paying jobs of this global market.”

According to Newsom, after ess than a year in office President Donald Trump’s tariff policy has driven away the United States’ second-largest trading partner, pushing Canada toward deeper economic ties with China and surrendering America’s top global spot in electric vehicle manufacturing.

“Competing to win the future requires investing in clean energy technologies, strengthening partnerships with allies like Canada, and reducing dependence on China in critical sectors,” officials said.

“Instead, the Trump administration repealed key parts of the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and imposed broad tariffs that have raised costs for American consumers while straining relationships with close allies,” state officials continued. “Despite Donald Trump’s efforts to cede the clean energy economy to China, California is ensuring American workers and manufacturers can compete and win in the industries that will define this century.”

The Trump administration has said tariffs will bolster the nation’s global economic leadership.

“I always say ‘tariffs’ is the most beautiful word to me in the dictionary,” President Donald Trump said at a rally hours after his inauguration in January 2025. “Because tariffs are going to make us rich as hell. It’s going to bring our country’s businesses back that left us.”

In an interview with Time magazine, the president said, “We’re a department store, a giant department store, the biggest department store in history. Everybody wants to come in and take from us. They’re going to come in and they’re going to pay a price for taking our treasure, for taking our jobs, for doing all of these things.”

The state’s zero-emission commitment extends beyond consumer incentives, official said. In the latest Clean Transportation Program Investment Plan Update, the California Energy Commission allocated $98.5 million for light-duty, zero-emission vehicle infrastructure for fiscal year 2025-26. The funding will focus on Level 1 and Level 2 charging in locations with longer vehicle dwell times, including at-home charging with a focus on multifamily residences.

The Energy Commission is also continuing to study infrastructure needs statewide, officials said. The following is planned for release later this year:

New and ongoing ZEV infrastructure funding opportunities driven by the $98.5 million from the Clean Transportation Program;

The third Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Assessment, as mandated by Assembly Bill 2127, which will assess the state’s infrastructure needs to meet EV demand; and

The next Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Assessment, as mandated by Senate Bill 1000, to assess whether charging infrastructure is disproportionately deployed.

EV infrastructure

The governor’s office touted efforts to tear down barriers that keep ZEVs off the roadways, speeding up charging station installations and deploying infrastructure in difficult-to-reach and low-income areas.

“Becoming an EV driver in California is increasingly getting easier,” according to state officials. “There are now over 200,000 public and shared EV charging stations statewide. EV chargers can be found at grocery stores, park-and-ride lots, and even gas stations, whereas shared EV chargers can be found at apartment complexes, workplaces, doctors’ offices, sports facilities, and other parking areas with some level of restricted access. This statewide network of public and shared private chargers is in addition to the estimated 800,000 EV chargers installed in California homes.”

California’s climate leadership

Pollution is down and the economy is up, according to Newsom. Greenhouse gas emissions in California have dropped 21% since 2000 — even as the state’s GDP increased 81% in that same time period on the way to becoming the world’s fourth largest economy.

Officials also boasted about California’s clean energy records. In 2023 the state was powered by two-thirds clean energy, the largest economy in the world to achieve that level. California has also run on 100% clean electricity for part of the day almost every day last year, officials said.

Since the beginning of the Newsom administration in 2019, battery storage has surged to nearly 17,000 megawatts — a more than 2,100% increase, and over 30,000 megawatts of new resources have been added to the state’s electricity grid. California now has 33% of the storage capacity estimated to be needed by 2045 to reach 100% emission-free electricity.",https://heysocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/logo-black.svg,N,,2026-01-21 13:01:31.825007

The affected workers include 16 engineers, five managers, three lab technicians and others. The cuts were made Jan. 6, according to a layoff notice to the state, a day before ONE announced a strategic transition and said the suspension of its EV efforts had resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately 45% to 100 employees.

The state got the company's WARN filing on Jan. 13. ONE said it was unable to provide the full 60 days of advance notice due to ""unforeseeable circumstances"" because its largest EV customer ""suddenly and unexpectedly"" canceled a contract.

It was not immediately clear if the 29 jobs were part of the 45% employee cut, though the timing suggests that was the case. Messages seeking comment were sent to ONE on Wednesday.

Founder and CEO Mujeeb Ijaz told Crain’s earlier this month that the plan is to produce a slower-moving, cash-generating company built less on a speculative market and more on traditional pathways. He declined to name new companies with which ONE has secured contracts but noted they are in three product lines: locomotive, defense and grid-scale energy storage systems.

""It's been tough, parting with our employees."" Ijaz said. ""We know every person and every name. But we have this really important job and it's generating a lot of hope, in my mind. What we are doing is going to result in a healthy business. We're not out of the woods, but moving in a direction that looks like a stable business.""

ONE, which has manufacturing facilities in Novi and Van Buren Township, made a splash in 2022 with plans to be the first U.S.-based company to establish a domestic lithium iron phosphate battery plant. The factory, backed by $237 million in taxpayer subsidies, was to feed EV-focused automakers with a less costly, more sustainable battery than the standard nickel-manganese-cobalt chemistry.

But demand for EVs failed to launch, automakers pulled back investment dramatically and the business case for battery plants imploded. The Trump administration's rollback of EV tax credits and fuel emission regulations has further chilled electrification in the auto industry.

In September, the company announced it planned to vacate part of its factory space in Van Buren Township in Wayne County, where it planned to invest $1.6 billion and create 2,112 jobs that did not come to fruition.

As of September, ONE employed 180 people in Novi. It had created about 70 jobs and invested $117.6 million in eligible costs under its deal with the state. It's unclear how many employees the company has now.

The Michigan Economic Development Corp., which had disbursed $70.2 million of public funds to the company, said no further payments would be made under its current agreement to support the project. Per terms of the contract, ONE has until December 2029 to meet its investment and jobs commitment.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce strongly supports H.J. Res. 140, the Superior National Forest Mineral Withdrawal CRA Resolution introduced by Rep. Stauber. The resolution disapproves of Public Land Order (PLO) 7917 to reverse the Biden Administration's mineral withdrawal decision in the Superior National Forest in Minnesota. This resolution is a critical step toward unlocking the vast potential of the Duluth Complex, which contains the largest untapped copper-nickel deposit in the world. The deposit is home to 95% of America's nickel, 88% of America's cobalt, 75% of America's platinum, and more than one-third of America's copper.

The previous Administration's decision to institute a 20-year mineral withdrawal on 225,504 acres in the Superior National Forest has effectively blocked the development of critical mineral resources in that region, including the Twin Metals project and other proposed hardrock mining and helium extraction projects. This withdrawal not only undermines our national and energy security but also hinders the ability to meet the U.S.'s ambitious infrastructure and clean energy goals.

H.J. Res. 140 does not immediately approve any specific project but instead reverses the mining ban, allowing proposed projects to proceed through the regulatory and permitting review process. This resolution ensures a level playing field, enabling projects to compete on their own merits while meeting strict permitting and environmental requirements at both the state and federal levels.

The Chamber supports H.J. Res. 140 and urges Congress to act swiftly to pass this resolution. Developing a strong, reliable domestic critical minerals supply chain is vital to America's future, and this resolution represents a necessary step in that direction.

Levelized billing A point of emphasis for the bill is to help for low-income customers amid price hikes caused by rising energy demand.
The idea is for customers to have a fixed electricity bill to make budgeting expenses easier.
“This bill is a good start; we think it could be improved a bit along the way,” said Pierce, who is the ranking minority member on the House utilities committee.
The idea is to set electricity rates for three years at a time.","A proposal to revamp Indiana’s regulatory framework and affordability programs for electricity service providers is headed to the House floor.

A legislative priority for Republicans, House Bill 1002 requires the state’s investor-owned utilities to start low-income-customer assistance programs, bans service shutoffs in the summer and moves all customers to “levelized” billing plans.

The legislation would also see Indiana dip its toes into performance-based ratemaking—a new regulatory framework in which utilities are locked into rates for three-year periods.

After lengthy testimony and debate last week over how best to make sure low-income families would be protected from shutoffs in the summer and would understand their monthly utility bills, the legislation passed the House Committee on Utilities, Energy and Telecommunications on Tuesday with unanimous support.

“The goal … is to prioritize affordability for Hoosier ratepayers and ensure our utilities are maintaining transparent, cost-effective practices,” the bill’s author, Rep. Alaina Shonkwiler, R-Noblesville, said in committee testimony.

Gov. Mike Braun also signaled his support for the legislation in his State of the State address.

Levelized billing

A point of emphasis for the bill is to help for low-income customers amid price hikes caused by rising energy demand.

The bill would require utilities, starting July 1, to enroll all eligible customers in a low-income assistance program to help pay for monthly bills. Many utilities already offer such programs.

Debates in committee centered on how to pay for assistance programs. The original bill suggested utility companies fund the offerings from half of the amount they recovered from ratepayers under their IURC-approved energy-efficiency programs in the most recent year.

Danielle McGrath, president of the Indiana Energy Association, cautioned that using such a mechanism could lead to unpredictable spikes and dips in funding from year to year, while Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, questioned whether the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission should have a say in how to administer low-income programs.

An amendment from committee chair Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, on Tuesday changed funding for low-income programs to be at least 0.2% of a utility company’s total yearly revenue.

“They’re all going to have to do something and it’s going to cost them some money,” said Soliday about the funding mechanism. “Somebody’s going to have to pay to make this work.”

The bill attempts to prevent surprises when customers see their monthly utility bills. To that effect, the legislation requires all customers to go to what’s commonly known as “budget billing,” in which utility companies average a customer’s electricity usage for the past year and charge the monthly average cost of their usage for that period.

A few times a year, the customers must “true up” and pay for the actual amount of electricity they used. The idea is for customers to have a fixed electricity bill to make budgeting expenses easier.

But Rep. Cherish Pryor, D-Indianapolis, and Rep. Alex Burton, D-Evansville, said their constituents have been confused, saying the term “budget” implies customers are on a low-income assistance program.

Burton offered an amendment to change the term budget billing to “levelized” billing to make the process more clear. As written, HB 1001 requires all customers to have levelized billing, but users can opt out at any time.

Language was also added during Tuesday’s committee session to prevent power shutoffs from June 1 through Sept. 23, similar to existing prohibitions against shutoffs in the winter.

“This bill is a good start; we think it could be improved a bit along the way,” said Pierce, who is the ranking minority member on the House utilities committee.

Pierce offered an amendment Tuesday that would have eliminated the state’s 7% sales tax on utility bills, saying it would give ratepayers more immediate relief, but it was voted down by Republicans on the committee who worried about budgetary impacts.

Multiyear planning

HB 1001 also marks a significant change in how regulators set electric rates for monopoly utility providers.

For much of the past century, Indiana has used a “cost of service” model to determine rates, in which utilities calculate how much money it took to provide service, add on a rate of return for investors and submit their rate requests to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.

The IURC hears testimony and documentation from the utility and from other stakeholders, then decides what a “reasonable” amount of cost recovery includes and sets rates for customers accordingly.

But Shonkwiler’s bill shifts the state to a performance-based ratemaking model that involves multiyear rate plans. The idea is to set electricity rates for three years at a time. Knowing they can’t ask for rate increases for a prolonged period, utilities are incentivized to operate more efficiently in order to make a profit.

The proposed legislation outlines that the process for setting multiyear rate plans would look similar to current rate requests utilities make before the IURC.

Along with multiyear plans, the bill sets up performance-based metrics that utilities would be rewarded for meeting or penalized for falling short.

Specifically, providers would be incentivized to keep rates in line with the national electricity inflation average, as measured by the consumer price index. Regulators can also use service restoration times as an incentive, though some people who testified in committee questioned whether the one basis point of financial reward or penalty would be enough for utility companies to change their behavior.

The Indiana Energy Association, which represents utility providers, supported making multiyear rate plans optional for utilities, but the bill as written requires the new practice starting in 2027.

Ratepayers advocates like Kerwin Olson, the executive director of the Citizens Action Coalition, had technical concerns over what information electric providers had to submit for rate plans. Overall, he thinks the bill will be a welcome initiative for low-income families, but wouldn’t have much effect on most customers in the short term.

“I think this bill is conflating affordability with stability a little bit,” Olson said. “We don’t see anything in the bill that is going to reduce rates for customers going forward, unless you are a low-income customer.”

As trade policy and geopolitical dynamics continue to create economic uncertainty around the globe, a robust domestic biofuel market would provide much needed stability and market opportunities for U.S. soybean farmers.

Instead of continued imports of biofuel and biofuel feedstocks that leave our value chain vulnerable to supply chain manipulation, ASA is advocating for policy outcomes that strengthen domestic soy demand and support U.S. soybean farmers.

Biofuel is a broad term that includes biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, as well as the smaller markets of soy-derived naphtha, liquified petroleum gas and home heating oil.

The domestic biofuel industry can play a critical role in national security and economic stability – and biofuel is produced right here on U.S. soil. Roughly half of all U.S.-processed soybean oil is used in biomass-based diesel, making biofuel one of the most significant domestic markets for soybeans.

The Current State of Biofuel

Biofuel encompasses a wide range of fuels, feedstocks and policy frameworks, but ASA is currently focused on two specific policy issues – the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit and the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) renewable volume obligations (RVOs). Clear guidance aligning with recently enacted amendments to the 45Z tax credit will help determine the economics of producing low-carbon fuels, while RVOs for 2026 and 2027 will establish the level of biofuel blending required under the RFS. Both directly affect soybean oil utilization, domestic crush expansion and market certainty for farmers. When U.S.-grown soybean oil is used in domestic biofuel production, it strengthens rural economies, reduces greenhouse gas emissions and lowers reliance on finite energy sources. How these policies are structured ultimately determines whether American clean fuel policy delivers its intended economic and environmental benefits to U.S. farmers and consumers alike.

45Z Tax Credit

In July 2025, the 45Z tax credit was amended through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) to enhance benefits to soy-based biofuel, but final guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury has yet to be completed. ASA is advocating for swift draft guidance from the Treasury Department to ensure timely implementation. The tax credit is important to soybean farmers because it incentivizes fuel producers to purchase soybean oil for biodiesel and renewable diesel.

To qualify for the 45Z tax credit, fuel producers must utilize feedstocks produced in North America. Finalization of 45Z is critical because it will boost domestic feedstock demand and support stronger soybean prices. The tax credit also protects domestically grown agricultural feedstocks and removes incentives for imported waste feedstocks, which have exponentially increased market share in U.S. biofuel production over the past five years.

“We led advocacy efforts and did so in coordination with other ag commodity groups and soybean processors as Congress was developing tax code changes in the OBBBA,” said Alexa Combelic, executive director of government affairs for ASA. “These advocacy efforts led to an incredible win for ASA in relation to the 45Z tax credits. We were able to remove the indirect land use change penalty on agricultural biofuel feedstocks, which effectively doubles the value of the tax credit for soy biofuel. In addition, we were able to address the surge of imported feedstocks entering our biofuel production value chain through new limitations on tax credit eligibility.”

Up until the week before the OBBBA was passed, Combelic said it wasn’t clear if the North American feedstock “ringfence” would be included in the final bill. Through significant grassroots stakeholder mobilization and advocacy leadership, ASA was able to ensure the tax credit would focus on biofuel feedstocks grown and produced in North America rather than overseas.

Additionally, through months of education on the impacts of agricultural indirect land use change (ILUC) penalties, ASA was able to double the 45Z credit rate for soy-based biofuel. The ILUC penalty was an arbitrary tax on U.S. farmers, and its removal means the carbon intensity of soy is based on its direct impacts and not tied to a calculation model that penalizes U.S. grown crops for farming behavior in South America.

This win was not only the product of the hard work of ASA Government Affairs, but also of the efforts by farmers who helped ensure lawmakers were hearing directly from their constituents about the importance of the tax credit amendments to the soybean industry. The 45Z credit was first established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which restructured biofuel tax credits based on carbon intensity and initially disadvantaged agricultural feedstocks. Through mechanisms like ILUC, the IRA policy created an incentive for imported waste feedstocks like tallow, primarily from Brazil, and used cooking oil, primarily from China. Now, the 45Z tax credit as updated by the OBBBA disincentivizes those imports by prioritizing feedstocks available at home through a North American ringfence of eligibility and by removing arbitrary credit reductions for agricultural products.

The next step to ensure utilization of 45Z is for the Treasury Department to develop tax guidance that outlines how biofuel producers can utilize this tax credit after the statutory changes enacted through OBBBA. At this time, ASA is continuing to engage with the Treasury Department and administration to highlight the sense of urgency. While interim or draft guidance is expected this winter, final guidance will only be published after a public comment period and agency review.

“We anticipate full final guidance by spring or summer,” Combelic said.

RVOs

The RVO rule for compliance years 2026 and 2027 as proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will lead to an increase in blending volumes for biomass-based diesel – a policy that supports soybean farmers, soybean processors and biofuel producers. Released by EPA in June 2025, this was the strongest proposed RVO rule ever published. It was the direct result of continued advocacy with this administration.

“The previous Trump administration was not the biggest advocate for biofuel, so we were thrilled to see this change in tune,” Combelic said. It shows a clear focus on wanting to be a partner as we seek to increase domestic markets for soybean oil. Based on the two-year draft rule, if finalized, the biofuel value chain would absorb 10% of the average soybean sales to China in the first year and 20% of soybean sales to China in the second year.

The current RVOs, released under the Biden Administration EPA in 2023, underestimated industry capacity, weakening demand for soybean oil. The 2023-2025 RVOs did not reflect the expansion of the biofuel value chain – production and soybean crush. At that time, ASA was disappointed that blending volumes were not higher. The 2026 volumes versus the 2025 volumes shows an increase of over 2 billion gallons. This is a historic increase in volume requirements for biomass-based diesel. ASA applauded the proposal but continues to push for higher volume targets going forward in order to stabilize the market and secure long-term growth.

2025 marked the 20th anniversary of the RFS, and the EPA proposal in June marked a perfect reason for ASA to celebrate the program. The RFS program was enacted in 2005 through the passage of the Energy Policy Act and has been improved over the years, resulting in a new era that puts farmers first and strengthens the domestic biofuel industry. When President Trump began his term, he signed an Executive Order that created policy in support of American energy dominance. Domestic biofuel production fits right into that idea as from soil to final fuel production, it can be produced exclusively within the United States.

While soybean farmers have struggled to maintain biofuel feedstock market share amid the rapidly surging flood of cheap, foreign feedstocks, the proposed 2026-2027 RVO rule addresses concerns of fraudulent used cooking oil coming into the United States through a novel proposal to reduce Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credit values by 50% for imported biofuel and biofuel made from imported feedstocks. It encourages domestic biofuel production, strengthening domestic soybean markets and making domestic feedstocks more competitive. The 50% RIN credit reduction proposed by EPA is yet another opportunity to continue disincentivizing foreign feedstocks from being imported into the U.S.

A Bipartisan Issue

Because domestic biofuel creates a market for farmers and provides a boon for rural communities, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle support biofuel policies which increase domestic production, making it a true bipartisan issue. Domestic biofuel production creates jobs, opens a market for soybean farmers and bolsters the use of a product planted, harvested, created and consumed all within the United States. Biofuel policy is a flexible issue that supports the values of both political parties – a win-win for all.

ASA saw additional success on Capitol Hill last year as there was a strong coalition of advocates who helped them see bipartisan caucus support using agriculture feedstocks. When the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit was first released, the North American ringfence was only included in the House of Representatives, with the Senate later striking the measure. However, through ASA’s targeted and continued engagement, an ad hoc coalition of biofuel producers, soybean processors and farmers from a variety of commodities advocated for the ringfence to be reinstated, and it was restored in an updated version of the text released by the Senate the week of passage, ensuring eligible feedstocks will be permanently limited to North American origin points for the life of the 45Z tax credit.

The Future of Biofuel

Looking to the future of biofuel, ASA is calling for the completion of EPA’s proposed 2026-2027 Renewable Fuel Standard renewable volume obligations and issuing timely Treasury guidance for the revised 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit to reflect enacted changes that prioritize domestic agricultural feedstocks. On Nov. 12, 2025, ASA and the National Oilseed Processors Association (NOPA) sent a letter to President Trump urging swift finalization of these key federal biofuel policies which are critical to strengthen domestic demand and support farmers who are facing continued market pressure.

As ASA continues to advocate for the good of the soy community, the Association is continuously engaging with USDA, EPA, Treasury, the U.S. Trade Representative and additional senior staff at the White House. Biofuel policy is an issue that spans beyond one agency. It takes a team effort to make a difference, and ASA is focused on coalition building, legislative education and advocacy at the highest level of government.",https://soygrowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CAM36806-lower-res-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 15:04:16.801046

“The only path to seeing this invention brought out into the world was to found and run the company,” Stark says.
“The fundamental challenge of delivering heat is that the higher your heat pump is raising the air temperature, the lower your maximum efficiency.
Many other electric boilers rely on waste heat, but Stark thinks that adds too much complexity to installation and operations.","More than 200 years ago, the steam boiler helped spark the Industrial Revolution. Since then, steam has been the lifeblood of industrial activity around the world. Today the production of steam — created by burning gas, oil, or coal to boil water — accounts for a significant percentage of global energy use in manufacturing, powering the creation of paper, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food, and more.

Now, the startup AtmosZero, founded by Addison Stark SM ’10, PhD ’14; Todd Bandhauer; and Ashwin Salvi, is taking a new approach to electrify the centuries-old steam boiler. The company has developed a modular heat pump capable of delivering industrial steam at temperatures up to 150 degrees Celsius to serve as a drop-in replacement for combustion boilers.

The company says its first 1-megawatt steam system is far cheaper to operate than commercially available electric solutions thanks to ultra-efficient compressor technology, which uses 50 percent less electricity than electric resistive boilers. The founders are hoping that’s enough to make decarbonized steam boilers drive the next industrial revolution.

“Steam is the most important working fluid ever,” says Stark, who serves as AtmosZero’s CEO. “Today everything is built around the ubiquitous availability of steam. Cost-effectively electrifying that requires innovation that can scale. In other words, it requires a mass-produced product — not one-off projects.”

Tapping into steam

Stark joined the Technology and Policy Program when he came to MIT in 2007. He ultimately completed a dual master’s degree by adding mechanical engineering to his studies.

“I was interested in the energy transition and in accelerating solutions to enable that,” Stark says. “The transition isn’t happening in a vacuum. You need to align economics, policy, and technology to drive that change.”

Stark stayed at MIT to earn his PhD in mechanical engineering, studying thermochemical biofuels.

After MIT, Stark began working on early-stage energy technologies with the Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency— Energy (ARPA-E), with a focus on manufacturing efficiency, the energy-water nexus, and electrification.

“Part of that work involved applying my training at MIT to things that hadn’t really been innovated on for 50 years,” Stark says. “I was looking at the heat exchanger. It’s so fundamental. I thought, ‘How might we reimagine it in the context of modern advances in manufacturing technology?’”

The problem is as difficult as it is consequential, touching nearly every corner of the global industrial economy. More than 2.2 gigatons of CO2 emissions are generated each year to turn water into steam — accounting for more than 5 percent of global energy-related emissions.

In 2020, Stark co-authored an article in the journal Joule with Gregory Thiel SM ’12, PhD ’15 titled, “To decarbonize industry, we must decarbonize heat.” The article examined opportunities for industrial heat decarbonization, and it got Stark excited about the potential impact of a standardized, scalable electric heat pump.

Most electric boiler options today bring huge increases in operating costs. Many also make use of factory waste heat, which requires pricey retrofits. Stark never imagined he’d become an entrepreneur, but he soon realized no one was going to act on his findings for him.

“The only path to seeing this invention brought out into the world was to found and run the company,” Stark says. “It’s something I didn’t anticipate or necessarily want, but here I am.”

Stark partnered with former ARPA-E awardee Todd Bandhauer, who had been inventing new refrigerant compressor technology in his lab at Colorado State University, and former ARPA-E colleague Ashwin Salvi. The team officially founded AtmosZero in 2022.

“The compressor is the engine of the heat pump and defines the efficiency, cost, and performance,” Stark says. “The fundamental challenge of delivering heat is that the higher your heat pump is raising the air temperature, the lower your maximum efficiency. It runs into thermodynamic limitations. By designing for optimum efficiency in the operational windows that matter for the refrigerants we’re using, and for the precision manufacturing of our compressors, we’re able to maximize the individual stages of compression to maximize operational efficiency.”

The system can work with waste heat from air or water, but it doesn’t need waste heat to work. Many other electric boilers rely on waste heat, but Stark thinks that adds too much complexity to installation and operations.

Instead, in AtmosZero’s novel heat pump cycle, heat from ambient-temperature air is used to warm a liquid heat transfer material, which evaporates a refrigerant so it flows into the system’s series of compressors and heat exchangers, reaching high enough temperatures to boil water while recovering heat from the refrigerant once it reaches lower temperatures. The system can be ramped up and down to seamlessly fit into existing industrial processes.

“We can work just like a combustion boiler,” Stark says. “At the end of the day, customers don’t want to change how their manufacturing facilities operate in order to electrify. You can’t change or increase complexity on-site.”

That approach means the boiler can be deployed in a range of industrial contexts without unique project costs or other changes.

“What we really offer is flexibility and something that can drop in with ease and minimize total capital costs,” Stark says.

From 1 to 1,000

AtmosZero already has a pilot 650 kilowatt system operating at a customer facility near its headquarters in Loveland, Colorado. The company is currently focused on demonstrating year-round durability and reliability of the system as they work to build out their backlog of orders and prepare to scale.

Stark says once the system is brought to a customer’s facility, it can be installed in an afternoon and deployed in a matter of days, with zero downtime.

AtmosZero is aiming to deliver a handful of units to customers over the next year or two, with plans to deploy hundreds of units a year after that. The company is currently targeting manufacturing plants using under 10 megawatts of thermal energy at peak demand, which represents most U.S. manufacturing facilities.

Stark is proud to be part of a growing group of MIT-affiliated decarbonization startups, some of which are targeting specific verticals, like Boston Metal for steel and Sublime Systems for cement. But he says beyond the most common materials, the industry gets very fragmented, with one of the only common threads being the use of steam.

“If we look across industrial segments, we see the ubiquity of steam,” Stark says. “It’s a tremendously ripe opportunity to have impact at scale. Steam cannot be removed from industry. So much of every industrial process that we’ve designed over the last 160 years has been around the availability of steam. So, we need to focus on ways to deliver low-emissions steam rather than removing it from the equation.”",https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/images/202601/MIT_AtmosZero-01-press.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 15:59:21.406950

The company says this approach reduces exploration timelines and costs while increasing the size and productivity of geothermal fields.

“This Series C positions Zanskar for rapid growth by enabling the company to advance its gigawatt-scale pipeline through a historic geothermal exploration and development campaign,” the company said in its announcement.

Carl Hoiland, CEO and co-founder of Zanskar, said the company was founded on the belief that artificial intelligence could significantly reduce geothermal discovery risk and improve project economics.

“We’ve already confirmed multiple large, previously unknown geothermal resources across the Western U.S., and deeper drilling has validated that these systems can produce far more energy than expected,” Hoiland said.

Investor confidence in geothermal exploration

The funding round represents one of the largest venture investments to date in AI-enabled geothermal resource discovery. Investors highlighted geothermal’s role in providing firm, low-carbon power amid rising electricity demand from industry and data centers.

“Geothermal energy is one of the only immediate ways to serve the enormous and growing demand for firm, clean power,” said Jason Scott, Partner at Spring Lane Capital, who will join Zanskar’s board.

Obvious Ventures Managing Director Andrew Beebe described Zanskar’s team as “fast, disciplined and very effective,” noting that geothermal is gaining renewed attention as a scalable and dependable energy source in the US power mix.

From discovery to power generation

Zanskar states that it has identified more geothermal anomalies in North America than any other company in recent decades, including projects such as Lightning Dock in New Mexico and exploration successes at Pumpernickel and Big Blind in Nevada. We previously reported on Zanskar and you can find a list of news here.

As the company transitions from exploration into construction and operations, it plans to build, own, and operate geothermal power plants as long-term infrastructure assets. Zanskar also noted that it is actively recruiting engineers, developers, and finance professionals to support its expansion.",https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Zanskar-LDG-rig-and-plant-scaled.png,N,,2026-01-21 15:03:42.548217

Canada and Qatar have built strong economic ties over nearly five decades, and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s visit to Doha on January 17, 2026, culminated with the announcement of significant investment by Qatar towards major Canadian infrastructure projects.

Joint statement on infrastructure investments

Following discussions with His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the Prime Minister of Canada and the Amir of Qatar issued a joint statement committing Qatar to strategic investments in large-scale Canadian infrastructure projects. The agreement is intended to accelerate the delivery of major initiatives in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, aerospace, defence, advanced manufacturing, agriculture and agri-food, while strengthening Canada’s industrial capacity and creating thousands of high-quality jobs.

Toward a new investment framework

This summer, Canada and Qatar plan to finalize a Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement (FIPA), providing Canadian companies with greater legal certainty and making it easier to operate in Qatar. The negotiation of FIPA has been stalled between the two nations for several years; the commitment to imminently conclude the agreement will also position Canada favourably to attract investment from Qatar, whose economy is valued at nearly CA$290 billion.

Expanding cooperation across sectors

The two countries also agreed to expand cooperation on trade and investment through a Joint Canada–Qatar Commission on Economic, Commercial, and Technical Cooperation, alongside collaboration in information technology, artificial intelligence, defence and security. Negotiations toward a double-taxation agreement were also announced by the two countries, while Canada will also expand air services, establish a Defence Attaché office in Doha, and cooperate with Qatar on security-related best practices in preparation for the FIFA World Cup 2026.

Strengthening strategic partnerships

During his visit, Prime Minister Carney met with Qatari officials, business leaders and the Qatar Investment Authority to notably advance collaboration in health, biotechnology, AI and technology. Canada and Qatar’s complementary strengths in technology, security and resources were framed as natural synergies that may support major projects in energy, defence and innovation.

While no estimated dollar value of these investments has been released as of yet, such initiative could significantly accelerate Canadian clean energy projects and the development of high-tech infrastructure hubs.

Key takeaways

For businesses and investors, the growing Canada-Qatar partnership presents significant opportunities in large-scale infrastructure and technology projects. Strategic investments are expected to accelerate energy, healthcare, AI and defence initiatives while creating long-term high-quality jobs. The upcoming FIPA and related agreements will provide a legal framework for seamless cross-border investment, reducing barriers for both Canadian and Qatari companies. Clients should monitor developments closely, as the partnership could influence project timelines, investment flows and opportunities to participate in nation-building initiatives across Canada’s priority sectors.

Through the Texas Electricity Power Pulse, TXOGA will continue to deliver fact-based insights on how natural gas and electricity work together to power growth, innovation and environmental progress across the state’s industrial landscape.","The O&G industry is the heart of American energy. It powers value chains that support millions of jobs, drive exports, and keep Texas globally competitive.

Quietly behind the flow of energy products is another critical input: electricity. As operations increasingly electrify to raise efficiency, improve safety, and reduce emissions, dependable electricity is essential.

From drilling sites and pipeline compressor stations to refineries, petrochemical plants and export terminals, electricity powers the systems that keep energy moving. That’s why the Texas Oil & Gas Association (TXOGA) launched the Texas Electricity Power Pulse, a quarterly report tracking trends in the ERCOT power market and spotlighting how natural gas underpins reliability, affordability and growth across the state.

Electricity demand in Texas continues to rise faster than anywhere else in the nation. Strong population growth, industrial expansion and rapid data center additions have driven a 25% increase in total electricity use since 2020. In the third quarter of 2025, ERCOT’s load reached 141,232 GWh, which is equivalent to an average demand of 64 GW, exceeding use in California and Florida combined over the period. This scale reflects the magnitude of Texas’ growth and the challenge to maintain reliability in a system without capacity markets.

For industrial users, a litmus test for reliability comes during periods of ""net peak load,"" that is, electricity demand less the output from intermittent sources. This is a demand that must be met by dispatchable generation, primarily natural gas, nuclear and coal, for the grid to remain stable. In Q3 2025, ERCOT’s net peak load reached as high as 70 GW. Meeting a 70-GW net peak requires instantaneous generation equivalent to powering every refinery, petrochemical complex and LNG terminal along the Gulf Coast, plus every home and business in Houston and Dallas, at the same time.

For the Texas industry, maintaining this level of dependable power requires resources that can ramp quickly and perform under pressure, making natural gas indispensable to ERCOT’s reliability.

Despite Texas’ nation-leading growth of wind and solar, natural gas remains the largest and most reliable power source. In Q3 2025, gas generation supplied 47.6% of total electricity, which was more than all renewable sources combined.

In fact, thermal and other dispatchable units provided at least half of the region’s power over 90% of the time during the quarter, stabilizing the grid whenever renewable output declined and demand rose.

Natural gas and electricity reliability are directly linked. As Texas industries electrify and expand, gas plants deliver the flexibility, speed and scale that renewable resources alone cannot provide. They enable refineries, chemical plants, data centers and manufacturers to operate continuously and safely, even as weather or market conditions shift.

Thanks to record-high production in Q3 2025, Texas produced about four times more natural gas than it required for power generation. TXOGA estimates that Texas averaged 28.2 bcf/d of dry natural gas in Q3 2025, compared with total in-state use of 15.6 bcf/d, including 7.6 bcf/d for industry and 7.3 bcf/d for power generation. Since 2020, as Texas has deployed the most renewable energy sources in the nation, natural gas use in the power sector increased 15%, reflecting its flexible ramping capability, local abundance and cost-effectiveness. Leveraging Texasproduced natural gas supports billions of dollars in industrial investment through cogeneration, combined-cycle plants and on-site power systems that enhance efficiency and resilience for manufacturers, refiners and high-tech industries alike.

Simply put, it’s often underappreciated how important reliable natural gas is to ensuring process safety, operational continuity and the global competitiveness of the facilities that anchor Texas’ economy. Through the Texas Electricity Power Pulse, TXOGA will continue to deliver fact-based insights on how natural gas and electricity work together to power growth, innovation and environmental progress across the state’s industrial landscape.",https://www.bicmagazine.com/downloads/28828/download/Plant%20Stock.png?cb=c9d9803cc749180f1a366dc61687141a&w=1200,N,,2026-01-21 15:59:45.917605

How you can take action for clean energy and clean air Clean energy transitions happen at every level—from households to governments.","Solar energy is the most abundant of all energy resources on planet Earth. Solar energy is also one of the most powerful tools available to reduce air pollution and cut greenhouse gas emissions at their source. Unlike coal, oil, and gas, solar energy generates electricity without releasing fine particulate matter (PM2.5) or nitrogen oxides into the air. This makes it uniquely important not only for climate action, but for protecting public health—especially in communities burdened by pollution.

Yet despite its promise, solar energy is often misunderstood. Persistent myths about cost, reliability, and feasibility have slowed adoption, even as technology improves and prices fall. Understanding what’s fact, what’s fiction, and what challenges remain is key to scaling solar responsibly and equitably.

What is solar energy and why is it better for air quality?

Solar energy is a form of renewable energy that comes from naturally replenished sunlight and generates electricity without releasing harmful air pollutants, like PM2.5, that are linked to asthma, heart disease, and premature death.

Solar and other clean energy solutions are becoming increasingly accessible. Today, renewable power is the most affordable source of electricity in much of the world, with over 90% of new renewable projects costing less than fossil fuel alternatives. Because renewable resources are available in every country, they reduce dependence on imported fuels and help protect communities from volatile energy prices and supply disruptions.

Most importantly, solar energy directly improves air quality. By replacing fossil fuel combustion with clean power, communities cut pollution at the source—reducing exposure, improving public health, and lowering healthcare costs. This is why clean energy plays a critical role not only in addressing climate change, but in helping people breathe cleaner air every day (1).

Among all clean energy sources, solar power offers one of the most scalable and widely accessible paths to cleaner air.

Solar energy: Myths

Solar energy is still surrounded by misconceptions such as how it actually works—and what challenges remain.

Myth: Solar power is unreliable or too expensive

Though global solar capacity is growing, a persistent myth has slowed adoption: that solar power is unreliable or prohibitively expensive (2).

In reality, solar energy is now the cheapest source of electricity in most regions of the world. Advances in technology and sharp declines in cost have made solar more efficient and accessible than ever. Between 2021 and 2025, solar capacity grew faster than any other renewable source, with costs now lower than coal or natural gas in many markets (3).

Myth: Solar power only works when it’s sunny

It’s true that solar panels produce the most electricity under direct sunlight—but solar doesn’t stop working when clouds roll in. Because panels generate power from light, not heat, they can still produce electricity on cloudy, rainy, or snowy days, just at reduced output. In fact, solar panels often perform efficiently in cooler conditions, since excessive heat can reduce performance.

For times when the sun isn’t shining, batteries can store excess energy generated during the day and provide backup power. And for most households, rooftop solar is still connected to the electric grid, meaning the home can draw power from the grid when solar production is low. Together, these systems help make solar a reliable part of everyday energy use, even when the weather isn’t perfect. (4).

Solar energy: Facts

Fact: Solar is the most abundant energy source on Earth

Solar energy is by far the most abundant source of energy on the planet (5). The amount of solar energy reaching Earth in one hour exceeds global energy demand for an entire year.

This abundance, combined with falling costs, makes solar a cornerstone of clean energy transitions worldwide—especially in regions seeking affordable, locally available power.

Fact: Solar is inexpensive and generates zero air pollution emissions

Solar energy often delivers electricity at a lower cost than new coal or natural gas plants—even without subsidies—according to annual analyses (6).

And once installed, solar panels generate electricity without releasing PM2.5, nitrogen oxides, or other harmful air pollutants. This means solar cuts pollution at its source while providing affordable power over decades.

While manufacturing solar panels requires energy and materials, multiple lifecycle analyses show that most systems produce the energy used in their manufacture within one to four years.

As solar technology scales and recycling programs expand, both costs and environmental impacts continue to decline—making solar not only one of the cleanest energy sources, but also one of the most affordable paths to reducing air pollution and protecting public health (7).

Solar energy: Challenges

Challenge: Energy storage and responsible battery supply chains

One key challenge for solar energy is storage. Supplying electricity when the sun isn’t shining requires hybrid systems that rely on batteries to store excess energy generated during the day.

Battery production relies on mining materials such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel, raising concerns about environmental impacts and labor conditions in mining regions (8). Meeting these challenges will require responsible sourcing, improved recycling, and stronger labor protections—so solar’s clean-air benefits are not achieved at the expense of people or ecosystems elsewhere.

Challenge: Land use and wildlife impacts

Large solar facilities can require significant land area, and poorly sited projects may fragment habitats or disrupt local wildlife—especially in sensitive ecosystems. These risks can be reduced through careful siting (such as on already disturbed land, rooftops, or parking structures), strong environmental assessments, and mitigation measures like wildlife-friendly fencing, bird deterrents, and vegetation planning.

Done responsibly, solar can scale while minimizing harm to biodiversity (9).

Dual benefits: Climate action and cleaner air

Solar power—often deployed alongside wind—cuts greenhouse gas emissions and reduces air pollutants linked to respiratory and cardiovascular disease.

These reductions deliver real-world benefits. Uruguay, for example, now generates nearly 99% of its electricity from renewables, stabilizing energy costs and sharply reducing fossil fuel pollution—while creating tens of thousands of clean energy jobs (10).

How much has the air quality in Uruguay’s capital city, Montevideo, improved? PM2.5 noticeably decreased from an average concentration of 14.2 µg/m3 in 2021 to 11.5 µg/m3 in 2024.

Uruguay is far from alone. China has significantly reduced its PM2.5 concentrations over a decade, in part through clean energy policies (11)(12). As one example, Beijing’s average concentration of 58.8 µg/m3 in 2017 declined to 30.9 µg/m3 in 2024.

In April 2025, wind and solar power generated more than a quarter of the country’s electricity for the first time on record (13). Solar’s capacity has rapidly risen from a mere 4.1% share of China’s electrical mix in April 2020 to 12.4% by April 2025.

How you can take action for clean energy and clean air

Clean energy transitions happen at every level—from households to governments.

Here are ways different groups can take meaningful action:

Individuals

Reduce home energy use and choose energy-efficient appliances.

Support renewable energy providers or community solar programs where available.

Stay informed about local air quality and energy sources to make healthier daily decisions.

Communities

Advocate for clean cooking programs, electrification, and renewable energy access.

Support local initiatives that reduce fossil fuel dependence and air pollution.

Encourage air quality monitoring to make pollution visible and actionable.

Businesses

Commit to renewable energy sourcing and improved energy efficiency.

Install elevated solar canopies over parking lots to both cool off vehicles and reduce building energy costs.

Reduce emissions across operations, logistics, and supply chains.

Invest in clean technologies that protect workers, customers, and surrounding communities.

Governments

Expand renewable energy investment and grid access (with shorter distances).

Accelerate clean cooking and electrification programs in underserved regions.

Align energy and air quality policies to protect vulnerable populations.

Together, these actions help ensure that the transition to clean energy delivers cleaner air, healthier communities, and a more equitable future.

Clean energy and clean air are deeply connected—and progress on one strengthens progress on the other.

Conclusion

Reducing reliance on fossil fuels cuts pollution at its source—helping people breathe cleaner air while protecting the planet. Solar energy, in particular, offers a powerful path forward by delivering clean electricity without the air pollutants that harm health, while expanding access to affordable energy.

Observed each year on January 26, the International Day of Clean Energy underscores the global commitment to a just and inclusive transition away from fossil fuels. Proclaimed by the UN General Assembly in 2023 and aligned with the mission of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the day highlights how clean energy—especially solar—can protect public health, reduce inequality, and expand economic opportunity.",https://www.iqair.com/dl/assets/logos/apple-touch-icon.png,N,,2026-01-21 12:03:52.985708

And PJM Interconnection, which manages the grid from the Mid-Atlantic to the Midwest, has said Dominion's offshore wind project is a critical source of new electricity.","Late last month, the Trump administration halted construction on billions of dollars worth of offshore wind projects after the Defense Department allegedly raised new national security concerns about the facilities. But no one outside the federal government seems to know what sort of threats the administration has found. So far, the government has been unwilling to release that information even to the companies building the projects.

The Interior Department sent stop-work orders on December 22 to the developers of five wind projects off the East Coast. The orders were based on classified reports recently completed by the Defense Department. The Interior Department said pausing construction would give federal agencies time to work with project developers to try to mitigate potential risks.

Companies building infrastructure projects routinely work with the federal government to deal with issues that regulators raise, including around national security. Without information about newly-discovered threats, companies building the wind projects have said in court filings that they can't address the government's concerns. They said the lack of transparency suggests the administration's goal is to block wind projects, rather than to deal with legitimate national security issues.

Dominion Energy, which is building a wind project off the Virginia coast, said in a court filing that the government's unspecified national security concerns are ""pretext for this Administration's purely political and irrational campaign against wind energy.""

A White House spokesperson, Taylor Rogers, said in a statement that U.S. industries, including the defense sector, ""cannot depend on the most expensive and unreliable form of energy."" The Interior and Justice departments declined to comment. The Defense Department didn't respond to messages seeking comment.

Blocking offshore wind could drive up power prices by restricting new sources of electricity at a time when demand is expected to soar. Trying to kill federally-permitted projects also risks stifling business investment in the United States, across industries.

""It's a big problem, and it impacts the ability of companies to have confidence to invest in the United States,"" says Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, which represents the offshore oil, gas and wind industries.

Security claims are the administration's latest move against wind energy

The projects targeted by the stop-work orders are Vineyard Wind off the coast of Massachusetts; Revolution Wind offshore Rhode Island; Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind off the coast of New York; and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind. All of the wind farms are far along in construction, with Vineyard Wind 95% complete. Together, the projects would generate enough electricity to power more than 2.5 million homes.

The companies have argued that the government's stop-work orders were ""arbitrary and capricious,"" among other alleged violations of federal law. So far, federal judges have ruled that three of the wind farms targeted by the Trump administration — projects off the coasts of Rhode Island, New York and Virginia — can resume construction while their lawsuits against the government continue.

It's not unusual for presidents to intervene in energy markets. The fossil fuel industry has long complained that it's been targeted by Democrats. Former President Joe Biden, for example, revoked a key permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline as part of his administration's efforts to limit climate change.

However, the Trump administration's latest moves seem more extreme than what presidents have done in the past, according to energy analysts and stakeholders.

Trump has railed against wind energy after he lost a fight with an offshore project near one of his golf courses in Scotland more than a decade ago. ""My goal is to not let any windmills be built,"" President Trump said at a recent White House meeting with oil executives.

The stop-work orders that the Interior Department sent out in December are the administration's latest effort to hobble the industry in the U.S.

Over the past year, the government has refused to issue new permits and has cancelled hundreds of millions in federal funding for ports that serve as assembly and staging areas for offshore projects. And over the summer, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum directed his staff to examine the impact that offshore wind farms could have on ""military readiness."" About a month later, in August, the Interior Department tried, unsuccessfully, to stop construction of a wind project off the coast of Rhode Island based on alleged national security concerns.

It's long been known that the spinning turbines of a wind farm can interfere with radar, obscuring legitimate targets and creating the appearance of false ones. But projects face extensive vetting by federal regulators, including military officials. And there are ways to limit the risk. Dominion Energy, for example, which is building the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project, agreed to pay for radar upgrades at the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). And Sunrise Wind has agreed to curtail operations at NORAD's request.

However, in November, the Defense Department shared new classified information with the Interior Department about security risks surrounding offshore wind, said Matthew Giacona, principal deputy director of the Interior Department's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, in a recent court filing.

It's unclear what the Defense Department found. Giacona said the assessment included ""a discussion of the rapid evolution of relevant adversarial technologies and the direct impacts to national security that arise from the construction and operation of offshore wind projects"" near early-warning and radar systems.

In a separate court filing that was heavily redacted, Dale Marks, a deputy undersecretary in the Defense Department, said the classified material related to an updated assessment of how offshore wind turbines could interfere with military radar.

The stakes are high for regions slated to get electricity from offshore wind

Companies building the wind farms have said in lawsuits that the government has blocked their efforts to get more information. A week after the Trump administration paused construction, a team from Sunrise Wind, including employees with security clearances, met with BOEM officials to try to resolve the government's concerns, according to the company's lawsuit. However, BOEM failed to arrange a classified briefing, Sunrise Wind said, adding that the government ""has taken no real steps"" to share details about alleged security risks. Other companies have described similar interactions with the government.

The administration ""can't just say 'national security,' file a secret report and call it a day,"" James Auslander, a lawyer for Dominion, told a federal judge at a hearing on Friday.

A DOJ lawyer, Stanley Woodward, said at the Friday hearing that the department hasn't politicized the process. The DOJ doesn't plan to share classified information with Dominion or Sunrise Wind during litigation, according to court filings.

""It would appear, when you see the sequencing of events, that [the stop-work orders are] more related to an administration agenda that doesn't want to see offshore wind move forward"" rather than to national security risks, says Milito of the National Ocean Industries Association.

ISO New England, which manages the electric grid across six northeastern states, has said cancelling or delaying two offshore wind farms in the area would drive up power costs by an unspecified amount and jeopardize electric reliability. And PJM Interconnection, which manages the grid from the Mid-Atlantic to the Midwest, has said Dominion's offshore wind project is a critical source of new electricity.

The stakes are also high for companies that have invested billions into projects that now face an uncertain future.

""It's no secret the president has a personal animus toward wind farms,"" Auslander, the Dominion lawyer, said at the Friday hearing. Now, he said, Dominion's project is ""caught in that net.""

By signing CRGA, Illinois aims to address “rising electricity costs driven by private grid operators,” expand cost-saving energy resources, and advance the state’s clean energy economy.
The energy storage target is to have resources deployed or contracted by December 31, 2030.
Illinois is a leader in community solar installations, ranking fifth among states for community solar development.
JB Pritzker stated, “The Clean Reliable Grid Affordability Act sets a national standard for efforts to lower energy costs and marks a historic advancement of our clean energy vision.","Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has signed a clean energy bill that will promote investment in solar photovoltaic and energy storage, among other initiatives, in the state.

This new legislation, titled the Clean Reliable Grid Affordability Act (CRGA, SB 25), builds upon two prior pieces of legislation supporting renewable energy: the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA) passed in 2021, which aims for 100% clean energy by 2050. Since CEJA’s passage, Illinois has supported the deployment of over 6 GW of renewable energy, with an additional 6 GW under development.

By signing CRGA, Illinois aims to address “rising electricity costs driven by private grid operators,” expand cost-saving energy resources, and advance the state’s clean energy economy. The legislation will take effect on June 1, 2026.

To reduce energy costs, the law sets targets, including establishing a state procurement of 3 GW of grid-scale battery storage by 2030; creating virtual power plant (VPP) programs by utilities, enabling households with solar panels, batteries, and electric vehicles to participate; and launching an integrated resource planning (IRP) process designed to identify cost-effective ways to keep energy bills low and make necessary adjustments to state-level programs.

These measures aim to lower energy costs. Programs within the legislation will also require utilities to promote energy equity for low-income households.

Furthermore, CRGA seeks to drive the clean energy economy, create new jobs, and accelerate the construction of new energy projects across the state.

This will be achieved by exploring new clean energy opportunities, such as directing the Illinois Power Agency (IPA) to propose long-term procurement agreements; enacting a Solar Bill of Rights to ensure residents served by municipal and cooperative utilities can install rooftop solar panels; and reforming clean energy siting to facilitate the expansion of energy storage projects.

The Illinois General Assembly passed the bill in October last year, after which it was sent to Pritzker to be signed into law. The energy storage target is to have resources deployed or contracted by December 31, 2030. The bill also directs the state to undertake energy storage procurements for electric companies. As reported by Energy-Storage.news, the bill includes energy storage targets and was warmly welcomed by consumer and environmental advocacy groups as well as clean energy industry organizations when it passed the state legislature.

The legislation will also benefit community solar development in Illinois by raising the maximum project size to 10 MW. According to the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, the state passed its first community solar legislation in 2016. Since then, as of the third quarter of 2025, Illinois has added 444 MW of community solar capacity. Illinois is a leader in community solar installations, ranking fifth among states for community solar development.

JB Pritzker stated, “The Clean Reliable Grid Affordability Act sets a national standard for efforts to lower energy costs and marks a historic advancement of our clean energy vision. Once again, Illinois is stepping up where the federal government has not.”

According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), Illinois is one of the top U.S. states for projected growth in the coming years. SEIA forecasts 14.6 GW of new solar photovoltaic capacity over the next five years, ranking fourth nationally. This would more than double the state’s current installed solar PV, which stood at 6.5 GW by the end of the third quarter of 2025.",https://www.solarbeglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/5.png,N,,2026-01-21 14:01:11.280418

The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) is hosting a virtual meeting series about ongoing actions and efforts to protect, educate, and assist New York communities in addressing the ubiquitous threat of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The webinars will focus on the PFAS Rural Background Study, treatment of landfill leachate, wastewater treatment guidance, sampling of PFAS in biosolids, and drinking water policy.

“Governor Kathy Hochul’s State of the State outlined a number of key priorities for protecting New York’s environment, including the development of new regulations to address PFAS contamination and protect New York communities,” DEC Commissioner Amanda Lefton said. “Public input is critical to the success of the State’s ongoing progress, and we encourage New Yorkers to participate in upcoming opportunities to help guide these important efforts forward.”

Governor Kathy Hochul’s 2026 State of the State directed DEC to develop draft regulations to instruct landfills to treat leachate for harmful contaminants at the source before discharge and provide funding for local governments to comply (more information is available on page 65 (PDF)). Development of regulations to treat landfill leachate at the source will better protect the environment, drinking water sources, and save taxpayers millions in future cleanup costs. DEC is drafting regulations that will instruct landfills to treat leachate for harmful contaminants at the source before discharge to wastewater treatment plants and will provide funding for local governments to comply. Information sessions specifically about the leachate initiative are scheduled for January 27 and February 11, 2026.

In December, DEC issued a suite of significant new actions and helpful resources to protect, educate, and assist New York communities in addressing the ubiquitous threat of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) contamination. This includes a new progress report detailing New York State’s leadership in addressing PFAS; released a new study detailing the widespread presence of PFAS on the landscape; finalized important wastewater treatment plant guidance that protects drinking water and other surface waters; proposed new policies directing DEC’s actions in PFAS investigations and sampling of biosolids products; and launched a new webpage – dec.ny.gov/pfas – that provides a one-stop resource about these and other initiatives and information about DEC’s multifaceted efforts to address PFAS. These topics and the leachate initiative will be addressed at the January 29 information session being held in cooperation with the State Department of Health.

DEC is also hosting a virtual webinar on February 4 outlining the rulemaking process to draft a proposal regulating PFAS in recycled biosolids to determine the long-term management processes and standards related to biosolids-derived soil amendments.

Coal-fired power plants are the largest industrial source of toxic water pollution in the United States, releasing heavy metals like arsenic, lead, mercury, and selenium.
Toxic heavy metals from coal-fired power plant wastewater cause severe human health problems, including cancer, reproductive impacts and lowered IQ among children.","WASHINGTON— The Center for Biological Diversity sued the Trump Environmental Protection Agency over its final rule to weaken, and extend until 2035, national standards that limit or eliminate toxic water pollution from coal-fired power plants, including mercury, selenium, and arsenic.

The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, also contests the EPA’s decision to take no enforcement actions against coal-fired power plants that fail to come into compliance with deadlines set in the agency’s 2020 and 2024 Rules.

“This grotesque action by Administrator Zeldin and the Trump EPA will make polluting corporations richer and Americans sicker,” said Hannah Connor, a senior attorney at the Center. “It’s disgusting that coal power plants have the technology and money needed to clean up their act, but their quarterly profits are more important to them than children’s health. We won’t stand for this immoral and illegal maneuver.”

Beyond delaying compliance with pollution-elimination deadlines, the EPA rule allows power plants that had previously committed to closing down to remain operational without updating their pollution-control standards until the later compliance dates. During that time the coal plants will not be required to take additional action to reduce discharges of heavy metal water pollution into the nation’s waters. The EPA has halso signaled that the postponed deadline for updating the pollution limits could be extended further in the future or eliminated entirely.

Coal-fired power plants are the largest industrial source of toxic water pollution in the United States, releasing heavy metals like arsenic, lead, mercury, and selenium. These plants also discharge high levels of nutrients, bromide and other harmful pollutants.

Toxic heavy metals from coal-fired power plant wastewater cause severe human health problems, including cancer, reproductive impacts and lowered IQ among children.

Power-plant wastewater discharges have also damaged aquatic ecosystems, made it unsafe to eat fish from many rivers and streams, contaminated the lakes and rivers where people swim, and increased treatment costs for drinking-water systems.

Dozens of endangered species, including Atlantic sturgeon, hellbender salamanders, sea turtles, and freshwater mussels will also be harmed by increased heavy metal pollution.

“Trump and Zeldin’s outrageous push to turn our nation’s waterways into industrial sewers will poison thousands of miles of rivers with toxic heavy metals for another decade or more,” said Connor. “This blatant violation of the Endangered Species Act will be a disaster for bald eagles, hellbender salamanders, tiny crayfish, and countless other plants and animals.”

Under the Clean Water Act, coal plants are supposed to be required to use the most modern and effective pollution control technology available before discharging toxic wastewater. The Trump action delays a 2024 Biden-era rule that would have brought nearly all power plants into full compliance with the Act no later than 2029 or required retirement of coal plants that could not meet the standards of the Act.",https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/images/center-frog-logo-300.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 11:04:56.586156

The concession was granted by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources through a competitive tender process involving four qualified bidders. It provides Ormat with long-term rights to explore and develop the resource.

The Telaga Ranu project is located on the island of Halmahera in the province of North Maluku and lies within Indonesia’s highest government-approved feed-in tariff zone. According to the planning documents of the state-owned utility PT PLN (RUPTL), the area has a potential of up to 40 MW of baseload-capable geothermal capacity. Development by the end of 2030 is intended to help replace diesel-based power generation and strengthen energy security in the region.

Ormat views the award as a strategic expansion of its project pipeline in Indonesia. CEO Doron Blachar stated: “The award of the Telaga Ranu geothermal concession represents a significant step in strengthening our development pipeline and highlights our confidence in Indonesia’s long-term geothermal potential. We believe this site has the potential to add up to 40MW to our exploration pipeline, bringing the total to approximately 200MW, in addition to the 59MW associated with our operating asset.”

As part of its energy transition, Indonesia aims to significantly expand renewable energy and reduce emissions. Due to the country’s geological conditions, geothermal energy plays a central role in this strategy. Projects such as Telaga Ranu are considered key building blocks for supplying remote regions with reliable, renewable energy.

Ormat Technologies has more than 50 years of experience in the geothermal sector. The company has developed, manufactured, and built power plants with a total gross capacity of approximately 3,600 MW, which are either owned by Ormat or installed worldwide by utilities and project developers.

The company’s shares, listed in the renewable energy stock index RENIXX World, are currently trading at €100.10, continuing their upward trajectory. In 2025, Ormat’s share price has risen by a total of 47 percent.

The proportion of America’s water use reserved for public drinking water systems is less than 15 percent, even though this kind of water is more valuable than others.

It has twice been named the number one city in America for clean energy.

Yet in 2019 the federal Environmental Protection Agency ordered the city to take action to limit its alleged contamination of the Pacific Ocean. In oral arguments before the US Supreme Court, the EPA’s lawyer condemned the city’s ‘decades-long failure’ to update its sanitation systems. This order came on top of an existing mandate requiring San Francisco to spend almost $11 billion, or $13,000 for every man, woman, and child in the city, updating its sewage systems.

San Francisco and other cities in a similar situation are not delinquent on sanitation. Instead, the EPA is setting water mandates that far exceed what even the most progressive cities think is necessary. These mandates drive up the cost of water, stymie housing, and burden city budgets.

Americans open a tap and get water much like their parents and grandparents did, but the price of water and sewer for households has more than doubled since the early 1980s, adjusted for inflation. American households in large cities now spend about $1,300 a year on water and sewer charges, even though per-capita use has actually decreased.

The roots of America’s water problems lie in the 1970s. Since the Clean Water Act of 1972 and the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, federal environmental rules have ratcheted up. Although state and local water systems had spent the previous century implementing massive improvements in water quality, national regulators treated these systems, supervised by local voters, as delinquent and needing prodding to reform.

Water policy parallels nuclear power, similarly forcing operators to reduce risks, no matter how trivial, and increasing costs to the point where nuclear is expensive and seldom used. This is another example of ‘safetyism’, the tacit ideology that the government’s main goal should be to minimize risks rather than balance them against benefits.

The triumph of urban water

The broad-based provision of clean water in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is one of the great successes in the history of civilization. The US, as did many other countries, accomplished this primarily through local government.

For most of history, cities were demographic sinks. More people died in them than were born, so they needed constant replenishment by migrants from the countryside. Urban areas remained deadly even into the early twentieth century. In 1900, infectious disease death rates were 75 percent higher in the largest American cities than in rural areas. Pathogens, especially waterborne ones such as cholera, typhoid fever, and dysentery, caused 40 percent of these deaths. Yet just three decades later the largest urban areas had slightly lower death rates from infectious diseases than rural areas did, with infectious diseases now causing only 15 percent of deaths.

By the 1940s, infant mortality had collapsed, long before the massive scaleup of penicillin production during the Second World War. Researchers tried to tease out the different mortality rate impacts of introducing new water technologies, such as filtration and chlorination, by looking at how mortality rates dropped in different cities in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Different technologies were installed in different cities at different times, but waterborne disease mortality dropped in almost every city very soon after water treatment was installed. The researchers concluded that half the overall mortality, two thirds of the child mortality, and three quarters of the infant mortality reduction in the early twentieth century were down to clean water.

These clean water successes resulted from patient and dedicated work by policymakers and scientists. A few decades after cities began installing large, publicly owned water systems in the mid-nineteenth century, governments and private individuals made a concerted effort to clean them.

In 1872, Poughkeepsie, New York opened the nation’s first ‘slow sand’ or ‘English’ filter, which allowed water to trickle through fine-grain sand beds that absorbed most solids and many pollutants. Thirteen years later, Somerville, New Jersey created the first urban ‘rapid-sand’ or ‘American’, which pushed water through coarser sand and gravel for faster cleaning and allowed frequent backwashing to prevent the build-up of pollutants. In the early twentieth century the chlorination of water allowed water systems to use minute amounts of chemicals to kill massive amounts of bacteria.

Beginning around the time of the Civil War, cities such as Chicago started creating comprehensive sewers, with ‘intercepting’ sewer lines to collect dirty water from multiple places and drop it farther away from residents. Chicago’s downtown was raised an entire story with jackscrews to allow their installation. Chicago later took this further by building the Sanitary and Ship Canal, reversing the Chicago River’s flow to bring the sewage away from drinking water intake pipes in Lake Michigan.

In the early twentieth century, cities began creating sewage treatment plants, which used chemical coagulants, often from aluminum salts, to bind and settle solid contaminants like feces. These cities began to use ‘activated sludge’ treatment, employing bacteria to decompose feces and other organic matter. The treated water was then piped to a clarifying tank, to separate the clean water from the bacteria-laden sludge that settled at the bottom of the tank.

These modifications were driven primarily by local governments, but states also pushed for improved water quality. In 1878, Massachusetts passed a pioneering water control pollution law that forbade cities or industry from dumping human waste or pollutants into rivers and lakes and gave the state board of health authority to examine water quality and stop polluters. Nine years later, the board established the Lawrence Experiment Station, the world’s first water-pollution research center.

The growth of these local and state systems of water provision and pollution control was an unalloyed triumph that created our familiar urban world.

Nationalizing water problems

The original drive for cleaner water involved hundreds of cities and thousands of politicians, engineers, voters, and activists pushing to improve their systems while weighing the costs and benefits of new public works. This changed in the 1970s: the issue was centralized, and the locals who benefited from and paid for water improvements lost control.

In 1969, the oil-laden Cuyahoga River in Cleveland caught fire. This had happened repeatedly over the preceding decades, and this particular fire was extinguished in half an hour. But it received national media attention, including inspiring a popular Randy Newman song, ‘Burn On’. This event and others, including an oil spill that had coated beaches in Santa Barbara that year, convinced activists that state and local governments were derelict in their duty to protect their citizens’ water.

Two Senate staffers, Tom Jorling, a Republican, and Leon Billings, a Democrat, were concerned enough to seek the nationalization of America’s water policy. The bill they helped write turned water from a state and local concern into a federal one. As historian Terence Kehoe said, the ‘staff members who worked on the bill generally scorned state water pollution control officials’ and worked with activists around Ralph Nader to centralize policy in Washington. ‘These activists helped shape the bill.’

What became known as the Clean Water Act of 1972 mandated new pollutant standards for surface waters, such as rivers and lakes, enforceable through a national system that required permits for sewer or pollutant discharges into waters. Two years later, after an Environmental Defense Fund study using disputed methods claimed a ‘significant relationship’ between drinking water contaminants and cancer deaths around New Orleans, Congress passed the Safe Drinking Water Act to set the federal standards for drinking water. President Gerald Ford expressed concern about ‘extensive Federal involvement in what has traditionally been state and local regulatory matters’, but the weakened post-Watergate president signed the bill.

In economics textbooks, pollution is treated as the quintessential externality that the government needs to control. The goal of government pollution control is to force polluters to bear the costs and consequences of their behavior so that they will only pollute if it’s more valuable to them an than harmful to society.

Because nearly all benefits of clean water are local, and because local governments already supervised water, the argument for federal control was and remains weak. The EPA says that ‘the costs and benefits of cleaner water are realized initially at the local level’ and that ‘changes in the quality of water resources . . . occur in fairly localized areas’. One study found that an increase in biochemical oxygen demand, an indication of the decomposition of organic material, from industrial plant or sewage plant discharges, led to a reduction of just 0.001 milligrams per liter in dissolved oxygen several miles downstream, which the authors note is a small effect and reflects the extent of ‘natural attenuation with travel distance’. For comparison, typical dissolved oxygen levels are about eight milligrams per liter.

Previous state and local governments had voted to invest massive amounts in improved water quality and water safety. One year prior to the Cuyahoga fire, Cleveland voters had approved a $100 million bond to fund a cleanup of their waters. Even areas where water flowed between states, such as the Ohio River, were dealt with by interstate compacts – where states balanced costs and benefits. The federalization movement shifted the calculus so that many localities were forced to do things, supposedly for their own benefit, that they didn’t judge as worthwhile.

Dirty water seems to have an emotional impact other pollution issues don’t. While one would be hard pressed to name a single Hollywood motion picture about local air pollutants, since the 1990s there have been multiple blockbusters focused on local water pollution: Erin Brockovich, Promised Land, Dark Waters, A Civil Action, and so forth. The public has ranked the pollution of drinking water as their number one environmental concern for decades, higher than climate change, species extinction, or local air pollution. This concern has led federal politicians and regulators to impose water mandates on state and local governments that those same voters reject when asked to pay the costs from their own pocketbook.

The impact of new mandates

Today, the average urban household in America pays about $1,300 a year for water and sewers, close to the $1,600 they spend on electricity. In San Francisco, even before the new sewer mandates went into effect, water rates were about $3,600 a year. Local governments spend more on building and maintaining their water and sewer systems than they do on policing.

The main reason for high water charges is federal mandates. The US, largely through federal mandates and subsidies, has spent about $5 trillion, in contemporary dollars, to fight water pollution since 1970, about 0.8 percent of the annual GDP in that period. This effort makes clean water ‘arguably the most expensive environmental investment in US history’, according to one study, far more than air pollution regulations.

Yet the EPA finds that the one category of environmental regulation where estimated costs exceed benefits is surface water regulations. The EPA does say that most of its drinking water mandates have benefits that exceed the costs, but, as one study showed, ‘these determinations were unsupported by the Agency’s own regulatory impact analyses’. The EPA analyses found that for many of the regulated dangers ‘the risks may be as low as zero’, but argued that potential risks should be treated as probable ones.

EPA water mandates have had a massive impact on costs in many urban centers. New York City is famous for having the ‘champagne of drinking water’ due to its numerous reservoirs with surrounding green space. For almost all of its history, the city’s water was unfiltered. But the EPA sued the city in 1997 to force it to filter the water from its famous Croton aqueduct to reduce the prevalence of two minor parasites that could live in the water.

The city was required to build a new plant. By the time the plant opened in 2015, it had taken a decade longer than expected and its cost more than doubled from its original estimate, to $3.2 billion. The project was riddled with accusations of fraud and waste. A Democratic New York state assembly member said ‘one day the Croton Filtration Plant will be right up there with the Tweed courthouse as far as mammoth examples of municipal waste’. Other federal mandates on water also added up. By 2013, the Bloomberg administration announced that it had spent $20 billion on water projects in total over the previous decade.

It is not clear how much New York’s spending accomplished. The city’s Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection noted that although the investments were massive, to the public the water would basically be ‘the same’. Infections from the two microscopic parasites the EPA was attempting to address were higher after the plants opened. A review from The National Academies noted that it was hard to measure the effects because the parasites were so rare to begin with: in 2015 there were about one thousand reported cases across both parasites, from 360 billion gallons of drinking water serving eight million New Yorkers, two million commuters, and nearly 40 million tourists – and they typically resulted in minor gastrointestinal pain.

Despite the lack of clear health benefits, the new mandates help explain why the water rate in New York City rose from under $2 per 100 cubic feet in the mid-1990s to almost $4 per 100 cubic feet in 2015, both in inflation-adjusted dollars. New York City’s water debt had increased to 25 percent of all city debt by the time of the pandemic.

Other places found themselves in worse situations. Jefferson County, Alabama, was forced by the EPA in the 1990s to rework its sewer system and stop sewage overflows into nearby rivers during storms. The county’s sewer debt grew from $300 million to over $3 billion by 2004. In 2011, after some financial engineering attempts to escape the burden went awry, the county descended into bankruptcy, at that point the largest municipal bankruptcy in US history. The average household sewer bill had increased by over 350 percent even before the bankruptcy and has continued increasing since. The rapid increase in EPA sewer lawsuits against cities led the US Conference of Mayors to ask the Obama administration to halt enforcement.

The EPA keeps imposing new rules with questionable benefits. In 2009, it finalized the Aircraft Drinking Water rule, requiring airlines to spend millions of dollars a year treating their water systems despite not having received any reports of illness and having come up with no quantifiable benefits. It recently finalized a rule to require sewer plants that could accidentally emit waste to create ‘Facility Response Plans’. The EPA estimated the cost of this paperwork exercise at more than $100 million a year. The benefits, meanwhile, were only ‘assessed qualitatively’.

In April of last year, the EPA finalized a rule to limit PFAS, so-called ‘forever chemicals’, in drinking water, based on an estimate that it would benefit local consumers of water by $1,549.4 million and cost water systems $1,548.6 million. It may seem suspicious that EPA found benefits that just infinitesimally exceed costs. The American Water Works Association estimates the costs are twice as high.

In water, as in many other fields, such as the ‘As Low As Reasonably Achievable’ radiation standard in nuclear facilities, the federal government has attempted to eliminate almost any risk whatsoever, whatever the cost. The Clean Water Act aims to reduce pollutant discharges to the ‘maximum extent practicable’ and the EPA has continually increased the standard it judges to be practicable. In the Safe Drinking Water Act, the goal has been to reduce pollutants to the lowest extent ‘feasible’ given costs and technology, and again what is considered feasible has been continuously increased. The difference with water is that the federal government is imposing costs not on private parties who supposedly ignore the effects of externalities on fellow citizens, but on the locally accountable bodies that citizens elect.

How water regulation reshapes the landscape

When the Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water Acts passed, observers thought changes to the technology of sewer treatment and water filtering would solve most of the nation’s water problems. But soon environmental officials realized that technological mandates would not be enough to achieve their goals. Thus, courts and federal regulators have tried to limit the use of water.

The year after the Clean Water Act’s passage, a court in Virginia said that Fairfax County could not issue any building permits that would create new sewer flows that further impacted water quality. The judge said that ‘control over building permits is the safest and best way to prevent pollution’. The EPA in the 1970s referred to ‘the ubiquitous sewer moratorium’ spreading across the nation after the Clean Water Act. It issued guidelines that encouraged governments, at pain of losing their federal subsidies, to create schedules for water and sewer hookups that would ‘prevent [urban] growth from exceeding’ the capacity of the systems. These water and sewer moratoria were a major reason for the success of the anti-urban growth movement of that decade.

Today, the EPA or delegated state regulators can mandate complete moratoria on connections to sewer systems if they believe sewer services don’t meet their standards. For instance, Dunn in North Carolina remains under a sewer moratorium imposed in 2021 due to supposed sewer overflow issues. It will have to spend tens of millions of dollars on new sewer treatments to remove it. The town of Epping in New Hampshire also remains under a moratorium imposed in 2022 for similar issues.

Due to the EPA’s high thresholds, sewer and water quality mandates are effective curbs on growth because cities can’t meet the costs of water treatment that come from new residents. Water utilities and local governments often create ‘urban service boundaries’, beyond which new water and sewer hookups are not allowed.

EPA rules mandate certain water quality standards in watersheds, yet such standards are not typically adjusted for population. This means any amount of growth in an area can make it fail the standards, even if blocking growth would just push the population and pollution to other areas. Even inside watersheds, moratoria on hookups often result in lower density and more polluting development attached to well water and septic tanks. (The UK is struggling with a similar issue where a requirement that new developments add literally no nutrient levels in rivers is blocking hundreds of thousands of otherwise-permissioned homes.)

The federal government has come to see part of its environmental mandate as discouraging water use in general. As required by the 1996 Safe Drinking Water Amendments, the EPA issues water conservation ‘guidelines’ that can be incorporated into the mandates for utilities receiving federal assistance. As an EPA official wrote in 2006, ‘Recognizing the need to reduce water use is the first step in developing a strategic plan’ for water utilities.

The federal government has pushed water utilities to use what is known as increasing block pricing, where the first few thousand gallons of water consumed by a household cost the least, the next cost more, and so forth. The goal is conserving water use, since the assumption in many parts of the environmental community is that water is a limited resource that should be kept out of taps as much as possible. Although this rate structure may look like a classic economic way to reduce waste, it poorly reflects the true costs of water systems.

Hooking up and maintaining pipes to a single customer is costly, but a little extra water delivered each month usually isn’t. As one water company president told Congress, ‘the cost structures of utilities are usually inversely related to our revenue structures, and by that I mean that 70 percent of our costs are fixed, but usually 70 percent of the revenues are a risk on consumption. If you have inclining or increasing block rates . . . [that] represents a real threat to the utility recovering the true cost of delivering the water service’. The mismatch between federally encouraged prices and costs has made water systems more reluctant to expand.

Limiting household water consumption is necessary in the short-run during droughts, or in a few truly dry places, but that’s it. The proportion of America’s water use reserved for public drinking water systems is less than 15 percent, even though this kind of water is more valuable than others. The vast majority of the surface water Americans consume serves either irrigation or thermoelectric power, and water for the latter is usually returned directly to streams with minimal effects on downstream users. In the arid West, the proportion used for irrigation is even higher.

The supposed water wars can largely be solved by redirecting water from low-value irrigation to high-value urban uses. The cost of water is much higher for urban users than irrigators, sometimes by orders of magnitude. But trades are not happening. Right now, because of federal mandates, utility pricing structures, insufficient infrastructure, and a general belief that water is scarce and should therefore be squirreled away and not used, many utilities don’t want more water. Instead they are trying to drive up costs and limit use. As the San Antonio Water System says, ‘it’s important we do everything we can to decrease our water consumption’. Unlike most services or companies, which see their job as meeting consumer demand, utilities see their job as limiting it.

Who should balance costs and benefits?

Drinking water issues are already internalized by local communities. Insofar as there is a case for federal government intervention on surface water, it comes where states’ pollution affect one another. When the federal government intervenes, it could consider looking at cap-and-trade or pricing programs as is commonly done for air pollution, instead of using top-down mandates that, as the EPA says, ‘do not reflect considerations of economic impacts or the technological feasibility’ of meeting them. There are encouraging examples. The states around Chesapeake Bay have a limited cap-and-trade program for the nutrient runoffs that can spread algae and create oxygen-depleted dead-zones.

The federal government can also redirect some of its regulatory focus away from urban areas. The Clean Water Act makes a distinction between ‘point sources’ of pollution, such as from municipal sewage plants and factories, which are tightly regulated and require specific types of technological treatment, and ‘nonpoint sources’, especially the runoff of sediment, fertilizers, and pesticides from farms, which face much vaguer rules. The regulation of point sources means that, according to the EPA, ‘nonpoint source pollution is the leading remaining cause of water quality problems’ today. By one measure, preventing a pound of water pollutants coming from agricultural areas costs less than a tenth of what it costs to prevent it coming out of urban areas. A regulatory system that looked at overall surface water health would find more cost-effective reductions to water pollution.

There is an old joke about a boy who said that he knew how to spell the word ‘banana’ but that he didn’t know when to stop. Officials in control of water today know how to get cleaner water but don’t know when to stop. Local voters already face the problems of balancing costs and benefits and the more distant the regulators, the less likely they are to get the balance right themselves.

The money came through the Maine Department of Energy Resources’s Clean Energy Partnership.

“These investments will strengthen career pathways, support local businesses and ensure Maine has the skilled workforce needed to meet growing demand for energy efficiency services across the state,” said Dan Burgess, the department’s acting commissioner.

The goal is to expand the heating, ventilation and air conditioning workforce and up-skill incumbent workers. The programs are expected to serve as many as 1,200 total participants, including new and existing professionals in the field, while supporting 60 local Maine businesses.

HVAC technicians

The Maine Community College System received $317,000 to expand the pipeline of HVAC technicians through career exploration, pre-apprenticeship and short-term workforce training. The system will also offer heat pump installation training for existing HVAC professionals.

Programs will be offered at four community colleges in Bangor, Auburn, Calais and Presque Isle.

Maine is experiencing “incredible demand” for increased residential energy efficiency, said David Daigler, the system’s president. The system will work with industry partners to offer no-cost short-term heat pump installer training andHVAC pre-apprenticeship training, allowing skilled workers to jump into jobs.

“Maine’s employers have been clear about what they need: job-ready technicians with strong mechanical skills, safety credentials, and experience with today’s energy-efficient systems,” said Dan Belyea, the system’s chief workforce development officer. “By expanding pre-apprenticeship pathways and heat pump installer certification across rural Maine, we’re helping employers grow their workforce faster while giving learners the skills, credentials, and connections needed to enter an in-demand field.”

Clean energy training

The Association of Energy Services Professionals was awarded $449,052 to provide training and industry certifications for new and incumbent workers through virtual learning, eight statewide webinars and six in-person hands-on training sessions.

“This grant expands access to clean energy training that supports Maine’s existing workforce and opens new pathways into high-quality careers,” said Jen Szaro, the association’s president and CEO.

Building trades

The Maine Labor Climate Council and affiliated unions and registered apprenticeship programs received $447,500 to collaborate with the United Technologies Center-Region 4, Union Construction Academy of Maine pre-apprenticeship and the Penobscot Nation to train HVAC technicians.

The unions will also provide up-skilling for incumbent workers, including HVAC technicians, HVAC contractors, home performance contractors, electricians and plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters and other building trades professionals.

The grant could help some union members start their own contracting businesses and grow by serving customers in the residential energy efficiency market, said Francis Eanes, executive director of the Maine Labor Climate Council.

“This award will provide training, certifications, and avenues for Wabanaki tribal members to become certified contractors in the energy efficiency workforce,” said Kelsey Flores, Wabanaki sustainable energy coordinator. “Continuing to strengthen the relationship with Maine-based construction trade unions is essential for connecting Wabanaki tribal members to pathways into union careers, while expanding their existing skills.”

Growing workforce

In 2024, as more home heat pumps were installed, the portion of Maine households reliant on heating oil fell to 50%, down from 62% in 2018 and over 70% in 2010, according to a news release.

In July 2023, Maine surpassed its goal of installing 100,000 new heat pumps two years early. As of December 2025, the number of heat pumps installed in Maine has now surpassed 180,000.

Maine’s clean energy workforce has grown to employ nearly 15,600 people, growing at a rate nearly twice that of the state’s overall workforce and contributing nearly $3 billion to the state’s economy, according to the state Department of Energy Resources.

Subcommittee Chairman Jake Ellzey’s opening statement as prepared for delivery:

Welcome to today’s hearing, “Empowering Rural America Through Investment in Innovation.”

I want to say thanks to all of our witnesses for traveling to be here today and for taking the time to share your expertise with the Subcommittee.

As the demand for AI accelerates, America’s digital infrastructure is rapidly expanding into rural communities. This infrastructure consists of data centers being built far beyond traditional tech hubs, with many investments being made in rural areas, including my district. Our rural communities and small businesses are at the center of America’s AI-driven growth.

Texas is leading the charge in data center development because of our pro-growth, pro-energy, low regulatory environment that has minimized the hinderance of red-tape. We’ve placed a strong focus on developing the workforce for high-paying, new-collar jobs and data companies have recognized those benefits

The economic ripple effect from data centers can reinvigorate rural communities by creating high-paying trade careers and supporting long-term economic activity in rural small businesses. For every direct job created at a data center, up to seven jobs are supported in the surrounding community.

Small businesses are supplying, maintaining, and supporting these facilities. From construction to infrastructure upgrades, data centers open doors for Main Street entrepreneurs and trade workers to be part of the next generation of technological advances.

Meeting the workforce needs of data centers across the country will take a whole-of-community approach to attract and train the skilled workers needed to succeed. Many of our military veterans who return to civilian life already possess the skills desired in this industry.

As a veteran myself, I was proud to co-lead the bill that made the Boots to Business training program permanent alongside Chairman Williams, and Representatives McGarvey and Schneider. Through this effort, our returning service members can be trained to fully utilize their military skills in entrepreneurship opportunities, including those offered by the data center industry. This bill was passed in the FY25 NDAA and will continue to be a vital tool in meeting our workforce needs.

Building out this workforce is a crucial step in securing America’s energy dominance and supporting our National Security. At the same time, industry leaders, local partners, and educational institutions are already stepping up with investments in advanced energy solutions that not only strengthen local infrastructure, but keep us competitive in the AI race with China.

I look forward to hearing from today’s witnesses about how data centers can support local communities, strengthen the small business ecosystem, and help build a new middle class in rural areas across the country.

A plurality of voters say the government is investing too much money in electric vehicles and electric vehicle charging stations (38%) and artificial intelligence and data centers (38%).

At least 2 in 3 voters are supportive of the federal government taking a more active role in growing most of these key industries in their community, including infrastructure projects (81%), housing (80%), transportation networks (74%), clean energy projects (72%), and manufacturing facilities for new technologies, like advanced silicon chips or batteries (67%). For each of these industries, only 1 in 5 voters or less are opposed to the government taking a more active role.

However, voters are more divided on whether the federal government should take a more active role in growing electric vehicles and electric vehicle charging stations (50% support, 39% oppose) and artificial intelligence and data centers (48% support, 40% oppose).

Members of Congress are considering different policies that would make it faster to undergo the review and approval processes for different types of energy projects. A plurality of voters (43%) say “the government should speed up these processes only for renewable energy projects like wind and solar, but not for fossil fuel energy projects, like oil and gas,” while 38% say “the government should speed up these processes for all types of energy projects.” Only 12% of voters think “the government should not speed up these processes for any type of energy projects.”

Respondents were provided with a hypothetical about a new construction project being proposed in their area, such as a large new housing development or energy facility, and then were asked what would make them most supportive of the new development.

A plurality of voters (33%) say “job opportunities for my local community,” followed by “knowing the project will help lower the cost of living in my area” (22%). Only 8% of respondents say nothing would make them more supportive of a hypothetical project like this one.

The survey also asked voters whether they think the federal government, state governments, or private sector companies would be most capable of addressing several economic issues. Voters are relatively divided: Pluralities think the federal government is the most capable at “improving U.S. competitiveness in fast-growing global industries” (45%) while private companies are the most capable at “developing new technologies that can support emerging industries” (48%).

However, when the percentages of voters who choose the federal government or state governments are combined for each item, the findings demonstrate that voters perceive government as being more capable than private companies at improving U.S. competitiveness in global industries (+31), creating new jobs in the U.S. workforce (+17), and building or scaling U.S. manufacturing (+11). Conversely, voters are more trusting of the private sector (48%) than government (38%) to develop new technologies that can support emerging industries.

Furthermore, the survey asked voters about a range of policies that have been proposed or implemented by the federal government, and are often the subject of debate around development projects that use federal funding or tax credits.

For every policy tested, a majority of voters across party lines are supportive, except for “implementing tariffs on foreign goods to encourage consumers and businesses to purchase products made in the U.S.,” which is supported by 55% of voters overall but opposed by a majority of Democrats (54%).

These findings indicate that voters want the federal government to play a more active role in growing key industries, especially housing, infrastructure, and transportation. Voters also broadly want to speed up the review and approval processes for energy development, and perceive the government as being more capable than private sector companies for several key economic strategies.

While voters generally express high support for new industrial development, only 51% say they would be enthusiastic about a new construction project in their community, and voters are divided on whether the federal government should take a more active role in growing the electric vehicle and AI industries.

Survey Methodology

From December 13 to 15, 2025, Data for Progress conducted a survey of 1,145 U.S. likely voters nationally using web panel respondents. The sample was weighted to be representative of likely voters by age, gender, education, race, geography, and recalled presidential vote. The survey was conducted in English. The margin of error associated with the sample size is ±3 percentage points. Results for subgroups of the sample are subject to increased margins of error. Partisanship reflectedin tabulations is based on self-identified party affiliation, not partisan registration.

,Texas American Energy ,2026-01-21 15:00:26+00:00,Houston Public Media,The EPA is easing pollution rules under Trump. Here's how it's affecting Texas,"Alejandra Martinez, Texas Tribune, www.houstonpublicmedia.org",,,,,https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/energy-environment/2026/01/21/541179/texas-trump-epa-regulation-rollback/,"It accounts for roughly 16% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is a major driver of climate change.
In 2024, the Biden administration finalized long-anticipated rules requiring oil and gas operators to sharply reduce methane emissions from wells, pipelines, and storage facilities.
Shelley said uniform EPA rules provided regulatory certainty for changes operators saw as inevitable.
Colin Leyden, Texas state director and energy lead at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, said eliminating the program could hurt Texas industry.
Leyden said tallying up the dollar value of lives saved when evaluating pollution rules is a foundational principle of the EPA since its creation.","The first year of President Trump's second term has seen an aggressive rollback of federal environmental protections, which advocacy groups fear will bring more pollution, higher health risks, and less information and power for Texas communities, especially in heavily industrial and urban areas.

Within Trump's first 100 days in office, his new Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Lee Zeldin, announced a sweeping slate of 31 deregulatory actions. The list, which Zeldin called the agency's ""greatest day of deregulation,"" targeted everything from soot standards and power plant pollution rules to the Endangerment Finding, the legal and scientific foundation that obligates the EPA to regulate climate-changing pollution under the Clean Air Act.

Since then, the agency froze research grants, shrank its workforce, and removed some references to climate change and environmental justice from its website — moves that environmental advocates say send a clear signal: the EPA's new direction will come at the expense of public health.

Cyrus Reed, conservation director of the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club, said Texas is one of the states that feels EPA policy changes directly because the state has shown little interest in stepping up its environmental enforcement as the federal government scales back.

""If we were a state that was open to doing our own regulations there'd be less impact from these rollbacks,"" Reed said. ""But we're not.""

""Now we have an EPA that isn’t interested in enforcing its own rules,"" he added.

Richard Richter, a spokesperson at the state's environmental agency, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, said in a statement that the agency takes protecting public health and natural resources seriously and acts consistently and quickly to enforce federal and state environmental laws when they're violated.

Methane rules put on pause

A major EPA move centers on methane, a potent greenhouse gas that traps heat far more efficiently than carbon dioxide over the short term. It accounts for roughly 16% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is a major driver of climate change. In the U.S., the largest source of methane emissions is the energy sector, especially in Texas, the nation's top oil and gas producer.

In 2024, the Biden administration finalized long-anticipated rules requiring oil and gas operators to sharply reduce methane emissions from wells, pipelines, and storage facilities. The rule, developed with industry input, targeted leaks, equipment failures, and routine flaring, the burning off of excess natural gas at the wellhead.

Under the rule, operators would have been required to monitor emissions, inspect sites with gas-imaging cameras for leaks, and phase out routine flaring. States are required to come up with a plan to implement the rule, but Texas has yet to do so. Under Trump’s EPA, that deadline has been extended until January 2027 — an 18-month postponement.

Texas doesn't have a rule to capture escaping methane emissions from energy infrastructure. Richter, the TCEQ spokesperson, said the agency continues to work toward developing the state plan.

Adrian Shelley, Texas director of the watchdog group Public Citizen, said the rule represented a rare moment of alignment between environmentalists and major oil and gas producers.

""I think the fossil fuel industry generally understood that this was the direction the planet and their industry was moving,"" he said. Shelley said uniform EPA rules provided regulatory certainty for changes operators saw as inevitable.

Reed, the Sierra Club conservation director, said the delay of methane rules means Texas still has no plan to reduce emissions, while neighboring New Mexico already has imposed its own state methane emission rules that require the industry to detect and repair methane leaks and ban routine venting and flaring.

These regulations have cut methane emissions in the New Mexico portion of the Permian Basin — the oil-rich area that covers West Texas and southeast New Mexico — to half that of Texas, according to a recent data analysis by the Environmental Defense Fund. That's despite New Mexico doubling production since 2020.

A retreat from soot standards

Fine particulate matter or PM 2.5, one of six pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act, has been called by researchers the deadliest form of air pollution.

In 2024, the EPA under President Biden strengthened air rules for particulate matter by lowering the annual limit from 12 to 9 micrograms per cubic meter. It was the first update since 2012 and one of the most ambitious pieces of Biden's environmental agenda, driven by mounting evidence that particulate pollution is linked to premature death, heart disease, asthma, and other respiratory illnesses.

After the rule was issued, 24 Republican-led states, including Kentucky and West Virginia, sued to revert to the weaker standard. Texas filed a separate suit asking to block the rule's recent expansion.

State agencies are responsible for enforcing the federal standards. The TCEQ is charged with creating a list of counties that exceed the federal standard and submitting those recommendations to Gov. Greg Abbott, who then finalizes the designations and submits them to the EPA.

Under the 9 microgram standard, parts of Texas, including Dallas, Harris (which includes Houston), Tarrant (Fort Worth), and Bowie (Texarkana) counties, were in the process of being designated nonattainment areas — which, when finalized, would trigger a legal requirement for the state to develop a plan to clean up the air.

That process stalled after Trump returned to office. Gov. Greg Abbott submitted his designations to EPA last February, but EPA has not yet acted on his designations, according to Richter, the TCEQ spokesperson.

In a court filing last year, the Trump EPA asked a federal appeals court to vacate the stricter standard, bypassing the traditional notice and comment administrative process.

For now, the rule technically remains in effect, but environmental advocates say the EPA's retreat undermines enforcement of the rule and signals to polluters that it may be short-lived.

Shelley, with Public Citizen, believes the PM2.5 rule would have delivered the greatest health benefit of any EPA regulation affecting Texas, particularly through reductions in diesel pollution from trucks.

""I still hold out hope that it will come back,"" he said.

Unraveling the climate framework

Beyond individual pollutants, the Trump EPA has moved to dismantle the federal architecture for addressing climate change.

Among the proposals is eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which requires power plants, refineries, and oil and gas suppliers to report annual emissions. The proposal has drawn opposition from both environmental groups and industry, which relies on the data for planning and compliance.

Colin Leyden, Texas state director and energy lead at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, said eliminating the program could hurt Texas industry. If methane emissions are no longer reported, then buyers and investors of natural gas, for example, won't have an official way to measure how much methane pollution is associated with that gas, according to Leyden. That makes it harder to judge how ""clean"" or ""climate-friendly"" the product is, which international buyers are increasingly demanding.

""This isn't just bad for the planet,"" he said. ""It makes the Texas industry less competitive.""

The administration also proposed last year rescinding the Endangerment Finding, issued in 2009, which obligates the EPA to regulate climate pollution. Most recently, the EPA said it will stop calculating how much money is saved in health care costs as a result of air pollution regulations that curb particulate matter 2.5 and ozone, a component of smog. Both can cause respiratory and health problems.

Leyden said tallying up the dollar value of lives saved when evaluating pollution rules is a foundational principle of the EPA since its creation.

""That really erodes the basic idea that [the EPA] protects health and safety and the environment,"" he said.

Some states continue to position themselves as places where ordinary people can still get ahead.
According to the recently released U-Haul Growth Index, which tracks the balance of inbound versus outbound one-way truck rentals, states with competitive tax policies that lead to more affordability continue to attract residents.
North Carolina ranks third, and Tennessee, another state without a personal income tax, ranks fourth.
While affordability challenges are real in many parts of the country, they are generally driven by failed big-government policies.","In the early weeks of 2026, what can we expect as it relates to the economy this year? Public debate remains focused on affordability. Americans are still absorbing the consequences of price increases that grew out of control during the Biden administration. In 2022, inflation never fell below 6.5% and peaked at an incredibly high 9.1% in June of that year. Americans noticed people balancing their budgets at their kitchen tables, watching groceries, rent, and utilities consume an ever-greater share of their income.

Yet our economy continues now to show indications of strength. Americans will see significant tax relief with the Working Family Tax Relief Act, which was signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2025. We will see gains in productivity, continued strong GDP growth in the last two quarters, and inflation that has cooled dramatically from its recent peaks during the Biden years.

However, what differs sharply across the country is not the national economy, of course, but state policies that have driven a wide economic divergence between rich states and poor states. Some states continue to position themselves as places where ordinary people can still get ahead. Others continue to enact policies that make basic necessities more expensive and economic mobility more difficult.

Of course, the most direct way for policymakers to leave more money in people’s pockets is to take less of it in the first place. That reality is reflected in human behavior. According to the recently released U-Haul Growth Index, which tracks the balance of inbound versus outbound one-way truck rentals, states with competitive tax policies that lead to more affordability continue to attract residents. Texas and Florida, two states without personal income taxes, again lead the nation in inbound movers. North Carolina ranks third, and Tennessee, another state without a personal income tax, ranks fourth.

At the other end of the list are California, Illinois, New Jersey, and New York. These four states, long committed to high taxes and heavy regulation, also lead the nation in outbound moves. This is not a coincidence. People respond to incentives, even when policymakers pretend otherwise. Such patterns are examples of Americans voting with their feet. Families and businesses migrate toward jurisdictions that allow them to keep more of what they earn and impose fewer regulatory obstacles. Human capital flows to where it can be used most productively, offering a clearer verdict on policy than any political talking point.

During the COVID period, when remote work expanded dramatically, many Americans discovered that moving could function as an immediate boost to affordability. Predictably, many did.

Affordability extends well beyond taxes. Consider even things like water and sewer costs, which are highest in states like Maryland, Washington, Hawaii, and Connecticut. Maryland residents pay, on average, more than three times what residents pay in the lowest-cost states: Alabama, Tennessee, South Carolina, and West Virginia. These differences do not arise from geography alone but from policy choices and regulatory structures at the state level.

Energy costs tell a similar story, depending on the choices of state policymakers. States that pursue government-directed ideas around energy as an overriding objective—through carbon taxes, cap-and-trade policies, or radical ESG ideology—have driven electricity prices sharply upward. California, Massachusetts, and Connecticut now charge more than 21 cents per kilowatt-hour for electricity. In contrast, states like Utah, Idaho, North Dakota, and Wyoming charge less than 9 cents, less than half as much. The consequences are borne not by slogans but by households paying monthly bills.

Housing costs are perhaps the most visible component of the affordability discussion. Prices have risen nationwide and strain household budgets. Some factors, like supply restrictions and property tax burdens, are driven by state and local government decisions, respectively. However, some cost drivers lie beyond state control. In much of the Western United States, large portions of land are federally owned and unavailable for development, creating supply constraints that no state legislature can easily overcome.

But state policy still matters greatly. Housing costs vary widely, even among states facing similar geographic limitations. California, again, stands out—and not in a good way. The average home price exceeds eight times the median personal income in the Golden State. While affordability challenges are real in many parts of the country, they are generally driven by failed big-government policies.

In contrast, we have some refreshing national tailwinds with federal tax relief and deregulation, driving costs lower. Free-market states are doubling down with policies that bring more affordability. As with our great experiment with federalism, Americans are free to choose—and they continue to choose states that value freedom.",https://alec.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/JW-ARJ-Affordability-Migration-Final-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 11:06:42.847801

This massive structural realignment was further bolstered by an $800 million federal award to accelerate the deployment of small modular reactors[2], moving the industry beyond policy talk and into direct capital deployment. As the market re-rates the entire fuel cycle, several key platforms are emerging as leaders in domestic energy security, including Eagle Energy Metals (OTC: SVIIF) (Soon-to-be under symbol ‘NUCLR’), Centrus Energy (NYSE: LEU), NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE: SMR), Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSE-A: UUUU) (TSX: EFR), and Canada Nickel Company (TSXV: CNC) (OTCQB: CNIKF).

Global investment in nuclear capacity is projected to triple by 2035, reaching approximately $210 billion as nations race toward ambitious 2050 power targets[3]. This secular transition is fueled by a new federal mandate that treats domestic critical minerals—from uranium to nickel—as vital national infrastructure[4]. In this unified industrial push, companies with execution-ready projects are being positioned to command the essential backbone of Western energy sovereignty.

Eagle Energy Metals (OTC: SVIIF) (Soon-to-be under symbol ‘NUCLR’) announced this week that it has engaged BBA USA Inc. , a consulting firm with over 45 years of energy sector experience, to design a targeted drilling campaign at its Aurora Uranium Project in support of an eventual Pre-Feasibility Study. The timing matters because the company is soon heading toward a NASDAQ listing under the ticker symbol NUCL through a business combination with Spring Valley Acquisition Corp. II (OTC: SVIIF), the same SPAC team that brought NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE: SMR) public in 2022.

Eagle Energy holds rights to what it describes as the largest open pit-constrained, measured and indicated uranium deposit in the United States. The Aurora deposit sits on the Oregon-Nevada border with 32.75 million pounds of indicated uranium and 4.98 million pounds inferred, based on over 500 drill holes. Adjacent to Aurora is the Cordex deposit, which has seen over 100 holes drilled and offers potential resource expansion as the company digitizes existing data.

""We're seeing sustained demand for nuclear power translate into real demand for uranium, particularly for projects located in the U.S.,"" said Mark Mukhija, CEO of Eagle Energy Metals. ""Advancing Aurora with BBA is about making sure this asset is ready to meet that demand as the market continues to tighten.""

The domestic supply situation provides context for the company's positioning. In 2023, U.S. utilities purchased more than 50 million pounds of uranium, with less than 5% obtained from limited domestic production and over 95% sourced from abroad, including significant amounts from Russia and Kazakhstan.

President Trump recently signed four executive orders aimed at removing regulatory barriers and quadrupling U.S. nuclear power over the next 25 years, while invoking the Defense Production Act to secure domestic uranium supply.

Meanwhile, electricity demand is accelerating as AI, quantum computing, and cryptocurrency operations strain global grids. Meta recently announced plans to build a $10 billion AI data center in Louisiana powered by nuclear energy from Constellation Energy , while Microsoft , Amazon , Oracle , and Nvidia have struck major deals to power their operations with nuclear.

Beyond uranium, Eagle Energy Metals also holds proprietary Small Modular Reactor (SMR) technology. With BBA's technical continuity (they authored Aurora's SK-1300 Technical Report Summary in August 2025), existing infrastructure, and access to low-cost hydropower in a mining-friendly jurisdiction, the company is advancing its asset as domestic uranium supply becomes increasingly prioritized.

Centrus Energy (NYSE: LEU) was awarded $900 million by the U.S. Department of Energy to expand its uranium enrichment facility in Piketon, Ohio, to include commercial-scale production of High-Assay, Low-Enriched Uranium. The competitively-awarded federal funding will support Centrus ' previously announced multi-billion dollar expansion that will also include additional Low-Enriched Uranium production to serve commercial utilities and the existing reactor fleet, with the project expected to support 1,000 construction jobs and 300 new operating jobs in Ohio while retaining 150 existing positions.

""This award represents a historic commitment to revitalizing America's nuclear fuel supply chain and reclaiming American nuclear leadership on the global stage,"" said Amir Vexler, President and CEO of Centrus Energy. ""I am grateful to the Trump Administration for making this commitment and to Republicans and Democrats in Congress who came together to provide this urgently needed funding.""

The fixed-price base task order amount is $900 million to bring new enrichment capacity online, with additional options for up to $170 million to produce and deliver HALEU to the Department. Centrus has already launched domestic centrifuge manufacturing at its Oak Ridge, Tennessee factory, with first new capacity expected online in 2029.

NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE: SMR) has released study results demonstrating that pairing its advanced small modular reactor nuclear technology with a heat augmentation system can provide both profitable and reliable power for commercial chemical plants. The techno-economic assessment conducted in collaboration with Oak Ridge National Laboratory examined the performance of coupling a NuScale Power Module with a U.S. chemical facility to provide nuclear-generated steam and electric power.

""As the first and only SMR to have our designs certified by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), NuScale continues to lead in the development of new technologies to provide process heat and electricity,"" said Dr. José Reyes, Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at NuScale Power. ""As we saw in the results of this assessment, delivering high-temperature steam with NuScale's scalable architecture provides industrial users with unparalleled flexibility that can be integrated into their processes and offers a promising new path for them to explore. We are proud of the collaboration with our partners at ORNL and grateful for the support of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under the Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear (GAIN) initiative for this study.""

The study demonstrated that the NuScale integrated energy system could meet chemical plant requirements of 1.3 million kg/h of process steam at 400°C and 4.1 MPa while also providing 73 MW of electric power. The hybrid system's scalable architecture offers maximum flexibility for optimizing plant energy use and profitability across various configurations.

Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSE-A: UUUU) (TSX: EFR) exceeded FY-2025 guidance for finished uranium production, mined uranium ore production and uranium concentrate sales. The company's Pinyon Plain Mine in Arizona and La Sal Complex in Utah produced over 1.6 million pounds of uranium in 2025, exceeding the top end of guidance by approximately 11%, while the White Mesa Mill produced more than one million pounds of finished U₃O₈ during 2025 with over 350,000 pounds produced in December alone.

""These 2025 uranium metrics reinforce our reputation as, not only the country's lowest-cost and largest uranium producer, but as a company that delivers on its promises,"" said Mark S. Chalmers, CEO of Energy Fuels Inc. ""Nuclear energy powered by uranium is among the cleanest, least expensive, and most reliable ways to supply our nation's growing energy and electricity needs.""

The company expects to sell 360,000 pounds of U₃O₈ in Q4-2025 at a weighted average sales price of approximately $74.93 per pound, representing 50% growth over Q3-2025 sales volumes. Energy Fuels Inc. completed two new long-term uranium sales contracts with U.S. nuclear power generating companies adding deliveries for 2027 to 2032 utilizing hybrid pricing with exposure to uranium market upside.

Canada Nickel Company (TSXV: CNC) (OTCQB: CNIKF) was named as the second project to be advanced under Ontario's new One Project, One Process framework, reflecting the advanced state, scale, and strategic importance of the Crawford Nickel Project within Ontario's Critical Minerals Strategy. The 1P1P framework is designed to better coordinate Ontario's permitting and review processes for major mining developments by aligning timelines, responsibilities, and information sharing across provincial ministries.

""Ontario is moving at lightning speed to open this 100% Canadian owned mine to create 4,000 jobs for Canadian workers,"" said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Energy and Mines. ""In 2026, our government is going full-tilt to unlock one of the world's largest nickel deposits that will supercharge our economy and help end China's critical mineral dominance.""

Crawford is expected to be the largest nickel sulphide project in the western world and among the most economically significant mining developments in Canada, with independent analysis estimating the Project will generate more than $70 billion in GDP over its initial 40+ year mine life. Canada Nickel Company is targeting construction commencement by year-end 2026.

House Bill 1002 would require companies to make billing consistent and predictable for customers. Another provision would transition utility companies to three-year rate plans subject to state approval.

The bill's author, Rep. Alaina Shonkwiler (R-Noblesville), said the goal of the legislation is “modernizing” how Indiana regulates electric utilities to benefit residents.

""The multi-year rate planning provides greater rate stability and predictability for customers, improved regulatory efficiency … and continued oversight and flexibility, including periodic reviews, public input,"" Shonkwiler said.

After discussing and then voting on several amendments, the House utilities committee approved the bill unanimously. It joins other Statehouse efforts to address energy costs, including a bill on nuclear power regulations.

HB 1002 would also create a summer disconnection moratorium, which would prohibit companies from shutting off service during periods of extreme heat. But lawmakers disagree over whether the final rule should be a time-based period as state law mandates in winter, or whether it should be tied to National Weather Service-declared heat emergencies.

Utility companies would be required to submit regular reports to the Indiana Office of the Utility Consumer Counselor under the bill. It would also reign in the ability of the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission to freeze rates by calling an electric emergency. Instead, it allows the agency to request an emergency declaration from the governor.

In his State of the State address last week, Gov. Mike Braun said utility rates are too high and signaled support for Shonkwiler’s legislation.

“Affordability is why I support Rep. Alaina Shonkwiler’s bill to hold investor-owned utilities accountable to provide affordable energy before they can increase their profit margin,” Braun said.

Rep. Matt Pierce (D-Bloomington) appreciated a Republican amendment that addressed several concerns from Democrats, some of which he said could have prevented his caucus from voting on the bill.

“You’ll see from our amendments, we think that there are some other things that can be done to provide even more relief,” Pierce said Tuesday.

Some of their proposals failed, including amendments to prevent outstanding utility bills from impacting a person’s credit score, and to prohibit companies from charging disconnect and reconnect fees.

Committee chair Rep. Edmond Soliday (R-Valparaiso) directed two Democrats to work with Indiana Energy Association President Danielle McGrath on amendments that would require companies to share more information with customers on their bills. Those included a notice to customers when they hit 50% of their usage from the previous month and a provision for companies to include both the amount a customer owes for the month and the total outstanding balance on their bill.

A subsidiary of the German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp has agreed to buy a certain type of steel from Stegra’s plant in northern Sweden, which is set to start operations next year.
The plant will use green hydrogen — made with renewable energy — and clean electricity to produce iron and steel.

Construction on Stegra’s plant in northern Sweden was 60% complete as of late October, and the company continues to share snapshots of ongoing work at its snow-covered site on social media.","Stegra’s grand plan to build the first large green-steel mill in the world has recently hit a rough patch. Faced with increasing project costs and construction delays, the Swedish startup has been seeking to raise over $1 billion in additional financing since last fall to complete the flagship facility near the Arctic Circle.

Last week, though, Stegra shared some brighter news: The company landed a major new customer, marking a step forward for the beleaguered project.

A subsidiary of the German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp has agreed to buy a certain type of steel from Stegra’s plant in northern Sweden, which is set to start operations next year. The plant will use green hydrogen — made with renewable energy — and clean electricity to produce iron and steel. The sprawling facility is expected to initially produce 2.5 million metric tons of steel annually and eventually double its production of the metal.

Stegra, formerly H2 Green Steel, estimates that its process will slash carbon dioxide emissions by up to 95% compared with traditional coal-based methods, which account for up to 9% of global emissions.

Thyssenkrupp Materials Services said it would buy tonnages in the ​“high-six-digit range” of ​“non-prime” steel — metal that doesn’t meet the high-quality standards required for certain uses but that is still strong and durable enough for other applications. Steel mills typically produce a higher ratio of non-prime metal when they’re starting up, which decreases over time, according to Stegra. The deal should help the firm generate cash flow when the plant first opens.

“A partner for non-prime steel is important for the ramp up of our steel mill,” Stephan Flapper, head of commercial at Stegra, said in a Jan. 12 statement. ​“Together we can drive an even stronger pull for steel products made via the green hydrogen route.”

The deal is Stegra’s first for non-prime steel, though the startup has already inked agreements for prime steel with automakers such as Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, and Scania, as well as major companies including Cargill, Ikea, and Microsoft. The offtake contracts represent more than half the steel that will be produced during the plant’s first phase.

Notably, Thyssenkrupp Materials Services won’t count the carbon-emission reductions associated with the green steel toward its own climate targets. Instead, Stegra will separately sell the green credentials, in the form of environmental attribute certificates, to other customers in the prime steel market. Stegra previously struck a deal to sell certificates to Microsoft — which is an investor — to help offset emissions from conventionally made steel that the tech giant is using to build data centers outside Europe.

The startup’s announcement with the Thyssenkrupp subsidiary didn’t include details about the financial value or other parameters of the multiyear agreement. Stegra didn’t respond to Canary Media’s requests for comment.

Analysts said the lack of specifics makes it difficult to know exactly how meaningful this development is for the Swedish steelmaker as it works to address its financial challenges.

“This gives a positive signal … that they’re moving in the right direction,” said Anne-Sophie Corbeau, a Paris-based hydrogen analyst at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. ​“But it’s really complicated to quantify how significant this is.”

The new deal with Thyssenkrupp and the previous one with Microsoft ​“suggest Stegra has a technically sound product,” Brian Murphy, head of hydrogen and low-carbon gas for S&P Global Energy, said by email. He added that, in general, signing long-term offtake deals for clean-hydrogen projects has become ​“the key unlock” for developers to secure necessary financing.

Still, ​“more price information is required to assess the full impact on Stegra’s financial position,” he said.

Stegra is forging ahead with its multibillion-dollar project even as other European steelmakers put their hydrogen-fueled ambitions on ice.

Last year, Thyssenkrupp Steel and the industrial giant ArcelorMittal said they were canceling or postponing projects in Europe, citing the economic headwinds and uncertain market conditions facing green steel and hydrogen production. The setbacks come even as the European Union is increasing regulatory pressure on steelmakers inside the bloc and globally to curb CO2 emissions from industrial facilities. In the United States, meanwhile, plans for two marquee green-steel projects were shelved last year.

Construction on Stegra’s plant in northern Sweden was 60% complete as of late October, and the company continues to share snapshots of ongoing work at its snow-covered site on social media. Stegra’s success, if it comes, could reinvigorate green-steel efforts across the region, particularly if the company can sell its steel at prices that cover the higher costs of making low-carbon metal, Corbeau said.

“In the end, if the economics work and they manage to sell most of the steel at a premium, that will be a good signal for a lot of the other companies that have been hesitant,” she said.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Stegra-site-web5-copy.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=d641a8f58c85a67ba968113991691451,N,,2026-01-21 13:01:50.630964

It does similar work in its home country with National Grid Electricity Distribution, a subsidiary of the same firm that owns National Grid in Massachusetts.
But National Grid is seeking to solve grid problems at 23 locations, each with a distinct set of needs, Tom said.
Distributed energy resources can bridge the grid overloads until the necessary upgrades take place.
After all, a utility must pay the customers handing over the reins to their distributed energy resources.","As Massachusetts faces an energy-affordability crisis, one of the state’s biggest utilities is trying a new approach to satisfy growing power demand without blowing out its grid budget and further spiking residents’ bills.

Late last year, National Grid launched a marketplace in Massachusetts that, put simply, lets the utility shop for the best customer-owned solar and batteries, smart EV chargers and appliances, and other distributed energy resources to reduce strain on the grid in specific locations.

The idea is that National Grid can strategically deploy this existing, scattered energy equipment during periods of high demand — for example, drawing power from a home battery, dialing down a business’s air conditioning, or deferring EV charging.

This relief on the grid lets the utility defer or even fully avoid upgrading the wires, transformers, and other infrastructure that deliver power to households. Such costly upgrades are the single biggest driver of rising electricity bills in the U.S.

That’s why National Grid calls it a ​“non-wires alternative” program — it’s finding things that can defer and reduce the costs of those grid investments.

Unlike the ​non-wires alternative projects that utilities have been doing for at least the past decade, this one is designed to move much more quickly and cast a much wider net for resources that can stand in for grid upgrades.

“The 2010s version is, you’ve got big players, a single project for the entire need. It’s an old-school utility procurement,” said Josh Tom, National Grid’s director of energy transition solutions. ​“It’s a closed system, not accessible to everyone. And it can take a long time.”

These slow, burdensome, and costly approaches have yielded only a handful of successful projects over the years. National Grid’s new program, by contrast, is built around a marketplace platform into which companies can bid resources ranging from big batteries to lots of smart thermostats.

From there, National Grid can assess how they could be combined to solve particular grid challenges at different sites on the utility’s distribution network. That should allow it to move much more quickly to find, test, and potentially pay for resources that meet its grid needs, said Nick Watson, National Grid’s director of flexible resource engineering. ​“We see it as more of a dynamic process,” he said.

The utility’s bidding opportunity will be open through mid-February and target providing grid relief during the summer and winter seasons from 2026 to 2030, Watson said. ​“We’ll assess those bids, figure out the procurements that meet our needs, using tools we’re trying out for the first time.” Contracts with winning bidders will follow, and tests of the resources are expected to begin this spring, ahead of eligible assets being dispatched in the summer, he said.

Piclo: Making a market for grid flexibility

The company running National Grid’s new marketplace is the U.K.-based startup Piclo. It does similar work in its home country with National Grid Electricity Distribution, a subsidiary of the same firm that owns National Grid in Massachusetts.

Piclo is a major provider of flexibility-marketplace services in the U.K., a country that analysts say is far ahead of the U.S. on this front, and the company has expanded to mainland Europe and Australia in recent years. It’s also making inroads in the U.S. via its partnerships with Connecticut utilities and with National Grid, which has already used Piclo’s marketplace as part of its ​“dynamic load management” programs in New York for several years.

“We’ve done this for years in the U.K. and beyond,” said James Johnston, Piclo’s CEO. ​“But in a lot of the U.S., this hasn’t happened before.”

The potential could be huge, Johnston said. In September, Piclo announced that it had registered across the U.S. a combined 1 gigawatt of distributed energy resources — a term that includes batteries, EV fleets, grid-responsive appliances, and commercial and industrial buildings that can dial down energy use on demand. Companies registering with Piclo include major residential solar and battery installer Sunrun, demand-response provider Enel X, and energy-efficiency startup Budderfly.

Owners and managers of these distributed energy resources can share data on Piclo’s platform about how much power their devices can inject into the grid, store for later use, or put off consuming, Johnston said. The platform will connect those offers to entities — utilities, grid operators, and large customers like data centers that are looking for ways to mitigate their impact on the system — interested in tapping them to solve energy or grid challenges.

Unlike companies that aggregate distributed energy resources and manage them as virtual power plants, ​“we don’t take a position in the market,” Johnston said. ​“We’re that party that partners trust to share data with. We’re that matchmaker — we share the right data sets, end to end, across that entire journey. And we’re the adjudicator — whether you’re matched or not, whether you win a contract or not.”

Piclo has proved its bona fides in the U.K., where it has more than 60,000 registered distributed energy resources and has procured more than 2.6 gigawatts of flexible capacity to date.

For National Grid, Piclo’s marketplace opens up a world of possibilities, Tom said.

“They’re helping us communicate our needs to the market,” he said. ​“Their open marketplace is a new procurement approach.”

The current program round is looking to secure about 25 megawatts of flexibility, he said. That’s less than half the 52 megawatts secured by the largest non-wires alternative program in the country — the Brooklyn-Queens Demand Management program, launched in 2014 by utility Con Edison to relieve a congested New York City substation.

But National Grid is seeking to solve grid problems at 23 locations, each with a distinct set of needs, Tom said. Some sites require only a small amount of overload relief on a substation or circuit during a handful of hours in the summer or winter. Others may require non-wires alternatives that can be dispatched more frequently or that expand over time as new customers increase peak demands on a specific part of the grid.

One key benefit of working with Piclo’s marketplace is that it helps National Grid mix and match the capabilities of a number of different bidders, rather than forcing a single bidder to meet them all, Tom said. ​“What we’re really trying to do in this approach is open up the possibility for portfolios of bids that work alongside each other to meet the need in a couple of ways,” he said.

“Let’s say you have a 3-megawatt need for a summer season, a four-hour window or eight-hour window on certain days,” he said. ​“We want to open the possibility, even if you don’t have 3 megawatts, to bid in your 1 megawatt,” which the company will combine with megawatts from other providers to make up the difference. ​“That opens opportunities for those who can’t enter the market otherwise.”

Portfolios can be built across time as well as across scale, he added. ​“Let’s say it’s a four-hour window. If you can only provide 3 megawatts for the first two hours, someone else could provide the megawatt for hours three and four — and we have a complete portfolio.”

Proving out a new way to boost the grid

Once National Grid selects the distributed energy resources it wants to procure from the Piclo marketplace, the utility will have to run them through a gauntlet of tests to ensure they’re reliable enough to relieve grid stresses.

“There are a bunch of test dispatch requirements before we run a real event or renumerate a party for services provided,” Tom said. This spring and summer will be dedicated to running those tests and to fine-tuning the ​“contractual structures with the right characteristics to ensure we’re comfortable in the future.”

Regulator support has been critical in setting this up, he added. Massachusetts’ three major investor-owned utilities are required to develop grid-modernization plans under a 2022 energy and climate law that sets the state on a course to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. In approving those plans, the state let utilities create grid services compensation funds that can pay for non-wires alternative programs, he explained.

Launching Piclo’s marketplace isn’t National Grid’s only attempt at a non-wires alternative program in Massachusetts. The utility is also expanding a 7-year-old program called ConnectionSolutions, which regulators required all the state’s investor-owned utilities to deploy. This program is designed not to relieve local grid constraints but rather to reduce overall peak demands on power plants and transmission grids. In that role, it has delivered hundreds of megawatts of grid relief during summer heat waves and become a national model for virtual power plants.

Now, National Grid wants to see if the program can also help defer or avoid upgrades at specific grid substations and circuits. The expanded version, ConnectedSolutions+, offers customers incremental incentives to install and sign up resources in areas with local grid needs.

What distinguishes ConnectedSolutions+ from National Grid’s work with Piclo is that the latter program targets not just customers with smart thermostats, EV chargers, grid-responsive appliances, and battery storage but also larger grid-connected energy assets like community solar arrays and batteries, Tom noted. Massachusetts has a lot of community solar that’s been challenging to connect to the grid, and the state has been working for years to find a way to use those solar and battery systems to relieve grid stresses.

Importantly, National Grid’s first round of non-wires alternatives is targeting spots that aren’t in dire need of grid upgrades, Tom said. ​“We’re not putting at risk the safety and reliability of the network by doing this.”

Another key target for National Grid is for ​“bridge-to-wires” needs, Watson said — spots where new customers that use a lot of power want to plug into the grid and ​“you can’t build the infrastructure quickly enough” to accommodate them, he said. Distributed energy resources can bridge the grid overloads until the necessary upgrades take place.

One big question that utilities must grapple with is when a non-wires alternative makes financial sense. After all, a utility must pay the customers handing over the reins to their distributed energy resources. Utilities also can’t avoid upgrading their grids forever — and changing circumstances can wreak havoc on the assumptions that inform how much a non-wires alternative is worth.

Utilities must account for a ton of variables to determine the value of deferring grid investments versus biting the bullet and investing in must-have upgrades or expansions, Watson said. ​“We’ve been developing methodologies to help us do that over the course of this year,” he said. ​“It depends on what the use case is.”

But from Watson’s perspective, utilities will have to find better ways to manage their grids in the long run, as power demand grows, distributed solar and batteries proliferate, and electric vehicles and buildings add both new strains and new sources of flexibility to the system.

“Traditionally, it isn’t the business model of the investor-owned utility to leverage flexibility,” he said. But to meet state goals around electrification and emissions reductions, ​“we’re going to have to change the way we manage our network. We can’t just continue to build out the network in the traditional ways we have in the past.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-1260528106.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=d47453ead08f8ca6e86a1eb4ddb28bbb,N,,2026-01-21 13:02:13.798295

The elimination of the tax credit has raised questions about the long-term adoption rates of zero-emission vehicles across the nation’s auto sector.
Last month, Cox Automotive estimated that EV sales in the U.S. in November dropped 41.2% compared to one year earlier.
While sales of EVs and plug-ins have grown, the rate of adoption in California has slowed in the past couple of years, before the federal tax credit was abolished.
“If anybody thought that there would be a sustained level of sales, post-federal tax credit, they would have to be insane,” he said.","The recent termination of federal tax credits for zero-emission vehicles delivered a body blow to end-of-the-year sales across California.

According to figures released Tuesday by the California Energy Commission, registrations for electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles came to 79,066 in the fourth quarter of 2025.

That works out to a drop of 36.6% compared to 124,755 sold in the third quarter, when many Californians rushed to buy or lease EVs before the federal tax credit expired on Sept. 30.

State policymakers and Gov. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday emphasized the long-term expansion of zero-emission vehicles, pointing out that cumulative sales in California have surpassed 2.55 million and have grown 300% since the end of 2019.

“California didn’t reach 2.5 million zero-emission vehicles by accident — we invested in this future when others said it was impossible,” Newsom said in a statement while at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

Last year, the massive 940-page federal budget dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” backed by Republicans on Capitol Hill and signed into law by President Donald Trump included provisions that eliminated the federal tax credit of up to $7,500 on the purchase or lease of a new EV, or $4,000 for a used one.

The elimination of the tax credit has raised questions about the long-term adoption rates of zero-emission vehicles across the nation’s auto sector.

Last month, Cox Automotive estimated that EV sales in the U.S. in November dropped 41.2% compared to one year earlier.

Ford recently discontinued its all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck and Stellantis ceased production of its plug-in hybrid models of the Jeep Wrangler 4xe, Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe and Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid. Ford and GM also reported write-downs in the billions on its EV assets.

But California officials say they are undeterred.

“Each quarter, even in the face of increasing federal headwinds, tens of thousands of consumers are purchasing a (zero-emission vehicle) in the Golden State, enjoying a great driving experience, and knowing they never have to go to a gas station again,” California Energy Commissioner Nancy Skinner said in a statement.

California has more zero-emission vehicles on the road than any other state. In 2020, Newsom issued an executive order mandating the elimination of sales of all new gasoline-powered passenger vehicles throughout California by 2035.

While sales of EVs and plug-ins have grown, the rate of adoption in California has slowed in the past couple of years, before the federal tax credit was abolished.

Last June, Trump signed three Congressional Review Act resolutions that rescinded California’s electric vehicle rules — as well as mandates related to diesel engines.

California and 10 other states have responded by filing a lawsuit, arguing that Trump’s actions are unconstitutional and beyond the authority of Congress.

Newsom recently announced plans to set aside $200 million to bring back a rebate program for California drivers who buy zero-emission vehicles.

Specifics — including the size of the rebate and eligibility requirements — still need to be worked out, and the program will require approval by the Legislature in Sacramento.

“Gov. Newsom’s new rebate proposal sends a clear message,” California Air Resources Board Chair Lauren Sanchez said Tuesday. “California isn’t slowing down, we’re still leading the pack. It’s not just about clean air, it’s smart economic policy.”

Ivan Drury, senior manager of auto insights at Edmunds.com, said the state’s drop in fourth-quarter sales did not surprise him.

“If anybody thought that there would be a sustained level of sales, post-federal tax credit, they would have to be insane,” he said. “It was destined to happen.”

The 79,066 registrations of zero-emission vehicles in the last three months of 2025 represented the lowest number in California since the third quarter of 2022.

Drury and other auto analysts will keep a sharp eye on EV sales figures in the next few quarters to see if the numbers have bottomed out and then rebound or not.

“This consumer base wasn’t buying in the friendliest conditions” in the fourth quarter, Drury said, “and going forward it should get better. … If the numbers (in succeeding quarters) come back and they’re very high, fantastic. But if it’s kind of murky and it looks very similar to Q4, then yeah, there will be a lot of questions.”

But the story is more complicated than that.

I study emerging technologies and how their development and deployment influence economic, institutional and societal outcomes, including environmental sustainability. From my research, I see that even as AI uses a lot of energy, it can also make systems cleaner and smarter.

AI is already helping to save energy and water, cut emissions and make businesses more efficient in agriculture, data centers, the energy industry, building heating and cooling, and aviation.

Agriculture

Agriculture is responsible for nearly 70% of the world’s freshwater use, and competition for water is growing.

AI is helping farmers use water more efficiently. Argentinian climate tech startup Kilimo, for example, tackles water scarcity with an AI-powered irrigation platform. The software uses large amounts of data, machine learning, and weather and satellite measurements to determine when and how much to water which areas of fields, ensuring that only the plants that actually need water receive it.

Chile’s Ministry of Agriculture has found that in that country’s Biobío region, farms using Kilimo’s precision irrigation systems have reduced water use by up to 30% while avoiding overirrigation. Using less water also reduces the amount of energy needed to pump it from the ground and around a farm.

Kilimo is one example that shows how AI can create economic incentives for sustainability: The amount of water farmers save from precision irrigation is verified, and credits for those savings are sold to local companies that want to offset some of their water use. The farmers then earn a profit – often 20% to 40% above their initial investment.

Data centers

U.S. data centers consumed about 176 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2023, accounting for roughly 4.4% of total U.S. electricity use. This number increased to 183 TWh in 2024. This growing energy footprint has made improving data center efficiency a critical priority for the operators of the data centers themselves, as well as the companies that rely on them – including cloud providers, tech firms and large enterprises running AI workloads – both to reduce costs and meet sustainability and regulatory goals.

AI is helping data centers become more efficient. The number of global internet users grew from 1.9 billion in 2010 to 5.6 billion in 2025. Global internet traffic surged from 20.2 exabytes per month in 2010 to 521.9 exabytes per month in 2025 – a more than 25-fold increase.

Despite the surge in internet traffic and users, data center electricity consumption has grown more moderately, rising from 1% of global electricity use in 2010 to 2% in 2025. Much of this is thanks to efficiency gains, including those enabled by AI.

AI systems analyze operational data in data centers – including workloads, temperature, cooling efficiency and energy use – to spot energy-hungry tasks. It adjusts computing resources to match demand and optimizes cooling. This lets data centers run smoothly without wasting electricity.

At Microsoft, AI is improving energy efficiency by using predictive analytics to schedule computing tasks. This lets servers enter low-power modes during periods of low demand, saving electricity during slower times. Meta uses AI to control cooling and airflow in its data centers. The systems stay safe while using less energy than they might otherwise.

In Frankfurt, Germany, Equinix uses AI to manage cooling and adjust energy use at its data center based on real-time weather. This improved operational efficiency by 9%, The New York Times reported.

Energy and fuels

Energy companies are using AI to boost efficiency and cut emissions. They deploy drones with cameras to inspect pipelines. AI systems analyze the images to more quickly detect corrosion, cracks, dents and leaks, which allows problems to be addressed before they escalate, improving overall safety and reliability.

Shell has AI systems that monitor methane emissions from its facilities by analyzing methane concentrations and wind data, such as speed and direction. This helps the system track how methane disperses, enabling it to pinpoint emission sources and optimize energy use. By identifying the largest leaks quickly, the system allows targeted maintenance and operational adjustments to further reduce emissions. Using that technology, the company says it aims to nearly eliminate methane leaks by 2030.

AI could speed up innovation in clean energy by improving solar panels, batteries and carbon-capture systems. In the longer term, it could enable major breakthroughs, including advanced biofuels or even usable nuclear fusion, while helping track and manage carbon-absorbing resources such as forests, wetlands and carbon storage facilities.

Shell uses AI across its operations to cut emissions. Its process optimizer for liquefied natural gas analyzes sensor data to find more efficient equipment settings, boosting energy efficiency and reducing emissions.

Buildings and district heating

The energy needed to heat, cool and power buildings is responsible for roughly 28% of total global emissions. AI initiatives are starting to reduce building emissions through smart management and predictive optimization.

In downtown Copenhagen, for instance, the local utility company HOFOR deployed thousands of sensors tracking temperatures, humidity and building energy flows. The system uses information about each building to forecast heating needs 24 hours in advance and automatically adjust supply to match demand.

The Copenhagen system was first piloted in schools and multifamily housing, with support from the Nordic Smart City Network and climate-innovation grants. It has since expanded to dozens of sites. Results were clear: Across participating buildings, energy use fell 15% to 25%, peak heating demand dropped by up to 30%, and carbon dioxide emissions decreased by around 10,000 tonnes per year.

AI can also help households and offices save energy. Smart home systems optimize heating, cooling and appliance use. Researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that by adopting AI, medium-sized office buildings in the U.S. could reduce energy use by 21% and cut carbon dioxide emissions by 35%.

Aviation

About 2% of all human-caused carbon dioxide emissions in 2023 came from aviation, which emitted about 882 megatons of carbon dioxide.

Contrails, the thin ice clouds formed when aircraft exhaust freezes at cruising altitudes, contribute more than one-third of aviation’s overall warming effect by trapping heat in the atmosphere. AI can optimize flight routes and altitudes in real time to reduce contrail formation by avoiding areas where the air is more humid and therefore more likely to produce contrails.

Airlines have also used AI to improve fuel efficiency. In 2023, Alaska Airlines used 1.2 million gallons less fuel by using AI to analyze weather, wind, turbulence, airspace restrictions and traffic to recommend the most efficient routes, saving around 5% on fuel and emissions for longer flights.

In short, AI affects the environment in both positive and negative ways. Already, it has helped industries cut energy use, lower emissions and use water more efficiently. Expanding these solutions could drive a cleaner, more sustainable planet.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/712762/original/file-20260115-56-ppnyes.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C65%2C3898%2C1949&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-21 09:59:17.191965

""After so many lies, it would be nice for everyone to stop pushing this false narrative that they could find the truth behind by simply looking up one single number for once,"" Jameson Dow, who has been reporting on EVs for the last decade, wrote in a piece appearing in Elektrek.

Dow's criticism is aimed at headlines claiming that EV sales are somehow stalling or even declining when, in fact, the opposite has been true.

Dow made his case using data from Statista, which showed that the global market share of battery EVs has continued to grow every year since 2015. Based on current trends, Statista has projected that EVs will account for 44.8% of the global market by 2030.

While some years have seen slower EV market growth than others, Dow pointed out that this is hardly the same as sales declining. With EV sales having as much as doubled year-over-year in some instances, it would be mathematically impossible for such trends to continue indefinitely.

""To take an extreme example, it would be odd to say that sales are slumping in Norway, which just set a record at 98.3% BEV [Battery EV] market share in September with 14,329 units moved,"" Dow wrote for Elektrek.

This represented 14.6% growth, which is far lower than the previous September's astronomical 96.4% increase, per Elektrek. However, as Dow explained, because market share cannot exceed 100%, such rapid growth has its limits.

With drivers able to save thousands of dollars each year by driving an EV versus a gas-powered car, it is unsurprising that so many car owners continue to make the switch. Additionally, many EV owners have pushed those savings even further by charging their vehicles at home, which is cheaper and more convenient than using public charging stations.

While installing a home charging station might seem daunting, Qmerit simplifies that process with free estimates and other helpful information.

To save even more money on charging costs, many homeowners pair their home charging stations with solar panels. If you're interested in learning more about home solar, The Cool Down's Solar Explorer offers free, easy-to-use online tools that allow you to compare quotes from trusted partners, saving you up to $10,000 in the process.

One such longtime TCD solar partner, EnergySage, takes the complication out of home solar with its ability to view multiple bids from vetted local installers.

Combining home solar panels with a Level 2 charger from Qmerit can allow you to make the most of EVs' cost-saving benefits.

POWERGEN 2026 continues through Jan. 22 at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center, building on Monday’s technical foundation with a week of executive dialogue, technical sessions and networking for the power generation community.","With the U.S. energy sector in the middle of unprecedented load growth driven by data centers and industrialization, it would likely be unwise to turn your nose up at any specific generation source. But with everything changing so fast, and with remaining uncertainty about how much actual load growth we will experience, how can utilities know they’re adequately preparing without taking on unnecessary costs?

Those were the sentiments at POWERGEN 2026’s Opening Keynote, which brought together leaders from utilities, engineering firms, technology providers and the research community to examine how the industry is responding to rapid change.

‘We’ve got to have it all’

The opening keynote began with a session between Rudy Garza, President & CEO – CPS Energy; and Victor Suchodolski, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer – Sargent & Lundy; moderated by Ahsan Yousufzai, Global Director Energy – NVIDIA. The trio discussed the unforeseen changes in the power industry that AI has stirred up; how to plan for uncertain projected load growth; how nuclear’s role will evolve in Texas; and pesky bottlenecks that can bring entire projects to a halt.

“The industry’s changing at a pace quicker than I think any any of us ever thought,” Garza said. “The pressure is exponentially changing on us in a way that is requiring us to really stretch every part of our business.”

There’s still plenty of uncertainty in the air surrounding the projected load growth the U.S. could experience. It’s currently unclear if all of the gigawatts of projected load growth will actually come to fruition, but utilities need to be prepared anyway, Garza argued. Otherwise, they may be blindsided by the lack of generation, transmission, and all of the components of these systems that can have large lead times.

“You’re going to have to teach an old dog new tricks, and the old dog is the utility industry,” Garza said. “We’re not used to changing the way we think about things. And if we don’t, the industry is going to go around us, and that’s not good for anybody.”

With so much on the line, the power industry doesn’t have much room to be picky. Nearly every existing form of generation will have a seat at the table – something Texas is already plenty familiar with: the state currently leads the nation in renewable and battery deployments.

“We’ve got to have it all,” Garza said. “And, you know, we don’t spend a lot of time here in San Antonio arguing over which resource is the right resource or the wrong resource.”

At Sargent & Lundy, Suchodolski is seeing firsthand how the markets are responding positively to more certainty – even gas and nuclear are both showing growth, when they have historically always run opposite to each other.

“With respect to bulk gas generation, regulatory and permitting are less of a driver now, and that’s primarily due to the longer lead time, so you can run in parallel with the permits,” Suchodolski said. “You also have partnerships with OEMs, and you can see there that there’s synergies with knowing what your air missions are going to look like, or what kind of designs you’re going to get. And you can design these projects a little bit more on the front end, you can buy equipment more on the front end.”

However, as some bottlenecks ease up, others become more prominent. Now, delays are being caused by power delivery center components, circuit breakers, and even emergency diesel generators, Suchodolski noted.

“This is really a power generation conference, but the grid is out there too,” Suchodolski said. “We are seeing transmission still having some issues with respect to the permitting process and getting things done as quickly as we want them. So it still takes time. There have been some strides here, but the transmission line projects are not going as quickly as we would hope that hope they would.”

Future nuclear deployments are going to look much different than what the U.S. saw in the 20th century. Garza argued that without state or federal incentives, new, large baseload nuclear generators like we built in the 70s will remain a relic of the past: there’s currently just too much risk and cost involved for that to be feasible. But next-gen nuclear reactors like SMRs, which have a much smaller footprint, could have a very promising future, especially for large loads like data centers, which are now required in Texas to have the ability to go off-grid on their own power sources if the grid gets squeezed.

At least one thing is clear though: the U.S. is going to have to build a lot of new generation, especially as older generating units are retiring. Many of those old units are on their last limbs already, being kept running now only out of necessity.

“ERCOT put one of our older units that we were trying to retire into what they call a reliability must run status, and it’s cost us millions of dollars trying to give that unit another three years of life,” Garza said. “So is that the most efficient, you know, use of our of our limited capital, or do we just need to build new stuff?”

How can AI help speed up new nuclear deployments?

In the next panel of Tuesday morning’s opening keynote, Raiford Smith, Global Market Lead for Power and Energy – Google Cloud; and Lou Martinez Sancho, CTO – Westinghouse Electric Company discussed a collaboration between Google and Westinghouse to create a custom AI-powered platform meant to assist and speed up reactor construction.

Westinghouse plans to have 10 of its AP1000 reactors under construction by 2030, and this platform is a key part of getting that plan into motion. The nuclear industry is notoriously heavily regulated, which can cause projects to take longer than some would like.

“We started this journey and needed to downsize basically the time to deliver new nuclear into market,” Sancho said. “But we needed also to utilize it to improve the way we are operating the current plants, [so] we can understand better how to do super power upgrades to deliver more.”

AI’s ability to learn and retain information has made it attractive to users like Westinghouse. The days of simple “if, then” statements may soon be behind us, Smith argued.

“Better yet, this is a solution that we collectively worked on for a work management problem for nuclear, but work management problems can be addressed using the same capabilities, as long as you have the foundational data and the frameworks – they can also be addressed the same way,” Smith said. “So the technology isn’t a one-off. The technology is not so bespoke that it cannot be applicable elsewhere.”

Details matter

In the final portion of Tuesday’s opening keynote, Mike Caravaggio, Vice President, Energy Supply, Fleet Reliability – EPRI painted a picture of the current moment the industry has unexpectedly found itself in, and what the coming years could look like.

Caravaggio echoed previous panelist arguments that each and every form of generation will have its own role to play, even though all gigawatts aren’t created equal.

“A gigawatt is not a gigawatt, is not a gigawatt,” Caravaggio said. “Our different technologies will fill this load growth void in different ways. A solar plant can’t do what a nuclear plant can’t can do. A gas turbine can move a lot faster than a combined cycle. We need to balance these technologies to meet the needs of these data centers.”

But that variance applies to the load side as well. Depending on their purpose, data centers can have vastly different load profiles from each other.

“These details are really going to matter,” Caravaggio said.

Seal the cracks Air seal your home.
Sealing these is a cost-effective way to retain heat and save money.
Air sealing costs about $500 but will save you about that amount in a year, Willman said.
“That has long-term impact and also has the added benefit of decreasing your energy bills.” IndyStar's environmental reporting is made possible through the generous support of the nonprofit Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust.","Residential electricity costs are rising faster than they have in years, but there are a few ways Hoosiers can take matters into their own hands to squeeze out some savings on their bills.

The historically high cost of electricity made headlines last summer when the Citizens Action Coalition analyzed statewide data and found residential bills saw the largest year-over-year increase since 2005.

This session some state lawmakers will consider a number of bills that make energy affordability a priority. But bills take time, the language in them can change and there is no guarantee any of the bills will become law.

Here are some tips that can help Hoosiers find relief now.

Get an energy audit

Get an energy audit of your home, says Christin Willman, the weatherization training director at the Indiana Community Action Association, which provides resources to help “low-income individuals attain self-sufficiency.”

An energy audit can identify how much energy the home uses, inefficiencies and where problems exist. Indiana utilities offer these audits to households of all incomes. People in lower income brackets may have access to free services.

Hoosiers willing to pay a bit for their services can go to Building Performance Institute to find a certified energy auditor to do the assessment.

“When it comes to saving energy, a certified energy auditor will tell you where to get biggest bang for buck,” Willman said.

Seal the cracks

Air seal your home. Sealing the cracks and openings in a home is like closing a pipe of hot air that funnels all that warmth outside. Every home has little cracks between where wires come out of drywall and other pathways where lights or junction boxes go. Sealing these is a cost-effective way to retain heat and save money.

Air sealing costs about $500 but will save you about that amount in a year, Willman said. Look for a contractor with a blower door. These devices are set up in the front door frame and find air leaks that come from everything from the space around wall outlets and light fixtures to leaky ducts and dryer vents.

One way to know your house is leaking air is to look at the roof after a snow or frost.

“If it snows an inch and the next day you still have snow over your whole roof, you’re probably OK,” Willman said. “But if you see big black patches of asphalt shingles, you know you’ve got a real big problem. You’re losing heat and paying utilities more than you should.”

A product called Mastic available at hardware stores can be used in a caulking gun to seal up ducts.

Also check furnace ducts for leaks. Follow the duct work and check for any air blowing out from the duct connections when the furnace is running.

Quick Tips to save money

There are also some simpler things Hoosiers can do to make their homes more energy efficient.Willman and her colleague Dan Phillips provided some quick tips for Hoosiers:

DO:

Replace indoor and outdoor lights with LEDs

Apply weather stripping around doors and windows

Install programmable thermostats

Clean the dryer’s lint trap after every use

Replace the furnace filter every month

DON'T:

Dress for warm weather inside when it’s cold outside

Keep blinds closed during winter days (sunlight provides free heat)

Seal a vent and shut the door to an unused room

Use furnace filters above MERV rating 8 unless directed by a medical professional

Prior to 2010, fewer than 600 zero-emission vehicles had been sold in the state, according to the California Energy Commission.
“California didn’t reach 2.5 million zero-emission vehicles by accident — we invested in this future when others said it was impossible,” Newsom said in a statement.
Nationwide, the share of electric vehicles sold among all new vehicles fell from 10.5% in the third quarter last year to 5.8% in the fourth quarter, according to Cox Automotive.
The Advanced Clean Cars II Rule requires 68% of new cars be zero-emission by 2030, and 100% by 2035.","More than 2.5 million electric vehicles have been sold in California since 2010, exceeding one of the state’s EV goals despite setbacks in clean energy brought on by the Trump administration.

This week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced that the Golden State surpassed a target to put 1.5 million zero-emission vehicles on the road by 2025.

Former Gov. Jerry Brown set the goal in 2012 with an executive order that also allocated $120 million for charging infrastructure. Prior to 2010, fewer than 600 zero-emission vehicles had been sold in the state, according to the California Energy Commission.

“California didn’t reach 2.5 million zero-emission vehicles by accident — we invested in this future when others said it was impossible,” Newsom said in a statement. “California is ensuring American workers and manufacturers can compete and win in the industries that will define this century.”

Shortly after taking office for the second time, President Trump signed an executive order that cut funding for charging infrastructure, eliminated a $7,500 EV tax incentive and abandoned an earlier goal that EVs make up half of new cars sold nationally by 2030.

Inflation and auto tariffs have also acted as boundaries to EV adoption as cash-strapped drivers aim to avoid the higher price of purchasing and insuring an EV.

Nearly 23% of new vehicles sold in California in 2025 were considered zero-emission vehicles, though EV sales were down in the state and across the U.S. compared to the year prior.

California counts plug-in hybrid vehicles as zero-emission even though PHEVs rely on a combination of gas and electricity.

EV sales jumped last year ahead of the expiration of the tax credit as consumers rushed to take advantage of the incentive. After the credit was eliminated on Sept. 30, sales declined sharply.

Nationwide, the share of electric vehicles sold among all new vehicles fell from 10.5% in the third quarter last year to 5.8% in the fourth quarter, according to Cox Automotive.

Despite the achievement touted in Davos, California failed to reach a separate goal approved by the California Air Resources Board in 2022 that 35% of new cars must be zero-emission by 2026. The Advanced Clean Cars II Rule requires 68% of new cars be zero-emission by 2030, and 100% by 2035.

In the fourth quarter of 2025, only 18% of new cars sold in the state were zero-emission.

California’s EV market has still proven resilient in the face of declining federal support.

The state leads the country in EV adoption and has a network of more than 200,000 public and shared charging stations, the governor’s office said.

In response to the loss of the federal EV tax credit, Newsom proposed a $200-million incentive program to accelerate EV adoption in his Jan. 9 budget. Private companies are creating their own incentives too, such as Costco, which offers members $1,000 off several electric Cadillac models.

In addition to consumer incentives, the California Energy Commission’s Clean Transportation Investment Plan includes a $98.5-million allocation for light-duty zero-emission vehicle infrastructure.

“While the federal government reversed and put up roadblocks, the global zero-emission vehicle market surged ahead last year,” said California Air Resources Board Chair Lauren Sanchez in a statement. “Governor Newsom’s new rebate proposal sends a clear message: California isn’t slowing down, we’re still leading the pack.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/165e9a4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1495x785+22+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3d%2Fc3%2Fd8afc603456c9d5e8b021d37ab91%2Fimg-0702-7.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 11:04:36.692119

Congress made $4.4 billion available to states under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, per official estimates. But so far, states have asked Uncle Sam to reimburse them for only $94 million, according to data from the Federal Highway Administration, which oversees the NEVI program.

Five states — Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Nevada and Wyoming — have spent no money.

The new data appeared in a legal filing last week in a lawsuit that Democratic states filed against the Trump administration for freezing their NEVI funds. It’s the latest sign that NEVI, an early part of the Biden administration’s push to accelerate EV adoption, is struggling to stand up charging stations on highways and build confidence in the EV future among road-trippers.

“That’s unfortunately not a very positive story,” said Loren McDonald, an EV-charging analyst who has closely tracked NEVI’s spending.

However, state officials and experts expressed confidence that NEVI’s roughest days are in the rear view mirror, and that the path seems clear for new charging plazas to steadily come online this year and into 2027 and 2028. The Trump administration ended its seven-month funding freeze in August, and states have plans in place to ramp up construction.

First, the program has to dodge cuts from Congress as lawmakers write a new surface-transportation bill. A bipartisan package announced Tuesday more than $500,000 from NEVI funds meant for states and puts it toward other purposes at FHWA — despite Democrats’ earlier insistence that EV chargers get more funding, not less. The Sierra Club said in a statement that the change “would sabotage states’ efforts to resume NEVI buildout.”

Hard from the start

The NEVI program has suffered the twin challenges of bureaucracy and political controversy.

NEVI is a creature of the bipartisan infrastructure law that Congress approved in 2021. It routed EV charging funds through traditional highway spending channels — a move that caused state departments of transportation to move cautiously because they didn’t know how to build charging stations.

Then President Donald Trump, who mocked NEVI’s slow rollout during the 2024 presidential campaign, paused the program last year, causing many station builders to slow down or back out.

Meanwhile, a somewhat rosier picture of NEVI’s progress can be found in a different number.

States have obligated $1.4 billion of funds. Money is considered obligated when the federal government believes a state has a clear enough plan that it approves the money to be spent. (States receive that obligated money only after they’ve paid their vendors and submitted their receipts to the federal government.)

These increasingly certain plans are creating confidence that more NEVI-funded EV stations are coming soon.

“Assuming no new political hurdles arise, it wouldn’t be a stretch to see the current open site count double by the end of the year,” wrote Steve Birkett, an independent EV-charging-station analyst, in a post on LinkedIn.

Estimates vary on the number of NEVI stations that are now open to serve the public.

One EV-data shop, Atlas Public Policy, counts 121 open NEVI locations. Birkett’s tally reaches 150.

NEVI aims to build an EV station every 50 miles on highways. That would mean roughly 1,600 stations once the network is fully built.

Ohio, which alongside Pennsylvania leads in NEVI station openings, said that both spending and new charging plazas are coming. The state currently has 19 stations open and 12 more slated to start construction this spring. Still, the state has spent only $8.3 million of the $140 million it has available.

“Some developers haven’t yet invoiced for completed work, so we expect that number to increase in the coming months as invoices continue to be received and paid,” said Breanna Badanes, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Transportation, in an email. “We anticipate a big uptick in spending in 2026.”

Trump’s freeze and a long thaw

The biggest and most recent speed bump for NEVI, some state officials said, was Trump’s funding freeze.

The freeze that Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy began last February ended in August, when the administration relented against legal challenges and offered new, simplified guidance. Those seven months threw carefully laid plans into limbo, said Jared Wiley, director of the Arkansas Department of Transportation.

Before the pause, Arkansas had awarded contracts for 19 sites, at a total cost of $15 million. Now, after the pause, nine station builders have backed out and others three are considering their next move. Only seven are still committed.

Arkansas is looking for new applicants for those idled sites, a process that may take another year.

“All that time was lost and we are now playing catch-up,” Wiley said.

Meanwhile, other states celebrated the resolution to Trump’s freeze — new guidance.

Wyoming had originally refused to build EV stations every 50 miles, as the Biden administration required. The state argued that no services or even buildings existed at some far-flung outposts.

But Trump’s new guidance erased that 50-mile rule, and Wyoming is doing what it has wanted to do all along: using the federal money to build charging stations on routes between Wyoming’s national parks and EV-loving California.

“Our goal is to use NEVI to help EV-driving tourists get from the interstate highways to popular destinations like Yellowstone National Park,” said Jordan Young, a spokeswoman for Wyoming’s Department of Transportation.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/d1/b4/a3392bd2436b8e6e7e5367a4b0e9/climate-electric-vehicles-64390.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 09:59:25.855432

Energy storage company NeoVolta announced its collaboration with BESS manufacturer PotisEdge and its majority owner, renewable energy giant LONGi to form NeoVolta Power, LLC.

The move represents NeoVolta’s first foray into domestic manufacturing and its expansion into utility-scale and commercial energy storage markets.

“I don’t see our move as a pivot, but rather a response to market needs and policy requirements,” said NeoVolta CEO Ardes Johnson. He told pv magazine USA that the policy changes of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) have created a “window of opportunity” to partner with manufacturing market leaders. “This move wasn’t about leaving residential behind.”

The facility, which will be based in Pendergrass, Georgia, and will support approximately 89 production personnel, is expected to begin mass production later this year with an initial production capacity of 2 GWh annually that’s scalable up to 8 GWh. Situated along the I-85 corridor, production will initially focus on prismatic-cell battery pack assembly and DC container integration for utility-scale applications.

“The Georgia facility is the beginning,” Johnson said, though NeoVolta’s goal is to keep growing once they have “demand, contracted backlog and the financing and policy environment [to] make the economics work.”

He expects part of that demand to arrive on NeoVolta’s doorstep due to the updated foreign entity of concern (FEOC) guidelines under the OBBBA, particularly as the company has structured their facility, partnerships and procurement structures around domestic content compliance. Initial funding for the joint venture comes in part from a $13 million private placement given to NeoVolta by Infinite Grid Capital. However, project-level debt financing and incentive monetization will provide long-term funding and enable manufacturing expansion.

“We want to avoid the classic over-capitalization for expanded manufacturing, only to have that equity sit in the form of inventory,” Johnson explained, noting that the company is being “very disciplined” in its approach.

60% of the joint venture will be held by NeoVolta, whose role will focus on product strategy, commercialization and customer engagement. PotisEdge, which owns 20% of NeoVolta Power, LLC., will bring its large-scale BESS manufacturing and production expertise. The final 20% will be split among a group of strategic investors that will provide technical and operational advising.

“Scaling at this level is really about certification, safety testing, software integration, quality control and financing confidence,” Johnson pointed out. “That’s why our partnership with PotisEdge and LONGi is so important.”

Global Supplier Targets 800K Units Annually at Chennai-Area Plant

The India market just became significantly more important for global brake system suppliers. ZF Group has commissioned an electric park brake production line at its Oragadam manufacturing complex near Chennai, signaling aggressive expansion into what company leadership is calling “the new China” for automotive growth.

The German supplier’s new facility will produce up to 800,000 EPB units annually at peak capacity, with systems already shipping to domestic automakers for integration into recently launched battery electric vehicles. For brake industry suppliers and aftermarket distributors watching Asian market developments, this move underscores India’s emergence as both a consumption market and a strategic global supply hub for advanced braking technology.

Localization Strategy Reshapes Supply Chain

The Oragadam line represents more than capacity expansion—it’s a deliberate restructuring of ZF’s supply chain architecture in the region. Currently, approximately 40 percent of EPB components are sourced from Indian suppliers. ZF India President Akash Passey indicated plans to push local content to 80-90 percent within two years.

That localization trajectory creates substantial opportunities for friction material suppliers, caliper component manufacturers, and actuator specialists operating in India. Tier-two and tier-three suppliers capable of meeting ZF’s quality specifications could find themselves integrated into a supply chain serving both domestic OEMs and global export programs.

The investment falls within ZF’s previously announced $200-250 million India commitment, though specific EPB line capital expenditure was not disclosed. What’s the potential ripple effect for regional brake component suppliers as localization targets climb?

India as Global Brake Technology Hub

ZF Board Member Peter Holdmann drew direct comparisons between India’s current growth trajectory and China’s automotive expansion, citing infrastructure development as a key catalyst. The company’s dual technical centers in Hyderabad and Chennai now support engineering work for both passenger and commercial vehicle applications across multiple markets.

This “engineering for the world” approach positions India beyond simple low-cost manufacturing. Advanced development work—including potential ADAS integration with braking systems—is increasingly occurring domestically. Board Member Andreas Moser confirmed ZF is evaluating advanced driver assistance system deployment in the Indian market, which would create new integration requirements with foundation and park brake systems.

The Oragadam facility represents ZF’s tenth manufacturing location in Tamil Nadu alone, making the state a concentrated center for the supplier’s India operations. Globally, ZF has produced over 250 million EPB calipers, giving the company substantial scale advantages as electric park brake adoption accelerates across vehicle segments.

Regulatory Tailwinds Support Growth

Indian regulatory frameworks increasingly mandate advanced safety systems, creating sustained demand for technologies like EPB. OEMs serving the market are investing heavily in safety and quality systems regardless of powertrain type—both EV and ICE platforms are driving brake technology upgrades.

For aftermarket stakeholders, the growing EPB installed base in India will eventually create service and replacement demand, though the relatively young vehicle parc means meaningful aftermarket volumes remain years away.

The Bottom Line

ZF’s Oragadam EPB line positions India as a critical node in global brake system supply chains, with aggressive localization targets creating opportunities for regional component suppliers. As EPB adoption grows across Indian-market vehicles, brake industry professionals should monitor both OE supply dynamics and the long-term aftermarket implications of this expanding installed base.",https://thebrakereport.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ZF-in-India_Teaser_3_2_748px.webp,N,,2026-01-21 08:58:34.852483

And that growth means Michigan likely faces a challenge meeting its clean energy goals without further state action.

Those conclusions come from a new report from the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Data Center Power Play in Michigan” models possible growth scenarios for data centers in the state, as well as possible ways to meet their growing demands for energy.

Data centers are the technological backbone of artificial intelligence. Michigan has seen an explosion in the proposed number of data centers in recent months, after the state implemented tax credits meant to lure them here.

Those facilities are notoriously power hungry. The report’s mid-range model suggests they will make up 40% of the state’s energy demand growth by 2030, and that “over the next 25 years, such data center growth could put Michiganders at financial risk of $18 billion in additional electricity systems costs.""

Report author and Union of Concerned Scientists senior energy analyst Lee Shaver said that under any scenario, energy costs will go up. The real question, Shaver said, is who will pay for that.

“The really important thing is that just because costs increase does not mean that those costs have to be passed on to residents,” said Shaver.

But to prevent that from happening, Shaver said state lawmakers and the Michigan Public Service Commission must take steps to protect residential ratepayers, and to make sure the companies behind data centers foot the bill for their energy needs.

On the environmental side, Shaver noted that Michigan has set targets of reaching 80% power from renewable sources by 2035, and 100% by 2040. But with the growth of data centers, “What we see is that the amount of growth from data centers is so significant that even with those policies, carbon emissions in Michigan will still increase.”

Shaver said that if Michigan hopes to reach those targets, “there needs to be additional policy in the power sector to in order to make that happen.” The report recommends a carbon reduction strategy, which would involve putting stricter limits on carbon emissions. It also suggests that bringing back renewable energy tax credits put in place by the Biden Administration, but rescinded by President Donald Trump’s, would encourage the energy and industrial sectors to adopt renewables on a larger scale more quickly.

But the report stresses that the time for policymakers to act is now. The Michigan Public Service Commission recently approved contracts with DTE Energy to power the state’s first massive “hyperscale” data center in Washtenaw County’s Saline Township, which included some level of protections for residential ratepayers. But Shaver said much about the terms of those contracts either still remain obscure, or will be determined by future utility filings, and “we don’t think they’re going far enough” to ensure that data centers bear the burden of their energy requirements.

And with new proposed data centers entering the pipeline almost constantly, Shaver stressed that citizen input is also vital. “None of these hyperscale data centers have been built in Michigan yet,” he said. “So now is really an important time to make your voice heard. Because if we wait until they've been built, it's going to be too late to do anything about it.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d9373b8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3984x2092+0+282/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8f%2Fa0%2F0e566eea46138a4f6074319486bb%2Fimg-0133.JPG,N,,2026-01-21 08:58:30.304748

Electricity demand is increasing, and so are electricity costs for households and businesses across the United States. After more than two decades of relatively flat electricity demand growth, the near-term surge in new demand from “hyperscale” AI data centers is poised to send electricity prices through the roof without strong ratepayer protections and other policy interventions.

Addressing these new threats from data centers—alongside existing price drivers such as increasing fossil gas prices and the high upfront cost of necessary infrastructure upgrades in the face of climate-fueled extreme weather—will require concerted efforts to address both electricity demand and supply. Unfortunately, actions taken during the first year of the Trump administration are moving us in the wrong direction and could result in much greater increases in electricity costs, while also risking more outages, more pollution, and more climate-damaging emissions. A new analysis from the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), Data Center Power Play, makes clear just how much is at stake, finding that:

Data center demand is highly uncertain, but will be the greatest near-term driver of load growth

Current policies risk putting the United States on a path to meet much of this demand with fossil fuels

Stronger policies can shift our path to running primarily on renewables without sacrificing reliability, while also bringing important health and climate benefits

The looming data center-driven demand surge comes with significant costs across all scenarios, and policymakers must take steps to ensure that these costs are not passed on to consumers

Overall, our modeling demonstrates that clean and renewable energy can meet the challenge of load growth from data centers, but policymakers must be proactive to protect our health, environment, and financial interests.

Trump admin sidelines clean energy amid rising electricity demand

Even as the Trump administration boasts of leading the global AI race, it is sidelining the clean, plentiful, affordable, and efficient energy technologies that are best poised to power such a future.

Even with investments in energy efficiency—which the Trump administration is aggressively undermining—we will still need to significantly increase electricity generation to meet surging demand growth from data centers and electrification. This will require building as much new, low-cost capacity as quickly as possible, and making it as clean as possible to avoid negative climate, health, and environmental impacts. Here, renewable energy technologies, especially solar and wind combined with energy storage, check all the boxes. They have a distinct advantage over fossil fuels and low carbon technologies such as new nuclear and carbon capture and storage (CCS), which have long lead times, high costs, and are largely unproven technologies.

Combining wind and solar with battery storage, while requiring greater data center flexibility, offers a promising solution for powering data centers and meeting overall electricity demand. Over the past few years, the vast majority of new capacity additions in the United States, and globally, have been wind, solar, and battery storage. These technologies also dominate new capacity waiting to be developed in transmission interconnection queues.

Further, the costs for wind and solar have fallen 70 to 90% over the last 15 years, making them cheaper in many cases than new gas and existing coal plants, even without subsidies and before factoring in environmental and health benefits. The lead time to plan and build wind and solar projects is also much shorter than it is for new gas or nuclear plants. In addition, recent studies have identified demand-side flexibility at data centers as an important strategy for reducing peak demand and lowering costs.

In striking contrast to this forward momentum is the Trump administration’s stated preference for using dirty, outdated fossil fuel generation to power emerging technology. At the same time, it has created significant headwinds for wind, solar, and storage, including rolling back federal tax credits, illegally rescinding clean energy grants and financing approved by Congress and under contract, illegally halting offshore wind and other renewable energy projects that are either under construction or fully permitted after lengthy reviews, blocking new wind and solar permitting from moving forward, and more.

The stakes are high. The path that states and the nation choose on how to power data centers has wide-ranging implications for energy affordability, reliability, public health, the climate, and the economy as a whole.

Powering data centers with clean energy vs. fossil fuels

To better understand the potential impacts of meeting US electricity demand growth from AI data centers, UCS’s new analysis highlights the consequences of data centers’ growing electricity demand on the US power grid and how decisionmakers can mitigate harmful economic, climate, and health impacts through clean energy deployment and strong ratepayer protections.

Using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (which the Trump Administration recently renamed the National Laboratory of the Rockies) open-source Regional Energy Deployment System’s (ReEDS) power sector model, we analyzed the impacts of meeting electricity demand growth from AI data centers on electricity generation, electricity costs, and the health and climate costs of emissions from using fossil fuels—as well as the avoided health and climate costs of emissions from using clean energy instead. Since future data center demand growth and the policy landscape are highly uncertain, we modeled multiple demand growth and energy policy scenarios.

Data center demand is surging—and highly uncertain

We project overall US electricity demand to increase 62% between 2025 and 2050 under a “mid-level” data center demand growth scenario, and as much as 79% under a “high” data center demand growth scenario (Figure 1). Data centers account for about half of total demand growth over the next five years, but this share falls over time as electrification increases in other sectors (especially transportation). While we vary the amount of data center demand growth, we assumed the same level of demand growth in other sectors under all scenarios. Studies by UCS and others show that higher levels of electrification of other sectors would likely be needed to achieve economy-wide net zero emissions by 2050.

The number of data centers anticipated to be built in the United States and how much

electricity they will need are both highly uncertain. Recent actions by electric

utilities and regional transmission organizations indicate that many proposals to build data centers are redundant. In addition, utilities, which earn a guaranteed return on investment, have an incentive to overestimate future demand. This could lead to overbuilding the electricity system, higher costs, and stranded assets. A lack of transparency compounds the uncertainties, as proposals to build data centers and the power plants to serve them, are typically confidential.

Current policies increase reliance on fossil fuels

Under current state and federal climate and energy policies, our analysis finds that the United States is likely to increase its reliance on fossil fuels as electricity demand grows due to data centers and electrification of other sectors. We found that gas generation could increase 23% between 2026 and 2035 and 77% by 2050, with 90 gigawatts (GW) of new gas capacity added by 2035 and a whopping 335 GW by 2050. (One gigawatt is enough to power about 750,000 average US homes per year and could be supplied by 294 utility-scale land based wind turbines, according to DOE)

While our analysis projects coal generation to continue to decline in response to planned retirements, remaining coal plants are dispatched more to help meet the growth in demand. While the model includes the Trump administration’s rollbacks of EPA power plant carbon standards, we didn’t account for other regulatory rollbacks and subsidies that could further boost coal generation. For example, we didn’t model recent Trump Administration actions to use emergency powers to prevent at least six uneconomic coal plants from retiring, which are expected to increase electricity costs for consumers.

Even with these caveats, we found that the additional fossil fuels burned to power data centers could increase power plant carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 19% and result in $1.6 trillion in climate and health damages over the next decade, growing to $4.5 trillion by 2050, under our mid-level data center demand growth scenario. We expect that recent actions not included in the model would only increase these costs compared to our results.

Stronger policies ensure that clean energy powers data centers

Restoring federal clean energy tax credits accelerates the deployment of wind and solar to power data centers. It also reduces reliance on gas and coal generation to meet the growth in electricity demand.

Adopting policies to reduce US power sector emissions of CO2 would go even further, facilitating the clean energy transition to help meet economywide emission reduction targets. With a target of a 95% reduction in CO2 below 2026 levels by 2050, wind and solar generation nearly triple between 2026 and 2035 and increase five-fold by 2050 to replace coal and gas. Combined, all renewable energy sources provide more than 60% of total US electricity generation by 2035 and 81% by 2050.

Data centers put ratepayers at risk of higher electricity costs

Rapid data center growth results in more than $500 billion in cumulative electricity costs nationally by 2035 and nearly $1 trillion by 2050 across our three policy scenarios and assuming mid-level demand growth. This represents 18-24 percent of total US wholesale electricity costs over the same period (see Figure 5). Without strong ratepayer protections requiring Big Tech companies to pay their fair share, these costs could get passed onto households and other businesses.

Restoring federal clean energy tax credits to the timelines and phaseouts that were included in the Inflation Reduction Act results in cumulative savings of $248 billion (4 percent) through 2050 compared with the “Current Policies” scenario. This underscores that recent actions by Congress and President Trump to rollback tax credits for solar and wind as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) will make electricity less affordable, which is consistent with other recent studies.

Restoring the tax credits and adopting more ambitious climate and clean energy policies that nearly decarbonize the power sector by 2050 (the Low-Carbon Policy scenario) results in higher costs of $291 billion (12 percent) from 2026 to 2035 and $412 billion (7 percent) through 2050 compared with Current Policies. But these costs of transitioning to clean, low carbon energy sources are far outweighed by the avoided climate and health damages from burning fossil fuels, reaching more than $1.6 trillion between 2026 and 2035 and $13.3 trillion by 2050. Additional interventions, such as using clean electricity to replace fossil fuel use in other sectors, investing in energy efficiency, and increasing data center flexibility, could significantly lower overall energy bills.

We can avoid the health and environmental harms associated with unmitigated growth of data centers

Ensuring that data centers are efficient, flexible, and powered with clean energy requires stronger state and federal policies. Policymakers and regulators should require utilities and data center developers to be more transparent and accountable, improve long-term planning for meeting data center demand, and protect other customers from cost increases and negative health impacts.

They should also require utilities and data center developers to meet demand growth with new low carbon or zero carbon generation and prioritize energy storage instead over diesel or gas generation for back-up power. Policies supporting the development of data centers should include standards and guardrails that protect public health while reducing emissions, energy and water use, and other environmental impacts.

Only bold action will ensure that the nation meets electricity demand growth with clean energy, achieves its climate goals, and protects consumers from added costs brought on by the growth of data centers. Unmitigated data center growth should not continue in the absence of stronger policies and guardrails, given that the consequences for energy affordability, reliability, public health and the climate are so high. The path for the United States to achieve these benefits is clear.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Blog-Thumbnail-Solar-and-Battery-Storage.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 07:58:36.284888

Those who navigate policy complexity and secure compliant supply chains early, and strike a balance between resilience and cost, will be at an advantage.

Decisions taken in 2026, particularly around manufacturing sourcing and critical mineral processing, will determine the scale, cost and feasibility of clean technology deployment through the 2030s.

That in mind, we’ve drawn on unique insight from Wood Mackenzie Lens Power & Renewables and Supply Chain Analytics to compile our pick of the key themes to watch in the year ahead – and the policy signposts to look out for.

Fill in the form to access Global cleantech supply chain: key themes in 2026, or read on for a brief introduction to some of the topics explored.

Policy-driven supply chain localisation will be a defining theme of 2026

The push for supply chain resilience continues. While China consolidates manufacturing to institute growth discipline, Southeast Asia’s role will wane due to trade barriers. Capacity localisation will intensify with India and the Middle East emerging as new hubs for solar manufacturing.

Europe continues to pursue domestically produced Made in EU PV modules, albeit at a limited scale. In contrast, the US is aggressively reshaping its procurement regulations for foreign suppliers and tariff regimes across technologies, which could lead to a supply gap in 2026 between existing projects entering construction and domestic demand, especially for battery storage.

Is supply adequacy achievable by 2030? For more on this, read the full report.

Technology pivots toward efficiency, integration and standardisation

Expect to see solar players focus on incremental efficiency and integrated systems with improved utilisation and cost stability. By late 2026, competitive advantage in PV will hinge on delivering fully integrated module–inverter–tracker ecosystems with advanced digital monitoring and grid-support capabilities.

Energy storage is set to see early commercialisation of sodium-ion batteries, riven by concerns over lithium-ion supply chain resilience. In parallel, leading suppliers of lithium-ion batteries are advancing towards higher energy density, improved safety and smaller land footprint, with new battery cell capacities.

Meanwhile, wind original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) will shift away from size escalation towards performance and manufacturing discipline.

Even 5 GW of additional demand could combine with increases in electric transportation and building electrification to double the state’s energy consumption by 2050, the nonprofit said.

In addition to the energy export loophole identified in the UCS report, Michigan’s climate law contains an “off ramp” provision that allows utilities to keep fossil fuel generation online if there’s not enough capacity to meet demand.

Consumers Energy didn’t respond to a question about emissions from electricity exports.

The company will address state climate goals in its upcoming Integrated Resource Plan, which the company will file later this year, said spokesperson Matt Johnson.

DTE Energy did not answer questions about the potential impact of data centers on the utility’s emissions.

Data center-driven pollution could add to growing health risk: Nonprofit

Controlling carbon dioxide pollution would help rein in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide pollution, which natural gas generation emits in direct proportion to CO2, said Lee Shaver, senior energy analyst for the UCS.

Nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide are precursors to fine particulate matter, or PM 2.5, a pollutant linked to cardiopulmonary problems and premature death. Nitrogen oxides also contribute to ozone formation, which can cause respiratory problems and increase the frequency of asthma attacks.

Shaver praised Michigan’s renewable energy and clean energy standards, but said the buildout of data centers could threaten the state’s clean energy progress.

“But what we see is that, due to the load growth from data centers, even with those policies, carbon emissions and health damages from air pollution are going to continue to increase,” he said.

This pollution would come as climate change and climate-driven wildfires contribute to a deterioration in U.S. air quality.

In 2025, The American Lung Association gave the Detroit area an “F” rating for air quality in its annual State of the Air Report.

Science group: Michigan Legislature should close loophole

The Union of Concerned Scientists’ proposed CO2 reduction policy would create a hard limit on how much gas Michigan utilities can burn, Shaver said. The report calls on the Michigan legislature to enact this policy.

By closing the loophole that allows Michigan utilities to burn fossil fuels for energy exports, the policy would achieve net zero emissions by 2050, the UCS said.

UCS projects that fossil fuel emissions by Michigan utilities will otherwise rise by 26% between 2023 and 2050.

UCS proposes a phased policy, with an 80% emission reductions for out-of-state sales by 2040 and a 100% reduction by 2045.

Michigan exports minimal energy to other states, the USC report said. Demand from data centers in Illinois combined with increased transmission capacity will contribute to higher exports of electricity from Michigan in the future, Shaver said.

Adopting a CO2 reduction strategy in Michigan would also help limit the damage from climate change in the state, including rising temperatures and more intense storms, the report said. Deaths related to increased heat are already on the rise, Shaver said.

“If carbon emissions continue, that trend is going to continue.”",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/iStock-90386346.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 09:59:13.217628

Establishing a robust, domestic battery manufacturing ecosystem will create thousands of high-skilled, well-paid jobs, support regional growth and secure the long-term future of the UK’s automotive sector.
Gigafactories – large-scale battery manufacturing plants – should be recognised not merely as individual industrial projects, but as elements of strategic national infrastructure.
A named Cabinet minister should be given personal accountability for delivering a package of investments in EV, battery and active material manufacturing.
The UK Battery Strategy, the Modern Industrial Strategy, DRIVE35, the Battery Innovation Programme and recent gigafactory investments in Sunderland and Bridgwater all represent important steps forward.","Governments across the world are racing to secure leadership in EV and battery manufacturing. Europe, the United States and Asia are deploying substantial incentives and aggressive investment strategies, cutting planning times and lowering energy costs. The UK is in this race – but unless firm and coordinated action is taken, it risks falling behind.

Set against these challenges, however, lies a significant opportunity. Establishing a robust, domestic battery manufacturing ecosystem will create thousands of high-skilled, well-paid jobs, support regional growth and secure the long-term future of the UK’s automotive sector. It offers a route to link industrial competitiveness with net zero ambitions, demonstrating that economic resilience and environmental sustainability can – and must – go hand in hand.

Gigafactories – large-scale battery manufacturing plants – should be recognised not merely as individual industrial projects, but as elements of strategic national infrastructure. Countries that succeed in co-locating EV manufacturing with gigafactories will determine where future automotive platforms are allocated, where new EV models are built, and which nations retain volume automotive production. In short, decisions taken over the next few years will determine whether the UK remains a serious player in global automotive manufacturing or sees production and investment move offshore.

Against this backdrop, the UK cannot afford a passive “open for business” stance. It needs a more interventionalist mindset: one that combines financial incentives, site readiness and proactive ministerial engagement to prioritise attracting a major global OEM as demand anchor and secure investment in gigafactories and their supply chains. The question is no longer whether government should act, but how quickly and how decisively.

That is why the policy commission on gigafactories – bringing together senior cross-party figures and experts from industry, policy, academia and public service – has set out a clear, practical roadmap in its report, The UK Gigafactory Commission: Britain’s Battery Future. Its recommendations rest on three pillars: proactive government leadership, strengthened domestic capabilities and capacities and targeted policy and regulatory reform. These are not abstract policy ambitions. They are the conditions that global automotive and battery investors now expect as standard.

Government leadership must be central. Attracting gigafactory investment and securing long-term commitments from automotive manufacturers as a demand anchor requires decisive, top-level engagement. A named Cabinet minister should be given personal accountability for delivering a package of investments in EV, battery and active material manufacturing. That minister, supported by a small but empowered secretariat, should have the authority to convene departments, remove barriers – on grid, planning and skills – and lead senior-level negotiations with prospective investors.

Capabilities and capacity on the ground are equally critical. Investor-ready sites with pre-secured grid, water and transport infrastructure, coupled with predictable, competitive energy costs, are now a basic requirement if the UK is to compete with rival locations. In parallel, the UK must close persistent supply chain gaps by attracting investment in cathode and anode active materials and recycling, alongside development and scale up of next-generation chemistries.

Skills must be treated as strategic infrastructure as well. Gigafactories and active materials plans will require a steady pipeline of technicians and engineers. A coordinated national approach to skills – including apprenticeships specific to battery manufacturing, reskilling programmes drawing from adjacent industries and curriculum reform in colleges and universities – will be needed to build the skilled workforce required to be in place at the right scale and time.

Policy and regulatory interventions must underpin this strategy. The Zero Emission Vehicle mandate should be reviewed to align with market realities. Relief for energy-intensive industries relief must be broadened across the EV and battery supply chain on a predictable, long-term footing. A deferral or phased transition for post-2027 rules of origin deadlines should be pursued with EU partners to protect UK exporters from tariffs while domestic battery and materials capacity is built up.

There has been significant progress. The UK Battery Strategy, the Modern Industrial Strategy, DRIVE35, the Battery Innovation Programme and recent gigafactory investments in Sunderland and Bridgwater all represent important steps forward. The UK retains strong research and engineering capabilities and an established automotive base. But the Commission’s conclusion is clear: on their own, these initiatives are not yet sufficient to make the UK genuinely competitive. Without more proactive and coordinated intervention, the UK risks losing momentum at a critical time – with global firms committing capital elsewhere.

The Commission has therefore set out 10 priority recommendations that together provide a coherent roadmap. This represents a significant but achievable agenda. The next 12–18 months will be decisive. What is required is the political will, industry focus and collective resolve to turn ambition into delivery.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/89ea5bfdd8971598726906c5c381681a:8e09850a7cb8c223d24e8f4c10d9832a/matt-aug-2.jpg.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 04:59:26.401631

“CUB is disappointed to see ComEd come in with another bloated, expensive grid plan,” Moskowitz said.
In addition to increased delivery charges, ComEd customers have seen electricity supply charges skyrocket over the past year, in large part due to increased demand from the proliferation of data centers.
PJM Interconnection manages the electricity supply grid for 13 states, including ComEd’s 4.1 million customers in northern Illinois.","Also driving demand is the adoption of electric vehicles and building out the state’s charging infrastructure. In Illinois, Gov. JB Pritzker has set the goal of having 1 million electric vehicles on the road by 2030, but the state has a long way to go.

There are 164,000 EVs registered in the state as of January, according to data posted online by the secretary of state’s office. The vast majority are registered in ComEd’s service territory.

“There are over 10,000 charging ports just in ComEd service territory,” Quiniones said. “It’s still growing.”

Other system upgrades proposed for the new grid plan include refreshing the current meter fleet, developing flexible interconnections to incorporate more renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, and “hardening” substations to withstand the increasing frequency of severe weather events.

The ICC is expected to rule on the new grid plan by December, with ComEd then submitting a multiyear rate filing in 2027. If approved, the grid plan and subsequent rate impacts would be implemented beginning in 2028.

Sarah Moskowitz, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board, said in a statement Tuesday that the nonprofit consumer group plans to analyze the proposal to identify and push back on wasteful spending by the utility.

“CUB is disappointed to see ComEd come in with another bloated, expensive grid plan,” Moskowitz said. “Everyone supports a strong distribution system, but ComEd has a responsibility to maintain its grid in a way that benefits customers and doesn’t bankrupt them.”

Last month, the ICC sliced $25.4 million from ComEd’s $268.5 million annual rate reconciliation request. The approved $243 million rate adjustment will add an average of $3.10 per month to the average residential customers bill beginning in January, the utility said. ComEd customers are already dealing with higher delivery charges after the ICC approved a four-year, $606 million rate hike in December 2024 as part of the utility’s first power grid improvement plan, increasing average residential customer bills by $1.84 per month through 2027.

ComEd will file for a 2025 rate reconciliation in April, which if approved would raise delivery rates again in 2027.

In addition to increased delivery charges, ComEd customers have seen electricity supply charges skyrocket over the past year, in large part due to increased demand from the proliferation of data centers.

PJM Interconnection manages the electricity supply grid for 13 states, including ComEd’s 4.1 million customers in northern Illinois. In July, an annual capacity auction for expected reserve electricity needed during peak demand jumped 22% to a then-record $329.17 per Megawatt-day, meaning even higher supply prices for ComEd and its customers beginning in June 2026.

Those supply charges could go up even more down the road after PJM released the results of a new auction last month, setting the capacity price at a record $333.44 per Megawatt-day beginning in June 2027.

In December, ComEd announced it would be rebating $803 million as part of the state’s Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, which requires nuclear plants to issue customers a Carbon Mitigation Credit when energy prices are high.

The credits are a pass-through from Constellation, the former power generation subsidiary of Exelon that spun off as a stand-alone company in February 2022. The average ComEd customer can expect to receive about $13 per month in carbon credits on their electric bills over the first five months of 2026, the utility said.

But during the darkest, coldest days of the year, energy demand spikes while weather-dependent sources such as wind and solar often bottom out.
That’s the equivalent of the energy demand of the entire state of Oregon.
Smaller shortfalls are possible as soon as 2026, making the need for the UO’s generator units especially acute.","Oregon public power utility Eugene Water & Electric Board and the University of Oregon (UO) are launching a pilot project to better understand if running UO’s on-site natural gas generator in the coldest winter months can bolster grid reliability when demand for energy across the region is high.

EWEB predicts that running the generator during the winter will provide an essential source of reliable energy at times of high demand, while also reducing costs for both organizations and displacing less efficient and more carbon-intensive natural gas generators elsewhere in the region.

The pilot project will give EWEB and the UO the data needed to assess those predictions. The pilot project will also help the two organizations to develop workflows, processes and protocols for operating the generator, including assessing how quickly it can ramp up, the utility said.

The UO’s Central Power Station has a highly efficient combined heat and power plant. UO will use the steam to heat campus buildings and EWEB will purchase the electricity.

The generator can produce up to 10.6 megawatts of energy, or about 2% of EWEB customers’ energy demand during the highest hour of demand of the whole year. That’s roughly enough to power about 2,000 homes during a winter cold snap.

The UO’s gas generator is more efficient than many other gas plants in the region. Plus, it produces steam, which is used to heat buildings on campus.

“Because the UO generators can create both electricity and heat, it’s essentially a buy-one-get-one deal,” said EWEB Chief Energy Resources Officer Brian Booth. “That kind of efficiency is unique. If we can run the UO’s generators rather than purchase energy from a less efficient, more polluting power plant elsewhere, we view that as a smart climate move for our community.”

The current UO generator was installed in 2011. Since 2016, due to changing energy market conditions, UO has positioned it as a backup to EWEB power.

The pilot project grants EWEB the right to run the generator on and off in January and February, the coldest months of the year when energy demand is highest.

To determine when to turn the generator on and off, EWEB will assess regional power supply conditions.

Over the course of the year, hydropower supplies approximately half of the energy in the region, and 80% of EWEB’s energy. Nuclear, biomass, wind, natural gas, coal and smaller amounts of other resources also contribute.

But during the darkest, coldest days of the year, energy demand spikes while weather-dependent sources such as wind and solar often bottom out. On those days, grid operators turn to gas plants to fill the gap.

As a local power source that is not dependent on fickle weather conditions, the UO generators can also help keep the lights on when regional energy shortages threaten the grid, EWEB noted.

Initial results from a 2025 study conducted by the consulting firm Energy and Environmental Economics (E3) have found that the Greater Northwest -- a region that includes Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and parts of a couple other states -- could face a shortfall of 9 gigawatts of electricity during extreme conditions by 2030. That’s the equivalent of the energy demand of the entire state of Oregon.

The shortfalls could occur if an extended, days-long cold snap strikes during a dry year in which river flows are low, constraining the region’s hydropower resources. Smaller shortfalls are possible as soon as 2026, making the need for the UO’s generator units especially acute.

“The key to fighting the climate crisis is to electrify as many energy uses as possible, including home heating and transportation. But for customers to feel confident switching from fossil fuels to clean electricity, that electricity needs to be reliable and affordable,” Booth said. “By making the UO’s generators available to the grid, Eugene can help maintain regional reliability and affordability as the electric sector continues to decarbonize.”",https://www.publicpower.org/themes/custom/appa_foundation/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-21 07:58:40.801883

Without shareholders, the responsibility to question its decision-making falls on local power companies that operate without “any substantial leverage” from constituents.","Scholars assess the TVA as a blueprint for publicly owned utilities in the green energy transition.

As the effects of climate change become more severe, experts recognize the need to accelerate the transition to carbon-free energy. Some scholars argue that publicly owned utilities could “rapidly, affordably, and reliably” decarbonize energy production. But others point to the shortcomings of the United States’ largest publicly owned power company—the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)—and claim that utilities that follow the TVA’s public ownership model are “historical relics” destined to fail.

In a recent article, three energy policy experts argue that the TVA’s “decidedly mixed” record is the result of fixable institutional design choices rather than failures intrinsic to public ownership. Shelley Welton and Levi Phillips of the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School and Nikki Luke of the University of Tennessee contend that the TVA mixes organizational elements from federal agencies and corporate boardrooms, creating a “hodgepodge” that is “incoherent, ineffective, and deficient” at guiding climate-resilient development in the Tennessee Valley. But with targeted reforms, they suggest the TVA could become a blueprint for public utility ownership in the green energy transition.

Welton, Phillips, and Luke argue that “corporatization”—the inclusion of corporate governance mechanisms into the TVA—has eroded its accountability to the U.S. Congress, President, and local stakeholders, creating an institutional identity crisis given the agency’s public roots. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt envisioned the TVA as the gold standard “yardstick” by which private utilities would be measured, ensuring that electrification served the public.

Congress gave the TVA the authority and funding to drive development in the Southeast, with a mandate to control flooding, improve navigable waterways, and address poverty stemming from the Great Depression. From 1933 to 1953, the TVA fulfilled this mission by building dams and electrifying the region.

Welton, Phillips, and Luke contend that the TVA’s accountability to public officials decreased when legislation in 1959 and 1998 made it financially independent from Congress. The TVA no longer received federal funds and was prohibited from selling energy outside the Tennessee Valley. Yet, it was required to fulfill its non-energy obligations—such as flood control—using only revenue.

In 2005, Congress converted the TVA’s full-time three-member board into a part-time nine-member board and required that it appoint a CEO to oversee operations. Welton, Phillips, and Luke claim that the TVA’s lack of federal funding, combined with its corporate governance structure, made it akin to a private utility and created an impossible obligation in the process.

Welton, Phillips, and Luke argue that despite a complex mandate to fund public works through private energy sales, the TVA has “performed reasonably well” in comparison with private utilities by slashing debt, maintaining competitive rates, and generating 53 percent of its power from carbon-free sources. But they also note that the TVA is “not just another utility”—it was created to serve the Tennessee Valley while remaining democratically accountable to residents. Democratic accountability through congressional funding and presidential board appointments was limited by Congress’s amendments, and in recent years, opportunities for local engagement with the TVA have also declined.

Most public utility planning involves extensive stakeholder input. But Welton, Phillips, and Luke describe how the TVA excludes discussion of ratepayer issues, such as reliability and affordability, by accepting public feedback only when it relates to potential environmental impacts. Discretionary public hearings on the TVA’s proposed decisions supplement limited comment opportunities, although greater access to information requires that the public file a request under the federal Freedom of Information Act. And recent proceedings show that the TVA’s nine-member board is willing to delegate important, locally relevant decisions—such as how to phase out coal plants—entirely to its CEO, with no outside input.

Welton, Phillips, and Luke argue that the TVA’s lack of shareholders exacerbates some of the issues that stem from its quasi-corporate structure. Without shareholders, the responsibility to question its decision-making falls on local power companies that operate without “any substantial leverage” from constituents. This lack of leverage stems from the TVA’s regional monopoly—its ability to legally exclude competitors from its transmission lines weakens local power companies and leaves little room for pushback.

Local power companies, which are the TVA’s primary customers, allege that this monopoly also encourages unfair business practices and forces them to forgo cleaner, cheaper energy options.

Welton, Phillips, and Luke cite data showing that the TVA lags behind privately owned utilities in adopting solar power, ignores the economic benefits of clean energy, and performs poorly on energy-efficiency metrics. In addition, nearly all of the 153 local power companies that do business with TVA have signed “never ending” contracts with a 20-year term and a 20-year cancellation notice, which require them to source 95 percent of all of their energy needs from the TVA.

But Welton, Phillips, and Luke contend that with targeted reforms, the TVA could still become a “clean energy laboratory and yardstick” that could influence a “national decarbonization strategy.” They identify the need for a more engaged and politically accountable board with its own dedicated staff, increased transparency in decision-making, and a clear congressional mandate. To transform the TVA into a cutting-edge public energy laboratory, the authors argue that federal funding is necessary to insulate local ratepayers from the economic risks associated with untested technology.",https://www.theregreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Botchev1.21.2026-1348129059.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 11:04:50.434860

Honda 0 Series: An All-New Platform

The Saloon, which debuted as a concept car in 2024, will ride on Honda’s new in-house platform. It’s a vertically integrated architecture that the automaker can have full control over, allowing it to make quick changes to the hardware and patch software issues with over-the-air updates without having to wait on third-party suppliers and developers.

Honda has gone to great lengths to integrate light materials into the cars’ construction, and is betting big on megacasting technology and a new, AI-enabled software suite that can integrate lidar sensors and ultimately offer Level 3 ""eyes-off"" driving capabilities.

Honda's 0 Series platform revolves around three key words: Thin, Light and Wise.

Photo by: Honda

The platform itself can accept battery packs rated at 800 volts, which enables them to charge faster than more mainstream 400-volt alternatives, as we have seen with 800-volt cars like the Kia EV9 and Porsche Macan. Honda has not yet offered official specifications for charging power and charging session times, but it’s aiming for a 15% to 80% top-up in 15 minutes or less.

It’s also worth noting that some 0 Series-based models could get a 400-volt battery system to keep costs down, but that’s unlikely to happen with the flagship Saloon.

Honda said that it would offer two versions of its e-axle motor: one with 241 horsepower (180 kilowatts), and the other with 67 hp (50 kW). In other words, the most powerful version of the 0 Series Saloon would have a total of 482 hp, which is not record-breaking by any stretch of the imagination. But if Honda manages to keep the weight down as it promises, it should be enough for any driving scenario.

Honda 0 Series Saloon: Design

There’s no way around this: the Honda 0 Series Saloon is a head-turner. The four-door EV is low to the ground, thanks to the slim battery pack nestled inside the floor, and looks like something out of a futuristic cartoon.

It’s a razor-shaped sedan that’s bound to get everybody’s attention once it hits the streets, but there’s no guarantee that Honda will stay true to the concept’s looks once the production version rolls off the assembly line.

The original show car did go through some modifications for its second public appearance, with the huge double doors being replaced with a set of more conventional four doors. Inside, everything screams “future,” from the profiled seats to the full-width screen and massive panoramic roof.

Asimo OS, a brand-new operating system that gives a nod to the cool and quirky Honda humanoid robot, powers it all. That too is a big deal. It lays the groundwork for future software-defined vehicles at Honda, future connected cars, autonomous driving, over-the-air updates and more. Like its Japanese rival Toyota, Honda is behind new players like Rivian, Tesla and the Chinese automakers at software, and Asimo OS represents the brand's attempts to hit back.

Honda 0 Series Saloon: Availability

The Honda 0 Series Saloon was initially scheduled to go into production in Ohio this year, as the first model based on the 0 Series platform. However, after several setbacks, including the cancellation of the $7,500 federal tax credit, Honda has decided to postpone the launch of the 0 Series Saloon to 2027.

The company is still moving forward with its 0 Series-based models, but the first models to roll off the assembly line this year will be the Honda 0 Series SUV and Acura RSX crossovers. The Japanese automaker also cut its investment plans for new EVs, going from $69 billion to roughly $48 billion until 2030.

Honda 0 Series Saloon: Price

Although Honda has not publicized a figure yet, the 0 Series Saloon is widely expected to start around $50,000. That doesn't make it a cheap new EV, but it does put it around the average newcar price in the U.S. If it can deliver on these specs, then Honda fans are getting a lot of car for the money.

But given the current softening of EV demand in the U.S., and the American market largely souring on sedans in recent years, the delay to 2027 makes sense—especially if Honda ends up leading with the 0 Series SUV. Either way, the 0 Series platform should be the start of something big from this manufacturer. Let's hope it finds a way to production, and wins hearts and minds with EV fans and newcomers everywhere.

Households will be eligible for thousands of pounds' worth of solar panels and other green tech to lower their energy bills, the government has announced.

The long-awaited Warm Homes Plan promises to provide £15bn to households across the UK over the next five years, as well as introducing new rights for renters.

The government has said it wants to create a ""rooftop revolution"", tripling the number of homes with solar, and lifting one million people out of fuel poverty.

The plan has been strongly welcomed by the energy and finance industry, but the Conservative Party said the scheme will ""saddle households with high ongoing running costs"".

First touted back in 2024, the Warm Homes Plan promised to tackle the ""national emergency"" of rising energy bills, but it has taken two years for the final detail to be published.

The government announced that the plan, published on Wednesday, will focus on funding solar panels, heat pumps and batteries for households across the UK via low-interest loans and grants.

For able-to-pay households even with the grants there are likely to be additional costs of installing the technologies. For a heat pump after the subsidy households pay on average £5,000.

But for an average three bedroom semi-detached home, installing these three technologies, could save £500 annually on energy bills, it estimates.

Although social charity Nesta, and green energy charity, MCS Foundation, have estimated it could be more than £1000.

""A warm home shouldn't be a privilege, it should be a basic guarantee for every family in Britain,"" said Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.

Ed Miliband said the ""cost of living crisis is the biggest issue the country faces"" and that ""upgrading homes is a crucial part of getting bills down"".

Speaking to BBC Breakfast on Wednesday, the Energy Secretary said the move was aimed at ""expanding the choices that people have, so something like a heat pump or a solar panel isn't just in the reach of the wealthiest"".

Measures in the plan include:

Extending the Boiler Upgrade Scheme by a further year to 2029/30, offering £7,500 grants for air source heat pumps

Additional £600m for low-income households to receive funding for the full cost of solar panels and batteries taking the total available to £5bn

Low and zero-interest loans for households irrespective of income

The plan has been strongly welcomed by the energy industry, workers' unions, and the finance sector, who see the long-term financial commitment by the government as crucial for driving private investment into green technologies.

""£15 billion is a substantial commitment, it provides certainty to investors and businesses in the energy market,"" said Dhara Vyas, chief executive of trade body Energy UK.

Camilla Born, CEO of Electrify Britain - a joint campaign group from Octopus and EDF to encourage switching to electric heating - also welcomed the announcement and said it will help cut bills long-term but said ""the bad side is that it is a plan, and we need delivery"".

Some of the schemes are already distributing grants, but for new funding the government has yet to decide how or when households will receive the money. It said that ""further engagement with the finance sector"" is needed this year.

Richard Tice, Reform deputy leader, strongly criticised the plan and said it was: ""A scandalous waste of up to £15bn of taxpayers' cash primarily buying Chinese made solar panels, batteries and heat pumps, that is bad for British industry.""

Two thirds (68%) of the solar panels imported by the UK came from China in 2024, according to HMRC trade data.

Miliband told the BBC that work was underway to ""diversify"" supply chains and that the government was seeking to ""unwind that concentration"" through investments in the UK.

The government has said the scheme would contribute to 180,000 new jobs in the clean heating sector - although some of these are likely to be from retraining existing engineers.

Insulation funding downgraded

The original plan had focused on ramping up installation of insulation in homes which was considered a cost-effective way to reduce heat loss from the UK's leaky housing stock.

But ongoing controversy with a government-funded insulation scheme, ECO, involving botch installations, has led to the scheme not being extended.

Aadil Qureshi, CEO of Heat Geek, which retrains heating engineers to install heat pumps, said it was the right decision and a refocus on green tech was better value for government money.

Unlike insulation, he said heat pumps are a technology in its infancy, and needed government support to catalyse the industry.

""[The plan] allows the industry to commit, to double down - it allows investors, manufacturers to say let's keep investing to get to a certain point where it is equal with the hydrocarbon alternative,"" he said.

By switching households away from oil heaters and gas boilers to electrical heat pumps, powered by renewable energy, the government hopes it will cut the country's planet warming emissions, of which around 18% come from home heating.

Dozens of people have got in contact with BBC Your Voice about their experience installing low-carbon technologies like heat pumps.

One retired couple Chris and Penny Harcourt, living in Stowmarket, got a heat pump two years ago and said it was the ""best update we have done in our house for 20 years"".

But they said that with current electricity prices it was expensive to run and it was only when they got solar panels did they see the costs fall.

You can watch a conversation BBC Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt had with Penny below.

Heat pumps can be three to four times more efficient than gas boilers, but higher electricity prices mean that they can end up being the same or more expensive to run.

But moving households off gas heating has been a priority for the government.

Miliband has previously said the UK's dependence on fossil fuels was its ""Achilles heel"" - after significant fluctuations in prices - and clean power was the only way to lower energy bills.

Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday he said the rise in gas prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine demonstrated why the ""mission for clean power is so important"".

He added: ""We are swapping reliance on imported gas... for homegrown clean power where we control the price"".

But the UK has some of the highest electricity bills in Europe due to upgrades to the network, government taxes and the impact of wholesale prices driven by the gas price.

Claire Coutinho, shadow energy secretary said: ""Unless the Government gets serious about cutting electricity bills now, many of these taxpayer-funded schemes will saddle households with high ongoing running costs every single year.""

And the Liberal Democrats said the plan did not go far enough and it means there is ""no effective fuel poverty programme in place this winter"".

The government hopes that ramping up solar panels will be the answer.

The Warm Homes Plan will encourage households to opt for the trio of low carbon technologies - heat pumps, solar panels and batteries.

This will see more of the electricity demand of heat pumps met by home-generated solar energy rather than from the grid; thus driving down prices.

Not everyone in the green industry is supportive of all the measures. Dale Vince, CEO of energy company Ecotricity, praised the new funding for solar but criticised the high level of subsidy for heat pumps.

Although he said they had a role to play, he said they weren't the national answer for lowering heating costs and greenhouse gas emissions.

""Solar panels give us the biggest bang for buck there is no doubt about that - cheapest to install and most productive in terms of bringing down energy bills. Heat pumps sit at the other end of that scale,"" Vince said.

""We could put solar panels on 10 million rooftops or heat pumps in one million homes.""

Renters' rights reforms

The installation of low carbon tech will only be available to those who are homeowners or in social housing, but the Warm Homes Plan also includes recent announcements to changes in renters' rights.

From 2030, landlords will need to make sure rental properties have a minimum energy efficiency score of EPC C - up from E.

But currently the way that a home is awarded an EPC score is based on estimated running costs rather than energy efficiency, which can mean the score is downgraded following a heat pump installation.

In the plan, the government has said it intends to announce changes to the assessment process later this year.

The industry was also hoping that the Warm Homes Plan would set out updated efficiency requirements for new builds - the Future Homes Standard - but it said these would be published in the next few months.

There had been concern amongst environmentalists that the requirement for solar panels on new homes was to be dropped.

But the plan said: ""We have confirmed that under these standards, new homes will have low-carbon heating, high levels of energy efficiency and solar panels by default.""

Jess Ralston, Energy Analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said that these decisions have been a long time coming.

""That timelines are being pushed back is likely to be frustrating for those who are still colder and poorer in shoddy rental homes, but the public overwhelmingly back better standards for new builds so should be encouraged to see new requirements on the house builders at long last,"" she said.

Leveraging core equipment for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) combined-cycle and nuclear power, the company is pursuing a strategy that covers both local production and maintenance, and is seen as having entered the heart of the U.S. energy market.

SNT Energy announced on the 21st that it is participating in POWERGEN International 2026, held in San Antonio, State of Texas, for three days from the 20th (local time).

POWERGEN International is the world’s largest power generation exhibition, covering the full spectrum of the power industry, including LNG power generation, nuclear power, and renewable energy. More than 500 companies from over 80 countries took part, including power producers, Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) firms, energy consumers, and equipment manufacturers.

At this exhibition, SNT Energy focused on building a global cooperation network around HRSG, a core facility for LNG combined-cycle power plants, and surface condensers, essential auxiliary equipment for nuclear power generation. The company noted that, as AI data centers proliferate and stable power supply becomes a top priority for many countries, interest has concentrated on high-efficiency, high-reliability power generation equipment.

In 1990, SNT Energy became the first company in Korea to localize high-frequency finned tubes, a key component of HRSG, and has since led the domestic HRSG industry. Building on its own design capabilities and manufacturing technology, the company has strengthened its market competitiveness, and in 2014 it supplied HRSG using the supermodule method for the first time in Korea to the Ichthys LNG Project in Australia, proving its technological prowess on the international stage.

The supermodule method involves fully assembling the entire HRSG at the factory, transporting it, and installing it immediately on site. This approach can significantly reduce both construction time and costs for power plants, which is why it has attracted strong interest from global EPC contractors. It is regarded as a competitive technology in the North American market, where large-scale projects continue to roll out.

SNT Energy is going further by ramping up its local production strategy, using the SNT Energy Louisiana plant established last year as a base. The company plans to expand its business portfolio by not only producing HRSG and surface condensers in the United States, but also linking this with maintenance and after-sales services for existing power plants. Its aim is to move beyond simple exports and establish itself as a true local player in the U.S. market.

A representative of SNT Energy said, ""Through the POWERGEN exhibition, we were able to see firsthand how the power generation industry is responding to the global challenge of power shortages in the AI era,"" adding, ""We will diversify our HRSG market strategy, not only in the United States but also in Japan, Poland, Vietnam, Taiwan, the Middle East, and Central Asia.""

The report, “Data Center Power Play,” projects U.S. electricity needs increasing more than 60% by 2050 in its mid-level data center demand growth scenario.

Stronger ratepayer protections can also prohibit utilities from passing on the costs from data centers through higher prices.
“With surging demand from data centers, the need for plentiful, affordable power has never been higher.","CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (January 21, 2026)—Electricity demand is up and so are household bills across the country. More energy is needed to bolster the U.S. electricity grid as the addition of data centers is widely expected to reshape the energy landscape in coming years. A new report released today by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) highlights the projected consequences of data centers’ growing electricity demand on the U.S. power grid and how decisionmakers can mitigate harmful economic, climate, and health impacts through clean energy development and strong ratepayer protections.

Since future data center demand growth is highly uncertain, largely due to a lack of transparency from utilities and Big Tech companies, UCS modeled multiple demand growth scenarios as well as energy policy scenarios for how that demand is met. The report, “Data Center Power Play,” projects U.S. electricity needs increasing more than 60% by 2050 in its mid-level data center demand growth scenario. In the next five years, data centers were projected to account for nearly half of total electricity demand growth nationally.

Without strong ratepayer protections, such rapid data center growth could put households and businesses at risk of more than $500 billion in cumulative electricity costs nationally by 2035 and nearly $1 trillion by 2050, UCS reports. Absent ambitious climate and clean energy policies, additional fossil fuels burned to power data centers could increase carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by 19% and result in a further $1.6 trillion in climate and health damages over the next decade, growing to $4.5 trillion by 2050.

“Frenzied data center growth with little transparency or guardrails puts the public at risk of massive cost increases,” said Steve Clemmer, director of energy research at UCS and lead report author. “The climate and health benefits and net cost savings of building clean energy to meet future electricity needs are obvious and enormous, but they will not materialize without political support and responsible management of data center load growth.”

Amid the rapidly escalating and costly impacts of fossil fuel-driven climate change and an affordability crisis nationwide, state and federal support for affordable clean energy paired with substantive ratepayer protections is the smartest and quickest way to meet growing electricity demand while protecting people’s health, wallets and the climate.

Key report findings, which assume mid-level demand growth for data centers:

$248 billion in wholesale electricity costs could be avoided by 2050 by restoring federal clean energy tax credits slashed by the Trump administration.

Reducing U.S. power sector CO2 emissions 70% by 2035 and 95% by 2050 would result in more than $1.6 trillion in avoided global climate damages by 2035 and $13 trillion by 2050.

Such power sector decarbonization would also dramatically reduce air pollution from fossil fuels, resulting in $40 billion in avoided health costs nationally by 2035 and $220 billion by 2050.

Decarbonizing the power sector would come with modest increases in wholesale electricity costs, but those costs would be far outweighed by the avoided health and climate damages from reducing fossil fuel use. Stronger ratepayer protections can also prohibit utilities from passing on the costs from data centers through higher prices.

“Data centers are already secretly increasing peoples’ electricity bills,” said Mike Jacobs, senior energy analyst at UCS and author of a recent UCS report on loopholes exploited by data center developers to push their costs onto the public. “While some utility companies and data center developers are intentionally misdirecting scrutiny, others are willfully ignorant about their roles in passing costs onto consumers. In a future with immense data center growth, ratepayers shouldn’t be forced to subsidize Big Tech’s profits at the expense of their own health, climate and pocketbooks. State utility regulators have clear authority to assign costs to those that cause them—it’s time they require data center developers to pay their fair share for energy needs that can dwarf that of entire cities.”

This latest UCS report recommends stronger policies to accelerate the clean energy transition while creating guardrails to protect people and communities from the harms and costs of meeting data centers’ electricity demands. It also calls out the Trump administration’s prioritization of fossil fuel polluters that put people, the environment, and electricity affordability and reliability at risk.

“The Trump administration has repeatedly worked to derail clean energy deployment precisely when we need it most,” said Julie McNamara, associate policy director for the Climate and Energy Program at UCS. “With surging demand from data centers, the need for plentiful, affordable power has never been higher. Yet instead of clearing the path for the fastest, cheapest, cleanest resources to deploy, President Trump is sidelining renewables just to boost the interests of the fossil fuel industry. People will pay the price: in higher bills, in dirtier air, in lost local investments and in worsened climate impacts.”",https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/2021-05/media-release-image.png,N,,2026-01-21 00:58:41.478240

(WOOD) — An investigation of Climax-Scotts High School’s athletic director and head football coach Tyler Langs found examples of player mistreatment, nepotism and a lack of oversight in his roles, the school board says.

In a letter to the school community posted online Monday, the Board of Education said that an investigator interviewed multiple parent and student witnesses, along with “additional individuals” who had been contacted by students or parents.

From Oct. 21 to Nov. 18, the board said that Langs “refused to meet with the investigator to discuss the allegations,” which delayed the investigative process. On Nov. 18, “a targeted set of specific questions — a snapshot of allegations from the report” were sent to Langs, the letter said. He submitted written responses on Nov. 24.

A 40-page investigation report that was released by the district listed several findings, including a point that stated: “In his role as football coach, Tyler Langs has engaged in conduct and speech over a period of at least three years that violates Board Policy 4201, has negatively impacted students, created a toxic environment, and cast aspersion on the District.”

The final of eight points listed said: “The employment of Langs as coach, athletic director, and dean of students gives the appearances of nepotism, including favoritism, to the detriment of the District.”

An additional point listed that in his role as athletic director, “Tyler Langs has not communicated promptly and appropriately with students, parents, or the community.”

The board acknowledged that while playing time caused speculation, none of the issues brought to administration were directly related to it.

On Jan. 16, the district said that the superintendent reached out to Langs “to try to reach an amicable agreement that would maintain his employment with the District as Dean of Students,” while adding that Langs has a contract to remain employed for the 2026-27 school year. The district said it is waiting on his response.",https://www.woodtv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2021/08/1-35.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-21 02:57:36.589836

Following up on the counterproductive decision to pull the plug on the US EV tax credit, Republicans in Congress are now looking to kill the giant US EV charging program that was created by Democrats during the Biden administration.

Yes, this is the program Donald Trump tried to halt in early 2025 before a federal judge determined that was illegal. Projects connected to the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Charging (NEVI) Formula program are all across the country, but Republicans apparently want to bring them to a screeching halt.

“Today, the Senate and House of Representatives released a series of appropriation bills. The draft fiscal year 2026 transportation bill would strip away more than $875 million in funds for EV charging infrastructure, including roughly $500 million already apportioned to all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico to build essential EV charging infrastructure along the nation’s highways under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Charging (NEVI) Formula program,” the Sierra Club shares. “This proposal would sabotage states’ efforts to resume NEVI buildout after the Trump administration unlawfully froze the program in February 2025. Although the U.S. Department of Transportation later lifted the freeze following an adverse court ruling, it continued to impede implementation by imposing unnecessary planning requirements and blocking some states’ access to funds they are legally entitled to use.”

Yes, indeed, it seems the whole Republican Party in Congress and the White House is eager to kill projects that create tens of thousands of jobs and support a transition to clean electric transport. This is despite some of them cutting ribbons to open such projects and claiming responsibilities for ones in their districts. Is it to support the oil and gas industry a little while longer? Is it to get in line behind Donald Trump and his vendetta against cleantech? Who knows, but either way, it’s not good for the country.

“Despite those hurdles, every state is moving forward. All states submitted new implementation plans within just 30 days and have resumed NEVI deployment. Since the freeze was lifted in August, states have obligated $895 million in NEVI funds to new projects,” the Sierra Club adds. “NEVI is delivering real results. In total, 48 states have committed over $1.4 billion to a reliable, nationwide EV charging network that lowers driving costs and expands access to electric vehicles across the country.

“Before the program was frozen, 39 states had issued solicitations, awards, or contracts, with $526 million committed to charging projects. After the freeze was lifted and states regained access to funds following submission of new (and unnecessary) plans, states have been actively advancing projects: Texas is restarting station construction; Alabama just closed a new application round; Indiana is resuming contracting; and Georgia is resuming procurement.”

Apparently, the Republican Party mantra is that we can’t have good things. While China surges far ahead in the EV transition and reaps the rewards, the GOP is intent on slowing us down even further and trying to pretend we’re back in the 20th century. Whatever it takes to prolong the burning of fossil fuels. Why? Because that helps some of their billionaire and millionaire friends.

“Americans shouldn’t be punished for the Trump administration’s attempts to rob states of reliable electric vehicle charging that will benefit our wallets, air, and climate. Following Trump’s unlawful funding freeze, we have seen the NEVI program restart successfully and overwhelming support across states. We urge Members of Congress to leave this funding alone. States must be able to access the full amount they were promised and are relying on as they work to build essential infrastructure in our communities,” Sierra Club Clean Transportation for All Director Katherine García declares. Ah, if only common sense like that would prevail.

One thing is clear: the Republican Party continues to be the party that is anti-progress, anti-cleantech, and anti-blue collar jobs.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/NEVI.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 03:58:49.024440

ODA and DEQ must limit waste disposal to put water quality and public health first.
Monitoring is key to the effectiveness of the Clean Water Act’s permit program, because it provides transparency and allows for accountability.","Late last year, the Oregon Departments of Agriculture and Environmental Quality proposed the long-overdue renewal of a permit that regulates how hundreds of the state’s factory farms manage their mountains of livestock waste. Unfortunately, their draft falls seriously short.

Factory farms are well known for dumping massive amounts of pollution into the environment, which can have disastrous impacts on our communities and our water. In 2022, milk cows on Oregon’s mega-dairies alone produced over 4 billion pounds of manure — or enough to overflow two-and-a-half Olympic swimming pools each day.

Much of this manure is then over-applied to agricultural land, where it can run off into streams and leach into drinking water — contributing significantly to Eastern Oregon’s three-decade-long nitrate contamination crisis. Oregon only updates the permit every five years at most, so it is critical to get this renewal right.

The federal Clean Water Act requires these permits be strong enough to protect Oregon’s waterways. Specifically, Clean Water Act permits require dischargers to restrict their pollution by using the best available control technology and management practices, and to monitor those discharges to show they are not violating the law. But for decades, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Oregon regulators have let factory farms off the hook on both counts — and this permit proposes to continue that trend.

First, the permit does not go far enough to protect Oregon’s waterways. It allows factory farms to spread waste on cropland according to plans that prioritize maximizing crop production, not protecting water quality.

It lacks common-sense provisions like strong liner standards for all waste impoundments and a prohibition on spreading waste on frozen ground, where it is likely to run off into nearby streams. These inadequate plans can allow cancer-causing nitrates to leach into groundwater, contributing to drinking water crises in the Lower Umatilla Basin and elsewhere. ODA and DEQ must limit waste disposal to put water quality and public health first.

Second, the permit leaves Oregonians and regulators in the dark about pollution because it does not require adequate monitoring. Monitoring is key to the effectiveness of the Clean Water Act’s permit program, because it provides transparency and allows for accountability.

Food & Water Watch won an important Ninth Circuit lawsuit in 2021 confirming that monitoring is required for factory farms — just like it is for factories and wastewater treatment plants. But despite this and a similar, recent decision from Washington, ODA and DEQ have doubled down on the permit’s ‘see no evil’ approach.

The factory farm industry has long benefited from special treatment and governments allowing these facilities to pollute our water without meaningful oversight. Now, as the Trump administration seeks to limit the scope of the Clean Water Act and attack all of our bedrock environmental laws, Oregon regulators can go above and beyond and use every authority to protect Oregonians and our waterways. ODA and DEQ’s draft factory farm permit falls short of what the law requires and what Oregonians deserve, but it is not too late for the agencies to make critical improvements.",https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSC00276-2-2048x1440.jpeg,N,,2026-01-20 22:59:38.506793

Why Indiana University wants you to trade your space heater this winter

""With these four options, you're putting the heat directly onto the person instead of the air, so it's a more efficient way for you to get warmer,"" said Jessica Davis, Associate Vice President for Sustainability with Indiana University.

Davis went on to explain how these swaps have saved energy around Indiana University's campuses.

""If you happen to be in a location that's near the building's thermostat, the building may start reading that your space is hotter than it truly is,"" Davis continued. ""You're kind of creating an artificial environment; the building may actually start cooling down your space.""

Stacy Lozer is the Director of Career Services for the O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs.

Lozer recently took advantage of the trade-in program.

""We had this really unique and amazing opportunity to take those old space heaters that eat up a lot of energy, that quite often smell and aren't as effective, and trade them in for a nice warm fuzzy blanket,"" Lozer said, while covering up with her new heated blanket. ""In my office, I have a lot of windows. It's a great way to stay warm and just not waste kind of that space heater air that's just circulating around.""

The 96 space heaters that have been traded in (including Lozer's) will save energy and money for the university.

""About 48,000 kilowatt hours of energy a year, and that's about $12,000 worth of financial savings,"" Davis stated.

""If you make little changes, it makes a huge difference,"" said Lozer.

The Office of Sustainability works with Circle City Mutual Aid to find new off-campus homes for the space heaters traded in during this initiative.

While the exchange program is only offered to those at IU, Davis hopes the public will consider switching their own space heaters for greener alternatives, similar to the ones offered in the campus program.

""The same learnings here at IU can apply at home as well,"" Davis said.

If a space heater makes the most sense to use to keep your space warm, make sure you use it safely.

""Only use space heaters when you're in the room,"" says Tim Griffin with the Carmel Fire Department. ""Don't leave the house. Don't leave it plugged in, and if you are going to have it plugged in, have it plugged directly to the wall. Don't use an extension cord.""

Griffin went on to say that extension cords can use too much power with a space heater, and cause it to overheat.

""Make sure that it's three feet away from anything,"" Griffin continued.

Keeping the space heater in an open area on top of stable ground could prevent you, your pets, and your kids from knocking the space heater over, which could start a fire.

""I know we're talking about the extreme temperatures, but if something does happen because of the extreme cold, those working smoke detectors are going to make a difference in early detection, so we can get there and stop that fire before it spreads,"" Griffin said.

What else would Griffin avoid to keep warm?

""Leaving your stove on,"" Griffin said. ""Having it open like that, if you have any small children, again, pets, animals that could burn themselves, you know, it's never a good idea to try to heat the house with the stove.""

""If you've got a blanket or clothes, shove them in the base of your door, shove them around your window,"" Davis recommended. ""Hopefully, we just try to make it through this, these couple of weeks that are really cold.""

The engine whir reminds us of family BBQs, swinging on a Hills Hoist, and sinking back a cold one. But that familiar sound also means trips to the servo, buying two-stroke oil, cleaning and sharpening, and changing the air filter.

The tide of electrification has hit the gardening equipment department. Bunnings now has a full aisle dedicated to electric alternatives from lawnmowers to hedge trimmers, brush cutters to blowers. Whether it’s time to upgrade or curiosity has you perusing, we’ll take a look at whether the investment in electric gardening equipment is worth it.

Point of difference: Comparing petrol and electric gardening equipment

Most people switch for one of three reasons: less hassle, less noise, and fewer fumes. Petrol still wins for raw grunt and endless runtime. Battery wins for convenience, cleaner storage, and easy starting.

Here’s the practical comparison that matters in a normal Aussie backyard. Note that we have compared petrol and electric lawnmowers below, but the same applies to every garden power tool with electric alternatives.

Starting and day-to-day ease

Electric mowers start with a button and go. Petrol mowers can demand priming, pulling, and occasional colourful language. If you mow often, that convenience adds up fast.

Noise and neighbour friendliness

Battery mowers generally run quieter than petrol options. That matters if you mow early, live on a small block, or just like staying on speaking terms with the neighbours.

Maintenance and ongoing fuss

Petrol mowers need ongoing care, like filters, plugs, fuel, oil mixing for two-strokes, and off-season fuel management. Battery mowers skip most of that, because they have fewer moving parts. You still sharpen blades and keep the deck clean, but the routine feels lighter.

Running costs

With petrol, you pay every mow. With battery, you mostly pay upfront, then charge at home. If you already own batteries and chargers in a tool platform, the upgrade can be cheaper than you think.

Power and performance

For small to medium lawns, modern battery mowers do the job well. For thick kikuyu, long wet growth, or big blocks, petrol can still be the path of least resistance. Some brands also say battery will not replace petrol for every heavy duty use case, at least not yet.

What you will actually pay in Australia

At Bunnings, cordless mower kits can sit around the mid hundreds, and climb higher for self propelled, wider decks, or premium brands. Petrol mowers also span a wide range, from budget to “this will outlive me” territory.

The hidden cost is the ecosystem. If you buy into a battery platform, you can run a trimmer, blower, hedger, and chainsaw off the same batteries. That can make the numbers stack up, especially if your shed currently holds three half-working petrol tools.

Apples for apples, the prices can be quite even. A petrol 18-inch Victa will set you back about $409 to $509. A battery-powered 18-inch Victa kit with 2 batteries is about $415.

You will need to factor in whether you require additional batteries. That’s the kicker, as batteries can cost a few hundred dollars on their own.

The electrification bonus: One battery, many tools

Battery platforms are the quiet achievers here. If you already own compatible batteries, “skin only” tools can be great value. If you do not, starter kits cost more, but they set you up for the rest of your garden gear.

A simple approach works best: pick one platform you can stick with. Then add tools as your petrol gear retires.

Emissions and air quality: The bit we do not smell until we do

Petrol mowers emit exhaust at ground level, right where you stand. Australian research has measured emissions from in-use lawn mowers, with attention on pollutants like hydrocarbons from small engines.

Electric mowers shift emissions to the electricity source instead of the backyard. Several life cycle studies have compared petrol and electric mowers, and generally find petrol models have higher emissions during use, with battery manufacturing impacts sitting on the other side of the ledger.

If your home runs on solar, your mower can too. That is about as neat as it gets.

Robot lawnmowers: Are they worth it?

Many of us enjoy the set-and-forget ease of robovacs, but robot lawnmowers are the next “big thing”. They operate almost exactly the same as your Roomba, but do they actually do the job?

The short answer is yes – but they have specific use cases.

If you have a small backyard with minimal obstacles, then it might be the perfect fit. They mow often enough that the grass never grows long enough to be an issue for it. You might find that your edges are lacking, but the trade-off for the convenience may be worth it.

When upgrading makes sense

Upgrading usually makes sense if you tick a few of these boxes:

Your lawn is small to medium, and you mow regularly.

You want less maintenance, less storage hassle, and easier starts.

You already own batteries in a tool platform.

You dislike fumes, noise, or keeping fuel around the house.

When petrol still earns its keep

You might stick with petrol, or delay the switch, if:

You mow a large block, or you need a long runtime without swapping batteries.

Your lawn grows thick and fast, and you often mow it long or wet.

You need maximum cutting power for tough conditions, every time.

A simple decision checklist

If you want a quick call, use this:

Under 300 square metres and mowed often: Battery will likely feel like an upgrade.

Already on a battery platform: Battery almost always wins on convenience and value.

Big block, thick grass, infrequent mowing: Petrol may stay the safer bet.

Battery-powered gardening tools have earned their place

For most suburban Aussie yards, a modern battery mower is a genuine quality of life upgrade. You ditch fuel runs, reduce maintenance, and keep the peace with the neighbours. Petrol still has a place for bigger, tougher jobs, but for the average weekend mow, battery gear has well and truly arrived.",https://www.energymatters.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Energy-Matters-Electrifying-Australia.png,N,,2026-01-20 21:58:48.505484

Business groups believe a proposed Senate bill would lower their energy costs through the basic principle of supply and demand.
House Utilities, Energy and Telecommunications Committee Chair Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, said he has no plans to schedule Ledbetter’s bill for a hearing.
“‘Should we expand in Indiana?’ ‘What’s the cost of electricity in Indiana?’” Becker said at the event.
What portion of those costs are they going to be responsible for moving forward?” Indiana Energy Association President McGrath agreed, saying energy-choice policies create volatility.","For decades, Indiana’s energy landscape has operated under a vertically integrated system with state-regulated utilities generating and distributing electricity to customers in their assigned regions.

But two bills from Republican lawmakers could change that dynamic by allowing businesses, and potentially individual households, to get their electricity from a provider other than their local utility company.

Consumer control over buying or producing power—sometimes called energy choice or energy deregulation—is not new, but it’s not been widely discussed in Indiana so far.

And it’s not clear whether it will be this year, either. Neither bill has been scheduled for a hearing in what is expected to be an unusually short session. But advocates of the legislation aren’t likely to give up, even if the bills don’t move over the next six weeks or so.

Business groups believe a proposed Senate bill would lower their energy costs through the basic principle of supply and demand. If businesses have more options for buying energy, competition will lower prices, they say.

And large users, such as advanced manufacturers and data centers, say if they’re able to bypass the state-regulated—or incumbent—utility in their assigned service area to buy power, that utility won’t need to invest in big infrastructure builds, keeping prices lower for everyone else.

Abby Foster is vice president for policy and advocacy for the Retail Energy Advancement League, or REAL, which represents a collection of energy companies that work in natural gas, nuclear and renewables. She said the Northern Indiana Public Service Co. has allowed large users to shop for their own power in some cases, but codifying such agreements is the next step.

“This is already happening in Indiana,” Foster said. “But our members would like more certainty than what the regulatory process can offer. So in order for this to truly be enough certainty for them to come and invest and build and serve these customers, it really needs to be in statute.”

The Indiana Energy Association, which represents the state’s investor-owned utilities, has a different take. IEA President Danielle McGrath said energy-choice policies can lead to unpredictability for companies and utilities alike.

“It definitely is creating more risk and uncertainty when we really need a period of stability,” McGrath said.

Wholesale energy

Language outlining energy-choice policy sits in Senate Bill 272 and House Bill 1276, carried by Sen. Stacey Donato, R-Logansport, and Rep. Cindy Ledbetter, R-Newburgh, respectively.

Donato’s bill would allow businesses that use more than 1 megawatt of power a year to buy energy from a “competitive electricity supplier,” beginning in July 2027. The utility managing that service area would have to distribute the purchased electricity through its transmission lines with no added fees.

The bill would cap the percentage of third-party energy sales allowed within an incumbent utility’s territory. It would set an initial cap of 20% of the utility’s sales from the prior year, excluding any sales for customers using more than 75 megawatts, but allow the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission to amend the cap.

The proposed legislation mirrors an energy-choice law Michigan passed in 2008 where, according to Foster, demand for wholesale energy purchases reached the state’s 10% cap within two years.

Data from the Michigan Public Services Commission shows 5,514 customers took part in the energy-choice program in 2024, and all of Michigan’s regulated utilities were at or near their 10% cap for alternative electric sales that year.

“If Michigan’s any story of what we can expect, customers are going to want to avail themselves of this,” Foster said. “And for every megawatt that’s procured from a third party, that’s one less megawatt that the utility, who gets to charge all ratepayers, has to build.”

If energy demand for outside power supplies exceeds the state’s cap, a queue system would kick in, and third-party electricity suppliers would have to register with the IURC.

Legislation from Ledbetter goes even further, allowing residential customers to also seek electric service on the open market.

Ledbetter’s House Bill 1276 would require investor-owned utilities to decouple their costs of generation from the costs of distributing electricity and charge customers only for what they use. Customers who don’t want to shop around would stay with their default utility.

Ledbetter said the intent of her bill is to drive down costs with a free-market approach.

“With us shutting down coal and converting everything to natural gas and going to renewables, the consumer has to pay for those costs, and those costs are getting high,” she said. “So if we go to free-market electricity, much like with cellphones, we will see those costs eventually come down.”

Both bills have been sent to their respective utility committees. Senate Utility Chair Eric Koch, R-Bedford, wouldn’t tell IBJ what bills will be scheduled yet this session. House Utilities, Energy and Telecommunications Committee Chair Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, said he has no plans to schedule Ledbetter’s bill for a hearing.

New energy paradigm

Anne Becker, a director at Indianapolis-based law firm Lewis Kappes, said during the IBJ’s Future of Energy Summit on Nov. 21 that businesses she works with are constantly thinking about their energy costs.

“‘Should we expand in Indiana?’ ‘What’s the cost of electricity in Indiana?’” Becker said at the event. “It’s a huge component to their costs. ‘Can we put something behind the meter on our property?’ All this stuff goes into the equation.”

Data from the Indiana Office of Energy Development shows Indiana’s electricity costs rose higher than the national average from 2002-2016 but below the national average from 2017-2023. A Lawrence Berkeley study published in December found Indiana’s electricity prices decreased from 2019 through 2024 when inflation is not considered.

But cost isn’t the only factor. Many large ratepayers are looking for “bespoke” energy plans that are diversified for resiliency or to meet environmental goals.

Foster, the vice president of REAL, said the proposed new model is a win for ratepayers large and small. With utilities building power plants to serve the demand of large manufacturers and data centers, the cost of that infrastructure investment can be passed on to consumers. But if those large users were responsible for their own power needs, utilities—and remaining ratepayers—would be off the hook, Foster said.

Under the current structure, she said, “If these data centers at the end of their power-purchase agreements with the utilities no longer need this generation, or say, new technology comes out that makes data centers super-efficient, and they don’t need the amount of capacity, the ratepayers in Indiana are the ones that pick up that bill.”

Foster and Becker pointed to NIPSCO, which created the subsidiary GenCo last year to facilitate large-load customers in its service area exploring their own energy options.

Kristina Wheeler, a partner at business law firm Bose McKinney & Evans, said that arrangement helped one of the biggest companies in Indiana.

“Kudos to NIPSCO for allowing their customers above 10 megawatts to go to the market for power. It kept our client, U.S. Steel, operating in Gary, Indiana,” Wheeler said at the IBJ Future of Energy Summit. “It was beneficial to a lot of other major users and existing businesses in northern Indiana.”

A spokeswoman for NIPSCO declined to comment for this story.

Not that simple

But Indiana’s regulated utilities and consumer advocacy groups say deregulation legislation will raise rates for most customers.

Citizens Action Coalition Executive Director Kerwin Olson said it takes years to plan and hundreds of millions of dollars for utilities to build their energy grid to serve their territories, meaning individual businesses packing up and leaving the grid is “just not as simple as people want it to be.”

Olson said that if large users don’t have to pay for electricity through their area utility, the cost of a power plant that was built 15 years ago to serve that very customer could then be passed along to everyone else.

“You build these massive systems to serve all of your customers, and then with 30 days’ notice, a huge customer can just leave that system and not pay anything,” Olson said of the proposed legislation. “They’re still using the grid. They’re still connected to the system. What portion of those costs are they going to be responsible for moving forward?”

Indiana Energy Association President McGrath agreed, saying energy-choice policies create volatility. Because regulated utilities are required by law to serve customers in their territories, she said, businesses buying energy on the wholesale market but still connected to the existing grid would still need to be served in an emergency.

“If something does go wrong, those businesses are still going to count on us to meet their needs, but that comes at a cost,” McGrath said. “If you don’t have the appropriate parameters in place and that customer comes to us, but there isn’t sufficient capacity, what do they do? What do we do?”

McGrath said Illinois and Ohio have both adopted energy-choice programs for residential ratepayers, but prices haven’t come down. She cited a study conducted by Ohio State University in 2024 that found 72% of offers for electricity on the residential retail market were more expensive than if the household had stuck with their default utility.

In Illinois, she said, the state’s Office of Attorney General has filed a string of lawsuits against retailer energy providers that the state says have used deceptive marketing practices to sign people up for their more expensive rates.

In 2021, when Beijing finally pledged to stop building and financing new coal power plants overseas, Western governments and climate advocates rejoiced. John Kerry, US climate envoy at the time, said he was “absolutely delighted to hear” of the decision.

It is “a key topic of my discussions during my visit to China”, Alok Sharma, a member of the British House of Lords, wrote on social media, suggesting it was a result of pressure from the West.

But now, from Chile to Spain to Portugal, country after country is grappling with major blackouts. A troubling question is emerging: has this major climate victory over China backfired?

Because while China agreed to halt coal power exports under intense international pressure, at home it took the opposite approach.

Far from abandoning coal, China doubled down on advanced, ultra-efficient coal units that acted as grid stabilisers, backing up its massive expansion of wind and solar power.

In effect, China developed a dual strategy: export pure green energy to the world while keeping the stabilising backup systems and tech largely for itself.

Today, as renewable-heavy grids in Europe and Latin America face strain, and extreme weather exposes the vulnerabilities of intermittent power sources, the irony is hard to ignore: while nations are embracing that green future, they are confronting power failures that may have been tempered with the very technologies that they asked China not to export.

Commitments that they largely would not have needed if they had access to global supply chains.","Support CleanTechnica's work through a Substack subscription or on Stripe.

At CES, I didn’t get the chance to attend as many panels and discussions as I had hoped. When I made it, I was often pulled away partway through by another commitment. However, I had the chance to attend “Competing in a Trade-Disrupted World,” moderated by Ed Brzytwa, Vice President of International Trade for CTA, which produces CES. The panel included diverse perspectives, including Dan Anthony, who runs the website WePayTheTariffs.com, and Robin Liss, CEO of Suvie, who explained her challenges as a SMB. As clean technology has been hardest hit due to a combination of politically connected legacy interests, trade was already on my mind. Listening to the conversations, reading the stories and seeing the diverse inputs into the technology ecosystem, I gained a new appreciation for how it is not just one sector or the consumer paying the price for protectionism. We all pay.

People Pay In Different Ways

Consumers paying the price should be obvious. Increasing taxes and blocking competition distorts markets. In most cases, the hours of work wasted to earn money to overpay for products are more than the net hours of work preserved at uncompetitive companies. If we blocked TVs when Zenith went bankrupt to prop them up in the 90s, we might still be looking at months of pay for a product that underperforms what people can now buy with a few hours of pay.

But small businesses also pay in many ways. Retailers faced with increased costs on goods, often beyond what their customers are willing or able to spend, clearly pay price for protectionism. Sales go down while margins squeeze, making viability a challenge.

Entrepreneurial innovators and manufacturers also suffer. We simply do not have the industrial capability to do everything on our own, and small companies do not have the capital to reinvent the wheel. When I spoke to several US-based entrepeneurs about it, they mentioned that they can use a Chinese company to produce a prototype part and have it in weeks, instead of months. They mentioned that they could have the product manufactured and in market faster than they could build the prototype in the US. Even if they could build it here, competitors would be generations ahead of them by the time it hits the market. And then, when it gets to market, the cost is often too high, especially if they are cut off from imported components and materials.

China has massive industrial supply chains and a well-developed technology ecosystem. They also add the equivalent of the US engineering workforce to their workforce roughly every year. Many of these engineers are focused on the essential but less exciting parts of the project, like DFM and injection mold tooling, rather than focusing on creating the next attention-grabbing breakthrough. They have the talent to do much of the “99% perspiration” that turns the “1% inspiration” into a viable product. That is undoubtedly one of their greatest advantages. Other countries seeking to compete with China need to offer their own advantages. We simply do not have the population or education system needed to match global capabilities internally. Those global capabilities can be utilized to help our companies, if we let it happen. When we stand in the way of it happening, we pay the price.

In addition, if you have ever taken apart an electronic product, you will see things like capacitors from Japan, memory chips from Arizona, processors from Taiwan, batteries from China, displays from Korea… no one country makes everything, regardless of where final assembly and packaging takes place. The South Hall at CES especially was filled with these types of manufacturers and suppliers. No one country is going to be good at everything, and the more options that are available, the better cost/performance of the product. Isolating any country weakens the entire technology ecosystem. The overall collaboration is less productive. Cutting off the supply of individual components, software, or technologies makes creating innovative products more difficult. This is especially the case for startups and small businesses that can’t pay for custom-made chips or to build their own factories. They can’t afford to order a spool of custom-alloyed stainless steel. They have to use largely off-the-shelf parts and materials, and we just made that shelf smaller and more expensive.

Even large companies with the capital to build factories to supply their operations have to pay the price. Some may look at the tens of billions of dollars that Detroit is writing off on scaled back EV plans and think it is just about EVs. But much of those write-downs and penalties are for supply commitments and capacity being built that they do not need now. Commitments that they largely would not have needed if they had access to global supply chains. That added cost, and now cancellation cost, sets EV adoption back. With access to global supply chains, EV adoption could have accelerated, and localization of the heavy, highly automated battery production would happen with the market scale that comes from increased adoption. Now, with that market scale postponed and isolation from global markets, US EV adoption is set back further.

We also pay the price for isolation from their consumers. In the US, the average new car buyer is in their 50s, over two decades older than the average new car buyer in China. While China may be aging and shrinking overall, their wealth is much younger and growing faster, largely driven by technology. The gap is expanded due to our education system, the debt loads our education system puts on young people, and our elevated prices. Young people in tech-focused careers who grew up with smartphones have different perspectives and expectations on technology than their parents. The early adopter market is much larger. The adoption curve is different. As such, some Chinese companies are moving to smartphone-like technology iteration, accelerating progress. In many ways, the consumer is just as important to technology adoption as the producer.

Even Legacy Pays Eventually

In the end, legacy industry also pays the price. Like the overprotective parent coddling a whiney child, our government has enabled underperformers. Initially, it may look like they are being protected from competition. But they also are not growing, evolving, gaining perspective, or making connections. As that kid becomes an adult still living with their parents, surrounded by participation trophies in a state of persistent dependency, were they really being helped?

As I mentioned to Tom and Riz on Ludicrous Feed, US legacy automakers have already lost on EVs in an “us versus them” adversarial contest. But there is hope in collaboration. Many people still have love for the brands. However, the longer we isolate our country from global competition and global collaboration, the farther behind we will fall. And the less relevant the US part of the collaboration will become.

Eventually, the walls politicians put up around their people and industry will come down. When they do, the artificially propped up and isolated industries tend to fall with them. Trabant no longer makes cars. Its fellow Soviet Bloc Dacia and Skoda brands still exist through the involvement of Western automakers, but they now have little to do with their closed market predecessors.

Innovation Is A Team Sport

There are no completely new ideas. All ideas build on other ideas. No single country has a monopoly. It makes no sense to go back to prehistoric understandings of the world in order to rediscover fire and reinvent the wheel over and over again. The larger the pool of ideas people get exposed to, the better the ideas they can come up with.

Some will say that others are just copying, but that is a cop-out. Otto, Diesel, Volta, Faraday, Newton… were not American. But it would be dishonest to say that a modern automobile is just copying them. People also said Harry A. Miller was just copying European engines when his company developed what would become the most successful racing engine in American history. But that misconstrues the progress of ideas building on other ideas and the hard work needed to realize the potential of those ideas.

It is easy to put one person on a pedestal as the key to innovation in the technology sector. It makes a good story. But the reality is that it takes a wide range of people with different capabilities and talents to make a technology succeed. The larger the potential talent and supply pool, the better.

Segregating teams by skin color didn’t make baseball better. Segregating technology teams by lines on a map doesn’t make those teams better either.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PXL_20260109_005851221.MP1_-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 22:59:46.757298

Today's Big Stories

1. Trump has promised cheaper oil. Texas’ economy could pay a price

After COVID-19 tanked oil prices, Texas’ oil and gas industry rebounded. By 2024, operators were drilling record amounts of oil. Each barrel sold for at least $70, bringing profits and momentum that enriched the state’s coffers, school districts and local government budgets with billions in tax revenue.

Now, President Donald Trump’s pledge to bring oil prices down to $50 a barrel could decimate that momentum, making trouble — even if temporarily — for the Lone Star State.

2. TxDOT rejects bid to keep rainbow, Black Lives Matter crosswalks in Dallas

Dallas is the latest Texas city to be denied an exemption request to keep pavement markings during the state’s recent push to ban politically-charged messaging from streets.

According to a report from the Dallas Morning News, the request was for 30 markings, including rainbow LBGTQ+ Pride, Black Lives Matter and other custom designs. This comes after Gov. Greg Abbott in October banned cities from displaying street markings that convey “social, political or ideological messages” or risk losing state funding.

3. Houston-based Francesca's reportedly closing all stores nationwide

Francesca’s, an apparel boutique chain that was founded in Houston, is planning to close all of its stores across the country, according to reports.

According to Women’s Wear Daily, the shopping mall chain began liquidating its inventory on Friday, a customer service representative told the outlet.

The “new world disorder” is reshaping global priorities, and renewable energy is at the heart of this transformation.","Global stability is fracturing. Economic realignments, geopolitical rivalries, and technological disruption are reshaping the international order. North America—long a pillar of global leadership—now faces pressures to make sustainable, strategic decisions. The clean energy transition is not just environmental—it’s geopolitical, economic, and technological.

Traditional energy markets have long underpinned global stability, but geopolitical shocks—from Middle East tensions to Europe’s reliance on Russian gas—underscore the need for energy resilience. The Trump administration has successfully issued swathes of executive orders and federal directives to support domestication of natural resource supply chains, while limiting reliance and relations with international markets.

Key legislative and executive restrictions that impact renewable energy:

In July 2025, Trump signed an executive order and “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” that terminated clean electricity production and investment tax credits for wind and solar projects, and directed federal agencies to eliminate preferential treatment for renewables compared to traditional energy sources

The Treasury Department was instructed to implement stricter eligibility rules for tax credits, requiring projects to show significant physical construction progress and limiting safe harbor provisions, making it much harder for developers to qualify

Enhanced Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) rules target supply chains connected to China, further complicating access to subsidies for solar and wind developers reliant on imported technologies

Tariffs have promoted increased domestic oil, gas, coal, and nuclear production, and onshoring of manufacturing, merging domestic and foreign policy

The headlines are overwhelming the wider narrative. Although incentives and support for clean energy technologies have been repealed, renewable energy offers North America a pathway to resilience.

“

Despite shifting geopolitical dynamics, renewable energy projects in North America remain active and robust in the near term. Although the long-term outlook is less certain, the current ecosystem—including insurance—continues to experience strong activity”

Andrew Rubin | Director, Tax Insurance Practice, Alternative Asset Insurance Solutions

How the One Big Beautiful Bill could accelerate pockets of growth for clean technologies

Pre- and post-the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) predictions for renewable generation index drops from 190 to 140 by 2035 . The speed of growth for renewable energy generation is limited under new regulations, but opportunities endure. “Despite shifting geopolitical dynamics, renewable energy projects in North America remain active and robust in the near term. Although the long-term outlook is less certain, the current ecosystem—including insurance—continues to experience strong activity”, Andrew Rubin, Director, Tax Insurance Practice, Alternative Asset Insurance Solutions.

Despite the loss of tax credits to solar and wind projects which signal that renewable energy in the U.S. is in a consolidation period, tax credits remain available to emerging renewable technologies.

“Tax credits are available for renewable natural gas, where an uptick in investment is making the technology a competitive opportunity for companies keen to diversify their energy mix”, Alex Forand, North America Renewable Energy Leader, Natural Resources. For business leaders, these opportunities are driving a rethink of procurement strategies and capital allocation. “Previously, the security of government backing gave companies opportunities to invest in clean technologies, but now, profitability is at the top of the agenda and investors and stakeholders are more cautious to spend capital on unknown technologies”, Andreea Merewitz, Managing Director, Resilience Practice, BDO.

Capital-heavy developers will have opportunities to acquire assets—such as wind and solar—that are now less profitable under the OBBBA. Although cutting tax credits could signal less room for innovation, renewable energy remains a way to anchor a strategic advantage. There’s scope for innovation, but the goal posts have moved. Business leaders will need to rethink and realign their strategies.

“As North America reduces reliance on imported oil and gas, renewable infrastructure becomes a strategic asset, particularly as the investment in data centers continues to increase exponentially. Investment in in grids and power will be non-negotiable, it’s inevitable”, Daisy McAndrew, freelance geopolitical and economic radio and TV presenter, reporter and writer.

The accelerator for electrification in North America: Data centers

Renewable energy is a technology race. Advances in battery storage and smart grids will define the next era of economic leadership. While China maintains its position as the renewable manufacturing major, adding over 212 GW of new solar and 51 GW of new wind capacity while the U.S. will add less than 100 GW combined, all while the U.S. is jostling to be the world leader in data centers.

By the numbers: The data center boom in the U.S.

Projections show the U.S. will continue to expand its capacity and market share, with electricity consumption by U.S. data centers set to more than double by 2030. The continued growth of data centers will need powering, suggesting the renewable energy agenda isn’t entirely off the cards.

The future of data centers: Beware the brain drain

The Trump administration’s approach to immigration could reduce the pool of workers available to support the ongoing growth of data centers. “AI isn’t just the tail that’s wagging the dog, it’s the dog. Technology companies are the wealth of the American economy. While data centers are primarily at risk of falling down the brain drain, natural resources companies will need to prepare for escalating demand.

Business leaders will need to bolster their workforce to prepare for the uptick in power demand. Will the tech center burst its bubble? Certainly, we’re poised for corrective measures, but how domestic and foreign policy will adapt, is something to watch”, Daisy McAndrew.

Looking ahead: Building certainty in the new world disorder

Political polarization complicates climate policy, but societal pressure for sustainability is intensifying. The “new world disorder” is reshaping global priorities, and renewable energy is at the heart of this transformation. For North American businesses, the green transition is not off the table. There are pockets of opportunity for emerging renewable technologies, particularly for power generation to support the growth of data centers. While geopolitical headwinds continue to blow, building resilience will be critical to withstand political and economic volatility. Risk management is at the core.

“Over the long term, tax insurance and renewable energy in the U.S. remain interconnected and resilient. Regulatory changes, statutory adjustments, and industry headwinds may pose challenges, but they are unlikely to halt investment, with tax insurance continuing to play a vital role” Andrew Rubin, Director, Tax Insurance Practice, Alternative Asset Insurance Solutions. Tax insurance covers losses from disallowed credits, penalties, interest, and legal costs, giving investors and developers confidence that expected tax benefits will materialize. By reducing counterparty risk and providing certainty, tax insurance has a role in facilitating project financing and supporting cash flow for renewable energy projects.

But more broadly, tax insurance can support the growing renewable energy sector through intricate partnership structures and evolving tax laws—a critical asset in risk managers’ toolkits in North America for the foreseeable future.

That reality makes one thing clear: grid planning matters more than ever.

Over the past year, state regulators have taken a series of important actions to modernize how the state’s large electric utilities forecast demand and plans to upgrade the grid. Taken together, these decisions move California away from reactive, worst-case planning and toward a smarter, more flexible approach that can support rapid electrification while protecting customers’ bills.

The work is not finished. But the direction is right – and now it is incumbent on the regulators and electric utilities to carry it through.

California is getting grid planning right – now we actually need to build it Share on X

Planning for electric demand that is actually coming

For years, the electric utilities have systematically understated future electricity demand and corresponding grid upgrade needs. That was not because electrification was not happening – it was because the antiquated rules only allowed utilities to plan for loads that were already firmly in hand. Everything else, including electrification projects still under development, was largely invisible to planners.

In December 2025, state regulators addressed this problem by allowing utilities to include pending electric demand in their forecasts – including customer electrification plans that are still being developed and credible, third-party electrification studies. The electric utilities can now plan for electric demand when supported by real-world data. This includes EV charging, building electrification, and other loads connecting to the distribution grid, rather than data centers and other large customers that connect to the higher-voltage transmission system.

In their action, regulators introduced a critical new concept: electrification hot spots. In areas in California where electrification of our buildings and transportation is clearly emerging, the electric utilities now have more discretion to proactively incorporate diverse data sources into their forecasts. That means fewer surprises, fewer last-minute upgrades, and better alignment between grid investments and customer needs. In effect, the regulators are directing the state’s electric utilities to plan for the future that is actually being built.

Moving beyond a single guess about the future

Just as important, California regulators are pushing the electric utilities to confront uncertainty head-on by directing them to adopt scenario-based load forecasting. Rather than anchoring grid plans to a single “best guess,” utilities must now evaluate at least three futures: low, mid and high load growth scenarios.

The electric utilities will pair this scenario planning with innovative decision-tree framework that guides how they should act under different outcomes – when to invest early, when to wait, and how to manage the uncertainty of their load forecasts. For example, California utilities plan for both high and low demand futures, so they can invest early when risks are high and hold back when demand may not actually happen.

This approach reflects a basic reality: overbuilding the grid is expensive but underbuilding it can be even more costly – missing opportunities to connect clean energy and locking in fossil dependence, emissions and reliability risks. Scenario planning, especially when combined with the new pending-loads framework, gives electric utilities a more disciplined way to strike that balance.

Integrating grid work to save money

Forecasting improvements alone are not enough. Execution matters just as much. Last month, the utilities filed a Commission-required proposal describing how they will better integrate capacity-driven grid upgrades with other distribution work. The concept is straightforward but powerful: when utilities are already replacing aging equipment or addressing safety needs, they should evaluate whether modestly upsizing that equipment today can avoid a second, more expensive project tomorrow.

For example, replacing a transformer at the end of its useful life without considering future load growth almost guarantees that ratepayers will pay twice – once now, and again when electrification demand materializes. This kind of integrated planning can reduce duplicative construction, lower costs and make better use of limited utility workforce resources. It also aligns closely with EDF-commissioned research from Black & Veatch showing that proactive grid planning is often the most cost-effective option.

While Environmental Defense Fund is not satisfied with the utilities’ initial proposal – and is actively engaging at the Commission to improve it – the CPUC’s underlying directive is well designed and worth supporting.

Electrification can lower bills if utilities plan for flexibility

In October 2025, Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric released draft studies examining how electrification will affect the electric grid – and how much electric demand flexibility can change the outcome. While this work will continue into 2026, the early results are striking.

PG&E’s analysis finds that while enabling electrification will require tens of billions of dollars in distribution investments through 2040, that same electrification could also save customers up to 25% by putting downward pressure on electric rates by improving system utilization. The takeaway is clear: electrification does not have to result in runaway costs to the customer’s electric bill.

When electric utilities actively plan for flexible demand – including managed EV charging, building electrification paired with demand response, and distributed energy resources – the grid can be used more efficiently, spreading the fixed costs of grid investments over more kilowatt-hours, and lowering costs for all ratepayers.

Turning planning into practice

None of these reforms will matter if they remain on paper. California’s regulators have laid out a thoughtful, forward-looking framework for electric demand forecasting and grid planning – one that supports electrification, improves affordability, and manages uncertainty instead of ignoring it. Now the hard(er) work begins.

The electric utilities must implement these tools rigorously and transparently.",https://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/wp-content/blogs.dir/38/files//CA-blog.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 00:58:45.618969

The plants would supply electricity to these growing industrial areas, without requiring miles of new transmission lines to deliver the power.

PUD Commissioners received the update at their first workshop of the year.

PUD Staff is focusing on generation technologies that could eventually be converted from natural gas, which produces a relatively small amount of carbon, to a non-carbon-generating fuel, such as hydrogen, to comply with state’s 2045 deadline to remove carbon-producing fuels from the state’s energy supply.

Additional analysis is underway to determine if an investment in an out-of-state natural gas plant, in a state that doesn’t have emissions-free policies, could supply power at a lower cost to Grant PUD customers.

In addition to natural gas generation, staff continues to research investments in battery energy storage systems, geothermal and small modular nuclear reactors to supplement Grant PUD’s portfolio of hydropower, solar and wind energy.

Work also continues to integrate the utility into a new western energy market -- the Southwest Power Pool’s “Markets +” -– that would help Grant PUD get the most value from the surplus power it sells beyond the county’s needs.

Commissioners also reviewed public input received on the proposed 2026 rate package during their workshop on Jan. 13.

Commissioners asked the public for their comments on a proposed increase of 3.5% for residential, general service/small business, and ag customers (core customers). A 9.5% increase is proposed for Tier 1 and Tier 2 (noncore) customers.

The rate adjustment is intended to balance affordability for core customers while ensuring financial stability in a high-inflation environment.

Grant PUD gathered feedback through multiple channels including a Dec. 9 public hearing, Grant PUD's website and social media.

For cattlemen who have access to cropland, winter annuals are a great way to extend the grazing season.
Planning is key for successful grazing at the farm that is located about 60 miles south of the Canadian border.
“We use both unrolling hay and bale grazing in the winter.” A lot of bedding is also provided for the cattle in the pastures.
“The next winter we had snow so deep that we had a terrible time bale grazing,” she said.","RALEIGH, N.C. — Managing an adaptive grazing management system is a thinking person’s game.

“You have to think to do this,” said Johnny Rogers, coordinator of the Amazing Grazing Program at North Carolina State University, during a webinar organized by the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association.

“Carrying capacity is the maximum stocking rate that our land will support to get good performance out of our animals and maintain that grazing resource, good soil health and good water cycle,” said Rogers, who owns Rogers Cattle Company in Roxboro in north-central North Carolina.

Stocking rate is the number of animals that cattlemen put on their land.

“I find it beneficial to stock our land slightly below the carrying capacity because things happen,” Rogers said. “The challenge with carrying capacity is that it changes every couple of weeks.”

Part of finding the correct stocking rate, he said, is stocking the land with the most appropriate beef cattle enterprise.

“Make sure you have the right class and type of cattle that fits your operation and lifestyle,” said Rogers, who owns a Red Angus seedstock herd.

Cattlemen can use a variety of measures to find functional cows.

“You can look at average weaning weight which will give you a picture of milking ability and growth rate of calves,” Rogers said. “Pounds of wean per cow exposed is kind of the gold standard and it pulls in some of the reproductive performance of the cows.”

Another measurement is pounds of calf weaned per pound of female exposed.

“Not every size and not every cow weans the same weight of calves, so this ties in a little bit of efficiency,” Rogers said.

At North Carolina State, researchers weighed calves at weaning and calculated the adjusted 205-day weight and determined the percentage of the cow’s body weight that she weaned in her calf.

“As the cows get bigger, they wean a lower percentage of their body weight,” said Rogers about the study that included seven to eight herds and about 200 cows.

The average cow in the survey weighed 1,380 pounds.

“We talk about 1,200-pound cows, but there is a higher percentage of cows that weigh over 1,400 pounds than under 1,300 pounds in this survey,” Rogers said. “So, know how big your cows are because that affects your stocking rate that you are trying to marry with the carrying capacity.”

In North Carolina, cattlemen are challenged with mud in the winter.

“Our ground can be frozen, but it does not stay frozen like it does in many parts of the U.S.,” the researcher said.

One way to address this, Rogers said, is to unroll hay in the pasture.

“I think that spreads out the impact of the cattle, and to me the hay that is not eaten, there is carbon added back to your farm, so it is not really wasted,” he said.

“I will acknowledge that when it is raining a lot and you unroll hay, especially with younger cattle, they tend to want to just walk through the hay and look for something better,” the cattleman said. “But a brood cow will stop and start eating.”

Bale grazing is an option, where cattlemen place bales in the pasture weeks or maybe months ahead of winter.

“When you are grazing the cattle, you put up a temporary electric fence and as the cows eat the hay, you move the poly wire,” Rogers said.

“One of the advantages is that instead of taking round bales out every day to unroll, you place those ahead of time,” he said. “So, you don’t have the equipment traffic on your fields on a daily basis.”

Rogers’ favorite way to extend the grazing season is stockpiled forage.

“You can stockpile any type of forage, but tall fescue is very special because it is a tough grass that takes the freezing and thawing and holds its quality through the winter,” he said.

For cattlemen who have access to cropland, winter annuals are a great way to extend the grazing season.

“Those are very high-quality crops and the cattle will eat them pretty quick,” Rogers said. “We like to use temporary fence to get the most out of that resource.

“For every $1 that the cow consumes in her mouth, she will deposit about 85 cents of that somewhere on your farm,” he said. “So, the more we can keep the cattle out on the land and grazing, that helps the nutrient distribution on our farms.”

Little Timber Farm

Rachel Gray owns Little Timber Farm near Blackduck in northern Minnesota.

“We are fifth generation here and we started as a dairy farm,” said Gray during the webinar. “My mom and dad were dairy farmers until the early 2000s when they transitioned to beef.”

When Gray took over the operation in 2012, the cow/calf herd included about 180 head of cattle.

“Now we rotationally graze about 500 heifers and a few cow/calf pairs that belong to my son,” she said. “We have small cattle feedlot and we sell some freezer beef.”

In the winter, the Gray family custom calve for some of their customers that purchase heifers from Little Timber Farm.

“We calve about 150 heifers per year, so we bump up to about 700 head in the winter,” the cattlewoman said.

Planning is key for successful grazing at the farm that is located about 60 miles south of the Canadian border.

“If you are going to keep cattle out on pasture in the winter, you have to have a plan and we find a good plan starts in the summer,” Gray said.

“When we develop a winter plan, we find areas that need nutrients and monitor those pastures throughout the summer,” she said. “We use both unrolling hay and bale grazing in the winter.”

A lot of bedding is also provided for the cattle in the pastures.

“We get a lot of wind and we also get very cold,” the cattlewoman said. “November is great, December is nice and in January we are often dipping into 20 to 25 degrees below zero nights, so we want to make sure these cattle are nicely bedded.”

Gray uses portable windbreaks and the bedding pack is placed in front of them.

“We build the bedding pack throughout the winter, so the cattle always know to go to that area,” she explained.

“When we are done in the field for the winter, we pile the bedding pack and let it compost down,” she said. “We spread that out and sometimes we will put that on our corn ground.”

Making grazing plans is important, Gray said, and she always has a Plan B.

“The summer of 2021, we were burning up because it was the driest summer on record,” she recalled. “We had no hay crop, so we had some cake brought in.”

That provided enough feed until Aug. 20, when Gray shipped 600 head of her cattle six hours south so they could stay fed and Little Timber Farm could stay in business.

“That was the Plan B for that year,” she noted.

“The next winter we had snow so deep that we had a terrible time bale grazing,” she said. “All we could do was take equipment out and move snow, so we were breaking trail for most of the winter so the cattle could get to water.”

Gray uses the Pasture Map app daily as a planning tool for her cattle operation.

“I have our permanent waterers marked, it shows where the cattle are right now and I can also add where the hay bales are placed,” she said. “It is really nice because it keeps track of how many days the cattle have been out of a pasture.”",https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/resizer/nzsdRV5BXeBNJKjXmNNnRZ7Qafc=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70):focal(435x472:445x482)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/QGQJUSULMZBBJBOQQIOWFIPYFQ.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 19:01:02.672920

It's not necessarily a question of full Chinese production in Canada or not.
The investment potential in Canada comes as Chinese firms have increasingly been building capacity outside of their home market.
Speaking in Doha, Qatar, on the weekend, Carney said there is interest in Chinese companies producing “affordable” electric vehicles in Canada.
Fiorani said that while investment in Canada is possible, it's unlikely Chinese firms would partner with the Detroit Three, as they're all unionized and Chinese producers will be looking to be union-free.","TORONTO — The trade deal between Canada and China has experts saying it could lead to Chinese electric vehicle firms producing vehicles in Canada, but much depends on the trade talks ahead with the United States.

Critics including Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Unifor leader Lana Payne panned the deal as an attack on workers and Canadian manufacturing, while Prime Minister Mark Carney said the government has already spoken with Chinese companies interested in investing in Canada.

The deal has the federal government lowering tariffs to 6.1 per cent from 100 per cent on 49,000 Chinese EVs a year, with a ramp-up to 70,000 within five years, while China has agreed to reduce tariffs on a range of Canadian goods.

It comes as Chinese manufacturers are already adapting globally to trade restrictions and are moving toward local production where they sell, said automotive consultant Sam Fiorani in an interview.

""Once they get a foothold in Canada, the idea that they could build plants locally, the odds of that jump dramatically.""

Fiorani, vice-president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, said Chinese firms need to test the waters first, but once they establish a brand, they look to invest where they sell.

""Build locally is the long-term plan for any Chinese automaker.""

China has been ramping up exports, estimated at around 6.5 million units lasts year, as its domestic industry has capacity to produce millions of more vehicles than it can sell locally, but firms have still been investing heavily abroad, said a report out last November from S&P Global Mobility.

“Along with avoiding tariffs and shipping costs, building close to where you sell improves market potential inherently,"" said S&P analyst Abby Chun Tu in the report.

""In most cases, consumers are more open to automakers who invest locally, regardless of where a brand’s home market is.""

However the chances Chinses firms will set up shop in Canada with out guaranteed access to the U.S. market is unrealistic, said Andrew King, managing partner of DesRosiers Automotive Consultants Inc.

""The Canadian market itself is just too small to justify an assembly plant – which is why the auto industry established an efficient North American assembly system – a system that the current U.S. administration seems determined to destroy,"" he said by email.

It's not necessarily a question of full Chinese production in Canada or not.

Chinese firms could do a less costly modular production, putting together pre-assembled pieces in Canada, if access to the U.S. becomes unlikely, said Ryan Robinson, automotive research lead at Deloitte Canada, but some form of investment is possible.

""I think there's a potential for it, for sure,"" said Robinson.

There's certainly demand potential on the consumer side as buyers confront the reality of current vehicle prices, he said, while noting the policy could also help Canada get closer to emission reduction goals.

The investment potential in Canada comes as Chinese firms have increasingly been building capacity outside of their home market. Chinese EV producers have built at least 15 facilities across Southeast and Central Asia since 2022, the S&P report noted, including in countries like Malaysia that has a vehicle market less than half the size of Canada's.

The wave of investments come as Chinese firms look to expand from an already saturated domestic market, leading to them collectively spend more abroad than at home in 2024 for the first time, according to a report out last year from the Rhodium Group.

Europe has also seen a jump in manufacturing capacity with Chinese giant BYD building plants in Hungary and Turkey, while Chery has entered a joint venture with Spanish automaker Ebro-EV Motors.

Stellantis, meanwhile, has partnered with Leapmotor for the Chinese to firm build its vehicles at Stellantis' Poland plant, and was set to start producing in Malaysia at Stellantis's Gurun facility at the end of 2025, the report noted.

Meanwhile, the future of the Stellantis plant in Brampton, Ont., remains an open question after the automaker moved production slated for it to the U.S. last year.

The Canadian government said in announcing the deal with China that it expects within three years it will ""drive considerable new Chinese joint-venture investment in Canada,"" creating new auto manufacturing career for Canadian workers.

TD chief economist Beata Caranci said in a report last September that Chinese EV production in Canada is unlikely given concerns about market access to the U.S., but that there are still areas for partnership.

""Given the EV technology gaps that remain between China and other nations and China’s desire to expand globally, some form of partnership could aid Canada in improving its EV ecosystem,"" she said in the report.

Speaking in Doha, Qatar, on the weekend, Carney said there is interest in Chinese companies producing “affordable” electric vehicles in Canada.

“We’ve had direct conversations directly from the Chinese companies ... with explicit interest and intention to partner with Canadian companies.""

Ford said it was terrible deal for the auto sector and a miscalculated decision by the Prime Minister, while Unifor national president Lana Payne said it was a self-inflicted wound to an already injured Canadian auto industry.

Fiorani said that while investment in Canada is possible, it's unlikely Chinese firms would partner with the Detroit Three, as they're all unionized and Chinese producers will be looking to be union-free.

He said the small volume of low-tariff vehicles will mean producers will, however, want to find some way to invest in Canada if they want to grow in the market.

""It should not take very long for some of those brands to become accepted in the Canadian market, and that will lead to local production of those vehicles as the manufacturers want to expand beyond the current limits.""

With the final sales numbers tallied for 2025, more than 2.5 million electric vehicles have been sold in the state since 2012, according to data released Tuesday by the California Energy Commission.

“We invested in this future when others said it was impossible,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement.

Newsom highlighted the number — 2,551,121 to be exact — during his appearance Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

For the past two decades, California has led the nation in electric vehicle sales. The state has provided rebates, tax credits and other incentives as part of its efforts to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases.

As technology has improved, allowing much farther battery range — with many models able to travel more than 300 miles when fully charged — EV sales now make up 22.9% of all new car sales in California. Santa Clara County has the highest rate in the state, with 41.1% of all new vehicles sold being electric in 2025.

But electric vehicles face major headwinds. President Donald Trump has reversed or blocked many of the federal incentives put in place by former President Joe Biden.

This past year, Trump and Republicans in Congress eliminated the federal tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of new electric vehicles. They let a law expire that allowed states to permit solo EV drivers in carpool lanes on federally funded highways, ending that perk nationwide.

And in June, Trump signed a resolution blocking California’s first-in-the-nation regulations banning the sale of new gasoline-powered passenger vehicles by 2035, which Newsom had put in place in 2020.

Trump held a White House ceremony June 12, saying California’s rules limited consumer choice. He revoked federal permission for the ban, called a “waiver,” that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had given to the state when Biden was in office.

“We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating the California electric vehicle mandate once and for all,” Trump said. “They said it couldn’t be done. It’s had us tied in knots for years. They passed these crazy rules.”

Republicans said California’s rules were overly broad and would effectively set a national standard because the state is the largest car market in the United States and, under the Clean Air Act, other states are allowed to copy its rules.

Environmental groups and Democratic leaders said Trump’s rollbacks will lead to more air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and health problems for Californian residents.

Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit over the issue minutes after Trump acted. California was joined by 10 other states — Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. The lawsuit is pending.

In the months since, several large automakers have pulled back on some EV models. In December, Ford announced it would cease production of its all-electric F-150 pickup truck, and would focus instead on hybrid vehicles and a new line of smaller, cheaper EVs.

“When the market really changed over the last couple of months, that was really the impetus for us to make the call,” Ford CEO Jim Farley told Reuters in an interview.

In California, 408,731 EVs sold in 2025. That’s double the number from 2022, but down 8% from 2024, when 443,374 sold.

Sales surged in the weeks before Sept. 30, when the federal tax credits expired, and then dropped off in October, November, and December.

Even though two of the top three highest-selling vehicles of all types in California last year were the Tesla Model Y and the Model 3, the other being the gas-powered Toyota Camry, Tesla has seen some softening of sales in the state. Some residents of the blue state, angry that Tesla CEO Elon Musk contributed $250 million to Trump’s re-election campaign and led an effort called DOGE to reduce federal staffing through firings and early retirements, have resisted buying Teslas, put stickers on the vehicles denouncing Musk, or purchased other EVs, like Hyundais, Hondas or Rivians instead.

The Trump administration’s fight over electric vehicle rules stands as one of the major environmental clashes between his administration and California during the first year of his second term, along with Trump’s proposal to allow new offshore oil drilling along the state’s coastline.

Trump similarly tried to curb California’s electric vehicle rules and allow new offshore oil drilling in his first term from 2017 to 2021. But California sued in both cases. The lawsuits were pending when Biden took office, and he reversed Trump’s positions.

On Tuesday, Newsom, who is considering a run for president in 2028, cast Trump’s resistance to electric vehicles as putting the United States at a competitive disadvantage in a world where Europe, Japan, Canada, China, and other countries have passed similar laws to encourage the sale of electric vehicles, reduce oil consumption and phase out the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035 or 2040.

“While Washington now cedes the global clean vehicle market to China, California is ensuring American workers and manufacturers can compete and win in the industries that will define this century,” Newsom said.

Two weeks ago, Newsom announced in his state budget proposal that he would allocate $200 million to a new electric vehicle rebate program. Details, including how much motorists will receive, which cars are eligible and what income limits may apply, have not yet been finalized.

“California isn’t slowing down, we’re still leading the pack,” said California Air Resources Board Chair Lauren Sanchez. “It’s not just about clean air, it’s smart economic policy.”",https://www.siliconvalley.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/LDN-L-TESLA-DINER-0725-DC-4.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2026-01-20 21:58:53.250940

Lately, President Trump has been talking about making sure that AI data centers pay their fair share for electricity costs.","On the campaign trail, President Trump promised to cut Americans' energy bills in half — cheaper gasoline, cheaper electricity. He also said he'd ""unleash"" American energy production, often repeating the catchphrase ""Drill, baby, drill.""

One year in, the price of gasoline is down about 10%. But the U.S. oil industry is definitely not drilling, baby, drilling. The price of oil is just too low to justify more of it — although within the last year, companies have won major lobbying victories that soothe that sting. Meanwhile, electricity costs are rising and expected to rise more.

Cheap gasoline: check

The U.S. benchmark price for oil is down about 20% from where it was a year ago, and the average retail gasoline price — the price drivers pay at the pump — is down nearly 10%.

Now, presidents — whoever they are — do not get to decide the price of gasoline. The price of crude oil is the biggest factor, and crude prices are set in a complex global marketplace that responds to a number of factors.

In the past year, cheaper crude has been largely driven by a global oversupply of oil, which in turn was largely driven by a series of decisions by the oil cartel OPEC+. The cartel repeatedly put more barrels on the market, depressing global prices but seizing more market share for its members.

However, Dan Pickering, the chief investment officer at Pickering Energy Partners, says the president also put significant pressure on OPEC to bring down global crude prices. As a result, he gives Trump partial credit for today's low prices.

""I think if we look at oil down 20% in 2025, that you have to say that political dynamics drove at least half of that,"" he says. ""And as we go into 2026, I think those dynamics will still be at play.""

Moving forward, the president's push to produce more oil from Venezuela could also help keep global crude prices lower for longer — if he persuades companies to invest.

Analysts with the gas prices app GasBuddy found that U.S. households spent, on average, $177 less on gasoline in 2025 than 2024, thanks to lower prices, and they predict that expenditures will continue to fall in 2026, saving Americans a collective $11 billion next year.

Drill, baby, drill? Not so much.

Those lower oil prices are exactly why ""Drill, baby, drill"" didn't happen.

The number of active drilling rigs in the U.S., the largest oil producer in the world, has dropped by more than 6% year-over-year, at last count. That means fewer new wells are being drilled. And that's true even as the Trump administration has made it easier for companies to start new projects, including by making more federal lands and waters available for leases.

With U.S. oil prices under $60 a barrel and the global market generally oversupplied with crude, it's just not profitable for companies to drill a bunch of new wells right now.

The Trump administration has many close allies in the U.S. oil industry. But this is a perennial point of disagreement between them: The president loves cheap oil, while companies would prefer prices to be higher than they are today.

This disagreement was actually called out by Secretary of Energy Chris Wright — a former fracking executive. Speaking to CBS News' Face the Nation this month, he called President Trump ""no helper to the oil and gas industry"" because ""he's driven down the price of oil.""

It's true that many U.S. oil workers wince every time the president talks about $50 crude or pushes for more production from OPEC. But it's not quite fair to call the administration ""no helper.""

The American Petroleum Institute, or API, is the most powerful lobbying arm of the U.S. oil and gas industry. Before Trump was reelected, the group laid out a dozen different policy priorities — a wish list. Tax policy changes that would help oil companies; more access to drilling in the Gulf; a boost in exports of liquefied natural gas; the repeal of requirements for cleaner and more efficient cars, which would have pushed down oil demand over time; the elimination of a fee for releasing planet-warming methane.

""By our count, every single one of them was completed in 2025, with the exception of legislative permitting reform,"" Mike Sommers, the president and CEO of API, said on a recent call with reporters. (""Permitting reform"" refers to a series of changes to federal laws that would make it easier for companies to build things like pipelines and other large projects that often face local opposition. It's been a hot topic in Congress for years.)

Sommers says U.S. companies can weather low oil prices in the short term and make business decisions with an eye toward the future.

And in the long term, the administration's policy changes support higher oil demand for years to come by doing things like slowing down the shift toward electric vehicles, while also cutting the costs of oil production, including by easing environmental rules.

Electricity costs are rising

Electricity prices have been increasing for years now, and 2025 was more of the same.

""Across most states and in most markets, what we see is that prices have gone up,"" says Helen Kou, an analyst with BloombergNEF.

Based on trends in wholesale power markets — where your local electric company buys its power, an expense they pass on to you — that's likely to continue. Kou said that in New York and New England, wholesale prices are up more than 60%, and in the mid-Atlantic they're up 45%.

""Almost 1 in 3 households, or over 80 million Americans, are struggling to pay their utility bills,"" says Charles Hua, who runs Powerlines, a national energy consumer education nonprofit that encourages people to get more involved in their public utility commissions.

Why are costs going up? Hua points to three primary reasons: an aging power grid, the cost of natural disasters, and higher fuel costs, especially natural gas.

Kou says that for 2025, natural gas prices were the clear driver of increases. While oil and gasoline are cheap, natural gas — which is used for home heating and power plants — has gone up more than 50% from last year's annual average. U.S. exports of natural gas have increased (one of API's requests), and sending more natural gas overseas means less is available domestically.

Natural gas prices have been up and down over the past few years. They spiked in 2022, after Russia invaded Ukraine. And they were unusually cheap in 2024 before rising again in 2025. While they're far from record highs, the increase has been enough to significantly shift electricity markets.

These causes are complex and date back years before Trump's return to office. But experts say the Trump administration's electricity policy has not focused on lowering natural gas costs, improving the grid or mitigating the effects of natural disasters. Instead, it has aligned with his goal of reversing Biden-era climate policies. The White House has ordered coal-powered power plants to stay open for longer. Those power plants are typically expensive to operate, raising concerns about prices. Kou says keeping them online could hypothetically help meet rising demand, but only if those plants are located where demand is growing.

The administration is also investing in nuclear power — that, too, could potentially help with costs, but only in the long term, Kou says, because nuclear plants take so long to approve and build.

Some of the administration's moves could actually increase electricity bills in the future.

Large solar and wind projects provide more cost-competitive energy than natural gas, nuclear and coal projects, according to financial services firm Lazard. But the Trump administration has ended federal tax credits for solar and wind projects early, and canceled more than $13 billion in funds for green energy projects

Trump has also said he won't permit any new wind projects, and the administration has attempted to stop offshore wind projects that are already under construction, leading to court battles. That's been criticized not just by renewable energy advocates, but by many business groups, because it creates uncertainty and discourages investments in projects that could be supplying more energy into the grid.

""As a general matter, the thing that you can do that most clearly helps reduce prices is to remove barriers to new energy investment,"" says James Coleman, a nonresident senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""And the thing that basically just increases prices is increasing uncertainty or barriers to energy.""

The administration is also rolling back efficiency standards for appliances. Those standards actually cut consumer bills by reducing energy use, Hua notes.

Meanwhile, some things that could meaningfully cut costs have simply not been prioritized by this administration. ""There are solutions that are available today that can be put on the grid that would meaningfully resolve a lot of these solutions,"" Hua says, pointing to technologies that allow more power to be moved on the existing grid, or better match supply and demand. ""It doesn't solve everything, but it provides some immediate relief … and that just has not been as much of a focus"" for the Trump administration, he says.

Lately, President Trump has been talking about making sure that AI data centers pay their fair share for electricity costs. Hua says there is a genuine opportunity to cut energy bills for ordinary Americans as data center demand for electricity goes up, depending on how costs are spread out.

But for now, the Trump administration's pledge to cut utility bills remains an unmet promise.

“The Toxic Substances Control Act is the country’s bedrock chemical safety law, and it keeps dangerous chemicals out of our homes, workplaces and communities.
Americans don’t want potentially toxic chemicals fast-tracked into their lives,” said Slaney.
The discussion draft would make sweeping changes to the Toxic Substances Control Act that threaten the public’s health.
This would severely undermine EPA’s ability to protect Americans from the worst toxic chemicals already in use, like cancer-causing formaldehyde and vinyl chloride.","The Toxic Substances Control Act – the primary U.S. chemical safety law – gives the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the authority and responsibility to review chemicals for safety, both before and after they enter the market. The law was significantly strengthened in 2016 when Congress passed a bipartisan overhaul of the law. In managing the safety of chemicals, the Toxic Substances Control Act requires EPA to take steps to protect the people most at risk from exposure to toxic chemicals, like children, pregnant women, workers and people living near chemical facilities.

American families should be able to trust that the chemicals in their everyday products have been assessed for safety and won’t cause them serious health problems.

New polling from EDF shows overwhelming support across party lines for the Toxic Substances Control Act. The law is universally popular, with more than four-in-five (82%) favoring it. That support is consistent regardless of gender, race, age, education level or party affiliation.

Despite this popularity, this week, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives introduced a discussion draft bill that would fundamentally dismantle the core responsibility for EPA to ensure the safety of chemicals in our economy and everyday lives.

“The Toxic Substances Control Act is the country’s bedrock chemical safety law, and it keeps dangerous chemicals out of our homes, workplaces and communities. Americans don’t want potentially toxic chemicals fast-tracked into their lives,” said Slaney.

The discussion draft would make sweeping changes to the Toxic Substances Control Act that threaten the public’s health.

No more scientific process for new chemicals

The proposal to reform the Toxic Substances Control Act would remove the requirement for EPA to follow an independent, scientific process to determine if a chemical can be used safely before it can come onto the market.

In addition to eliminating this requirement, the bill would proactively invite industry to participate in reviewing their own products. This would dramatically undermine EPA’s responsibility and authority to protect Americans from the most toxic chemicals and to adhere to a scientifically robust, independent process that Americans can trust.

Sets up a rubber stamp approval process for new chemicals

Many dangerous chemicals, including many PFAS, or “forever chemicals,” entered the market before a bipartisan Congress strengthened the law in 2016. The current proposal would bring back this process that allowed forever chemicals into the market by flipping the safety standard on its head.

Instead of requiring EPA to prove a chemical doesn’t pose an unreasonable risk as is required under the current law, the proposal makes it EPA’s responsibility to prove that a chemical would likely pose an unreasonable risk. This small distinction would have major impacts – it would shift the burden of proof away from safety, effectively turning EPA’s safety review into a rubber stamp for any chemical the industry wants to bring to market.

Blanket approvals for most uses

In this proposal, once a chemical is rubber stamped for one use, it could more easily be used in additional unapproved ways. In practice, this could lead to a chemical that was approved for use in industrial settings – with proper worker protections in place – potentially being used in homes, schools and daycares.

Puts industry profits over our health

Republicans’ proposal would severely weaken EPA’s ability to regulate existing chemicals that we know are toxic. The Republicans’ proposed requirement that EPA prove a chemical is likely to pose an unreasonable risk to public health is intended to set a nearly unreachable standard for addressing the risks from dangerous chemicals. The discussion draft bill also diminishes what EPA can consider harmful in the first place when evaluating toxic chemicals, requiring EPA to apply a vague and difficult standard of proof, making it harder to regulate toxic chemicals. It minimizes the estimates of the risks to those living near chemical plants, workers, children and pregnant people by failing to consider their full chemical exposure.

This proposal would also limit the tools EPA can use to eliminate unreasonable risks, putting industry profits ahead of people’s health. This would severely undermine EPA’s ability to protect Americans from the worst toxic chemicals already in use, like cancer-causing formaldehyde and vinyl chloride. These chemicals have long devastated the health of workers and communities on the fenceline of industrial facilities.

The bill also allows the chemical industry and manufacturers to delay for months or years the regulation of existing toxic chemicals by challenging in court any scientific finding by EPA that a chemical is harmful. The proposed process changes would prevent EPA from taking actions to reduce the risks to consumers until after the industry litigation is over.

Limits the information that can be required on dangerous chemicals

The proposal would make it significantly more difficult to produce key information on the hazards of chemicals, how people are exposed to them, and how they harm the environment. It even prohibits EPA from requiring testing for whole groups of chemicals, including highly toxic chemicals. This information is key to properly characterizing the risks we face from groups of toxic chemicals, such as PFAS or “forever chemicals.”

Hazardous loophole

This proposal creates a loophole for so-called advanced or chemical recycling – essentially the burning of plastic waste. It would allow harmful products produced through this process to be considered “equivalent” to chemicals already on the market without undergoing a safety review. Despite the fact that the products are contaminated with plastic’s toxic additives and harmful byproducts such as dioxins, these false equivalents would be rubberstamped as safe.

Why now?

The chemicals industry and manufacturers have advocated for most of the proposals in this bill, and according to news reports EPA “keeps adding former industry lobbyists to the office that manages TSCA.” The Trump EPA has made moves to roll back numerous essential Toxic Substances Control Act protections against toxic chemicals, including altering the way the agency evaluates chemical risk and lowballing the risks from cancer-causing formaldehyde.",https://blogs.edf.org/health/wp-content/blogs.dir/11/files//getty-image-room-TSCA-chemicals.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 17:59:48.034180

Trump’s edicts, signed in March and August, cited a seldom-used provision of the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act to exclude most federal agencies from federal sector labor law under the auspices of national security. A federal judge in California in June issued a preliminary injunction blocking the orders’ implementation, but a three-judge panel on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed that decision last summer, finding that the lower court did not adequately consider whether the president would have taken the same action against labor organizations absent their various legal challenges against the president’s personnel policies.”

Labor advocates and businesses had warned of devastating consequences after the government moved to eliminate most of NIOSH’s staff last year.”

U.S. Teachers Union Says It Is Leaving X Over Sexualized AI Images of Children: “The American Federation of Teachers says it is leaving X, citing the social media site's creation and dissemination of ‘sickening’ images of children in various states of undress. In an interview with Reuters, AFT President Randi Weingarten said that the site had already been degraded by extremists and trolls since Elon Musk's 2022 takeover, before which the platform was known as Twitter. But the recent proliferation of nonconsensual images of women and children in bikinis or underwear generated by X's artificial intelligence chatbot, Grok, had made the site unusable, she said.”

Maine Med Nurses Ratify Union Contract with 21% Pay Increase, Workplace Protections: “Nurses at MaineHealth Maine Medical Center in Portland recently ratified a new contract that includes a 21% pay increase over three years and measures to guard against workplace violence. The contract, which runs through the end of 2028, is the second contract for nurses at the state’s largest hospital since they voted in 2021 to join the Maine State Nurses Association and National Nurses Organizing Committee. Nurses at the hospital, MMC nurses, signed their first contract in September 2022 and secured the latest contract after four months of bargaining.”

Streetcar Operators Finalize First Union Contract: “After successfully unionizing in 2024, streetcar workers are close to finalizing a contract. In February 2024, more than two dozen workers who operate and maintain the city of Milwaukee’s streetcar, called The Hop, organized a union with the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 998 (ATU), which also represents Milwaukee County Transit System (MCTS) workers.”

How Vets in Labor Have Joined the Fight Against Trump: “The U.S. is home to 17 million military veterans. About 1.3 million of them currently work in union jobs, with women and people of color making up the fastest-growing cohorts. Veterans are more likely to join a union than non-veterans, according to the AFL-CIO. In half a dozen states, 25% or more of all actively employed veterans belong to unions. In the heyday of industrial unionism in the decades following World War II, hundreds of thousands of former soldiers could be found on the front lines of labor struggles in auto, steel, meatpacking, electrical equipment manufacturing, mining, trucking, and the telephone industry. Many World War II vets became militant stewards, local union officers, and, in some cases, well-known union reformers in the United Mine Workers and Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers.”

Springfield's 3M Workers Vote to Unionize Under United Steelworkers: “Springfield's 3M plant has been a major employer in the city since 1967. Now, the plant's 370 employees will be represented by a union following a successful organization effort. On December 20, workers elected to be represented by the United Steelworkers union, the nation's largest industrial labor union, joining a coalition of employees at other 3M plants across the country in seeking union representation. According to the National Labor Relations Board election results, there were 370 eligible voters, though 332 ballots were counted. Out of those, 233 votes were cast for the labor union and 99 against.”

Kaldi’s Coffee Workers Vote to Form Union, Accuse St. Louis Chain of Union-Busting: “Workers at Kaldi’s Skinker Boulevard location appear headed to unionization. On Friday, workers at the St. Louis specialty coffee chain location voted 7-2 in favor of unionization with the National Labor Relations Board. The results are not yet certified, however, and the union is challenging multiple ballots that it said were from employees who shouldn’t have been eligible to vote. The NLRB and Unite Here Local 74 are accusing Kaldi's of anti-union actions, including bringing in new or transferred employees in order to sway the outcome of the vote.”

Graduate Student Workers Secure First Contract with University of Maine System: “After more than 700 days of negotiations, the University of Maine System reached a tentative agreement with the graduate student workers union for its first-ever contract. ‘It took lot of organizing power for years. Hundreds of grad workers came together for each of the issues, and we fought really hard,’ Andrea Tirrell, a bargaining committee member for the University of Maine Graduate Workers Union, said.”

Science News Media Guild Ratifies First Contract, Securing Major Gains in Pay and Leave: “85% of the 27 members in the Science News Media Guild, workers who publish Science News and Science News Explores, have voted to ratify their first collective bargaining agreement. The historic contract establishes increases in pay, including cost of living raises and equity raises, sick and parental leave and importantly, codifes just-cause protections. The union launched on November 14, 2023, after more than 80% of non-management employees voted to unionize with the Washington-Baltimore News Guild. The ratification follows 625 days of negotiating with the Society for Science, which included a successful 24-hour walkout on November 5, 2025.”

SAG-AFTRA Leaders Sean Astin and Duncan Crabtree-Ireland on Their Negotiating Approach, Disney-Open AI Deal, Chance of Longer Contract Term & More: “The Hollywood labor landscape will have different contours this year as above-the-line guilds try to reach deals with the studios and streamers and avoid a repeat of the damaging strikes of 2023. For one thing, SAG-AFTRA will be the first union to negotiate, taking the spot normally occupied by the Directors Guild. SAG-AFTRA President Sean Astin and Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the union’s national executive director and chief negotiator, have confidence that their early start (talks kick off February 9) will be a difference-maker. The current contract won’t expire until June 30. ‘Part of the reason we wanted to go first is that we wanted to be able to have the time we feel is necessary,’ Astin told Deadline in an interview during CES in Las Vegas. ‘We appreciate that [AMPTP members] are willing to engage early in order to properly examine each item.’”",https://aflcio.org/sites/default/files/2026-01/working-people-weekly-list.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 17:59:31.279846

EPA’s proposal seeks to limit the scope of state-issued water quality certifications (WQCs) under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) to water quality impacts associated with discharges authorized by federal agency actions. The Proposed Rule also addresses concerns raised by applicants for federal licenses and permits (including for hydroelectric projects, natural gas pipelines, and other energy and infrastructure projects) that certain states have overstepped their Section 401 authority to impose onerous terms and conditions unrelated to water quality and artificially extended the statutory time limits for issuing WQCs.

CWA Section 401 requires any applicant for a federal license or permit that may result in any discharge to waters of the United States (WOTUS) to obtain a state certification that “any such discharge will comply with the applicable provisions” of sections 301, 302, 303, 306, and 307 of the CWA — all of which relate to effluent limitations. States may impose conditions on such certifications, including to comply with “any other appropriate requirement of State law” as provided in CWA Section 401(d). Over time, however, many states have used this conditioning authority to address issues unrelated to water quality.

EPA’s Proposed Rule, similar to the 2020 Rule, would narrow the scope of WQC conditions and provide predictable timelines for projects to receive their WQCs. In so doing, the Proposed Rule rolls back significant portions of the current rule, issued in 2023 under the Biden administration (2023 Rule).

Following is an overview of key changes in the Proposed Rule:

Scope of Certification – EPA notes the current 2023 Rule “provides States with sweeping authority to decide the fate of nationally important infrastructure projects, such as natural gas pipelines and hydropower dams, based on potentially speculative water quality impacts not linked to a point source discharge into waters of the United States.” To correct this, and consistent with the 2020 Rule, the Proposed Rule would scrap the 2023 Rule’s provision that the WQC can relate to the “activity as a whole” and instead limit state certifications to addressing discharges “from a point source into waters of the United States.” This, in turn, would prevent states from using Section 401 to address nonpoint source impacts, impacts to purely state waters that are not considered WOTUS, and non-water quality policy concerns such as land use, endangered species, and climate change. The preamble to the Proposed Rule describes in detail how limiting WQCs in this way is consistent with the legislative history and plain language of the CWA, relying heavily on the Supreme Court’s landmark 2024 decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo curtailing judicial deference to agencies’ statutory interpretations.

Request for Certification – The Proposed Rule would create a uniform, national standard for what a permit applicant must submit in a “request for certification” to establish, with certainty, the start of the one-year statutory period for states to act on a WQC request. Conversely, the Proposed Rule would bar states from imposing their own “completeness” criteria that control when the clock starts — although they may still request additional information from applicants.

Timing of Review – The Proposed Rule reiterates that the failure of a state to act on a WQC request within one year results in a waiver, while imposing several restrictions on states’ ability to extend the one-year certification deadline. Extensions would require the approval of the federal agency and only be allowed for specified reasons, and state certifying authorities would be barred from orchestrating withdrawal and resubmittal of requests to extend the one-year “reasonable period of time” cap — a maneuver that has long been criticized by applicants as gamesmanship that further facilitates the injection of non-water quality policy priorities into the certification process. Notably, the Proposed Rule does not foreclose another form of gamesmanship: denial of WQC applications without prejudice.

Contents of Certifications – Among other changes, the Proposed Rule would require states to explain how each condition of a certification relates to a CWA effluent limitation and would mandate any WQC denial to cite the specific water quality requirement at issue, which may deter certain states’ efforts to prolong the WQC process by denying applications without prejudice. Notably, EPA explains that WQC conditions should be limited to “water quality requirements” defined as applicable provisions of sections 301, 302, 303, 306 and 307 of the CWA, and any applicable and appropriate state water quality-related regulatory requirements for discharges. In explaining what water quality-related requirements are “applicable and appropriate,” EPA expressly provides that it is not limiting state regulatory provisions to only EPA-approved provisions — although it requests comment on this point. The Proposed Rule continues to allow states to incorporate narrative water quality standards and other regulatory requirements that apply to point source discharges, declining to limit conditions to just “numeric water quality criteria.”

Modifications – The Proposed Rule would allow states to modify a previously granted WQC only when the federal permitting agency and the applicant agree to the modification, including the content of that modification.

Neighboring Jurisdictions – The Proposed Rule would streamline the process by which other states may object to a discharge that “may affect” their water quality under CWA Section 401(a)(2), including establishing a 60-day deadline for the other state to file an objection and a 90-day deadline for the permitting agency to act on a valid state objection.

In aggregate, the proposed amendments would create a WQC process that is more predictable, provides long-term certainty for WQC holders, and significantly constrains states’ ability to bootstrap other policy concerns onto their Section 401 authority. However, EPA notes in the preamble that if a state imposes conditions in a WQC that exceed the scope outlined in the 401 Rule, the remedy would be found in court. This means litigation of both the Proposed Rule and individual WQCs is likely to continue.

EPA did not include several regulatory changes suggested by industry during past comment periods in the Proposed Rule, indicating that there are still opportunities for further improvement before EPA adopts a final rule. For example, the Proposed Rule is silent on the issue of who (states and/or action agencies) has the authority to enforce WQC conditions incorporated into the federal license or permit, as well as the extent to which EPA or the federal permitting agencies can serve as a “gatekeeper” for WQC conditions that exceed the scope of CWA Section 401.

They spend on average 20 percent of their income on energy bills — more than three times the average for households above 200 percent FPL spend on energy bills (on average, these households spend 4 percent of their income on energy bills).","Everyone deserves affordable, reliable, safe, and clean energy to meet their everyday needs. But rising energy costs threaten energy access, especially for low-income people and people of color, who experience the highest energy burdens and are also struggling with rising food, health care, and housing costs. Rising energy costs are due in large part to construction cost spikes, reflecting factors like supply chain bottlenecks and tariffs on building materials, and to natural gas price changes as well as increased energy demand, to which data centers are a heavy contributor.

It is clear that capital investments are needed to meet the rising demand for energy. In the face of this, we must find ways to build more resources to reduce energy costs, or at a minimum slow their growth. With the right incentives, investment strategies, and policies, states can harness cleaner energy sources that are less expensive for households and improve people’s health, while helping to ensure the cost of energy is more fairly shared between household and non-household users. This paper describes a range of steps states can take to meet our growing energy needs in a way that works for consumers and helps facilitate the continued transition to clean energy.

States seeking to address energy affordability during 2026 legislative sessions should:

provide direct energy assistance to low- and moderate-income households for short-term relief;

better manage how costs are incurred and allocated to control the rate of medium-term increases; and

facilitate the continued transition to an energy system dominated by clean and renewable sources for long-term affordability and safety for everyone.

The energy transition is necessary, inevitable, and underway. 2025 saw the U.S.’s first month in which clean energy sources surpassed fossil fuels in electricity generation, driven in large part by the increasing availability of low-cost solar and wind. This energy transition, if done right, will create not just cleaner air and a healthier climate, but lower bills for everyone. States should make smart, informed choices to reduce known challenges and speed up the transition to a system that is affordable, safe, and reliable for all.

Rising Energy Bills Are Driven by Higher Demand, Construction Costs, and the Price of Natural Gas

Solar and wind energy generation is cheaper to build and run than fossil fuels, a trend that will likely only continue as renewables technology continues to improve. What’s more, with the energy transition already in progress, infrastructure and fuel from the fossil energy system are becoming more expensive or obsolete.

But to fully reap the cost benefits of clean energy, electric grid infrastructure and state regulatory and policy systems must be optimized for its use. This will create some short-term costs, and it’s important that states implement measures to mitigate those costs when households are already experiencing rising energy prices due to other factors.

Average U.S. electricity prices are rising faster than overall inflation for the first time in 15 years — and are expected to increase by 7.6 percent this winter. While electricity prices are rising, currently the average price is similar to those experienced in 2010 in inflation-adjusted terms. Some families are already experiencing affordability challenges, and if prices continue to rise, more will strain to afford their energy bills.

The Republican budget reconciliation megabill enacted in July 2025 dismantled key policies that would have mitigated some of these increasing bills for households. The megabill made over $300 billion in cuts to clean energy tax credits and rescinded close to $8 billion in funding for grants and loans for clean energy, energy waste reduction, improvements to the electric grid, and energy upgrades in affordable housing enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. These investments had been designed to cover some of the transition costs to cleaner and less expensive energy. Some models project that these cuts will translate into higher energy bills for consumers.

Many households were already struggling to pay their utility bills before the megabill was enacted. Our analysis finds that 6.5 percent of households indicated being behind on utility bills in 2023. For renters, the rate was higher, at 10 percent of households. Analysis from the Century Foundation finds that nearly 1 in 20 households have severe past-due utility debt, meaning their accounts were sent to collections or have been delinquent for more than 89 days and will soon be sent to collections. It also finds the average overdue balance on utility bills has increased .

The national average electricity price rose between 2021 and 2024, driven by large increases in California; the Northeast, and Maine in particular; and the Mid-Atlantic. Prices in many Central, Southeast, and Mountain region states remained flat or fell, but experts predict further increases in all regions in 2026. Key factors behind these increases: rising construction costs for maintaining the electric grid and building new energy generation facilities, increased electricity demand, and natural gas price increases, with households served by for-profit utilities experiencing higher increases.

Rising construction costs: Rising construction costs, due to supply chain bottlenecks, permitting delays, and tariffs on building materials, increase the cost of needed upgrades to the electric grid. These upgrades, which are the most significant contributor to rising energy bills, are necessary to protect against climate change-fueled extreme weather events like wildfires and hurricane-force winds; accommodate new demand from data centers and electrification of transportation, heating and cooling, and appliances; and make it possible to connect new resources like wind, solar, and batteries to the grid. The problem exists nationwide but is more acute in places with higher construction costs, like New York and California. It may also be worse in places where investor-owned utilities (IOUs) are responsible for grid upgrades. IOUs receive a guaranteed rate of return for capital investments and are therefore incentivized to increase capital expenditures.

Increased demand: According to an analysis by ICF, after two decades of mostly flat demand growth, U.S. electricity demand is expected to grow 25 percent by 2030 and 78 percent by 2050. Current demand increases are being driven largely by data centers and manufacturing in certain sectors like semiconductors; in the future, building and vehicle electrification are expected to become significant drivers as well, though the Trump Administration has taken steps to slow vehicle electrification by cutting tax credits and withholding electric vehicle charging funding from states. As electric utilities prepare to meet increased demand, they must expand and improve the electric grid, including by building and connecting new sources of energy to it. Backlogs for connecting these new sources are one reason the Northeast, in particular, is experiencing challenges meeting electricity demand, though these challenges aren’t unique to that region. In an ideal scenario, large electricity users like data centers and manufacturing facilities can drive down prices by helping pay for the cost of upgrades. In reality, households and small businesses often get saddled with financially burdensome infrastructure investments. That is because utility companies may offer deals to large users, resulting in those users not paying their fair share, or a new large energy load may so far outstrip current demand that new infrastructure investments can’t be absorbed at a reasonable price. In some cases utility companies may build in anticipation of demand that fails to materialize, with households left to foot much of the bill

Natural gas (also known as methane gas): Over 40 percent of U.S. electricity is powered by natural gas. In contrast to renewables which have no fuel costs, natural gas is subject to price spikes, like the one caused by the Russia-Ukraine war. High natural gas prices are the leading cause of high energy bills in several states, including Maine, where electricity prices are growing at the third fastest rate in the nation. Natural gas prices are rising and are expected to rise further due to increased exports, which increase international demand for U.S. gas, driving up the price for domestic consumers.

Higher Energy Bills Hurt Low-Income People and People of Color Most

Low- and moderate-income households and households of color are disproportionately feeling these rising energy bills. These households are more likely than others to live in homes that are not energy efficient, either because of lack of insulation or inefficient heating and cooling systems, increasing energy costs. Households whose incomes are below the federal poverty level (FPL) are more likely than others to face severe energy burden. They spend on average 20 percent of their income on energy bills — more than three times the average for households above 200 percent FPL spend on energy bills (on average, these households spend 4 percent of their income on energy bills).

Looking regionally, low-income households in the Northeast and Midwest tend to spend the largest share of their income on energy bills. (See Figure 2.) In Maine and Connecticut, for example, low-income households spend an average of 31 percent of their income on energy bills.

Black, Indigenous, and Hispanic households face significantly higher energy burdens than white households, driven by income inequities and the older housing stock and lower homeownership rates in communities of color that are often the result of past and present discrimination in the economy and housing market.

Our analysis finds that 31 percent of Black households, 31 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN), and 27 percent of Hispanic households have high energy burdens (energy costs above 6 percent), compared to 24 percent of white households that do so. AIAN households also face the highest frequency of severe energy burden, with 1 in 5 households spending more than 10 percent of their income on energy bills. (See Figure 3.)

Immediate Action: Expand Energy Assistance for Low- and Moderate-Income Households

Low- and moderate-income households have the highest energy burdens and are least able to afford high electricity prices. Energy assistance is a targeted, cost-effective intervention that helps people stay safe in their homes and meet their everyday needs. Energy assistance can be monetary or take the form of prohibitions against shutting off vulnerable households’ electricity.

States can take steps to enact or expand these kinds of vital assistance. Recent threats to federal benefits — like the Trump Administration’s moves to eliminate funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) — make state actions even more important.

Expanding eligibility and enrollment: Energy assistance programs, like LIHEAP, are funded primarily through federal block grants and supplemented by state funds or utility ratepayers. But chronic underfunding, apart from even the Administration’s current funding threats, means these programs only serve roughly 18 percent of eligible households. In some states, like California and Texas, LIHEAP serves only about 5 percent of eligible households. Additionally, enrollment barriers and income thresholds for eligibility mean the program isn’t always serving those with the greatest energy burdens. States can expand supplemental funding, advocate for increased federal funding, and streamline enrollment and documentation processes. For example, a 2024 Michigan law assesses a utility surcharge to expand funding for the state’s program and extends eligibility to over 300,000 additional households.

Enacting moratoriums on utility shutoffs: Many, but not all, states have policies that protect vulnerable households from utility disconnection. States can expand these protections. In particular, they can add hot weather disconnection protections — like those they have for cold — as New Jersey did in 2025.

Some states are providing energy bill rebates to all ratepayers, which can be meaningful for some households. But these small, one- or two-time payments aren’t a reliable source of relief for residents who most need it. Additionally, some states are funding these payments using money allocated to vital clean energy and climate resilience projects, potentially delaying the work needed to move to cleaner, less expensive energy sources and forgoing resilience upgrades that would bring down the cost of future infrastructure repairs. If states do offer these payments, they should look to New Jersey, which provided larger payments for low-income households, and Maryland, which secured the funding from utility companies instead of reallocating state funds.

Short- and Medium-Term Action: Change Utility Incentives, Manage Utility Spending, and Assign Costs Equitably

While energy assistance is important to address immediate needs, states should also enact legislation that helps bring down the cost of household energy bills. Doing so requires that states change regulations so that, as utilities make needed investments, they do so in a cost-effective manner that prioritizes safety and affordability. States should also ensure that equity guides how costs are distributed among ratepayers.

States can achieve this by:

Including affordability in utility regulator mandates. State legislatures have the power to mandate that Public Utility Commissions (PUCs), which regulate utility companies in each state, include affordability as a goal in their regulatory actions. In 2021 Maine tasked its utility commission with mitigating disproportionate energy burdens, and in 2024 Minnesota mandated that its PUC establish standards to fairly share the cost of utility system upgrades between, among other things, residential and non-residential energy users and increase low-income households’ access to energy efficiency programs.

Considering regulatory structures based on utility performance. Performance-based ratemaking (PBR) is the practice of compensating utilities based on their performance against target outcomes — including cost effectiveness and reliability — instead of solely the cost of service, while minimizing the perverse incentive utilities have to overbuild capital-intensive systems. For example, following the 2018 Camp Fire in California, the state and the utility company underwent protracted negotiations to create a grid upgrade plan that balanced effective wildfire protections and consumer protections from rising energy costs. PBR is gaining traction in several states, such as Connecticut, which passed a comprehensive PBR package in 2023 that included social equity and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in its target outcomes.

Making it easier to install and use the lowest-cost sources of energy. Although transmission and distribution costs are the biggest drivers of increased electricity prices, the price of electric generation plays a role as well. Solar and wind are cheaper to run than fossil fuels, a cost advantage that’s likely to only grow as the technology continues to improve and fossil fuels are phased out for economic and environmental reasons. To increase large-scale solar and wind projects, states should:

Remove barriers to building large renewable energy facilities by streamlining siting and permitting processes, creating state-backed project financing such as revolving loans, and upgrading technology and processes for adding energy sources to the electric grid. California, Illinois, Michigan, New York, and Washington all recently overhauled their permitting systems for clean energy.

Enable more residents to benefit from renewable energy sources by enacting and protecting “net metering” policies and community choice aggregation. Net metering allows residential and commercial customers who generate their own electricity from solar power to sell the electricity they aren’t using back into the grid, significantly improving the economic case for switching to renewable energy. Community choice aggregation (CCA) allows local governments to procure power for residents and businesses from sources outside their utility company. The utility continues to provide energy transmission and distribution services and CCA participants get cheaper, cleaner power.

Require the cheapest sources of energy to provide power first, a practice known as “economic dispatch.” Utilities that own power generation resources sometimes run coal plants even when cheaper power is available because they earn profit not from minimizing fuel costs, but from keeping the plants they own in the rate base, that is, the value of property owned by the utility company on which it is permitted to earn a specific rate of return. If the utility company doesn’t operate the coal plant regularly, regulators may deem it no longer “used and useful,” which can force its retirement and reduce the utility’s earnings. But by running the plant — even at a loss — the utility helps justify keeping it in the rate base, while the higher fuel costs are passed on to customers. Utilities may also run coal plants to satisfy minimum purchase requirements in coal supply contracts, even when doing so is more expensive. State regulators can help end this practice by disallowing utilities from recovering costs that result from uneconomic dispatch, and by rejecting inefficient fuel supply contract terms.

Shifting power from corporations to consumers. Many aspects of utility spending lack transparency. And corporations often have outsized influence in regulatory proceedings due to their large financial, political, and legal resources, resulting in high corporate profits and contributing to inequitable utility rates. Six states have implemented intervenor compensation programs — which compensate consumer advocates for their time and expertise when intervening in electricity rate cases — to level the playing field between investor-owned utilities and consumers. Also, at least seven states have implemented laws prohibiting utilities from recovering lobbying costs from ratepayers. Some, like Maryland, also enhance accountability by requiring utilities to disclose their votes in regional electric grid proceedings.

Regulate data centers and other large energy users. States can study the costs these users impose on the electric grid; enact surcharges on them and use the revenue for electric bill assistance; or direct regulators to require that utility companies more equitably allocate the costs of energy system upgrades that serve them. States can also pass laws requiring large energy users to disclose their energy use, enabling regulators, utilities, and grid operators to better plan for their needs and help avoid price shocks. Requiring aspects of data center deals to be made public helps utilities avoid pursuing upgrades for loads — and paying customers — that ultimately don’t materialize. Texas SB6, enacted in 2025, seeks to protect residential and small business customers from subsidizing speculative large-load developments by increasing visibility into large-load proposals and requiring upfront financial commitments from developers.

States should also be wary of arguments that giving more power to IOUs will lower electricity prices. Measures to avoid include the practice known as “Construction Work in Progress,” which allows utilities to begin recovering construction costs of new energy generation facilities from ratepayers while they are still under construction. This exposes ratepayers to the risk of paying for new energy buildout with long timelines and no guarantee that the project will be completed. This was the case in Georgia, where ratepayers began paying for the Votgle Plant upgrade in 2010, which was $23 billion over budget and didn’t begin coming online until 2023, resulting in the biggest rate hikes in the state’s history. States where the utility industry is “deregulated,” that is, where utility companies are only allowed to own transmission and distribution infrastructure, should avoid “re-regulation,” because allowing utilities to own energy generation infrastructure in addition to transmission and distribution increases their monopoly power and results in poor outcomes for ratepayers.

Positioning For Long-Term Success: Plan for a Phased Energy Transition That Works for Everyone

The energy transition is necessary, inevitable, and underway. If done right, it will create cleaner air, a healthier climate, and lower bills for everyone. However, during the middle of this transition, with fossil and clean energy operating simultaneously, infrastructure and regulatory systems are not optimized for either system. Smart planning to guide the choices states make regarding energy technology, siting, and operations can address the near-term challenges and speed up the energy transition.

The following are some best practices that states can follow:

Accurately forecast energy demand to adequately plan for grid upgrades. By supporting utility companies and grid operators to more accurately forecast demand, states can help create the conditions for adequate generation buildout and grid upgrades, thus avoiding price shocks. States can pass laws that promote the forecasts’ robustness and accuracy by requiring use of multiple forecast timelines and scenarios; consideration of new technologies and policies that may affect demand (such as heat pumps, electric vehicles, and electrified buildings); and estimates for peak capacity. As the energy transition brings more distributed energy resources such as rooftop solar and battery storage online, states should ensure their energy demand forecasts account for how these new, flexible resources impact the electric grid.

Address stranded fossil energy assets. As the energy transition progresses, infrastructure and fuel from the fossil energy system is becoming more expensive or obsolete. This results in utility companies passing on to consumers associated higher operating costs and debt recovery.

For example, many coal plants are no longer economical to run, but utility companies are still using them because it’s easier to pass those costs to customers than replace the asset. New gas plants and gas distribution network upgrades are incurring upfront costs now that corporations will expect to recoup from ratepayers regardless of how much longer those systems remain operational, meaning whoever stays on gas (likely lower-income households that can’t electrify without financial assistance) will experience astronomical prices.

To address these problems, states need to implement a set of policies – ranging from future energy system planning to banning fossil fuel use altogether — to limit or prevent utility companies from building out fossil fuel assets. Several states have begun proceedings to plan for a phased, equitable transition off the natural gas system. And, once implemented, New York’s law requiring new buildings to be all-electric (that is, no oil or gas) will slow the buildout of the fossil gas distribution system. States should also help utility companies responsibly retire existing assets faster, such as by providing low-cost refinancing so they can more quickly pay off the remaining cost of the asset.

Unfortunately, many states are pursuing short-sighted policies that prolong existing — or even build new — fossil fuel infrastructure. These policies are often advanced by groups with ties to fossil fuel corporations, lean on outdated assumptions about the energy system, and ultimately will burden ratepayers with stranded asset costs. The same groups often work to block state progress on this issue. New York paused implementation of its all-electric buildings law in a deal to end litigation brought by industry groups, and the Trump Administration has issued stay-open orders for coal plants in four states, in a questionable use of its power to alleviate electric grid emergencies and at a high cost to ratepayers. States should push back against these challenges and continue to use their authority to halt fossil fuel buildout to avoid even higher future energy costs, to say nothing of the severe impacts to health, safety, and the climate. More than that, states can proactively advance racial, economic, and health justice through climate action.

“We are committed to protecting and preserving our natural resources — and the waterbodies on Cape Cod are some of Massachusetts’ finest,” said Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper. “Cape residents deserve clean and healthy water, and these grants are essential to addressing nitrogen pollution once and for all.”

The Natural Resource Nitrogen Sensitive Areas (NRNSA) Grant Program, administered by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP), helps communities develop plans to comprehensively address wastewater and other sources of nitrogen pollution. Excess nitrogen has been an ongoing problem in Cape Cod, where it has fueled the growth of nuisance plants, weeds, and algae that use up much of the oxygen in the water — harming water quality and forcing out indigenous fish and plant species.

“When people are on the Cape, they want to experience the fresh salt air and enjoy time on the water.” said MassDEP Commissioner Bonnie Heiple. “This funding is a critical step in reversing decades of nitrogen pollution and protecting what makes the Cape so special.”

State regulations allow Cape communities to choose a watershed-wide solution to mitigate nitrogen pollution by applying for a Watershed Permit. Alternatively, a Town may choose to address wastewater solutions, via Title 5, by using improved septic technologies for new construction in areas heavily impacted by nitrogen. MassDEP is supporting the work of towns that choose the comprehensive Watershed Permit solution by providing both technical and financial assistance.

The nine Cape Cod towns receiving NRNSA grants are:

Barnstable — $137,719

Brewster — $ 58,680

Statement of Support:

State Senator Julian Cyr (D-Truro):

""Nitrogen pollution remains one of the most urgent environmental and public health challenges facing Cape Cod, threatening our estuaries, shellfisheries, and the long-term vitality of our tourism-based economy. These grants will directly benefit towns in my district — Barnstable, Brewster, Dennis, Truro, Wellfleet, and Yarmouth — as they work to meet updated Title 5 requirements and advance smart solutions tailored to local conditions. I'm grateful to the Healey-Driscoll Administration and MassDEP for investing in practical, science-driven tools that help Cape communities protect water quality, comply with state standards, and safeguard the natural resources that define this special region.""

One early sign that things might not go so smoothly for the U.S. in its quest for Venezuelan oil was how American energy companies responded.

In a meeting between oil executives and President Trump this month at the White House, Darren Woods, head of Exxon Mobil, called Venezuela “uninvestable.” Another oil magnate and Trump ally, Harold Hamm, was more diplomatic, but not exactly enthusiastic. Venezuela has “its challenges,” Hamm said.

Trump has made it clear that he wants to move fast. At that meeting, which he called less than a week after U.S. troops captured the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, Trump told oil executives to “rapidly rebuild” the South American country’s oil industry.

Last week, exclusive reporting by my colleague Anatoly Kurmanaev found that the U.S. has already begun selling 50 million barrels of the Venezuelan oil that had previously been trapped by a partial U.S. blockade.

There are good reasons for the U.S. administration to prioritize speed, Anatoly told me. The Venezuelan economy was days from collapsing. Oil storage was near capacity. The currency was in free fall. Officials had to get that trapped oil out and dollars in as soon as possible.

“It was a race against time,” Anatoly said. “Trump has no interest in a collapsed Venezuela right now.”

In the longer term, Trump has bigger ambitions. He wants what he calls “energy dominance” — enough weight in the global oil market to curb the power of OPEC countries and gain leverage over China. Venezuela is part of that plan.

But in the weeks since the invasion, these longer-term ambitions to gain effective control of Venezuela’s oil industry have “run headlong into reality,” my colleague Anton Troianovski wrote last week.

Slow and expensive

One problem for Trump is that the U.S. doesn’t have a national oil company. Exxon, Chevron and the like are private corporations that will start projects only when they see a good business opportunity. When they look at Venezuela, they don’t like what they see.

The case for investing in Venezuelan oil isn’t straightforward. The country has a lot of oil, but gaining access to it and turning it into a profitable business would take a lot of time and upfront investment, as my colleague Peter Coy writes. That’s the kind of thing that U.S. oil companies, which have recently sought to economize on investments and cut risk, don’t like.

Low oil prices mean the incentive to invest is limited. “Many analysts believe that a vast oversupply of oil is already sloshing around global markets,” Anton wrote.

Another problem: The U.S. may have removed Maduro, and achieved seeming compliance from his successor, for now, but it’s far from clear that it has achieved long-term political stability in Venezuela. A history of political turmoil, which led to the assets of U.S. oil companies being nationalized in the first place, is part of why executives view the country as “uninvestable” today.

And, as some of my colleagues have been reporting, there are signs that cracks have already begun appearing.

‘Zero oil’

For all the discontent many Venezuelans feel toward their government, oil has been an integral part of the country’s opposition to the U.S.

“For the last three decades, they have been fed an ideology of ‘Chavismo,’ with its goal of harnessing oil wealth to transform the country, empower the poor and stand up to the United States and its imperial ambitions,” writes my colleague Maria Abi-Habib.

And so some Venezuelans find it hard to swallow their new status as a country willing to cooperate — and share oil wealth — with the Americans who just invaded them.

“At this point, we should have cut off the oil, we shouldn’t have sold any oil to the United States. Zero oil, zero oil!” one Venezuelan told Maria.

It’s not clear how long the new government will manage to stave off these forces in order to continue cooperation with the United States. Even if it does, other ingredients for instability abound: The country remains filled with paramilitary groups, Colombian guerrillas and gangs.

It’s not the kind of environment that looks tempting to an oil executive watching from Texas. But Trump is also willing to strong-arm them into submission. “I’ll probably be inclined to keep Exxon out,” the president told reporters after the White House meeting. “I didn’t like their response.” Exxon’s stock slipped in the aftermath, though it has since recovered.

It has overtaken nickel-based packs to become the dominant battery chemistry in the world.

China spearheaded this growth, followed by Europe and some Asian countries.

The rollout of low-cost lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries surpassed deployments of traditional nickel-based chemistries in electric vehicles in 2025 for the very first time, EV Magazine reported, citing data from the research firm RhoMotion. That marks a significant shift for the global battery industry, and its yet another sign of China's continued dominance here.

For years, automakers leaned heavily on nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) batteries, largely because they benefited from a mature supply chain and higher energy density that delivered desirable driving range on EVs. (Most U.S.-market EVs use NMC batteries.)

But those advantages have come at a cost. Nickel- and cobalt-heavy batteries are expensive to mine, they’re environmentally intensive and remain tied to controversial supply chains that involve labor and human rights violations, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Ford LFP battery cells

As a result, battery makers have been accelerating their shift toward nickel-free chemistries such as LFP.

Chinese automakers and battery companies have been leading that shift, thanks to LFP’s lower costs, reduced dependence on troubled materials and a narrowing energy-density gap with NMC batteries.

By last year, LFP batteries accounted for more than half of global EV battery deployments, RhoMotion said. NMC batteries still retain an edge on energy density, but automakers have found ways to offset that disadvantage. Cell-to-pack and cell-to-chassis designs allow more cells to be squeezed into similar spaces. Optimized anode and cathode materials are helping close that performance gap even further.

And China is absolutely crushing it when it comes to LFP adoption. Between January and November last year, more than 80% of EVs sold in the country were equipped with LFP batteries. And that dominance is also spilling overseas.

BYD Seagull (China Spec)

Europe and Asia (excluding China) accounted for roughly 75% of last year’s global LFP growth, driven largely by a surge of Chinese EVs entering overseas markets. In Europe, Chinese automakers accounted for a record 12.8% of the EV market in November, more than doubling their share from a year earlier, Bloomberg reported, citing numbers from Dataforce. BYD, Leapmotor and Chery all posted strong growth across the region in 2025. China's CATL is by far the leading company in the LFP market, and last year, about one-third of all EVs sold had CATL battery cells. You do the math.

Chinese battery giants are pushing aggressively into local LFP production in Europe, both to reduce their exposure to tariffs and also to stay close to automakers. Both BYD and CATL are building battery factories in Hungary. CATL already operates a plant in Germany and has another one planned in Spain in partnership with Stellantis.

North America was the only region to see LFP deployments decline in 2025. The U.S. has effectively blocked China-made batteries from entering the country through tariffs and strict sourcing rules under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, leaving only a handful of LFP-equipped EVs on the U.S. market.

Tesla briefly offered LFP batteries on the base Model 3 in the U.S., but discontinued that trim in 2024 due to tariffs. Rivian and Ford still use LFP packs on base versions of the R1S, R1T and Mustang Mach-E. However, LFP is expected to undergo somewhat of a resurgence in the U.S. thanks to more affordable EVs like the new Chevrolet Bolt and Ford’s upcoming $30,000 electric truck.

LFP is still poised to grow in the U.S., but the path will look different from what’s happening in Europe and China. Much of that momentum is expected to come from domestic production of battery energy storage systems (BESS), rather than passenger EVs alone.

After the end of the $7,500 federal tax credit, several battery makers in the U.S., including LG Energy Solution, Tesla and SK On, adjusted their battery manufacturing capacity for the ESS market, which is growing much faster than EVs.

Last year, Detroiters received hundreds of millions in tax credits through the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit

Increase to Michigan EITC means more money for residents this year

All the information needed is available at getthetaxfacts.org

Today, Mayor Mary Sheffield joined with a coalition of community partners to announce a campaign to help all Detroiters access every dollar of federal and state tax credits they are eligible for by scheduling an appointment for best-in-the-nation, no-cost tax preparation. Through last year’s coordinated outreach in the City of Detroit, thousands of Detroit families were able to take advantage of the Earned Income and Child Tax Credit, bringing millions into their homes. This year, even more money is available in state credits thanks to 2023 legislation that increased the Michigan EITC five-fold.

Mayor Sheffield was joined by United Way for Southeastern Michigan, Accounting Aid Society, and Wayne Metropolitan Community Action Agency as they kicked off the 2026 income tax season today and outlined efforts to urge residents to claim their credits.

“My administration is intensely focused on getting more Detroit families and children out of poverty and making sure they receive the valuable tax credits is a very easy way to do that,” said Mayor Mary Sheffield. “Through our partners, we have volunteers ready to help residents claim and receive the tax returns they are entitled to, so they can have the money they need to support their families.”

All residents with income less than $69,000 qualify for an expert tax preparation appointment at no cost to them. Last year the coalition partners filed more than 26,000 tax returns in the region. Audits by the IRS find they achieve better than a 98% accuracy rate, making them a leader in the nation. An IRS study of paid tax preparers found they achieve a 40% accuracy rate, meaning that Detroit’s coalition of no-cost tax preparers are far more accurate and their returns are at far less risk of penalties or audit.

As a result of the coalition’s work in 2024, Detroiters claimed more than $450 million in EITC refunds for tax year 2023, plus many millions more in Child Tax Credits. Prior to 2017, EITC-eligible Detroiters left an estimated $80 million of potential tax refunds unclaimed each year.

There are several cash payments available to low-income, working Detroit families, including the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, but you’ve got to file your taxes to claim these credits. Even if you don’t typically file your taxes or didn’t earn much in 2024, you may qualify for these payments.

Eligible Detroiters to receive text message reminders

The City of Detroit and its no-cost tax prep partners are using nation-leading strategies to communicate with low-income families who may be eligible for large tax refunds. This includes evidence-based text messages delivered in partnership with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS). Analysis by the United Way of Southeastern Michigan finds that on days when text messages go out, use of its online tax prep appointment scheduling tool triples and online bookings jump by 2.25 times. Today MDHHS partnered with the City of Detroit to send a text message about the availability of no-cost, highly accurate tax prep services to over 70,000 Detroit households on food aid.

“Too often, people miss out on tax refunds simply because they can’t afford professional tax prep help,” said Elizabeth Hertel, Michigan Department of Health and Human Services director. “This free service offered by the United Way of Southeastern Michigan and the city of Detroit will help put money back into the pockets of those who need it most. MDHHS is helping to ensure eligible families in Detroit are aware of this opportunity available to them at no cost.”

Starting today, residents can call 2-1-1 or visit getthetaxfacts.org to learn more and schedule an appointment.

EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT – Who is eligible?

For more than 50 years, the Earned Income Tax credit has been providing much-needed extra cash to hard-working families. The EITC is available to working families and individuals who meet certain income requirements. There are actually two EITC credits – a main credit when you file your federal tax return, and an additional credit when you file your state of Michigan tax return. This year is the third year of new state legislation in which the Michigan credit is worth 5 times what it used to be. That means more money in Detroiters’ pockets.

If you worked at all in 2025, you may be eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit. The Earned Income Tax Credit provides extra income to workers with low to moderate incomes, up to $69,000. The amount of the refund depends on income, filing status, and number of qualifying children claimed on tax returns. For example, a single individual with no children who works and makes less than $19,104 could get back as much as $844. A married couple with three or more children who files a joint return, with a combined income of less than $68,675 could receive the maximum EITC of $10,460 between the federal and state credits. Adults and children must have a Social Security Number to claim the EITC.

MICHIGAN EITC – 5X INCREASE

The Michigan EITC uses the same eligibility criteria as the federal EITC. The amount of the Michigan credit is calculated as a percentage of the amount the family or individual receives from the federal EITC. Previously, the Michigan EITC was calculated as 6% of the federal EITC. For example, if a family qualified for a $3000 federal EITC refund, they received an additional $180 ($3000 x 6%) from the state of Michigan when filing their state taxes.

Under the new law, now in its third year of implementation, the Michigan credit was increased to 30% of the federal credit. In the same example, a family qualifying for a $3000 federal EITC refund will now receive an additional $900 ($3000 x 30%) from the state of Michigan.

CHILD TAX CREDIT – Who is eligible?

The Child Tax Credit provides $1700-2200 per child for qualifying families.

Children under age 17 living in your home.

If you are the child’s primary caregiver, you are likely eligible. You don’t need to be the child’s biological parent to qualify.

You earned at least $2500 from working in 2025.

You (or your spouse, if filing jointly) and the child(ren) must have a valid Social Security Number to claim the Child Tax Credit.

EXPERT TAX PREP AVAILABLE AT NO COST:

All residents with income less than $69,000 qualify for an expert tax preparation appointment at no cost to them. For the 2026 tax season, Accounting Aid Society and Wayne Metro will offer primarily in-person tax prep services. Drop-and-go and all-virtual appointments will also still be available.

""The Earned Income Tax Credit remains one of the most powerful tools for helping families build financial stability, and with Michigan’s 30% state match, it continues to create meaningful opportunities for working households,” said Priscilla Perkins, President and CEO of Accounting Aid Society. “As we enter the 2026 tax season, we are grateful for the continued partnership and support of the Mayor’s Office as we work together to provide no-cost tax preparation services and ensure every eligible family receives the credits they have earned. Together, we are strengthening Detroit - one family at a time.""

A communitywide coalition of partners last year helped Detroiters receive more than $450 million in earned income tax credits alone. Detroiter Tiffany Thomas (far right) used her Child Care Tax Credit checks over the years to help put her son through school.

SPREADING THE WORD:

This coalition is working to spread the word to those who are at the greatest risk of missing out, such as first-time parents who may not know they are eligible, non-traditional families where the biological parents are not the primary caregivers, families that don’t make much money and don’t normally file taxes, and families with limited English, limited education, and limited connections to social services.

We are working with community-based organizations to meet families where they are with in-person outreach at community events, flyers at community locations, direct outreach to neighborhood residents, and more. These efforts receive additional funding and support through the generosity of funding partners including Kresge Foundation, Ballmer Group, and Comerica.

The most important thing to know is that most Detroiters are eligible for expert tax preparation at no-cost, thanks to the help of hundreds of staff and volunteers from Accounting Aid Society and Wayne Metro. These IRS-certified non-profit partners specialize in helping low- and moderate-income individuals claim the credits they are entitled to. They have a higher accuracy rate than most for-profit tax filing companies.

“Too many Wayne County households miss out on tax refunds simply because they don't know they qualify or they don't have access to trusted tax preparation services,” said Louis D. Piszker, Chief Executive Officer of Wayne Metropolitan Community Action Agency. “Wayne Metro’s free certified tax services help remove those barriers and ensure that residents receive the full tax credits they’ve earned, putting real dollars back into the family budget.”

Through its extensive network of community resources, United Way will again lead this coalition - making sure Detroiters are connected to the help they need.

“At a time when families are feeling the pressure of rising costs and reduced federal supports, the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit are more important than ever,” said Darienne Hudson, president and CEO of United Way for Southeastern Michigan. “These credits provide real relief—helping families afford basic necessities, catch up on overdue bills, and regain financial stability while building a pathway to economic mobility. Alongside our partners at the City of Detroit, Accounting Aid Society, Wayne Metro, and others, we’re committed to ensuring every eligible household can access the full refund they deserve.”",https://detroitmi.gov/themes/custom/detroitminew/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-20 16:00:41.260252

The West Concord, Massachusetts-based circular economy company said the capital will support expanding operations and deploying additional wasted-food solutions, with a particular focus on completing Integrated Diversion & Energy Facilities in Longview, Washington and Lexington, North Carolina, which are expected to begin operating later this year. Divert converts unsold, non-donatable food into beneficial outputs using anaerobic digestion, producing carbon-negative renewable energy as well as soil amendment and nitrogen-rich fertilizer, while also helping customers comply with organic waste mandates and reduce costs through improved purchasing and merchandising.

Divert highlighted its existing facility in Turlock, California, which it said can process 100,000 tons of unsold food annually, as an example of the infrastructure model it is replicating in new markets. The company framed the expansion against the broader scale of the problem, citing nearly 74 million tons of surplus food generated in the U.S. in 2023 and noting that more than 46% of food is wasted each year in Canada.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – JANUARY 20, 2026 — Today, Congresswoman Summer L. Lee (PA-12) alongside Representatives Ro Khanna (CA-17), Mark Takano (CA-39), and Jill Tokuda (HI-02), reintroduced the Stop Wall Street Landlords Act, legislation aimed at ending large institutional investors’ ability to use taxpayer dollars to subsidize the acquisition of single-family homes and drive up housing costs for working families.

Since the 2008 housing crash and subsequent foreclosure crisis, increased investor activity in America’s housing market has normalized excessive fees and abusive practices while artificially driving up housing and rent prices. In Pennsylvania and across the country—particularly in states like California, Nevada, Florida, and Georgia where corporate landlords own large concentrations(link is external) of single-family rental homes—investors are driving up rents and pricing families out of stable housing and homeownership opportunities.

“Here in Pittsburgh and across Western Pennsylvania, I’ve seen too many families living in homes owned by some distant investor who treats them like a paycheck instead of people,” said Rep. Summer Lee. “Investors are buying up single-family homes and affordable buildings and squeezing our communities, leaving families to live in conditions no one should ever have to endure. This is the result of a system that subsidizes corporate landlords while everyday people struggle to find a safe, stable place to call home. The Stop Wall Street Landlords Act is about stopping that exploitation, so homes belong to the people who live in them, not wealthy investors driving up costs and pushing families out of their own neighborhoods.”

“Homes should be owned by people, not wealthy corporate landlords who are buying up single-family homes and pushing the dream of homeownership out of reach for too many Americans,” said Rep. Ro Khanna. “I’m proud to lead this effort to put affordable housing for families first. If President Trump is serious about taking on Wall Street landlords, Congress should pass my bill and he should sign it into law.”

Big investors have spent years driving up housing costs,” said Rep. Mark Takano. “I’ve heard from countless constituents who feel the dream of homeownership is now permanently out of reach. I’m proud to co-lead this bill with Reps. Khanna, Lee, and Tokuda to put people over profits and keep corporations out of the single-family housing market while ensuring those creating affordable housing can continue their work.”

“In Hawaiʻi, too many hardworking families are getting priced out of paradise,” said Rep. Jill Tokuda. “They're barely staying afloat working numerous jobs and living in multigenerational homes, but still can’t afford to stay in the communities they grew up in, while Wall Street investors and billionaires buy houses and land they’ll never live in. That's why I’m proud to co-lead the Stop Wall Street Landlords Act with Representatives Khanna, Takano, and Lee because housing should work for people, not corporate profits. This bill takes real steps to keep large investors out of our neighborhoods and make homeownership more affordable so families can stay, put down roots, and thrive.”

“Corporate landlords have priced out an entire generation,"" said Rep. Maxwell Frost. ""The Stop Wall Street Landlords Act is a real step toward restoring fairness in our housing market and making sure families, not Wall Street, shape our communities.”

“For far too long, the American dream has been confined to wishful thinking for millions of hard-working people,” said Watson Coleman. “No one trying to build a life for themselves and their families should suffer from housing instability while corporations monopolize the market. Democrats have been hard at work fighting for solutions to solve the affordability crisis. It’s time for Republicans to step up and work with us to pass this legislation.”

“As people in my district and around the country already know, the rent is too damn high,” said Congressman Jesús “Chuy” García. “Renters are already facing the destabilizing effects of algorithmic pricing schemes, gentrification, and now, here come the Wall Street companies scooping up all the housing stock to jack prices up even higher. I’m proud to co-sponsor the Stop Wall Street Landlords Act because the U.S. government should not subsidize Wall Street landlords, and because we need to invest in affordable housing for those who need it most.”

Specifically, the Stop Wall Street Landlords Act will:

End large institutional investors’ ability to benefit from tax breaks reserved for homeowners – namely mortgage interest, insurance, and depreciation deductions.

Direct the Federal Housing Financial Agency (FHFA) and related agencies Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae to (a) prohibit large institutional investors from purchasing mortgages on single-family residential (SFR) homes – or any interest in such a mortgage – and (b) from newly lending on a security or securitizing any SFR mortgage under which the mortgagee meets the bill definition of a specified large investor.

Legislate a federal real estate transfer tax of 100% of the sale value of each SFR in the possession of a specified large investor if SFRs are not sold within 18 months of bill enactment.

Promote the use of transfer tax revenue and deduction tax savings to fund the Housing Trust Fund, which enables affordable housing construction and preservation.

The bill makes exceptions for mom-and-pop landlords, housing providers that participate in federal affordable housing programs, nonprofits and developers committed to building and supplying affordable single-family homes to owner occupiers in the American housing market.

Cosponsors: Representatives Summer Lee, Mark Takano, Jill Tokuda, Maxwell Frost, Bonnie Watson Coleman, Jonathan L. Jackson, Chris Deluzio, Jesús “Chuy” García, Rashida Tlaib, Lateefah Simon, Robin Kelly, Shri Thanedar.

WASHINGTON — U.S. Representative Greg Steube (R Fla.) introduced today the Worldwide Animal Testing Compliance and Harmonization Act or WATCH Act. This bill would prohibit federal funding for foreign laboratories found to be in violation of animal welfare protections.

“Torturing animals in the name of science is both morally wrong and wholly unnecessary,” said Rep. Steube. “The fact that the United States continues to fund foreign laboratories that engage in animal cruelty is indefensible—especially considering the NIH has set clear guidelines for domestic laboratories to follow. Any scientific research involving animals demands proper care and a humane environment for God’s creatures. That is why I am introducing the bipartisan WATCH Act to bar the NIH from funding studies in foreign countries that fail to protect the welfare of innocent animals.”

“American taxpayer dollars should never fund inhumane animal testing in unregulated laboratories around the world,” said Rep. Susie Lee. “This bipartisan bill requires foreign laboratories to meet the same animal welfare standards American-based labs must follow, ensuring animals are treated humanely and strengthening the integrity of U.S.-funded research.”

This bill serves as the House companion to legislation introduced by Senators Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.).

“Despite what Communist China may say, it has become clear that the COVID pandemic was the result of risky animal experiments by an unregulated lab in Wuhan that received U.S. taxpayer dollars,” said Senator Schmitt. “Outsourcing animal testing and research to foreign laboratories that do not comply with U.S. standards is dangerous, inhumane, and puts America, and the world, at risk. This bipartisan WATCH Act puts in place strong guardrails to ensure humane and safe research by requiring that foreign NIH-funded studies are subject to the same standards and animal welfare requirements as studies in the U.S.”

“American taxpayers shouldn’t fund animal cruelty, and the WATCH Act puts in place common-sense guardrails to ensure federal funds only go to organizations upholding strong animal welfare standards,” said Senator Jeff Merkley. “Our bipartisan bill is an important step forward to make sure NIH-funded studies meet consistent and enforceable animal welfare protections, regardless of where they are conducted.”

With this grant funding, the Port of Cleveland will implement the next phase of the Electrification and Net Zero Emissions Master Plan by deploying electric cargo handling equipment (including scrapping a portion of the existing diesel fleet), zero-emission vessels, and associated charging infrastructure and battery energy storage systems. Infrastructure for vessel shore power is included as well. The project also includes community outreach activities and workforce development through increased equipment and infrastructure maintenance jobs.

Ports are vital to the U.S. economy and are responsible for moving goods and people throughout the country. At the same time, the port and freight equipment responsible for moving goods including trucks, locomotives, marine vessels, and cargo-handling equipment contribute to significant levels of diesel air pollution at and near port facilities. This pollution is especially harmful to nearby communities’ health and contributes to climate change. These funds will improve air quality at the Port of Cleveland by installing clean, zero-emission freight and ferry technologies along with associated infrastructure.

The Port of Cleveland is one of the largest ports on the Great Lakes. Over 23,000 jobs are tied to the roughly 13 million tons of cargo that move through Cleveland Harbor each year. The Port of Cleveland is the only local government agency whose sole mission is to spur job creation and economic vitality in Cuyahoga County. The Port is an economic engine for our community, a key to Northeast Ohio’s global competitiveness, and a crucial partner in building Cuyahoga County’s future.

The funding for this project is anticipated to replace thirteen pieces of cargo handling equipment, two older generation diesel tugboats, add EV charging equipment and a new Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) with complimentary solar and shore power.

In conjunction with the development of the Master Plan, the Port has invested over $93.8M in infrastructure since 2015, with 75%+ of the cost covered by state and federal grants. Grant funds have supported various projects aimed at modernization, sustainability, and infrastructure development, which align with the broader program goals of reducing Port emissions and transitioning to ZE operations. Several recent coordination efforts are as follows:

The Port has secured $32M+ in federal and state grants for the rehabilitation and modernization of a key warehouse and electrical infrastructure upgrade at its General Cargo Terminal. This project included the development of the Master Plan, which developed the roadmap and project planning for the elements of this application. The grants for this project include $27.2M from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Maritime Administration (MARAD)’s PIDP and $4.9M from the Ohio DOT’s MAP.

In 2021, the Port completed improvements at its main gate to improve the security clearance process and truck turn time via U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Earmark OH302.

In collaboration with the Port, Omnitrax, the provider of switching rail services at the terminal, will deploy a fully Battery Electric (BE) locomotive later this year using Ohio EPA Diesel Mitigation Trust Fund funding. The new locomotive will reduce fuel consumption by 50% and Particulate Matter (PM) pollution by 77%.

In 2020, the Port received a grant from the U.S. DOT Maritime Administration (MARAD) to rehabilitate and improve two cargo docks at the Port on Lake Erie. This project helped improve the efficiency of port operations.

The Port has received two Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) grants to date, one in 2021 to replace tugboats and one in 2017 to replace a loader at the Port’s Cleveland Bulk Terminal. These grants amount to just under $1M.

During the Port’s Strategic Plan development, the Port conducted interviews with over 40 local stakeholder organizations, with specific questions regarding the Port’s community, social, and environmental impacts, as well as its communication regarding issues or concerns. Several themes arose from responses, including the need for additional equipment, namely another crane and reach stacker, concerns over the cost and reliability of electrified equipment, the desire for shore power infrastructure, and the pressure to reduce emissions to aid in companies’ Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) and Climate Action goals. The Project is expected to address all these themes.

To ensure the voices of all County residents are incorporated within the Project design, the Port has conducted engagement that has consisted of a public board meeting, as well as the distribution of a Project fact sheet through Port newsletters and social media. Additional community engagement will occur throughout Project delivery that will entail regular community updates and opportunities to provide feedback.",https://www.portofcleveland.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/favicon-16x16-1.png,N,,2026-01-20 17:59:57.802271

This review examines recent technological, regulatory, and market-driven developments in corn- and sugarcane-based ethanol production, with emphasis on advances realised between 2023 and 2025.

In corn ethanol systems, enzyme-enabled process enhancements have improved starch and fibre conversion efficiency, increasing ethanol yields without additional land use while simultaneously strengthening coproduct markets such as distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) and biochar. Parallel progress in carbon capture and storage has enabled ethanol producers to enter voluntary carbon markets, reducing lifecycle carbon intensity and improving economic resilience.

In sugarcane ethanol, the integration of second-generation (2G) pathways using agricultural residues has expanded operational windows and improved overall resource efficiency, while advances in genetic improvement techniques have accelerated yield gains and climate adaptability.

These technological developments have been reinforced by evolving blending mandates and renewable fuel policies in major markets, including Brazil, the European Union, and emerging aviation and marine fuel sectors.

Collectively, these changes explain the surge in investment and capacity expansion observed globally and signal a transition of ethanol from a compliance fuel towards a strategically optimised, low-carbon energy carrier. Understanding these converging drivers is essential for guiding future research, industrial deployment, and policy design in biofuel systems.

Introduction

The transport industry produces significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, such as CO₂ and methane.

These gases absorb and re-emit infrared radiation, trapping heat in the atmosphere and contributing to global warming and climate change. As a result, renewable and environmentally sustainable fuels are increasingly important.

Ethanol, derived from corn and sugarcane, is already widely used and, in some cases, mandated in the global fuel industry.

Corn and sugarcane are used to produce ethanol because they are rich in fermentable carbohydrates and have well-established production methods.

A factor limiting sugarcane’s global spread is the climate required for cultivation.

Recent advances in biofuel technology include improved enzymes, higher-yield crops and processes that use crop residues to boost yields.

These developments, alongside renewable energy and carbon-reduction efforts, are strengthening collaboration in the sector.

Despite these developments, there remains a need to examine and consolidate the latest progress in biofuel technologies, particularly over the past three years.

Therefore, this review highlights the major technological and sustainability-driven innovations in ethanol during this period. Understanding these advances is essential for future research, global sustainability, and industrial optimisation in the sector.

Advances in corn-based ethanol

2.1. Enzyme and process enhancement

Over the past three years, significant effort has been directed towards developing techniques to improve yield without expanding land use.

Enzyme technology is a key solution: specific enzymes are now applied directly to the crop or during processing, boosting DDGS (distillers’ dried grains) and ethanol production by facilitating more efficient breakdown of plant material, as shown in Table 1.

This technology is estimated to increase overall ethanol production by 10% [2]. Crucially, these enzymes require only a financial investment, as no additional machinery or space is needed to realise these gains.

2.2. Co-product valorisation

With the rise in biochar production, used in carbon removal technologies, the supply chain was unable to keep pace.

This necessitated expanded intake to support higher production. The expansion focused on residues produced by ethanol plants, which began selling these materials.

Even with ethanol production “waste” being used in biochar production, by 2024 approximately 62% of supply had already been sold, with 28% presold for 2026. This raised prices and generated additional revenue for ethanol producers.

Not only has biochar increased in price, but DDGS has risen as well and is expected to grow by 7.3% from 2025 to 2030, as shown in Figure 1.

This increase in value can be attributed to several factors: governments have begun requiring and encouraging the use of DDGS in livestock nutrition through subsidies and awareness campaigns.

Another factor is price, which is estimated to be 10–15% lower than soybeans, another widely used livestock meal.

To meet this demand, industries have begun investing in machinery upgrades, such as fractionation systems that remove fibre and increase digestibility, now being installed in distilleries [3].

2.3. Carbon intensity reduction

One method for distilleries to offset their environmental footprint is through government carbon credits.

These credits were once considered unattainable due to gas emissions. However, in 2024, the first ethanol plant voluntarily entered carbon markets [4]. Red Trail Energy laid the groundwork for future facilities.

In corn ethanol production, yeast ferments corn starch, producing ethanol, solids, and a high-purity carbon dioxide (CO₂) stream as by-products. The CO₂ that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere is captured.

Exhaust gas from fermentation vessels is directed to a capture facility, where it is purified, compressed into liquid form, and dehydrated to remove impurities.

The liquefied CO₂ is then transported through a flowline to an onsite injection well and injected into the Broom Creek Formation, a secure sandstone layer approximately 6,500 feet below the facility, where it is intended to be permanently stored [5,6].

Advances in sugarcane-based ethanol

3.1. 2G sugarcane

The integration of 2G production facilities with existing 1G mills involves using sugarcane residues, including leaves, bagasse, vinasse, and filter cake [7]. These residues are not fully utilised in 1G processes [8].

Including sugarcane bagasse also reduces the need for additional cultivation areas.

First-generation production occurs for only about nine to ten months per year. Including second-generation residues enables ethanol plants to operate year-round, thereby improving efficiency.

Investments in Brazil are also closely monitoring research into generating electrical energy from bagasse, as shown in Table 3 [9]. This could be essential for reducing future plant costs.

3.2. Genetic improvements

Genetically modified sugarcane traits aim to boost yield, pest resistance, and adaptability to new climates.

Methods such as CRISPR-based breeding and marker-assisted selection help improve traits while minimising unintended outcomes [10]. Classical breeding can take 15 to 17 years [11] and requires large quantities of plant material, much of which is wasted due to genetic or breeding failures.

With modern techniques, researchers can directly modify the genetic code of the plant, reducing the time required to achieve desired sugarcane traits.

Emerging trends and market effects - Laws mandating increased ethanol consumption

More countries, economic groups, and states are opening their energy systems to biofuels. Brazil has approved a law increasing ethanol content in petrol from 27.5% to 35% [12].

Biodiesel is rising from 15% to 25%. The most significant change is in aviation, with a 1% blend starting in 2027, rising to 10% in 2037 and increasing by 1% annually thereafter.

In Europe, the EU is finalising its ethanol blending policies, with a 2030 target of 5.5% renewable fuel [13].

In the US, there is no mandatory ethanol percentage, although financial regulations such as waivers influence consumer behaviour [14]. The transition from E10 to E15, along with expanded availability, further demonstrates growing demand.

Future demand for water and air

Biofuels are commonly used in land transport but less frequently in aviation and maritime sectors. This is beginning to change.

Cargo ships have started blending biodiesel onboard [16], improving fuel properties and usability. Ethanol’s higher solubility in water presents additional handling considerations.

MIT researchers are also developing aviation fuel from biomass [17], creating another pathway for broader biofuel adoption.

Beyond regulatory drivers, expanding use in maritime and aviation introduces challenges related to fuel handling, moisture control, and emissions. Ethanol-based fuels are more hygroscopic than petroleum fuels, requiring improved storage and monitoring systems.

Integrated fuel management strategies, including controlled blending, adaptive combustion tuning, and real-time quality monitoring, will support safe and efficient use. These developments indicate that future biofuel deployment depends not only on chemistry, but also on infrastructure and operational co-evolution.

Market reaction

Biofuel companies are actively positioning themselves for future growth. INPASA, Latin America’s largest biorefinery company, currently produces up to 5.6 billion litres of ethanol annually [19].

It owns the world’s largest biorefinery and plans further expansion, investing nearly one billion dollars into facility upgrades [20].

Their actions demonstrate confidence in the sector’s future. Financial markets increasingly factor carbon intensity and regulatory alignment into investment decisions. ~

Producers demonstrating emissions reductions and coproduct integration are better positioned for favourable financing.

The market is shifting towards scale and integration, with larger facilities benefiting from economies of scale and improved logistics.

As consolidation continues, standardisation and transparency are expected to increase. These trends confirm that biofuels are transitioning from a niche option to a mature component of global energy systems.

Conclusion

Between 2023 and 2025, the corn- and sugarcane-based ethanol sector has made clear progress through increased production, stronger coproduct markets, and supportive policies. Enzyme technologies have boosted ethanol output by approximately 10%.

Biochar accounted for 62% of 2024 supply, with 28% already sold for 2026. DDGS prices remain 10–15% lower than soybean prices and are expected to rise by 7.3% between 2025 and 2030.

For sugarcane ethanol, second-generation processes now enable year-round operation. Policy changes, including Brazil’s ethanol blend increase and the EU’s renewable fuel targets, demonstrate rising adoption.

These developments show that the sector is becoming more efficient, environmentally responsible, and economically competitive. Researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders can use these insights to further accelerate progress towards low-carbon transport. These factors collectively explain the growth in investment observed in the biofuel sector over the past three years.

,EVs,2026-01-20 20:03:23+00:00,Times Herald Online,California hits milestone in electric vehicle sales - Timesheraldonline.com,Paul Rogers,,,,,https://www.timesheraldonline.com/2026/01/20/california-hits-milestone-in-electric-vehicle-sales/,"For the past two decades, California has led the nation in electric vehicle sales.
“We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating the California electric vehicle mandate once and for all,” Trump said.
Trump tried to curb California’s electric vehicle rules and allow new offshore oil drilling in his first term from 2017 to 2021.
Two weeks ago, when he released his proposed state budget, Newsom included $200 million for a new electric vehicle rebate program.
“California isn’t slowing down, we’re still leading the pack,” said California Air Resources Board Chair Lauren Sanchez.","In 2012, when there were about 30,000 electric vehicles on the road in California, Tesla was a small new company that mostly appealed to hobbyists, and the Toyota Prius was still a rarely seen novelty in many areas, former Gov. Jerry Brown signed an executive order setting an audacious goal: 1.5 million EVs sold statewide by 2025.

There were lots of skeptics, given that Brown was calling for a 50-fold increase in the status quo. But as it turned out, California achieved it easily.

With the final sales numbers tallied for 2025, more than 2.5 million electric vehicles have been sold in California since 2012, according to data released Tuesday by the California Energy Commission.

“We invested in this future when others said it was impossible,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement.

Newsom highlighted the number — 2,551,121, to be exact — during his appearance Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

For the past two decades, California has led the nation in electric vehicle sales. The state has provided rebates, tax credits and other incentives as part of its efforts to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases.

As technology has improved, allowing much farther battery range — with many models able to travel more than 300 miles when fully charged — EV sales now make up 22.9% of all new car sales in California. Santa Clara County has the highest rate in the state, with 41.1% of all new vehicles sold being electric in 2025.

But electric vehicles face major headwinds. During the past year, President Trump has reversed or blocked many of the federal incentives put in place by former President Biden.

This past year, Trump and Republicans in Congress eliminated the federal tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of new electric vehicles. They let a law expire that allowed states to permit solo EV drivers to drive in carpool lanes on federally funded highways, ending that perk nationwide.

And in June, Trump signed a resolution blocking California’s first-in-the-nation regulations to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered passenger vehicles by 2035, which Newsom had put in place three years earlier.

Trump held a White House ceremony June 12, saying California’s rules limited consumer choice. He revoked federal permission for the ban, called a “waiver,” that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had given to California the previous year when President Biden was in office.

“We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating the California electric vehicle mandate once and for all,” Trump said. “They said it couldn’t be done. It’s had us tied in knots for years. They passed these crazy rules.”

Republicans said California’s rules were overly broad and would effectively set a national standard because the state is the largest car market in the United States and, under the Clean Air Act, other states are allowed to copy its rules.

Environmental groups and Democratic leaders said Trump’s rollbacks will lead to more air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and health problems for Californian residents.

Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit over the issue minutes after Trump acted. California was joined by 10 other states — Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. The lawsuit is pending.

During the fourth quarter of 2025, Californians bought 79,066 new EVs, representing 18.9% of new-car sales. That was a big drop from the third quarter, when EVs accounted for 29.1% of new car sales statewide. Experts and industry analysts noted the surge in EV sales in the weeks before Sept. 30, when the federal tax credits expired.

Even though two of the top three highest-selling vehicles of any kind in California last year were the Telsa Model Y and the Model 3, the other being the Toyota Camry, Tesla has seen some softening of sales in California. Some residents of the blue state, angry that Tesla CEO Elon Musk contributed $250 million to Trump’s re-election campaign and led an effort called DOGE to reduce federal staffing through firings and early retirements, have resisted buying Teslas, put stickers on them denouncing Musk, or purchased other EVs, like Hyundais, Hondas or Rivians instead.

Trump marked his first year anniversary of taking office Tuesday for his second term. The fight over electric vehicle rules stands as one of the major environmental clashes between his administration and California, alongside Trump’s proposal to allow new offshore oil drilling along the state’s coastline.

Trump tried to curb California’s electric vehicle rules and allow new offshore oil drilling in his first term from 2017 to 2021. But California sued in both cases; the lawsuits were pending when Biden took office, and Biden reversed Trump’s positions.

On Tuesday, Newsom, who is considering a run for president in 2028, cast Trump’s resistance to electric vehicles as putting the United States at a competitive disadvantage in a world where Europe, Japan, Canada, China, and other countries have passed similar laws to encourage the sale of electric vehicles, reduce oil consumption and phase out the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035 or 2040.

“While Washington now cedes the global clean vehicle market to China, California is ensuring American workers and manufacturers can compete and win in the industries that will define this century,” Newsom said Tuesday.

Two weeks ago, when he released his proposed state budget, Newsom included $200 million for a new electric vehicle rebate program. The plan still needs approval from state lawmakers. Details, including how much motorists will get, which cars are eligible and what income limits may apply, have not yet been drawn up.

But for the majority, the new rules represent a welcome change, promising both environmental benefits and significant savings.
As the nation continues its drive toward sustainability, these changes may well prove to be a turning point, making electric motoring more accessible and affordable for millions.","England’s drive toward a greener future just got a significant boost, as new regulations making it easier—and much cheaper—for homeowners to install electric vehicle (EV) chargers have come into force. These changes, introduced by the Labour government last May and taking effect in the summer of 2025, mean that drivers no longer need to submit planning applications to install EV chargepoints at home. It’s a move that could save motorists up to £1,100 a year, according to government officials and industry experts, and is already making waves across the country.

For years, the process of installing an EV charger at home was bogged down by red tape. Homeowners were required to apply for householder planning permission, a bureaucratic hurdle that often resulted in months of waiting, additional costs, and, frankly, a lot of headaches. Now, thanks to this regulatory overhaul, any homeowner in England can install a single wall-mounted or pedestal EV charger on their driveway without the need for planning permission—provided the unit doesn’t exceed 0.2 cubic meters in volume and is positioned at least two meters from the public highway.

“We’re cutting down on paperwork to power up the EV revolution so that drivers, businesses and those looking to make the switch will have more chargepoints to power from and less red tape to deal with,” said Lilian Greenwood, Labour Party minister, at the launch of the new rules. She emphasized the government’s commitment to making the transition to electric vehicles easier, cheaper, and better, pointing to over £2.3 billion in investments aimed at supporting drivers and British carmakers, as well as fueling job creation and economic growth through international trade deals.

The impact of these changes is already being felt. Lewis Gardiner, Operations Director at Osprey Charging Network, called the move “a hugely welcome and practical change that will make a real difference on the ground.” He explained, “Removing the need for planning permission for essential electrical infrastructure like substations across the majority of sites will save months of delays, reduce costs and accelerate the delivery of the rapid charging hubs drivers need. It’s the result of months of collaboration between industry and government and we’re proud to have played a key role in making it happen.”

Patrick Dunne, Sainsbury’s Chief Property and Procurement Officer and Managing Director of Smart Charge, echoed this sentiment. “Everyone at Smart Charge knows how important it is to make EV charging simple, reliable and accessible—both to make transport cleaner and to ensure we’re meeting the everyday needs of drivers throughout the UK. We welcome this new streamlined approach to installing charge points, which will help accelerate the nation’s adoption of EVs,” he said.

The government’s hope is that by making the installation process quicker and more affordable, more drivers will be encouraged to make the switch from petrol and diesel vehicles to electric ones. And with the potential to save up to £1,100 a year compared to running a traditional combustion engine vehicle, it’s a compelling case. According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the appetite for electric motoring is on the rise: there are now approximately 1.75 million purely electric vehicles in the UK, with 47,000 new EVs registered in 2025 alone—an 8% jump from the previous year.

However, it’s not all smooth sailing. While the new rules remove significant barriers, some restrictions remain in place. For instance, the regulations specify that charging units must not exceed 0.2 cubic meters in volume and must be set at least two meters from public roads. These technical requirements are designed to ensure safety and minimize visual clutter in residential areas.

There are also caveats for certain homeowners. Residents in leasehold accommodation may still face obstacles, as freeholders retain the authority to restrict modifications to properties. Likewise, some newly constructed housing developments have clauses in their title deeds that prevent alterations to a property’s exterior—potentially including the installation of charging points. For those who share driveways or access routes with neighbors, the process could be complicated by legal disagreements or the need for joint consent. These practical realities mean that, for some, the path to an at-home EV charger may still require negotiation and patience.

Despite these challenges, the overall direction is clear: the government and industry are working hand-in-hand to make electric vehicle adoption easier and more attractive. The removal of planning permission requirements is widely seen as a crucial step in accelerating the rollout of charging infrastructure—not just for private homes, but for public and business sites as well. As Gardiner of Osprey Charging Network pointed out, “It’s the result of months of collaboration between industry and government and we’re proud to have played a key role in making it happen.”

Industry leaders agree that the streamlined process will help address one of the biggest concerns for would-be EV owners: the availability and convenience of charging. Patrick Dunne of Smart Charge summed it up: “We welcome this new streamlined approach to installing charge points, which will help accelerate the nation’s adoption of EVs.”

For many, the financial incentive is hard to ignore. With the cost of running an electric vehicle now potentially £1,100 less per year than a petrol or diesel car, and with the process of getting a charger at home made vastly simpler, the barriers to entry are lower than ever. The government’s investment of over £2.3 billion in the sector is also expected to spur innovation and job creation, further embedding the UK’s commitment to a cleaner, greener transport future.

Still, the transition isn’t without its bumps. Leaseholders, residents of new developments with restrictive title deeds, and those with shared driveways may find themselves navigating a maze of permissions and legalities. But for the majority, the new rules represent a welcome change, promising both environmental benefits and significant savings.

With EV adoption climbing steadily—47,000 new electric vehicles registered in 2025 alone, according to SMMT data—the streamlined regulations are set to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of transport in England. As the nation continues its drive toward sustainability, these changes may well prove to be a turning point, making electric motoring more accessible and affordable for millions.

As England’s roads quietly shift from petrol power to electric hum, one thing is certain: the journey toward a cleaner, more efficient future just got a little easier for homeowners across the country.","https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/TC1bbgnq3nbWAVJrrxh76NUL-14=/1200x0/filters:format(webp):quality(85):sharpen(0.5,0.5,true)/tpg%2Fsources%2F97a5514d-9a7a-481a-a6e0-69f40c96e036.jpeg",N,,2026-01-20 14:59:49.866538

From supporting energy development and assessing critical minerals potential to expanding scientific understanding of deep-sea environments, BOEM helped shape a more secure and informed offshore energy future.

Take a deep dive into our biggest achievements from 2025:

Oil and Gas Energy

In 2025, BOEM advanced U.S. energy development by conducting a landmark oil and gas lease sale, proposing new offshore lease sales, releasing a new and expansive National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program, and updating our Outer Continental Shelf planning areas for oil and gas.

Advancing Offshore Energy Development with a Landmark Lease Sale: We successfully conducted Lease Sale Big Beautiful Gulf 1, which was the first offshore oil and gas lease sale required under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The sale generated $300,425,222 in high bids for 181 blocks across 80 million acres in federal waters of the Gulf of America. Thirty companies submitted 219 bids totaling $371,881,093.

Driving Energy Production with a Proposed Second Gulf of America Lease Sale in March 2026: To strengthen U.S. energy dominance, we proposed a second Gulf of America Lease Sale. This sale is the second of thirty Gulf of America oil and gas lease sales required by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Expanding Energy Development in Alaska’s Cook Inlet: We published the Proposed Notice of Sale for Big Beautiful Cook Inlet 1 (BBC1), which would make approximately one million acres available for leasing in Alaska’s Cook Inlet. This marks the first of at least six Cook Inlet lease sales required by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, scheduled annually from 2026 to 2028, and from 2030 to 2032.

Proposing a New National OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program: In response to the National Energy Emergency, we released the first proposal of a new, expansive 11th National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program. This proposal reflects our continued commitment to restore American Energy Dominance and address the nation’s growing energy needs.

Refining Our Outer Continental Shelf Planning Areas for Oil and Gas: We updated our Outer Continental Shelf planning areas for oil and gas management, increasing the total from 26 to 27. This included creating a new High Arctic Planning Area and revising other areas to reflect recent changes in U.S. OCS jurisdictional limits.

Marine Minerals

In 2025, we unleashed America's offshore critical minerals and resources by implementing the directives of Executive Order 14285 . Some examples include:

Taking Action to Unlock Potential Marine Minerals Offshore Virginia: We launched the process for a potential mineral lease sale for heavy mineral sands and other mineral deposits in federal waters off the coast of Virginia. This action—only the third of its kind in more than three decades—represented a significant step toward unlocking the mineral potential of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf and reinforcing the nation’s economic and strategic independence.

Advancing Beach Nourishment and Coastal Protection Projects: BOEM supported the use of Outer Continental Shelf sand in beach nourishment and coastal protection projects in North Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana.

Charting the Future for Potential Offshore Minerals in American Samoa: Offshore American Samoa, we explored the potential for seabed mineral leasing and invited public comments on a possible minerals lease sale—this could be the first mineral lease sale in federal waters in over 30 years! We also completed area identification to determine which specific parts of the Outer Continental Shelf offshore American Samoa will undergo environmental review for proposed commercial leases for critical minerals.

Exploring Potential Offshore Minerals in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands: BOEM invited the public to submit comments on a potential minerals lease sale offshore the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. At this initial stage in the planning process, public input helps ensure that BOEM’s decision-making is locally and scientifically informed.

Renewable Energy

Throughout 2025, BOEM supported efforts to advance the Administration’s offshore wind objectives and enhance oversight of offshore wind activities to promote dependable, American-made energy. We worked to align offshore wind regulations with America’s energy priorities and acted on directives to reduce preferential treatment for unreliable, foreign-controlled energy sources. BOEM also supported the Administration’s efforts to ensure that offshore wind projects do not endanger the environment, U.S. national security, and economic interests.

Environment

In 2025, BOEM supported the responsible and innovative management of offshore development by conducting environmental research and analysis for offshore oil and gas, critical minerals, and sand resources.

Conducting Deep-Sea Research Off Hawaiʻi: This past fall, BOEM scientists explored the remote abyssal plains south of Hawaiʻi Island – one of Earth’s least explored environments – with members from the U.S. Geological Survey. During the expedition, the scientists focused on the large, crescent-shaped area of the abyssal plain, known as the “Hawaiian crescent,” mapping the seafloor, studying the deep-sea environment, and exploring for critical minerals, all while honoring the cultural significance of Moananuiākea.

Deepening Our Knowledge of Alaska’s Offshore Ecosystems: This past summer, BOEM researchers joined the U.S. Geological Survey on a deep-sea expedition along Alaska’s Aleutian Arc to gather vital data on critical marine minerals and deep-sea ecosystems. During the expedition, the scientists collected biological samples, high-resolution seafloor maps, and video footage of the seafloor, all helping to fill critical knowledge gaps in Alaska’s offshore ecosystems.

Exploring the Deep: BOEM, USGS and NOAA Join Forces in the Mariana Arc: This past spring, BOEM, USGS and NOAA Occean Exploration came together to support the Ocean Exploration Trust’s Exploration Vessel Nautilus on a mission to study the remote and volcanically active waters around Guam and the Mariana Arc. The 21-day expedition mapped the seafloor, investigated underwater volcanoes, and collected important data on ecosystems found in extreme deep ocean conditions. These unique habitats may hold critical minerals vital for modern technologies, making this research essential in supporting resource management priorities.

Hello, 2026!

As we embark on 2026, we remain committed to managing offshore energy, marine mineral and geological resources in a responsible way, while supporting environmental and economic sustainability.

Building on last year’s momentum, we are looking forward to continuing to strengthen America’s energy future and making a splash in the year ahead!",https://www.boem.gov/sites/default/files/images/BOEM_Logo_OpenGraph.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 14:59:52.398085

“Energy and geopolitics were always interwoven but I have never ever seen that the energy security risks are so multiplied,” he said.
But Payne defended data centres’ electricity use, arguing that it provides more “economic output per electron” than industries like steel or oil.","The annual World Economic Forum got underway on Tuesday in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, providing a snowy stage for government and business leaders to opine on international affairs. With attention focused on the latest crisis – a potential US-European trade war over Greenland – climate change has slid down the agenda.

Despite this, a number of panels are addressing issues like electric vehicles, energy security and climate science. Keep up with top takeaways from those discussions and other climate news from Davos in our bulletin, which we’ll update throughout the day.

From oil to electrons – energy security enters a new era

Energy crises spurred by geopolitical tensions are nothing new – remember the 1970s oil shock spurred by the embargo Arab producers slapped on countries that had supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War, leading to rocketing inflation and huge economic pain.

But, a Davos panel on energy security heard, the situation has since changed. Oil now accounts for less than 30% of the world’s energy supply, down from more than 50% in 1973. This shift, combined with a supply glut, means oil is taking more of a back seat, according to International Energy Agency boss Fatih Birol.

Instead, in an “age of electricity” driven by transport and technology, energy diplomacy is more focused on key elements of that supply chain, in the form of critical minerals, natural gas and the security buffer renewables can provide. That requires new thinking, Birol added.

“Energy and geopolitics were always interwoven but I have never ever seen that the energy security risks are so multiplied,” he said. “Energy security, in my view, should be elevated to the level of national security today.”

In this context, he noted how many countries are now seeking to generate their own energy as far as possible, including from nuclear and renewables, and when doing energy deals, they are considering not only costs but also whether they can rely on partners in the long-term.

In the case of Europe – which saw energy prices jump after sanctions on Russian gas imports in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine – energy security rooted in homegrown supply is a top priority, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in Davos on Tuesday.

Outlining the bloc’s “affordable energy action plan” in a keynote speech at the World Economic Forum, she emphasised that Europe is “massively investing in our energy security and independence” with interconnectors and grids based on domestically produced sources of power.

The EU, she said, is trying to promote nuclear and renewables as much as possible “to bring down prices and cut dependencies; to put an end to price volatility, manipulation and supply shocks,” calling for a faster transition to clean energy.

“Because homegrown, reliable, resilient and cheaper energy will drive our economic growth and deliver for Europeans and secure our independence,” she added.

China pitches itself as clean energy champion

While the US under President Donald Trump doubles down on fossil fuels and retreats from international climate bodies, China is openly pitching itself as the flagbearer of the clean energy transition and multilateralism.

In Davos, the country’s Vice-Premier He Lifeng invited nations and companies from across the world to “embrace the opportunities from the green and low-carbon transition” by working closely with China.

He boasted about China’s dominance of the global cleantech industry where it controls vast parts of the supply chain – from critical mineral processing to the manufacturing of finished products such as solar panels and electric vehicles.

At ‘Davos of mining’, Saudi Arabia shapes new narrative on minerals

At the same time, He Lifeng told leaders in Davos that Beijing wants to share these opportunities with the world and called on partners to “ensure the free flow of quality green products globally”.

Western nations, including the European Union, have imposed hefty tariffs on Chinese cleantech in an attempt to protect their home-grown businesses from what they regard as unfair competition. But there are signs of those trade tensions easing. Canada announced last week it would let 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the country under a much reduced tariff as part of a sweeping trade deal.

He Lifeng also reaffirmed Beijing’s commitment to achieve for the first time an absolute emissions reduction target by 2035 and to peak its carbon emissions by the end of this decade, as laid out in the country’s latest climate plan.

He described this plan as “a testament to China’s firm resolve and maximum efforts”, although climate experts believe Beijing’s promise to cut emissions by between 7% and 10% by 2035 against an unspecified peak level is weak and unambitious.

In the month that saw the US announce its intention to withdraw from the UN climate convention (UNFCCC), He Lifeng confirmed China’s engagement in climate diplomacy. “China will work with all other Parties to fully and effectively implement the UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement, and uphold the multilateral process,” he said.

AES boss calls for “more technical talk” on supply chains

Earlier, the energy security panel tackled the risks related to supply chains for clean energy and electrification, which are being partly fuelled by rising demand from data centres and electric vehicles.

The minerals and metals that are required for batteries, cables and other components are largely under the control of China, which has invested massively in extracting and processing those materials both at home and overseas. Efforts to boost energy security by breaking dependence on China will continue shaping diplomacy now and in the future, the experts noted.

Copper – a key raw material for the energy transition – is set for a 70% increase in demand over the next 25 years, said Mike Henry, CEO of mining giant BHP, with remaining deposits now harder to exploit. Prices are on an upward trend, and this offers opportunities for Latin America, a region rich in the metal, he added.

At ‘Davos of mining’, Saudi Arabia shapes new narrative on minerals

Andrés Gluski, CEO of AES – which describes itself as “the largest US-based global power company”, generating and selling all kinds of energy to companies – said there is a lack of discussion about supply chains compared with ideological positioning on energy sources.

Instead he called for “more technical talk” about boosting battery storage to smooth out electricity supply and using existing infrastructure “smarter”. While new nuclear technologies such as small modular reactors are promising, it will be at least a decade before they can be deployed effectively, he noted.

In the meantime, with electricity demand rising rapidly, the politicisation of the debate around renewables as an energy source “makes no sense whatsoever”, he added.

BYD exec says EV batteries will make mining CEOs happy

A top BYD executive told the head of a mining company that the rise of electric vehicles (EVs) will make him the “happiest person” because “we’re going to consume a lot of copper, a lot of lithium, a lot of different mining”.

Stella Li, executive vice-president of the world’s biggest electric car company, made the comments to Vale’s CEO Gustavo Pimenta during a panel entitled “Can EVs really dominate?” on Tuesday morning.

EV batteries typically use copper, lithium, nickel and manganese. While these minerals and metals are mined around the world, they are mainly processed in BYD’s home country of China, a dominance that alarms Western powers.

Push for global minerals deal meets opposition, more talks agreed

Climate Home News has highlighted numerous environmental and social problems associated with the mining of these critical raw materials in its Clean Energy Frontier series. Doctors in Chile claim that a copper mine is causing autism, while lithium miners in Nigeria face physical dangers and bad pay.

From the audience, the head of the global IndustriALL trade union Atle Høie said he knows the transition to EVs is “coming” but “mining is still ridden with exploitation” and “minerals are coming from countries where human rights are very poorly developed”.

Pimenta said he wanted mining to be cheap and fast but also ethical, with minerals that can be traced, human rights policies implemented and mines using less land and water. He said Vale was looking at recovering materials from mining waste piles instead of digging new mines.

He added that he didn’t want competitors with low ethical standards because “it’s not a level playing field”, highlighting the need to “rebuild the reputation of the mining industry” in order to convince society to let mining projects go ahead.

He and BYD’s Li played down fears of an under-supply of minerals like copper and lithium, saying sustained and predictable demand would encourage more supply. Li noted there had been a shortage of lithium copper oxide during the COVID-19 pandemic but then the price shot up by a factor of 30 and “suddenly” reserves were found in new countries.

Self-taught mechanics give second life to Jordan’s glut of spent EV batteries

Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan – a major US car-producing state – told the panel that Americans still need both EVs and polluting internal combustion engine vehicles, as seen at the recent Detroit Auto Show.

Whitmer, a Democrat, criticised the US federal government for “back and forth policies” which have made it more difficult for the car industry to go all in and ramp up in the way Chinese firms have been able to.

BYD’s Li said that, unlike China, “some countries” – which she did not name – have gone “back and forth” and “this will confuse manufacturing”.

“Nuclear renaissance” predicted to power AI data centres

The need for clean but reliable electricity to power data centres is likely to lead to a “nuclear renaissance”, according to participants on a panel on artificial intelligence.

Sweden’s centre-right energy minister Ebba Busch told the panel that while Sweden is “still loving renewables”, wind and solar can not provide the kind of power available on demand that is needed to run data centres around the clock because they are too variable. To provide clean, reliable electricity, she said, Sweden is “doing a nuclear renaissance”.

Fellow panellist Joshua Payne – founder of a company called Nscale, which builds and owns data centres – agreed that a nuclear renaissance was “very likely” in the early 2030s. But he also added that northern Norway is the best place to build data centres because it has an oversupply of clean and reliable hydropower electricity.

As Bloom Energy CEO KR Sridhar noted, data centres often consume more electricity than big industrial users like aluminium smelters or petrochemical refiners. Like these industrial sites, data centres will soon be forced by governments to “bring your own power” rather than continuing to free ride from the grid, Sridhar said.

But Payne defended data centres’ electricity use, arguing that it provides more “economic output per electron” than industries like steel or oil. This means it’s better for the economy to use electricity for data centres than other energy-intensive sectors, he argued.

Panellists discussed whether AI will become more energy efficient in future, perhaps due to shortages of computing memory forcing companies to use memory more efficiently and therefore use less electricity. Or because the theory of artificial general intelligence is flawed and a more energy-efficient model of AI – such as that championed by China – will emerge.",https://www.climatechangenews.com/wp-content/files/2026/01/55047490036_b2d16c3375_c.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 16:59:13.029011

The group will meet publicly at least once a month and focus on studying data center citing decisions, according to Kotek’s news release.","Oregon’s governor is organizing a new committee of advisers to weigh in on issues rising from the rapid growth of data centers in the state.

Gov. Tina Kotek announced the new Data Center Advisory Committee on Tuesday and named seven members, who will provide policy recommendations to her and the Legislature no later than October 2026.

Kotek and state lawmakers will use those to create regulations, most likely aimed at where data centers can be built, according to a news release from Kotek’s office. The regulations would aim to protect energy infrastructure and water supplies from being overburdened by the privately run data and AI processing centers, which require massive amounts of energy to run and water for cooling.

“Oregonians have made their concerns about rising utility bills clear. As our state faces rapid growth of data facilities, we must have frank conversations about the challenges and opportunities ahead,” Kotek said in a statement. “I expect the Data Center Advisory Committee to help ensure economic growth while protecting affordable power and Oregon’s critical water resources.”

Oregon’s data center market is among the largest in the nation, according to Chicago-based commercial real estate group Cushman & Wakefield. Access to relatively clean, cheap hydroelectricity in the region and a lack of sales tax, along with billions of dollars in property tax incentives, helped lure the companies.

But the decision to offer those property tax incentives and site a data center is largely a local one, made at the city and county level. The Data Center Advisory Committee is the state’s first big foray into setting data center policy, following several laws that passed in 2025 meant to curb rising electricity rates driven by data centers.

As the giant data complexes expanded across the state during the last several years, energy rates rose on all customer classes served by the state’s private, investor-owned utilities. For residential customers, rates have gone up an average of 50% in the last five years.

Between 2013 and 2023, Oregon’s overall electricity consumption rose by more than 20%, according to a Sightline Institute analysis of U.S. Energy Information Administration data.

“Data centers undoubtedly drove a major share, if not almost all, of this growth,” analysts wrote.

In the next two decades, demand for electricity in the Northwest could double, and demand from data centers is expected to outpace demand from the growing use of electric vehicles until 2046, according to regional energy experts.

Kotek appointed as committee chairs Margaret Hoffmann and Michael Jung. Hoffman is also a member of the Northwest Power and Conservation Council, former energy policy adviser to Oregon governors John Kitzhaber and Kate Brown and former rural development director for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Oregon. Jung is an environmental policy executive and director of the ICF Climate Center, an international tech and energy consultancy.

Other commission members are:

Dan Dorran, chair of the Umatilla County Commission. Umatilla has sited a large number of Amazon data centers in the last decade that have caused 554% demand growth at the Umatilla Electric Cooperative, according to Sightline’s analysis.

Greg Dotson, an energy and environmental law expert at the University of Oregon.

Bill Edmunds, a former private utility executive who teaches energy and business courses at Portland State University and the University of Portland.

Tim Miller, director of the nonprofit industry group Oregon Business For Climate.

Jean Wilson, a renewable energy executive and former president of the nonprofit Oregon Environmental Council.

The group will meet publicly at least once a month and focus on studying data center citing decisions, according to Kotek’s news release. They’ll look at regulations to support how and where data centers could be built to spur “responsible economic development” and job creation, without overburdening local energy and water supplies in the rural communities they tend to be built in.",https://bendbulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2026/01/QTS-Data-Centers-in-Hillsboro-on-Oct.-11-2024.-Oregon-Gov.-Tina-Kotek-created-a-new-advisory-co.jpg?w=729,N,,2026-01-20 14:59:44.130106

The bill also rejects President Trump’s proposal to prohibit funding for wind, solar, and battery projects.","WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, secured funding for high-impact, local public projects and Michigan priorities in the Fiscal Year 2026 Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act that passed the Senate. The bipartisan legislation includes funding for protecting the Great Lakes, continued construction of the Soo Locks, strengthening our power grid, and flood prevention. The bill now heads to the President’s desk to be signed into law.

“This bipartisan legislation delivers crucial investments that will support Michigan’s economy and help protect our Great Lakes and precious freshwater assets,” said Senator Peters. “I was proud to secure funding in the bill to build more resilient infrastructure, bolster clean energy production, and advance research that keeps our state at the forefront of innovation.”

The bill includes numerous measures led and supported by Peters, including:

Strengthening Critical Infrastructure

Robust Funding for Soo Locks Construction: Peters secured $176.6 million in the bill for the Soo Locks construction project. This funding will support ongoing construction of the new Poe-sized lock. Peters has prioritized securing the funding necessary to build the new lock. Last year, through his role on the Appropriations Committee, he secured more than $264 million through government funding legislation. In 2024, he toured the ongoing construction project after helping to secure $257.4 million for the project. In January 2022, Peters also helped to secure $479 million for modernizing the Soo Locks through the bipartisan infrastructure law.

Brandon Road Lock and Dam Funding: Peters secured $28 million for construction of numerous measures to counter invasive carp at the Brandon Road Lock and Dam, a critical choke point for halting the continued spread of invasive carp and preventing them from establishing in the Great Lakes.

Supporting U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: The bill provides over $10 billion for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to support critical projects that strengthen our nation’s waterways and protect communities from extreme weather events.

Strengthening Michigan Ports and Harbors: The bill provides a historic more than $3 billion, a $702 million increase over fiscal year 2025, to improve navigation and commerce on our nation’s waterways, including the Great Lakes. The bill also includes funding for inland waterway navigation projects, which help improve the transport of important commodities like grain, iron, and petroleum.

Protecting the Great Lakes, Access to Clean Water

Replacing Lead Service Lines in Detroit: Peters secured $9 million in funding for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to replace lead service lines throughout the City of Detroit, helping to ensure safe drinking water and public health.

Great Lakes Authority: The bill includes $5 million for the Great Lakes Authority (GLA), one of ten federal regional commissions that seek to address major economic distress in certain geographic regions. The funding will be used to make targeted investments in economically distressed communities across the Great Lakes Basin, helping to ensure communities throughout the region have access to quality public infrastructure, job training opportunities, and the general tools necessary for economic prosperity. The GLA encompasses counties throughout eight states: Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania, and Indiana.

Great Lakes Coastal Resiliency Study: The bill provides the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers with $3 million to continue conducting its Great Lakes Coastal Resiliency Study, which is developing a coordinated strategy and identifying aging infrastructure to protect 5,200 miles of Great Lakes coastline against flooding and erosion.

Bolstering U.S. Manufacturing and Innovation, Michigan’s Automotive Sector

Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB): The bill provides $110 million for FRIB operations and $15 million for the construction of the High Rigidity Spectrometer (HRS). The facility is housed at Michigan State University. The rare isotopes produced at FRIB will allow nuclear scientists and researchers to explore a range of potential applications in the fields such as energy, medicine, and national security, including diagnosing and curing diseases, improving next generation nuclear reactors for energy, and finding processes to destroy nuclear waste. Once completed, HRS will enable isotope harvesting and substantially increase FRIB’s scientific reach and productivity.

Supporting Scientific Discovery: The bill provides $8.4 billion in funding for the Office of Science. The Office of Science is the largest federal sponsor of basic research in the physical sciences and supports 22,000 researchers at 17 national laboratories and more than 300 universities, including in Michigan. The bill will advance research in the highest priorities including high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, biology, and clean energy to maintain and strengthen our global competitiveness. The bill also boosts funding for the Office’s work on artificial intelligence and advanced computing to help the Department of Energy implement the Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence for Science, Security, and Technology (FASST) initiative.

Renewable Energy: The bill provides $3.1 billion for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs that support all types of research, including into advanced manufacturing and building and industrial decarbonization. The bill rejects President Trump’s proposed cut of over $2.5 billion for this research, as well as his proposal to zero out funding for critical solar, wind, and hydrogen research programs. The bill maintains vital investments to bolster energy and manufacturing supply chains to help ensure our continued global leadership in energy technologies.

Protecting Our Energy Grid: The bill provides $190 million to help ensure the continued success of the Department of Energy’s programs aimed at strengthening the security and resilience of our energy sector and grid. It also provides robust funding for both the Office of Electricity and the Grid Deployment Office, rejecting President Trump’s proposed merger of the two offices. The bill will also support upgrades to critical electrical grid infrastructure, an essential investment when energy costs are skyrocketing due to President Trump’s policies, including the termination of renewable energy projects across the country.

Tribal Energy: The bill provides funding for the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs. The bill also rejects President Trump’s proposal to prohibit funding for wind, solar, and battery projects. This funding will help electrify the 30,000 Tribal homes that currently do not have access to power.

I look forward to partnering with President Trump to deliver real results for California’s Central Valley in the years ahead.”","WASHINGTON, D.C. — One year ago today, President Donald J. Trump took the oath of office, becoming the 47th President of the United States. In just one year, his administration has secured the border, unleashed domestic energy, and put America back in charge on the world stage.

Members of the Republican Study Committee (RSC) celebrated President Trump’s first-year accomplishments and the results he has delivered for American families.

""One year in, and President Trump proved what we already knew: weakness invites chaos, strength delivers results. Under his leadership, American workers gained back $1,100 in real wages that President Biden's policies destroyed, manufacturing is surging, and new jobs are going to U.S. citizens instead of illegal aliens. And it's not just our economy that's winning again. Our adversaries are contained and our country is leading from a position of strength again. The world knows America is back. Promises made, promises kept!"" said RSC Chairman August Pfluger (TX-11).

“One year into the Trump 2.0 Administration, we’ve seen bold leadership that has delivered lower taxes, stronger borders, renewed energy independence, and historic support for our military and law enforcement. President Trump has kept his promises to the American people, strengthening our economy, defending our freedoms, and holding the line against radical policies that hurt our nation. I’m proud of what we’ve achieved so far, and I look forward to the work ahead to secure a more prosperous future for all Americans,"" said RSC Vice-Chair Ben Cline (VA-06).

“Today we mark year one of President Trump restoring American momentum after years of chaos and decline. Lower costs, unleashing American energy, a secure border, and safer communities prove that real leadership gets real results. America is back!” said RSC Messaging Task Force Chair Mark Alford (MO-04).

“One year ago, President Trump took office with a bold vision to restore economic opportunity for working families and strengthen American competitiveness. That vision is now delivering real results — bigger paychecks, rising wages, and a stronger economy. GDP growth is beating expectations, inflation is moderating, and thanks to pro-working families policies, Americans are better able to afford the essentials of daily life. Republicans in Congress will continue working alongside the Trump Administration to build on this progress by supporting American workers and families, and expanding opportunity across the country,” said House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith (MO-08).

“In just one year of President Trump back in the White House and working with a Republican Congress, the people of North Texas have enjoyed incredible success with lower costs, rising wages that are beating inflation, and they are looking forward to massive tax refunds to help their families keep $1,000 to $2,000 more of what they earn. The Texas border with Mexico has never been more secure and as we are continuing to deport hundreds of thousands of criminal aliens brought in by Joe Biden's open border policies, cities and communities throughout Texas are safer for our families and small businesses. This past year of responsible governance and conservative reforms has helped us set the stage for a cycle of virtuous economic growth that will strengthen our hardworking families and deliver much deserved prosperity for their futures,” said RSC Budget and Spending Task Force Chair Beth Van Duyne (TX-24).

""One year ago, President Trump returned to the White House with a historic mandate to rebuild American strength at home and abroad. In just 12 months, we've worked with the administration to deliver a secure southern border, the lowest gas prices in five years, historic tax relief for working families, and renewed American leadership on the world stage. The path forward is clear: stay focused on commonsense solutions that lower costs for families and advance peace through strength around the globe,” said RSC National Security Task Force Chair Zach Nunn (IA-03).

“In just one year, President Trump has delivered on the mandate the American people gave on Nov. 5th, 2024. He ended the failed policies from Biden and the Democrats — policies that fueled crushing inflation, allowed millions of illegal criminals to pour into our communities, and pushed radical gender ideology into our schools, sports, and institutions. I am honored to serve with President Trump and to be in the fight to secure our borders, restore prosperity, protect our children, and save the future of our country. AND THE BEST IS YET TO COME!” said RSC Emerging Technologies Chair Kat Cammack (FL-03).

""One year since President Trump's inauguration and congressional Republicans continue to renew their commitment to putting taxpayers first and restoring fiscal discipline. The One Big Beautiful Bill reflects that effort and shows what can happen when the White House and Congress work together to deliver real solutions. I fought to include priorities that directly benefit hardworking families, including a strong child tax credit and support for rural hospitals. Those provisions matter. They help parents keep more of what they earn and ensure that families in rural communities can continue to access care close to home,"" said Rep. Robert Aderholt (AL-04). ""The contrast after one year is undeniable. We have moved from excuses to action, from chaos to order, and from a Washington that too often protects itself into a government that is being forced to answer to the American people again. This anniversary is more than a milestone. It is proof that leadership matters. When a President enforces the law, defends our sovereignty, stands up for taxpayers, and leads with strength on the world stage, America wins. President Trump’s first year back in office has shown what is possible when we put America first, and we are just getting started,” said Values Action Team Chairman Robert Aderholt (AL-04).

“We can sum up President Trump’s first year in one word: results. From slashing wasteful spending and securing our border to unleashing energy dominance and jumpstarting our economy, the President has delivered with massive tax cuts and a rollback on burdensome red tape. This first year has been defined by historic speed to reverse the failures of the previous administration—promises made, promises kept. I look forward to continue working with President Trump and my House colleagues to keep America moving forward and make our nation great again,” said Rep. Aaron Bean (FL-04).

“In just one year, President Trump has secured our border, eliminated woke DEI ideology from our military, jump-started the economy by cutting red tape and unleashing American energy, and restored America’s leadership on the world stage. It’s an honor to work alongside President Trump to advance this conservative agenda. The best is yet to come,”said Rep. Chip Roy (TX-21).

“President Trump saved this country from a socialist, Marxist left and delivered historic tax cuts for working families, defunded Planned Parenthood, restored Second Amendment rights by zeroing out the NFA tax, and secured our border. Reconciliation 2.0 is the next step, building on those wins by lowering health care and housing costs, unleashing American energy, and making the American Dream real again,” said Rep. Eric Burlison (MO-07).

“In just this first year, President Trump and Republicans in Congress have secured the border, ended tax on tips, eliminated wasteful spending, fought fraud, and in the case of Arizona's 8th Congressional District, brought in more high-paying tech jobs, laying the necessary groundwork to make the American Dream affordable again,"" stated Congressman Abe Hamadeh. ""We have done this despite constant obstruction from Democrats, who repeatedly show they are more interested in exploiting the struggles of hard-working Americans to advance failed policies and fund the livelihoods of illegal immigrants,” said Rep. Abe Hamadeh (AZ-08).

“One year into President Trump’s administration, America is moving in the right direction. Policies that put American workers and families first are delivering results at home, while peace through strength is restoring credibility and stability abroad. The best is yet to come as we continue advancing economic growth, security, and opportunity for the American people,” said Rep. Claudia Tenney (NY-24).

“In the year since President Trump took office, we have seen amazing success at our border. I will continue to push to codify President Trump’s executive orders that have enabled this historic change. Thank you, President Trump, for your leadership and for making the border secure again,” said Rep. Michael Guest (MS-03).

“One year into President Trump’s second term, the momentum is undeniable. With another reconciliation package on the horizon, we’re pushing forward bold, commonsense reforms to strengthen the economy, secure the border, and put American families first. This is how you deliver results and we’re just getting started,” said Rep. Ralph Norman (SC-05).

“In just one year, President Trump has undone the damage caused by the Biden autopen presidency and made America respected again on the global stage,” said Rep. Stutzman. “Terrorists are on the run, our economy is on the rise, and there are still three years to go! The Golden Age of America is upon us,” said Rep. Marlin Stutzman (IN-03).

“What a difference a year makes. One year after President Trump laid out a clear plan in his inauguration address, that plan is being executed and delivering results. Under President Biden, the country faced numerous failures, including a broken border, weakened energy production, runaway inflation, heavy regulations, declining military recruitment, reckless spending, and global instability. Under President Trump, the border is being secured, American energy is back, delivering lower gas prices, inflation has decreased, wages are increasing, and families are keeping more of their paycheck. Burdensome regulations are being rolled back, allowing businesses to grow. Military recruitment is surging, wasteful spending is decreasing, and waste, fraud, and abuse are being eliminated. Accountability is being restored. Abroad, the U.S. is once again pursuing peace through strength and restoring credibility. With pro-growth policies, deregulation, and investment, the economy has real momentum, with growth projected to exceed 4%. It has been a strong year, and we are just getting started. My bipartisan message is simple: Democrats must stop the political posturing and focus on governing, because it is time to build a stronger America together,” said Rep. Dan Meuser (PA-09).

“Today marks one year of America’s golden age,” said Rep. Troy Nehls (TX-22). “In just 365 days, we now have the most secure border in history, gas prices are down, taxes have been cut, we are once again respected on the world stage, our communities are safer, and waste, fraud, and abuse have been eliminated. Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, our country is doing better than ever before, and I’m proud to stand with President Trump and my House Republican colleagues in working to Make America Great Again.”

“It’s been one year since President Trump’s historic return to the White House,” said Rep. Vince Fong (CA-20). “In record time, he secured the border, lowered costs, spurred economic growth, and rooted out waste, fraud, and abuse across the federal government. For the Central Valley, that means fighting for reliable water supplies and more energy production. Policies that put working families, farmers, and small businesses first. I look forward to partnering with President Trump to deliver real results for California’s Central Valley in the years ahead.”",https://republicanstudycommittee.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicanstudycommittee.house.gov/files/evo-media-image/AP-PRESSER_0.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 14:59:32.088859

From my understanding, it was sort of last minute as far as the actual invite, this has been in the works for a while as far as governors working with the White House, including Democrats, Wes Moore of Maryland was the other Democrat in attendance, but it was pretty interesting to sort of see them all come together and call on PGM to take action.

Now, PJM doesn’t have to do anything. What’s interesting, I mean, clearly there’s a political element of this. I think the governors and the White House see a reason to be seen as responsive to rising electricity prices, which I’m sure will get more into, has become a really potent political issue. And there’s a lot of questions, I think in talking to experts with some of my colleagues around actually implementing this and what it would take. But to see all these folks at the White House with very disagreements around broader energy policy and the types of generation we should be building, I thought was pretty noteworthy.

Bill Loveless (05:09): Yeah, yeah, certainly affordability, right? That’s sort of the political watchword these days on so many issues. And in electricity, the concerns over rising prices, they’ve gone up, what about 7% in the United States over the past year. And so politically it’s a big issue as well as for the pocketbook. Josh, I know there’s a lot of uncertainty at this point, but I mean, do some see this as what it will take to achieve some sort of breakthrough in terms of providing reliable but affordable sources of electricity for not only data centers, but for the general public?

Josh Siegel (05:45): I mean, I think people seem to think it’s a show of force that really we haven’t seen that’s like, okay, people recognize how big of a problem this is. So in that aspect it’s positive. But as far as any immediate impact, how quickly would PJM act on this, if at all? Would they have a different interpretation of what to do? We know how long it takes to build power plants in this country. Permitting I’m sure we’ll get into is a challenge, so I don’t think you would see any immediate relief for this, but it’s sort of more to show that folks are taking action. There’s bipartisan interest in doing so. I think a lot of questions are around does FERC, so PJM would have to file a filing with FERC. We know that the FERC has been a huge priority of this administration to sort of see FERC as an avenue to move their energy agenda for chair. Laura Swett was in attendance at this event. So I think that was sort of telling to show, okay, they see a need here to maybe act on this if PJM again were to proceed, but a lot of questions as far as how quickly you would see something like this actually be implemented and take effect in time for people to see it and be visible. I think that’s unlikely as far as midterm election season.

It’s designed to motivate big tech companies to build new power plants to serve rapidly growing AI data centers.

It was especially interesting to see Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, a longtime critic of PJM, attend the event. From my understanding, the invitation was fairly last-minute, though the effort has been in the works for some time and included Democratic Governor Wes Moore of Maryland. Seeing them all come together to call on PJM to act was noteworthy.

Josh Siegel (04:37): PJM doesn’t have to do anything, of course. There’s clearly a political element. The governors and the White House want to be seen as responsive to rising electricity prices, which have become a potent political issue. There are major implementation questions, and it will take time to build new power plants. Still, given the disagreements among these leaders over broader energy policy, it was striking to see them unified in this moment.

Bill Loveless (05:09): Affordability really is the political watchword right now. Electricity prices have risen about 7 percent over the past year. Josh, do some see this as a potential breakthrough for providing reliable and affordable electricity, not just for data centers but for the public more broadly?

Josh Siegel (05:45): People see it as a show of force and recognition of how serious the problem is. That’s positive. But in terms of immediate impact, it’s unclear how quickly PJM would act, if at all. Building power plants takes time, and permitting remains a challenge. This is more about signaling action and bipartisan interest than delivering near-term relief, especially before the midterms.

Bill Loveless (06:59): Yeah, absolutely. We’ll talk more about FERC at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in a few minutes, but because certainly a lot will be happening there, and of course this is happening as we are seeing major geopolitical events around the world. I wonder, are events in major oil producers like Venezuela and Iran reshaping the context for US energy policy making this year, Maxine, are they changing any energy priorities around, I don’t know, production, strategic reserves, sanctions, environmental issues?

Maxine Joselow (07:35): Those are a lot of really big questions, Bill. Let me see if I can take a stab at answering some of them and I’ll let Josh weigh in on some of them too. I think at a very high level, the fact that oil prices are low right now has allowed the administration to have more confidence and to kind of be unfettered in taking these big geopolitical actions because they know that there won’t be repercussions at home. Americans won’t be seeing higher prices at the pump as a result, which is top of mind in this whole question about affordability. People often notice prices at the pump more than they notice their electricity bills going up. And so whether it’s Venezuela, whether it’s Iran, the administration feels like it has room to make these big interventions because of the fact that prices are low, generally speaking right now. But those are some big questions. I don’t know if Josh, you want to jump in on some of those too?

Josh Siegel (08:29): Yeah, I do see it sort of involving the affordability context. There’s some intersection here, and again, my frame is really from the Hill. I do most of my reporting in Congress and when I talk to Democrats, they sort of see this as an opportunity to say, Hey, President Trump’s so focused on these overseas interventions, domestic affordability, what does he really care about? And then there’s this question of the administration is exporting Venezuela’s oil. They say the US government has control over the revenue and it’s going to go to the Venezuelan people. But I think there’s a lot of questions. I think Democrats see an opportunity to use that as like, okay, we’re giving more control to this administration. That obviously has stepped on the power of the purse in lots of ways as far as when it comes to Congress’s prerogative over federal government funds and appropriations. This seems separate from that. This wouldn’t involve Congress from everything that I’ve been told as far as does Congress get a chance to weigh in on what to do with these revenues? But I think they see it as an opportunity to say, oh, the Trump administration, we’re going to trust them to sort of handle this when they’ve intervened in funding matters pretty aggressively across the board on energy.

Maxine Joselow (09:41): And just speaking of Democrats in Congress in Venezuela, I also thought it was notable that the administration appears not to have briefed members of Congress in advance of the strike. And then at the same time, the head executives of major oil companies had a heads up and were brought into these conversations earlier on, and you see Democrats like Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee sending letters to these top oil company executives asking, what did you know and when and did you know it before we did?

Bill Loveless (10:14): So to some extent, it does color some of the discussions that take place, obviously over energy policy this year.

Josh Siegel (10:22): Yeah, no, I think that’s for sure. And again, I think Democrats are already eager to sort of show that the Trump administration is too close to the oil industry. And this is another example, although, I mean that big White House meeting right there was ExxonMobil, a lot of skepticism around whether what it would take to actually go back in Venezuela in a significant way. So I think that’s interesting that there does seem to be division within the industry on how that will play out. But I think Democrats see an opportunity here and it’ll color a lot of what we see the rest of the year.

Bill Loveless (10:56): So let’s go to Congress, go to Capitol Hill. Are there two or three flash points for lawmakers in 2026? Josh, I know you’ve been big in covering permitting reform, so I would hazard to guess that’s one of them, but there’s grid reliability, something else.

Josh Siegel (11:15): I think permitting reform is really, I mean, the top policy issue I’m still watching for, I mean, I know right? Talks are on pause right now. So Senate Democrats have stopped negotiating with Republicans because the Trump administration during the Christmas holiday season basically paused all offshore wind projects that are in construction, five really large projects. And that sort of caught some folks by surprise, given the timing of that — happened right after the house passed their NEPA overhaul bill, which was sort of their imprint on permitting reform was meant to sort of jumpstart negotiations. The Senate was already having conversations, but Senate Democrats were like, look, we can’t do this when it’s very clear that the Trump administration has favorites when it comes to energy, they favor fossil fuels, they favor nuclear. How can they implement any permitting bill that might benefit clean energy or should on a policy basis benefit clean energy?

(12:08): But I mean the outside noise for action is still super significant. Every industry is at the table that you can think of, oil and gas, clean energy, tech, I mean, so I think the noise is going to be consistent throughout the year. There could be opportunities to reopen. We’ll see if, I’m sure we’ll get more into this, but a big question mark going forward is does the Trump administration change their tactic on clean energy at all? They suffered some court losses here last week with three of these projects, three of these offshore wind projects that now can continue construction. Does that change anything from this administration? Is rising prices and sort of what it looks like when they’re taking projects offline and how that might impact things, does that force them to change course at some point? So I think that’s the biggest question hovering over permitting reform, but I expect that to be a constant conversation every week. It feels like there’s an event from some industry group hoping that they return to the table. So we’ll see. But that’s really my big one.

Bill Loveless (13:05): I mean, that’s been the case with permitting reform for several years, right? I mean, it’s constantly chatter over this. There has been more action lately with the passage of the bill by Republican Bruce Westerman and Democrat Jared Golden late last year. But as you say, there’s been these obstacles that have come up more recently over the administration’s pausing again of offshore wind projects. Maxine, you cover Interior. Remind us what’s happened most recently with those offshore wind projects.

Maxine Joselow (13:37): Yeah, so I cover the interior department generally and have been following these offshore wind projects, specifically, including the ups and downs of their various legal battles. And last week, as Josh noted, there was a trio of adverse rulings against the administration ordering all three of these projects to again resume construction and finding that the Trump administration had not adequately explained why these projects needed to stop construction because they pose these unspecified national security risks. And essentially in its abrupt December 22nd announcement, just three days before Christmas, ordering these projects to stop construction, the Interior Department had cited these classified reports by the Defense Department, now called the Department of War, that found that these projects posed security risks and that the turbines could interfere with the radar used by military vessels and other boat captains. And the three judges in these three cases all ruled that those reports which they saw under seal, did not adequately justify stopping these multi-billion dollar projects, some of which are almost near completion and in operation.

Bill Loveless (14:59): Yeah, there’s been a lot of turmoil over these offshore wind projects. A lot of those that were on the drawing board are no longer there because of the administration’s opposition to this form of energy. So yeah, it’s been quite tumultuous and costly certainly for those offshore developers. I just wonder with those actions on the offshore wind happening when they did and how it came at a point when the house had just passed this bill, so there was giving hope to some people that maybe there would be some sort of permitting reform this year if in fact that can be resolved. Josh, as I understand it in the House, there was some stiff opposition to doing anything to stop the White House from stopping wind projects. And they can point to this has happened during the Biden administration when the President pulled permits that had been done for the pipeline from Canada. I mean, is this one of the big stumbling blocks that needs to be resolved if permitting reforms to go anywhere?

Josh Siegel (16:00): I mean, it’s the biggest one for sure. I mean, we saw, as you noted in the House, I mean some of the Freedom Caucus hard right along with more moderate members who just oppose offshore wind kind of banded together and saw this provision that Westerman was able to negotiate in the markup of his bill that essentially put some limits. I mean it was a pretty modest measure, but put some limits around the executive branch’s interference in the permitting process, which has been sort of the biggest hangup in these talks. Westerman knew he was going to have to get at this issue at some point. He negotiated that with Democrats, but the Freedom Caucus got wind of it, and they immediately saw it as a target on Trump policies, even though Westerman really took pains to say this is a technology neutral, as you noted, Bill, we’ve seen it, the Biden administration take actions against fossil fuel projects.

(16:48): So it was meant to really not target any specific technology, but that didn’t stop the Freedom Caucus. They eventually got it through, but Westerman had to water it down somewhat. And yeah, I mean on the Democratic side, the biggest thing they want out of these talks in the Senate, they even thought what Westerman did was not sufficient at all. So they want to see stronger language in this area. They want to see both Trump administration change its behavior as far as how it’s treating these projects. And then they do this exact opposite right after the House passes its bill when they put the halt on these offshore wind projects. But they also want to see a big policy right as this Interior Department memo that interior secretary Doug Bergham put in, that essentially requires him to sign off on routine permits for solar and wind onshore projects on federal lands.

(17:36): But this affects projects on private lands because some of these approvals involve crossing state and private lands, and that policy has really put a hamper on project development in this country. And the Democrats say they want that policy to go away. They want to maybe put in language into a bill that would limit that kind of stonewalling that the administration has been doing. Rather than outright rejecting. They’re just not approving anything. So is there a way to get at that? But we know that any move in this area is going to get backlash on the right. So it’s tricky to see how you get compromise on that.

Maxine Joselow (18:09): Those are great points, Josh. And I would just add, there was I think a lot of speculation in climate and energy circles in Washington about whether these two things were related, whether the collapse of the permitting reform talks on the Hill was related in any way to the Trump administration’s announcement that it was ordering a halt to construction on these five offshore wind projects just a few days later. And my reporting, my colleagues in their reporting have tried to answer that question, and it seems a little unclear, but maybe the answer is a tentative no. I didn’t actually end up including this in my story, but I’ll share it with listeners of this podcast that I had an interview with Congressman Jeff Van Drew, Republican of New Jersey and leading opponent of offshore wind projects, and I asked him: “You along with your colleagues in the Freedom Caucus up in arms over this language in the permitting reform, talks about offshore wind. Did you call President Trump? Did you call the White House and maybe get this issue back on his radar in a way that may have resulted in that stop work order announcement?” And he actually declined to take credit for getting it back on the White House’s radar, which I thought was very telling whenever a lawmaker declines to take credit for something that’s notable, I think when given the opportunity to do so.

Josh Siegel (19:29): Yeah, no, Maxine, that’s a great point. I do think it’s unclear as far as the connection, but you raise a point on, did just sort of the conversation around this put it back into Trump’s radar and like, Hey, why haven’t we done anything lately against offshore wind? So I think that’s a possibility, but it also shows I think, how disconnected the administration is from Congress that maybe there wasn’t a direct connection here, but they clearly were not aware or they didn’t care that what they did here would permeate or affect permitting talks on the Hill. They didn’t make that connection. So it’s sort of unclear how much they actually see a need for congressional action, what their priorities would be. There hasn’t been a great public discussion of that from administration officials other than some NEPA reform, but they’re going to need more than that to get a bill through and then maybe to see some pipeline approvals streamlined through the Clean Water Act. But they’re doing it right. We’ve seen the EPA do regulatory action and that recently, so it’s unclear. I mean, they’re doing a lot on permitting to benefit the projects they want. So how much do they really want Congress to act?

Bill Loveless (20:31): Yeah, and I certainly want to get to EPA in a moment, one of Maxine’s beats. But I think for years we’ve heard about all of the above energy policy, and there’s some controversy over that, some depending on which side of the political spectrum you sit. Some people would prefer more of this than that, but it seems to be there has been more of an acknowledgement that in all the above energy policy is important to consider. And at a time when renewables solar and wind achieving a bigger part of the new generation in this country, IEA just put out a new short-term energy outlook, I believe it was today, that’s saying that solar power is driving electricity generation growth and will do so over the next two years. But there’s a lot of talk about base load too, particularly natural gas and nuclear new to back in the in the mix again, is there, where do we sit with this? It takes some years to get a gas turbine built and operating in this country for baseload. The renewables seem to come on faster. Is there some meeting in the middle among politicians and regulators over where the optimal growth can be in this country for electricity, Maxine?

Maxine Joselow (21:44): Yeah. Well, I think this whole notion of all of the above energy policy has had a really fascinating political realignment attached to it that I’ve observed as a reporter in the space over the last several years. When you think back to the first Trump administration, they used the phrase to describe their energy policy, all the above. And to some extent it was more true in the first Trump administration because you still had offshore wind leasing taking place. You still had interior Secretary Ryan Zinke at the time praising the offshore wind leasing bonanza that had resulted in a bunch of bids. And fast forward to today, and you actually, despite the fact that President Trump issued an executive order on day one of returning to office calling a national energy emergency and saying that his administration was going to take all of these steps to bring new energy sources online faster, you actually see his administration not so much taking in all of the above approach as pushing for fossil fuels like coal, which he calls beautiful clean coal, natural gas oil, and of course, some technologies that energy secretary Chris Wright tends to favor like nuclear and geothermal at the same time as his administration is arguably throttling wind and solar onshore and offshore.

(23:11): And so all of the above has in some ways become an opening for Democrats to attack the administration on and say, Hey, you say you’re all of the above, but in fact you’re throttling these sources of power. And in the case of offshore wind, these five wind farms we were talking about that are stalled or were stalled off the East coast, we’re projected to power hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses with clean energy at a time that there’s potentially shortages in the northeast.

Bill Loveless (23:40): Well, I mean, we talk about energy all of the above, but I mean this administration came in with energy dominance being the theme, right? Oil and gas and coal. So there’s no getting away from that, and I don’t mean to diminish the significance of that aspect of the administration’s energy policy, but I think out there in the atmosphere when people look at energy, our energy needs, you can’t ignore the fact that the renewables have come on so substantially in recent years and raises the question of what role they could play in combination, say with batteries, for example, which seems to be coming on in greater force these days as well as the fossil fuels. It’s a lot to consider Josh.

Josh Siegel (24:21):

Yeah, no, Maxine is spot on as far as Democrats seeing an opportunity in this, and you are hearing them increasingly talk about wind and solar in the context of being the cheapest quickest to get on the grid at a moment of great energy need out there, less sort of in the climate frame, which is interesting and saying, I mean the administration is preventing that from happening. They’re literally taking projects offline that are ready to go. So it is interesting to see Democrats. And as far as fossil fuels, I mean, I feel like most I talk to on the hill, I mean, you still have maybe the progressive left who would like to see less fossil fuel use even now, but folks seem to say we’re in a different context, a different time with the growing rising demand. We didn’t see that in the last Congress. It wasn’t part of the conversation when we were talking about the Inflation Production Act, which was the big Biden administration climate energy initiative. So Democrats are largely aligned, I think, on we’re really all of the above, not. So it’s been pretty interesting to see that evolution.

Bill Loveless (25:29): Well, we’re talking about Congress, but as I often say, and probably have said it more in recent years, it’s the agencies that seem to matter most when it comes to energy and climate outcomes. And that’s certainly the case here in 2026. And there we’re talking EPA, DOE, Interior, FERC, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Maxine, where do we even begin with EPA? There’s so much that has occurred during this administration regarding regulations and rulemakings, which are the ones that deserve a particularly close attention right now?

Maxine Joselow (26:06): Great question. Where to begin? There’s been such a flurry of news out of EPA under the second Trump administration, Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator had this day back in March that I remember because my inbox was just ping, ping, ping where they sent out, I think a total of 30 press releases about each of these new regulatory rollbacks they were undertaking. LeeZeldin called it the Greatest Day of Deregulation in American History and said he was driving a dagger through the heart of the climate change religion, which is a quote that’ll stay with me for a while. And since then there’s just been an onslaught of more news out of the agency. And I think one announcement that deserves a lot of attention and scrutiny is an announcement that I covered last week, it feels like longer ago, but yeah, it was last week. I got my hands on some internal EPA emails and documents that were later posted to their website and formally announced to the public, and they show that the EPA is going to make what I described in my article as a seismic shift to the way that it conducts cost benefit analysis for new clean air rules.

(27:22): And instead of considering both the health benefits of reducing air pollution, including the avoided asthma attacks and avoided premature deaths, the agency is only going to be considering the costs to businesses of complying with the rules. And that’s going to mean that in these cost benefit analysis, the costs of clean air regulations appear to greatly outweigh the benefits, which would be a significant change from the past three decades of EPA rulemakings under the Clean Air Act, where the benefits have typically exceeded the cost by at least a 30 to one ratio.

Bill Loveless (28:00): In the case of that, and there’s so many, as you say, other things going on at EPA right now, I mean, they proposed considering revising the Greenhouse Gas reporting program that could remove reporting requirements for many industry sectors and potentially reshaping how emissions are tracked and regulated in this country. And they’ve more recently proposed limiting the ability of states to block construction of oil and gas pipelines and coal export terminals. And perhaps the biggest thing, in my mind anyway, is that rescinding the 2009 endangerment finding, which provides the legal foundation for regulating greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles and power plants under the Clean Air Act, there could be some decision on that fairly soon. Right, Maxie?

Maxine Joselow (28:47): That’s right. My colleagues and I are expecting a decision to formally repeal the endangerment finding this month. It might slip to next month, but so far every indication we’re hearing is it could be by the end of this month, and that would arguably be the single biggest deregulatory action by the EPA ever. To be fair to Lee Zeldin, that would probably be an accurate way to describe that action just because of the enormous benefits of climate regulations that have flowed from that Seminole 2009 finding that greenhouse gases do in fact endanger public health and welfare and therefore should be regulated under the Clean Air Act. And that has paved the way for EPA to regulate greenhouse gases from car and truck tailpipes, from coal and gas power plant smokestacks. And as part of this proposal to repeal the endangerment finding, EPA is expected to also erase all limits on greenhouse gas pollution from light duty vehicles and power plants could be next.

Bill Loveless (29:53): I mean, this will be challenged in court as are all new regulations regardless of what administration’s in power at the moment, but we’re only entering the second year of the Trump administration. I mean, is it likely that this decision on the endangerment finding as well as other rules that EPA has proposed could in fact take effect within the next couple of years?

Maxine Joselow (30:23): Well, Bill, I’m not an environmental lawyer. I just interview a lot of them, but I think they’re all thinking that the EPA and the Justice Department want this case to reach the Supreme Court within President Trump’s second term and have this issue decided before the next administration comes into office, particularly if it’s a democratic administration. And in an ideal world for them, the Supreme Court would overturn Massachusetts versus EPA, which was the landmark case that found that EPA can regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants under the Clean Air Act, and that would prevent a future Democratic administration from coming in and reestablishing these limits on cars and power plants and other sources of pollution.

Josh Siegel (31:08):

Yeah, it’s been, just from a help perspective, it’s been interesting to hear Republicans universally who I talked to, even ones who were starting to lean in a little bit on climate change, saying that they support what the administration’s doing on the endangerment finding. I talked to Shelly Moore, Capto chair of VPW Committee of West Virginia who can be moderate on certain energy issues, or at least on how she talks about them. And she was saying, I mean, we want the end engagement finding to go away because we don’t want to see another Democratic administration come in and do what the Biden administration did as far as regulating power plants, vehicles in sort of an aggressive fashion. And they actually see that that’s why we need to see something like this. We don’t want ping ponging anymore. We want finality to it. So I think that’s pretty interesting to note, although there has been some pushback on the greenhouse gas reporting program that the administration has moved to undo where there’s a tie in there to carbon capture tax credits and accessibility, so the administration in the fossil fuel industry are aligned and wanting to see maybe that maintained, which is interesting.

Maxine Joselow (32:14): Yeah, I think potentially even more interesting than Congressional Republicans kind of falling in line is, as Josh said, industry pushback to some of these changes out of EPA. And that’s been a trend that I’ve noticed in my reporting on EPA over the past several months is in many cases, the agency is rolling back programs that industries actually like and want to keep around. So the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is a great example. It’s just all it requires is reporting, reporting your greenhouse gas emissions. And the oil and gas industry really likes this program because it makes them look pretty good. It shows the progress they’ve made in reducing methane emissions compared to their competitors around the world, and it allows them to market their gas as more clean when they’re selling it abroad. Similarly, the Energy Star program, which we haven’t talked about, the administration said it wanted to eliminate it. There was pushback, and the home appliance manufacturers said, Hey, we actually really like this program. Similarly, it allows us to market energy efficient products like washing machines, dishwashers, et cetera, to consumers who recognize that label. And actually, there was pushback from the Hill too in the latest appropriation bill for the EPA and interior department that would actually provide and maintain funding for that program as well.

Bill Loveless (33:36): Now, you mentioned appropriations, Maxine, I don’t know if you or Josh have been following appropriations closely lately, but it’s my impression, I think there’s a bill moving through the hill right now for appropriations for the Department of Energy and some other agencies, and I may be wrong, but I think that the agency’s on fairing all that badly. I mean, compared to what the appropriations were previously. Right. Do either of you track that at all?

Josh Siegel (34:03): Yeah, so the appropriations bills for Interior and the Energy Department did pass the House and Senate already. So the Senate was last week. So I’m not sure if the President has actually signed those into law at this point. But yeah, these were compromised bills. I don’t have the numbers on top of me, but they definitely rejected some of the Trump administration’s proposed cuts, and you saw great votes from both the Democrats and the Republicans, great amount of votes, which I think was notable in this environment that they were able to get there. Appropriation seemed to be sort of the one thing maybe right now where you are seeing some members assert themselves and say, Hey, we need to claw back some power here.

Bill Loveless (34:40): So the funding is more or less consistent with what the agencies have gotten in the past, Josh?

Josh Siegel (34:44): Yeah, I mean, I don’t know. Comparing it to, I’m sure it’s less than the Biden administration have to go and look at the numbers, but they do reject some of the aggressive cuts that the Trump administration was proposing.

Bill Loveless (34:56): Let’s get back to FERC, and I always hesitate when I bring up FERC. As I recall, my first beat as an energy reporter in Washington many years ago was covering the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. And I always said that that was sort of my bootcamp in covering energy in Washington because it’s pretty darn complicated place, but it continues to be important. And we’ve mentioned previously the new chair, Laura Swett, and she said at the first meeting that she chaired that her top priority would be connecting data centers to the grid, along with ensuring grid reliability at reasonable prices. Josh, what’s been happening there and what should we be paying particularly close attention to?

Josh Siegel (35:37): Yeah, the big thing we’re tracking, of course, and our FERC reporter, Isa Domínguez, so I sort of moonlight as a FERC reporter occasionally, but yeah, basically Chris Wright Energy Secretary, Chris Wright, issued this request under section 403 of the Department of Energy Organization Act for the commission to initiate a rule speeding connection of data centers to the grid, really dealing with this issue of interconnection and gave a pretty fast timeline for FERC to act on that. He wants action by the spring. So yeah, as you said, I mean FERC chair Laura Swett has seemingly leaned in on this area. They seem poised to issue a rule on it, notice of proposed rulemaking, and then there’s actually some bipartisan interest on it on the hill. I reported on energy committee chair Mike Lee and ranking member Martin Heinrich, who have really not gotten along on much on that committee.

(36:29): There’s been a lot of tensions in that relationship, but they actually issued a letter to FERC saying, we want to see you take action in this area while, of course, keeping state’s rights and consumer utility bills in mind. So there does seem to be great interest across the energy industry on action. I think the details will matter a lot. We’ve seen state utility commissioners sort of push back on maybe some move into their authority in a way that we haven’t seen when it comes to the grid, so it’ll be interesting to see what FERC does here.

Bill Loveless (37:02): Yeah, it seems like that would be a big potential source of conflict, right? States because states maintain considerable authority over what’s built when it comes to the electric grid, unlike natural gas pipelines and oil pipelines where FERC has considerably more authority than the states. But it’s a very complex issue, and one, I would think it’s going to take some time to work out.

Josh Siegel (37:27): We’ve seen a former Republican for chair Mark Christie really express that from a state perspective on like, look, we need to build a lot more generation and quickly, but he thinks the proposal from the energy secretary will undercut that goal. He talks about legal risks and just as he put it in an assault on the traditional authority of the states, who as he notes are really the key players in what kind of generation gets built.

Bill Loveless (37:52): Then of course as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, there’s renewed interest in building nuclear in the United States, other conventional nuclear new reactors, small modular reactors, restarting reactors that had been previously shut down all of these things, and it’s all before the NRC, which is under a lot of pressure from the White House to act quickly and raising fears among some who follow nuclear regulation closely that maybe they’re going to be sideswiping the close scrutiny that NRC is typically administered in the past. So Josh,we need to keep our eye on NRC as well.

Josh Siegel (38:28): Yeah, we do. I mean, we’ve been watching it here at POLITICO on the energy team, and we’ve seen Trump fire NRC Commissioner, Chris Hanson, we’ve seen others quit, and then he has a new one, Ho Nieh. So this is really one of those independent agencies along with FERC. But I think NRC has even been more glaring of where we’ve seen the Trump administration really try to assert themselves and use it as a vehicle to advance their agenda. And the Energy Department has put some very aggressive goals as far as deploying new nuclear reactors here in the next couple of years. So there’s a bipartisan interest, as you said, so I don’t want to totally say this is going to be a political act that will come out of NRC because of the Trump administration. And Ho Nieh is someone who comes from industry and is seen as having respect. He got bipartisan votes out of the Senate. But yeah, definitely going to be watching what they do in the coming months as far as whether they play much of a role in the Trump administration’s nuclear agenda.

Bill Loveless (39:25): Well, of course, it is an election year. The midterms come up in November and raises the question of how much does the upcoming election cycle affect energy and climate policymaking these days? Maxine, I was just reading Frank Maisano, who we all know, I think at the law firm, very small in one of his weekly emails said, as 2026 unfolds energy policy is shaping up to be a defining fault line in the midterm elections, one that will influence how Republicans position themselves heading into the next presidential cycle. How does the election factor into these activities that we’ve been discussing in the Congress among the agencies, and I guess more importantly among voters across the country?

Maxine Joselow (40:18): Well, we see that poll after poll shows that climate change is not a top tier issue for voters, unfortunately for us climate reporters who it is a top tier issue for in our beats. But energy affordability as part of this broader theme of affordability that we’ve been talking about, I do think will be a big issue in the midterm elections and in those special elections that were held earlier last year for the Governor of Virginia and the Governor of New Jersey, Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill respectively did talk often on the campaign trail about energy and energy affordability, and they both won in those states. And Mikie Sherrill, I think even was talking about PJM and data centers and getting a bit wonky with it. So we’ll have to see how much of a concern it is among the many other concerns for voters right now, Venezuela, immigration, et cetera. The list goes on, but certainly I think both parties are going to be looking to use it as a wedge issue to their advantage.

Josh Siegel (41:23): Yeah, no, I think energy affordability will be a top tier issue in terms of electricity prices in a way we haven’t seen before. And it’s been interesting to see the Trump administration’s evolution on this because I think for a while we saw the president really trying to point voters’ attention to gasoline prices being really low, and how, as Maxine mentioned earlier in our conversation, that’s always the most visible thing to voters when it comes to energy prices and utility rates are utility bills are very hard to unpack. We haven’t really seen a huge political emphasis on it, but now, I mean, the Trump administration clearly is scrambling on it, and we see the president and his true social posts talking about data centers and wanting them to build their own generation announced playing up deals that we’re seeing in the tech space around that area. We saw the White House announcements around PJM that I covered last week, so clearly, and we’ve seen Chris Wright acknowledge that electricity prices, and this is an interview I had with him over the summer, are a vulnerability for them, and they’re the party in power. We know that the incumbent usually gets blamed for these kind of things, so we will have to see how it actually trickles down to house and Senate races, but it’s definitely going to be a top tier issue.

Bill Loveless (42:35): Josh, I saw a former colleague, Callie Patteson of The Examiner wrote the other day that Wright told her that he was willing to put his job on the line over electricity prices.

Josh Siegel (42:47): Yeah, no, I mean, he’s been really out there, but again, I think the Trump administration is hoping they could sort of make this argument that it’s the Biden administration’s fault, that it’s because of renewable energy. I mean, we’ve seen that Chris Wright refers to renewable energy as a parasite on the grid. I mean, he’s really consistent in his messaging saying that that’s what’s been driving up rates in a lot of states. But I mean, that’s just politically right. I mean, we haven’t seen great evidence that blaming a prior administration works out. I mean, the Biden administration faced this problem. They were blamed for inflation that a lot of it was not in their control. There was a result of COVID and returning back from that. But we’ll see if that pays off for them. But clearly that’s the strategy is to say there’s a problem, but it’s not our fault, and we’re trying to do what we can now to keep coal plants online to sper more oil and gas generation, but it might not pay off right away.

Bill Loveless (43:43): Well, we’ve covered a lot. And before we go, what I had like to talk a little bit about covering the beat, you’ve each been doing it for some time now and your experience matters. What do you find the hardest to explain to readers about energy and climate policy in Washington, Maxine?

Maxine Joselow (44:05): Well, one of my goals as a reporter is always to explain to readers how seemingly wonky, arcane policy decisions that get made in DC affect real people, affect their lives, their livelihoods, their pocketbooks. And that’s one of my biggest challenges. But I think one of my greatest opportunities in my reporting too, and when I report on the EPA, I always try to connect it back to what this change to the way they’re conducting cost benefit analysis means for the clean air that we all have come to take for granted when we breathe it as a result of steep reductions in air pollution from the Clean Air Act over the past half century. So that’s something I’m going to be trying to do over this next year, 2026, and hopefully going on more reporting trips and traveling across the country and not just staying chained to my desk in dc but actually getting out and talking to real people about how these moves are affecting them.

Bill Loveless(45:03): Josh?

Josh Siegel (45:04): Yeah, I think just covering this unfolding story around the White House’s attempt to ensure really one of the bright spots in the economy, the surge in construction of data centers devoted to AI and how they’re trying to ensure that isn’t overcome by the rising cost of energy and those two political imperatives, how they clash and just making sure we’re clear to readers on what’s actually behind rising prices, what role data centers are having or not having, could they actually help lower prices? There’s an argument and on that side as well. So just making sure we’re really covering it beyond the political rhetoric, which has been pretty aggressive as far as each side wanting to play the blame game already. So I think there’s a lot of complexity there and just want to, it’s a challenge to be honest as far as being clear about what we’re seeing and what we might see going forward, but we’re definitely trying to do our best on the energy team.

Bill Loveless (45:59): You sort of answered a question that I have in mind, but let me ask it anyway. Is there an energy, or a climate story that you think isn’t getting enough attention right now? Maxine?

Maxine Joselow (46:13): I don’t want to say that in front of Josh and have him steal it before I get to report it out, Bill, but that’s a good question. I don’t know. I think the energy and climate press corps here in DC is doing a great job, but there’s always room to cover more that isn’t necessarily part of the national conversation, but maybe there are local stories on climate and energy that it takes, to my earlier answer, getting out of DC to discover.

Josh Siegel (46:46): Yeah, I mean, I think there’s great coverage being done as far as state and local level. I’m really, as someone who covers permitting, it’s been interesting to see how state and local actions to restrict wind and solar developments or NIMBYism the new frontier on that has been interesting to see some backlash in areas that have openly supported renewable energy in the past, like Iowa, I did some reporting there, but would love to have more opportunity around that as midterms kick in and cover how more states are grappling with this need to build more, which is generally something Republicans want to do, but sort of NIMBYism and how we’re starting to see conservatives really push back on renewable development happening near them. So transmission’s long been a part of this conversation as well. So just continuing to cover that and how it’s actually trickling down at the state and local level. But again, there’s been really good reporting on that from others for sure.

Bill Loveless (47:39): Well, there’s a lot to cover there, and I didn’t mean to try to prompt you to scoop yourself in front of one of your competitors, but you’re both covering a lot of ground and there’s so much for us to keep track of in this year, 2026 in Washington, DC and the United States. So Maxine, Josh, thanks for joining us today on the Columbia Energy Exchange.

Maxine Joselow (48:01): Thank you so much.

EPA Administrator Zeldin at RSC Member Meeting

I hosted EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin at this week's Republican Study Committee meeting, where he discussed his conservative vision for the Environmental Protection Agency, after years of Democrat weaponization of it under the Biden administration.

Administrator Zeldin outlined his plan to return the EPA to its core mission of environmental protection while removing burdensome regulations that have driven up costs for families and small businesses. By refocusing the agency on its original purpose, we can protect our natural resources without stifling American innovation and economic growth. It was a productive discussion about how we can achieve common-sense environmental policies that work for everyone.

Mystic Alerts Act Advanced Out of Subcommittee

I am proud that my bipartisan legislation, the Mystic Alerts Act, was passed out of the Energy and Commerce Communications and Technology Subcommittee this week. Since the devastating floods of July 4th, I have been advocating for the strengthening of emergency alert systems, especially in rural or remote areas.

No family should miss a life-saving warning simply because infrastructure went down or service is unavailable. The Mystic Alerts Act is a critical step toward closing the digital divide and strengthening public safety communications. Watch my full remarks in support of the legislation here.

Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller in Washington

I had a great time meeting with Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller this week. Texas-11 is home to countless hardworking farmers and ranchers who are the backbone of our state's economy and feed families across America. I'm committed to fighting for our agricultural communities in Congress—cutting burdensome regulations, protecting property rights, and ensuring our producers have the resources they need to thrive. Always great to have a fellow Texan in D.C. Thank you for stopping by my office!

Questioning FCC Chairman Carr and Commissioners

This week, I questioned Federal Communications Chairman Brendan Carr and Commissioner Olivia Trusty about the monumental wins Republicans delivered to the American people through the Working Families Tax Cut Act, which will support the long-term economic and national security of the United States.

During the hearing, I also highlighted my work on countering the Chinese Communist Party’s influence at the 2027 World Radiocommunications Conference (WRC-27) and asked how the FCC is preparing to spearhead these efforts. Additionally, I questioned FCC Chairman Carr on how the FCC is safeguarding public interest and trust in broadcast licensing. Watch my full line of questioning here or by clicking the image below.

Sounding the Alarm on Grid Security

During a House Energy and Commerce Energy Subcommittee legislative hearing this week, I asked a Department of Energy (DOE) witness for his insight into the growing cyber and supply-chain risks facing U.S. energy infrastructure and what DOE is doing to address them. I made it clear that hostile foreign technology has no place in America's power system. With cyber and physical threats evolving quickly, we must zero in on a major vulnerability: foreign-manufactured equipment being embedded in the U.S. supply chain and its risk to the electric grid.

In my questioning, I also referenced a recent report that indicated certain Chinese-manufactured solar and battery inverters used in the U.S. grid contained undisclosed communication devices, warning that these technologies could threaten our grid security and serve as backdoors into critical American infrastructure.

Chris Brown Chris Brown is the Northern District Public Service Commissioner.","Below is an opinion column by Chris Brown:

Northern PSC Commissioner Chris Brown says nuclear energy is the future of large-scale power generation. Serious nations know it.

America’s economy is entering a new phase: one that requires enormous amounts of reliable electricity. Artificial intelligence, data centers, advanced manufacturing, military installations, and modern infrastructure all depend on power that is available every hour of every day, no matter the weather.

That reality matters deeply in Mississippi, where families, businesses, hospitals, and military facilities cannot afford rolling outages or skyrocketing power bills. If the United States wants to remain economically competitive and nationally secure, we must be honest about what works, and accelerate investment in advanced nuclear energy.

Much of today’s energy debate focuses on the falling cost of renewable power, especially solar. That progress is real and useful. But it often ignores a critical distinction: cheap power on paper is not the same as dependable power in the real world.

Solar energy can be inexpensive when the sun is shining. But electricity demand does not stop at night, during storms, or during prolonged cloudy periods. To deliver round-the-clock power, solar must be paired with massive battery systems. Those batteries are expensive, wear out over time, and must be replaced regularly. Once those costs are included, the price of “dispatchable” solar power rises sharply.

Once you require dispatchable, 24/7 power, the economics flip.

Cost per kWh (firm power):

• Advanced Nuclear: $0.06–$0.10

• Solar + 4h batteries: $0.09–$0.13 (still not fully reliable)

• Solar + 24h batteries: $0.20–$0.35

• Hardened solar (multi-day): $0.40–$0.80+

Dispatchable solar costs 2–8× more per kWh.

When measured fairly, comparing only power that is available on demand, the difference becomes clear. Advanced nuclear energy can produce electricity for roughly six to ten cents per kilowatt-hour, with plants operating more than 90 percent of the time and lasting for decades. By contrast, solar paired with enough storage to provide continuous power often costs two to four times more, and systems designed to handle multi-day outages can cost even more.

This is not a political issue. It is a matter of physics and engineering. Nuclear energy stores immense amounts of energy directly in its fuel. Solar energy must be generated when conditions allow and stored externally in batteries that require large amounts of land, minerals, and ongoing replacement.

Reliability matters more than ever as electricity demand grows. Data centers, manufacturing plants, military installations, and critical infrastructure cannot simply power down when conditions are unfavorable. A grid built primarily on intermittent generation like solar and wind becomes more fragile, not more resilient, without firm power sources to anchor it.

Advanced nuclear reactors are designed for exactly this challenge. Modern designs rely on passive safety systems, simplified construction, smaller footprints, and decades of operational experience. Unlike other technologies, nuclear power becomes more economical as it runs longer, without requiring massive new infrastructure, and only small amounts of additional fuel.

Nuclear energy is also a strategic national asset. Countries that lead in advanced nuclear technology will control supply chains, safety standards, and long-term geopolitical influence. Russia and China understand this clearly and are investing heavily to dominate the next generation of nuclear power. The United States cannot afford to fall behind, or worse, outsource its energy future while competitors lock in theirs.

Nuclear energy is the future of large-scale power generation. Serious nations know it. Rather than continuing to funnel billions of dollars into subsidized solar projects that depend on weather and constant backup, America should focus on technologies that deliver reliable power, strengthen national security, protect ratepayers, and secure long-term leadership. When it comes to powering the next century of economic growth and national defense, advanced nuclear is not optional: it is essential.

Electricity generation by the U.S. electric power sector totaled about 4,260 billion kilowatthours (BkWh) in 2025. In our latest Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), we expect U.S. electricity generation will grow by 1.1% in 2026 and by 2.6% in 2027, when it reaches an annual total of 4,423 BkWh. The three main dispatchable sources of electricity generation (natural gas, coal, and nuclear) accounted for 75% of total generation in 2025, but we expect the share of generation from these sources will fall to about 72% in 2027. We expect the combined share of generation from solar power and wind power to rise from about 18% in 2025 to about 21% in 2027.

In our STEO forecast, utility-scale solar is the fastest-growing source of electricity generation in the United States, increasing from 290 BkWh in 2025 to 424 BkWh by 2027. Almost 70 gigawatts (GW) of new solar generating capacity projects are scheduled to come online in 2026 and 2027, which represents a 49% increase in U.S. solar operating capacity compared with the end of 2025.

Much of the utility-scale solar generation capacity additions will come online in Texas. We expect that solar electricity generation supplied to the grid managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) will grow from 56 BkWh in 2025 to 106 BkWh by 2027. Increasing amounts of battery storage capacity help to support the fluctuations in solar output during the day. The electric power sector plans to expand battery capacity in ERCOT from about 15 GW in 2025 to 37 GW by the end of 2027.

Wind generation has been traditionally concentrated in the central part of the country, such as in the grid operated in the Midwest by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO). However, additions of new wind generating capacity have slowed in MISO, and we expect little growth in MISO wind generation through 2027, averaging just over 100 BkWh annually. New solar plant projects are also starting up in MISO. We expect MISO solar generation to grow from 31 BkWh in 2025 to 46 BkWh in 2027.

Natural gas is the largest source of electricity in the United States; however, its contribution to total generation has been declining from a peak share of 42% in 2024. In our forecast, U.S. natural gas-fired generation totals 1,696 BkWh in 2026, about the same as in 2025, and then increases to 1,711 BkWh in 2027 as overall power demand increases. The increase in natural gas-fired generation is slower than the overall increase in total U.S. generation, and so natural gas’s share of total power generation falls to 39% in 2027 compared to 40% in 2025.

Natural gas-fired generation increases 23% in ERCOT between 2025 and 2027 and 5% in the Mid-Atlantic area of the country where the grid is managed by PJM Interconnection. The regional growth in natural gas-fired generation responds partly to the growing electricity demand from data centers.

U.S. generation fueled by coal increased by 13% in 2025 to 731 BkWh due to cold temperatures in some regions and because of relatively higher natural gas prices. With existing policies and scheduled retirements planned by plant operators, we expect that coal plant retirements will lead to U.S. coal-fired generation declining an average of 5% annually over the next two years, producing 661 BkWh in 2027. The share of coal in power generation would fall to 15% in 2027 from 17% in 2025.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/US-solar-electricity-growth-1.png,N,,2026-01-20 13:59:57.980081

Together with the 5MW solar plant completed in 2023, Kennecott now has 30MW of solar capacity—enough to power approximately 1,026 average American homes annually and reduce Kennecott’s Scope 2 emissions by about 6% (20,000 tonnes CO₂e). This is equivalent to removing 4,400 cars from the road each year.

Construction of the 25MW plant began in October 2024 in partnership with Bechtel, was completed and commissioned in October last year, and energized in December. The new solar array includes over 71,000 panels, containing tellurium produced at Kennecott, a critical mineral for solar technology.

Kennecott began producing tellurium in 2022 as a byproduct of copper refining, making it one of only two U.S. producers of this critical mineral. Tellurium from Kennecott is converted into thin-film semiconductor materials by 5N Plus Inc. in Canada and then supplied primarily to First Solar for the manufacturing of the photovoltaic panels now installed at Kennecott, keeping the entire tellurium supply chain in North America.

Nate Foster, Managing Director of Rio Tinto Kennecott, said: “This new solar plant is more than a source of renewable power for our operations; it’s a demonstration of circularity and supply chain resilience. By mining copper and tellurium, both classified as critical minerals in the United States, here at Kennecott and using that tellurium in the panels powering our site, we’re proving how domestic critical minerals support renewable energy manufacturing. This approach strengthens North America’s supply chain for essential resources, supports national energy security, and reinforces our commitment to a low-carbon future.”

Scott Austin, General Manager of Renewables & Clean Power at Bechtel, said: “Working closely with Rio Tinto, Bechtel is proud to have delivered this project two months ahead of schedule while supporting 200 local jobs, helping bring renewable energy to the mine. We look forward to future projects together.”

Gervais Jacques, Chief Executive Officer of 5N Plus, said: “Our partnership with Rio Tinto helps deliver industry-leading products that support the clean energy transition and advance national energy security. At a time when the security of critical minerals supply chains is under intense scrutiny, we’re pleased to reinforce our position as a trusted partner to deliver the advanced materials this critical and growing sector depends on.”

Note to editors

Copper and tellurium are both classified as critical minerals in the United States, underscoring their importance to clean energy technologies and national supply chain security. Kennecott produces both minerals and operates one of only two copper smelters in the U.S., reinforcing its role as a strategic supplier for the energy transition. Kennecott is also one of only two U.S. producers of tellurium, a key component in photovoltaic solar panels, further strengthening its contribution to domestic renewable energy manufacturing.

The milestone cements the Golden State’s position as the undisputed national leader in clean transportation and proves that consumer demand for EVs remains strong despite federal headwinds.

“No state in the union can match California’s five-year growth in ZEV sales,” said California Energy Commissioner Nancy Skinner. “This serves as a reminder of how far we’ve come thanks to historic levels of state investment and Californians’ strong demand for clean cars. Each quarter, even in the face of increasing federal headwinds, tens of thousands of consumers are purchasing a ZEV in the Golden State, enjoying a great driving experience, and knowing they never have to go to a gas station again.”

This remarkable growth has also driven the state’s commitment to building a robust ZEV infrastructure network.

“While the federal government reversed and put up roadblocks, the global zero-emission vehicle market surged ahead last year,” said California Air Resources Board Chair Lauren Sanchez. “Governor Newsom’s new rebate proposal sends a clear message: California isn’t slowing down, we’re still leading the pack. It’s not just about clean air, it’s smart economic policy.”

ZEV market demonstrates resilience despite federal policy reversal

During the fourth quarter of 2025, Californians purchased 79,066 new ZEVs, representing 18.9% of new car sales—even after federal tax credits expired on September 30. Ahead of that expiration, sales surged in the third quarter of 2025—accounting for 29.1% of new car sales—likely softening sales in the fourth quarter as a result. While the loss of federal support triggered a nationwide decline in EV sales nationwide—from 10.5% in Q3 to 5.8% in Q4, according to Cox Automotive—California’s market proved far more resilient.

This resilience reflects a market turning point. After decades of strategic state investment in charging infrastructure, consumer incentives, and manufacturer standards, California has built a strong, mature, resilient ZEV ecosystem grounded in policy certainty and sustained investment. Consumers are buying electric vehicles in part because the technology works, the vehicles perform, and the charging infrastructure continues to grow rapidly.

Despite the setbacks from the federal government, sales were still strong in Q4. With 149 ZEV models available in California in Q4 of 2025, consumers are buoyed by the diversity in the ZEV market. Not only do ZEVs produce zero tailpipe pollution, but they are also fun and powerful to drive, and cost less to operate and maintain compared to gas-powered vehicles.

California doubles down on clean transportation investments

California is doubling down on its clean transportation leadership. In his January 9 budget, Governor Newsom proposed a new $200 million incentive program to accelerate ZEV adoption and respond to the loss of the federal ZEV tax credit, while supporting American automotive innovation at a critical moment—just as the Trump administration has abandoned the good-paying jobs of this global market. Less than a year in office, Donald Trump has driven away the United States’ second-largest trading partner, pushing Canada toward deeper economic ties with China while surrendering America’s leadership in electric vehicle manufacturing.

Competing to win the future requires investing in clean energy technologies, strengthening partnerships with allies like Canada, and reducing dependence on China in critical sectors.

Instead, the Trump administration repealed key parts of the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and imposed broad tariffs that have raised costs for American consumers while straining relationships with close allies. Despite Donald Trump’s efforts to cede the clean energy economy to China, California is ensuring American workers and manufacturers can compete and win in the industries that will define this century.

The Golden State’s commitment extends beyond consumer incentives. In the latest Clean Transportation Program Investment Plan Update, the CEC allocated $98.5 million in light-duty zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) infrastructure funding for fiscal year 2025-2026 to focus on Level 1 and Level 2 charging in locations with longer vehicle dwell times, including at-home charging with a specific focus on multifamily residences.

The CEC is also continuing to study infrastructure needs across the state, with the following planned for release later this year:

The third Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Assessment, as mandated by Assembly Bill (AB) 2127, which will assess California’s EV infrastructure needs to meet demand.

The next Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Assessment, as mandated by SB 1000, to assess whether charging infrastructure is disproportionately deployed.

The gold standard for American EV infrastructure

California is tearing down barriers to ZEV deployment, speeding up EV charging station installations, and deploying infrastructure in hard-to-reach and low-income areas.

Becoming an EV driver in California is increasingly getting easier. There are now over 200,000 public and shared EV charging stations statewide. EV chargers can be found at grocery stores, park-and-ride lots, and even gas stations, whereas shared EV chargers can be found at apartment complexes, workplaces, doctors’ offices, sports facilities, and other parking areas with some level of restricted access. This statewide network of public and shared private chargers is in addition to the estimated 800,000 EV chargers installed in California homes.

California’s climate leadership in action

Pollution is down and the economy is up. Greenhouse gas emissions in California are down 21% since 2000 — even as the state’s GDP increased 81% in that same time period, all while becoming the world’s fourth largest economy.

California also continues to set clean energy records. In 2023, the state was powered by two-thirds clean energy, the largest economy in the world to achieve this level. California has also run on 100% clean electricity for part of the day almost every day last year.",https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/At-World-Economic-Forum-Governor-Newsom-announces-California-shattered-clean-car-goal-surpassing-2.5M-ZEV-sales-despite-Trumps-chaos-SEO-GFX-v2.png,N,,2026-01-20 13:59:34.061769

“Everyone that we have talked to so far has been supportive of us moving to a batch study process,” Billo said.","By Arcelia Martin | Inside Climate News

This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

Texas’ grid operator is developing a new process to evaluate multiple large-load interconnection requests at the same time. The question for cryptocurrency miners and data center developers that are already in line is: who gets to go first?

That should hopefully be sorted out by month’s end. That’s when the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) hopes to have criteria announced for which energy-intensive projects could be considered for “Batch Zero,” the first group to go through ERCOT’s revised planning process.

At a Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) meeting on Thursday, Jeff Billo, ERCOT’s vice president of interconnection and grid analysis, said that for “Batch Zero,” the grid operator will consider proposed large load interconnection requests from projects that have been in the queue for some time and don’t need to be restudied. Projects that are less far along will be studied in a later batch, Billo said.

These requests primarily come from data centers, crypto mines, industrial sites and hydrogen projects. Billo also said that just because some existing projects in ERCOT’s queue might warrant another transmission study doesn’t mean they couldn’t still be considered for “Batch Zero.”

“There are a lot of details to fill out there,” Billo said. “We are still really early in the process of designing how that batch study would work.”

The timing of a transmission study matters greatly for companies with billions of dollars at stake in developments requiring grid connection. PUC Chairman Thomas Gleeson said one of the largest points of contention among data center developers has been uncertainty about where their projects stand, despite some having been in the queue for years. Gleeson said it’s important not to leave these companies in limbo while ERCOT sorts out its new procedures for reviewing multiple requests from large energy users together and allocating existing transmission capacity among them. ERCOT previously studied large load users one at a time.

“Transparency around this is going to be critically important to ensuring success,” the chairman said.

The planning around “Batch Zero” comes as ERCOT is well into reforming its transmission planning procedures. With the increasing number of large loads seeking to connect to the grid, ERCOT and utilities cannot keep up with the required transmission planning and end issuing restudies.

The current system, built for a large load queue totalling 40 to 50 projects, is now bogged down by the 225 new interconnection requests ERCOT received last year, according to a December report.

Under its previous planning process, by the time one data center finished planning studies, the results would often have to be reconsidered almost immediately, as more projects joined the interconnection queue and changed the local transmission needs and reliability.

The consensus from early conversations with corporate stakeholders, including Google, Meta, CenterPoint, Amazon and OpenAI—all looking for grid capacity in Texas—was that the uncertainty in the current process creates undue risk for developers with existing interconnection requests.

The proposed batch method aims to ameliorate that.

The outcome of the new process would determine the number of megawatts that Texas’ independent grid could reliably deliver and the additional transmission projects needed to enable full interconnection.

If a developer requested a 500-megawatt project be interconnected in 2028, but the batch study showed that ERCOT could only reliably provide 100 megawatts and would need to undergo a transmission upgrade project in 2030, the developer would be offered an “on-ramp” of 100 megawatts until the transmission upgrade is completed in 2030, Billo said as an example. Then, the developer would receive the full 500 megawatts of grid power.

At the end of the batch study process, developers would have a set amount of time to make a financial commitment, Billo said, to demonstrate they will proceed with the project. After that, ERCOT could begin a transmission project to cover “firm” commitments, which could then be utilized in other batch studies.

The initial sentiment from “hyperscale” data center users like Google, Amazon Web Services, Meta and Microsoft, developers and independent power generators is that a batch-based approach is necessary for large load interconnection, Billo said. “Everyone that we have talked to so far has been supportive of us moving to a batch study process,” Billo said.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/FT-Template-8.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 14:59:41.171455

The funding will help build early-stage enterprises and value chains needed to bring continuous living cover (CLC) crops and cropping systems to commercial scale.

Funding was provided to the MDA by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency under its Minnesota Climate-Smart Food Systems initiative, supported by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

“Continuous living cover is one of the most promising strategies we have for building a more resilient agricultural future in Minnesota,” said MDA Commissioner Thom Petersen. “These investments will help farmers, entrepreneurs, and supply‑chain partners bring innovative crops and systems to market, strengthening rural economies while protecting our soil, water, and climate. Minnesota is proud to support the early‑stage work that turns good ideas into real‑world solutions.”

Continuous living cover refers to agricultural systems that maintain living plants and roots in soil year-round. These systems include winter cover crops sown between summer annuals, agroforestry practices, perennial forage crops, perennial biomass crops, and perennial grain production. Examples include regenerative poultry silvopasture systems, Kernza® perennial grain, winter camelina, and elderberry.

CLC crops have been shown to improve water and soil quality, sequester carbon, build soil health, and enhance biodiversity and pollinator habitat. Scaling these benefits requires strong markets and supply chains that support farmers, processors, and end-users.

Delivered through the Employment Advancement Right Now (EARN) Maryland program, the funding will help more than 100 employers connect more than 750 Marylanders to occupational training, industry-recognized credentials, and supportive services.

“You can't have a competitive state without a growing economy, and you can’t have a growing economy without a clear economic strategy,” said Gov. Moore. “Through EARN Maryland, we are aligning government, business, and workers around a shared goal: preparing more Marylanders for the in-demand jobs of today and tomorrow while strengthening our state’s long-term economic competitiveness.”

EARN Maryland is the state’s nationally recognized, industry-led workforce program that brings together employers, training providers, and community organizations to design training that leads directly to employment or career advancement. Known for its strong return on investment, EARN Maryland generates an estimated $19 of economic impact for every $1 of state funding invested.

Under the Moore-Miller Administration, nearly 4,000 Marylanders have been placed into employment through EARN Maryland. The program has also upskilled more than 5,800 incumbent workers, helping an estimated 1,700 businesses train or upskill valued talent.

“Maryland businesses are upskilling their workers to meet evolving industry needs and creating more opportunities for Marylanders to advance into in-demand careers,” said Maryland Department of Labor Secretary Portia Wu. “By investing in these employer-driven efforts through EARN Maryland, we’re investing in workers, strengthening businesses, and helping to grow and diversify our economy.”

The additional investment announced today advances the Moore-Miller Administration’s all-of-government approach to boosting economic mobility and combating childhood poverty. Two-thirds of awardees will target jobseeker outreach to ENOUGH communities and nearly 40 percent will seek to enroll individuals receiving SNAP benefits into training programs. The ENOUGH Initiative is the Moore-Miller Administration's comprehensive strategy to reduce child poverty and increase economic mobility through coordinated investments in communities with high concentrated levels of poverty.

“EARN Maryland is a proven strategy to increase economic mobility in Maryland, and this expansion to serve ENOUGH communities will maximize its impact,” said Governor’s Office for Children Special Secretary Carmel Martin. “For Maryland’s workforce to thrive, every community needs strong pathways to careers. The Moore-Miller Administration’s all-of-government approach is ensuring the State’s investments are directed where they are needed most.”

“New federal laws place unprecedented obstacles between Marylanders and their SNAP benefits,” said Maryland Department of Human Services Secretary Rafael López. “EARN grants will not only fuel Maryland’s workforce and extend opportunity across our state, but will help families overcome federal red tape and maintain access to vital benefits to put healthy food on the table.”

The Ford CEO has positioned the 121-year-old automaker at the forefront of America's EV revolution, reshaping a company that once democratised the automobile through the assembly line into one that could help define the electric future of mobility.

Ford's iconic status in American manufacturing traces back to 1903, when it made cars accessible to the masses through assembly line production and a locally-based dealer-franchise system. This legacy now serves as the foundation for Jim's Ford+ strategy, which centres on transitioning the company into a leaner, technology-driven and electric-focused automaker.

In partnership with Statista, TIME conducted a survey of US residents to rank the 250 American companies that have shaped culture and society. Ford came out on top, with TIME saying: ""Ford transformed the manufacturing process and also transportation for the average American, reshaping the development of cities and suburbs.""

Today, the company recognises it is in the position to ""redefine the future of mobility in the country"" through electrification.

According to TIME, Bill Ford, Ford's Executive Chairman, says: ""Just as my great-grandfather put the world on wheels to give people the freedom of movement, our approach to the modern era is rooted in that same spirit. Innovation is not just about building batteries or technology for its own sake; it is about making people's lives better.

""We are leveraging our position as the largest hourly auto employer in the US to ensure that the future of transportation is built by American workers for everyday American families.""

Restructuring for electric acceleration

Jim restructured Ford in 2022 into distinct units to accelerate the company's electric vehicle ambitions.

The creation of Ford Model e as a dedicated EV division, separated from Ford Blue for traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, and Ford Pro for commercial services, enabled the automaker to sharpen its focus on the EV market. This strategic separation could allow Ford to compete more effectively in the rapidly evolving electric landscape.

Amid recent softening demand for EVs, Jim has moved towards a broader electric and electrified mix that includes hybrids, extended-range EVs and smaller, more affordable electric models to compete with Chinese automakers, particularly with the rising success of BYD.

Speaking on an episode of the Office Hours: Business Edition podcast in November 2024, Jim said that he was struck by a ""shocking"" discovery when digging into competitors' vehicles, encouraging him to take action that would allow the automaker to compete with Tesla and the rapidly evolving Chinese EV market.

He says that he knew diving into EV innovation was going to be ""brutal business-wise"", adding: ""My ethos is, take on the hardest problems as fast as you can and do it in public because you'll solve them quicker that way.""

While EV sales jumped in the US in the first quarter of 2025, Jim said in Ford's third-quarter earnings call in October 2024 that EVs will only make up 5% of the US car market in the near term.

Building the electric workforce

As part of Ford+, Jim is heavily investing in new talent, particularly from Silicon Valley, to shift the company culture toward software, connectivity and data-driven capabilities essential for electric vehicle development.

Ford and Carhartt, two Detroit-born companies, have formalised a long-standing relationship through a new multi-year strategic partnership focused on strengthening the ""Essential Economy"", announced at the Detroit Auto Show by Jim and by Linda Hubbard, CEO of Carhartt.

The collaboration focuses on workforce development, training the next generation of skilled tradespeople for the electric era, community building and durable products.

Discussing the partnership on LinkedIn, Jim says: ""Ford and Carhartt have been working together on job sites for 100 years, now we're excited to step into a new partnership that makes sure America's workers have the best equipment and gear they can get.""

This commitment to the American workforce could cement Ford's role in leading the nation's electric vehicle transition.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/388e939b6e37793f5f718ac60c27b174:5b79a7e99dc51ec07fdacf469fcbe752/blue-oval-city-jim-farley-10.JPG.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 13:01:20.759731

The funding, led by Wittington Investments, Limited, acknowledges the food waste problem across North America and recognizes Divert’s scalable solutions.

“This investment is a strong endorsement of what our team has built over 19 years as we continue to scale our infrastructure to solve the wasted food crisis,” says Ryan Begin, CEO and co-founder, Divert. “This funding underscores confidence in our industry leadership, proven ability to turn vision into infrastructure at scale, and the measurable impact of our solutions. We are eager to expand our footprint in North America and continue to deliver value to customers, communities, and investors.”

In 2023, the U.S. generated nearly 74 million tons of surplus food, and in Canada, over 46% of food is wasted every year. With this new investment fueling expansion plans, Divert is accelerating its business momentum, including the buildout of its Integrated Diversion & Energy Facilities in Longview, Washington and Lexington, North Carolina, which are expected to commence operations later this year.

Through these facilities, Divert recoups the value in unsold non-donatable food by leveraging anaerobic digestion to transform food and liquids into beneficial products — including carbon-negative renewable energy, soil amendment and nitrogen-rich fertilizer. The company’s model supports major food retailers and manufacturers in achieving organic waste mandate compliance, meeting food waste reduction goals, and uncovering cost benefits through better purchasing and merchandising decisions.

In Turlock, California, Divert is already operating an Integrated Diversion & Energy Facility that is capable of processing 100,000 tons of unsold, non-donatable food products annually to reduce wasted food and promote circularity in the region.

In addition, Divert's parent company, Ara Divert HoldCo, recently expanded its board of directors to bolster Divert’s energy expertise and international support at a time of critical growth. Joining the board of directors are Zvi Orvitz, managing director, sustainability and energy transition, at Wittington Investments, Limited, and Ali Naqvi, chief investment officer at Ontario Power Generation.

Former Governor Roy Cooper holds a durable 5-point lead over Michael Whatley for U.S. Senate

North Carolina voters remain closely divided on downballot elections

Voters support independent redistricting – unless it might cost their side

As America barrels into a turbulent election year, North Carolina voters are on track for another closely contested, yet potentially pivotal, election year. The January edition of the Carolina Forward Poll finds North Carolina’s voters once again narrowly divided not only about candidates for office, but about the future direction of the state and nation.

Will Roy Cooper break the streak?

North Carolina’s Democrats have not won a statewide federal election in 18 years. Ever since former President Barack Obama and the late Senator Kay Hagan’s wins in 2008, Republicans have won every statewide election since for U.S. Senate and the Presidency. This continues a long tradition of partisan ticket-splitting between state-level and federal races in North Carolina that reaches all the way back into the 1970s.

Yet it appears that former Governor Roy Cooper could very well break that losing streak in 2026. Roy Cooper holds a 5-point lead over his presumptive Republican opponent, Michael Whatley.

This represents a slight dip since the September Carolina Forward Poll, where Cooper held a 7-point lead. Yet that slight narrowing appears mainly attributable to consolidation among Republican voters. The poll shows that former Governor Cooper is gaining among Independent voters. Unless we see a significant reversal, Cooper remains the favorite to be the first Democratic candidate to win a statewide federal race since 2008.

Michael Whatley remains the presumptive Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate. Even after months of campaigning by candidate Don Brown and a splashy entrance by the ever-peculiar Michele Morrow, neither candidate has managed to crack double digits among Republican primary voters. Even though Whatley himself has still not won over a majority of Republican primary voters, neither of his declared rivals appears to be a legitimate challenge. As the Republican establishment’s preferred option, Michael Whatley will almost assuredly be the Republican candidate in November.

Turning to the North Carolina State legislature, the generic ballot has tightened. Voters are equally split about whether they’d pick the Republican or Democratic candidate for their representative in Raleigh:

Similarly to the U.S. Senate ballot, this tightening mostly reflects consolidation among Republican voters and some movement among Democrats within the margin of error. This poll shows a 17-point net swing towards Democrats among Independent voters since the September poll.

One of the highest-profile races in North Carolina this year will be for the state’s Supreme Court. Democratic incumbent Justice Anita Earls is defending her seat against Republican State House Representative Sarah Stevens. The poll shows the two effectively tied, with Stevens holding a 1-point lead over Earls.

The breakdowns in support are almost identical to the generic ballot, suggesting that the Supreme Court race is still very low-visibility. Most voters have not heard much, or anything, about it.

One of the biggest developments across the United States in the Trump era has been aggressive, militarized anti-immigration crackdowns. Back in November, North Carolina itself saw this close up with ICE’s “Operation Charlotte’s Web” exercise, which focused but was not limited to Charlotte and Raleigh metro areas. In the January poll, we asked voters to indicate their view on the operation. A clear majority was negative, with a plurality saying they thought the ICE crackdown mistreated people and targeted people for their skin color.

As expected, responses to this question are highly polarized by partisanship, with independents strongly siding with Democrats.

One interesting observation about this question is that it references events – “Operation Charlotte’s Web” – that occurred some time ago, just before the holidays. The ICE crackdown mostly concluded before Thanksgiving in November 2025. Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s passed in the intervening 6 weeks before that conclusion and the fielding of this poll on January 5th. Despite that distance, the crackdown retains strong recall and resonance with voters, with only a very small proportion saying they “don’t know enough” about it. Most of that recall is distinctly negative.

(This poll was also out of the field when Renee Good was shot and killed by ICE agents in Minneapolis on January 7th.)

Independent redistricting for me – but not for thee

This poll took a new twist on the long tradition of polling North Carolina voters about their appetite for independent redistricting.

For years, polls from different ideological points of view have found that North Carolina voters broadly support the idea of an independent redistricting system which would end partisan gerrymandering. But in this survey, we took the investigation one step further: would partisan voters still support independent redistricting, if their opponents could conceivably benefit? It turns out that many of them would not.

First, voters were asked if they would support a system of independent redistricting. Then, as a follow-up, self-identified Republican respondents were separately informed that “some experts believed” that such a system could benefit Democrats, while self-identified Democratic respondents were told the opposite. This additional piece of information significantly changed responses.

When informed that a system of independent redistricting could result in more Democratic representation, Republican support flips from +19 net support to -46 net opposition – a head-spinning 65-point swing.

Democratic voters, when informed that a system of independent redistricting could result in more Republican representation, flip from +35 net support to -17 net opposition – a similarly dizzying 52-point swing.

While Democrats appear to be modestly less so, both party bases appear to be much more strongly influenced by partisan gain than principle when it comes to ending gerrymandering in North Carolina. To successfully end partisan gerrymandering as Democratic lawmakers in Virginia did in 2019, or as voters in Michigan secured, lawmakers of either party would need ironclad principle to resist the demands of some of their base for partisan vengeance.

The grid is warning Pennsylvania

RealClearPennsylvania

Pennsylvania faces a severe energy crisis as the PJM Interconnection grid reports a large capacity shortfall, threatening power for millions of homes. This deficit, underscored by record auction prices, reflects a failure to build new generation infrastructure amidst rising demand and regulatory hurdles. Coterra’s Bill desRosiers argues that Pennsylvania must leverage its vast natural gas reserves to secure the grid’s future. The article promotes Senate Bill 1106, which utilizes tax credits to incentivize private investment in baseload power. By aligning public goals with private capital, Pennsylvania can ensure energy reliability and affordability while reclaiming its position as a strategic energy leader. [MDN: Our buddy Bill desRosiers is spot on with this article. Only if PA rapidly builds more gas-fired power can it deliver on the promise of Senator McCormick’s $92 billion of promised AI data center investments. The time is now! Don’t blow it, PA!!]

Valero to cut 200+ jobs as California refinery closes

Bloomberg/Rigzone

Valero Energy Corp. is permanently closing its Benicia refinery, leading to the layoff of 237 non-union employees between March 15 and July 1. Representing the bulk of the facility’s staff, these job cuts follow a 2025 announcement that persisted despite unsuccessful intervention attempts by Governor Gavin Newsom and local officials. This closure contributes to California’s dwindling fuel supply and high gasoline prices as more refineries shutter or pivot to biofuels. However, Newsom noted that Valero will maintain its presence by importing fuel to the region, avoiding a complete exit and helping to stabilize the state’s energy needs. [MDN: This is directly due to the policies of Gov. Gruesome Newsom. Facilities closing, jobs eliminated, and less gasoline meaning not only are the jobs gone, but the price of gas is higher in the “Golden” State. Way to go, Gruesome! What a putz.]

Pipeline construction reaches an 18-year high on natural gas demand

Midland (TX) Reporter-Telegram

The United States is entering its most significant natural gas pipeline boom in nearly two decades, with a massive expansion projected for 2026. Approximately 12 projects across Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma will increase the region’s shipping capacity by 13%, adding roughly 18 billion cubic feet per day. This surge, the largest since 2008, is primarily driven by soaring global demand for liquefied natural gas exports destined for Europe and Asia. New infrastructure, such as Enbridge’s Rio Bravo and Energy Transfer’s Hugh Brinson pipelines, will provide critical relief for Permian Basin drillers currently facing negative prices due to pipeline congestion. [MDN: This is great for Texas and the southwest, but not so great for the M-U as it means more gas from down there will compete with our gas for LNG exports. American itself wins in the end.]

Michigan to study white hydrogen’s potential

RBN Energy

Governor Gretchen Whitmer has established the Michigan Geologic Hydrogen Exploration and Preparedness Initiative to evaluate the state’s potential for “white” or naturally occurring hydrogen. This initiative aims to decarbonize high-pollution sectors like manufacturing and maritime shipping. An executive order mandates a report by April 1 to assess infrastructure, regulatory readiness, and the feasibility of repurposing existing oil and gas wells. While a 2025 U.S. Geological Survey map identifies Michigan as a high-prospectivity region for these deposits, established extraction strategies are currently lacking. Michigan’s proactive approach seeks to leverage this clean energy resource to bolster its economic and environmental future. [MDN: Again we make this point…it doesn’t matter how the hydrogen is produced, it could come from magical sources like unicorn farts…the issue is, Where are the customers for it? If you don’t have people who want to buy and use it, it’s senseless to find new sources or ways of producing it!]

U.S. natural gas slips ahead of long weekend

Wall Street Journal

U.S. natural gas futures for February delivery settled 0.8% lower at $3.103/mmBtu, marking a 2.1% loss for the week as the market headed into the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend. Despite colder weather forecasts for late January, prices failed to rally—a rare decoupling of weather trends and market performance that NatGasWeather.com attributes to significant inventory surpluses, robust production levels, and a recent pullback in LNG feedgas flows. [MDN: Bummer. Let’s hope the price doesn’t continue this downward trend. We NEED to keep it above $3.]

EIA inventory report weighs on futures despite cold forecast

FX Empire

Natural gas futures are facing downward pressure as high inventory levels continue to outweigh the impact of incoming cold weather. Despite forecasts predicting below-normal temperatures across the northern and eastern United States through late January, the market remains in a bearish “sell the rally” mode. Recent Energy Information Administration (EIA) data revealed that natural gas stockpiles are 3.4% above the five-year seasonal average, signaling a significant supply surplus. Prices recently settled near $3.10, with technical analysis suggesting a sustained downtrend unless a solid support base forms near the $3.00 level to absorb the ample supply.

How to add 300 gigawatts of nuclear energy by 2050

Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT)

President Trump’s executive orders aim to spark a nuclear renaissance by adding 300 gigawatts of capacity, viewing nuclear energy as a superior alternative to wind and solar. While Westinghouse plans new AP1000 reactors, Canadian firm AtkinsRéalis is seeking U.S. licensing for its CANDU technology to help meet these ambitious goals. Unlike traditional designs, CANDU reactors use natural uranium, can be refueled during operation, and produce vital medical isotopes. Despite past regulatory hurdles and cost overruns, this cross-border collaboration and focus on large-scale reactors are presented as the primary pathway to doubling America’s energy capacity and achieving long-term energy reliability. [MDN: Maybe there is something worthwhile north of the border besides hockey. Who knew?! We’re all for expanding nuclear energy.]

Should data center companies learn from the fracking boom?

Time Magazine/AOL

To address growing community backlash over massive energy and water consumption, data center companies are adopting strategies from the fracking industry’s playbook. Microsoft’s Brad Smith recently proposed a “social contract” to build local trust, promising that data centers will pay higher electricity rates to shield residents from price hikes. Tech firms also plan to fund community infrastructure—such as schools, hospitals, and parks—while prioritizing local hiring. Advised by the American Petroleum Institute to avoid the negative reputation of hydraulic fracturing, the industry is shifting toward proactive engagement to prove their benefits outweigh the costs through long-term trust and tangible investments. [MDN: Smart move. It’s time to get ahead of anti-frackers-turned-anti-data-center lefties now, while we still can.]

Top 6 American energy trends to watch in 2026

Forbes

In 2026, U.S. energy policy is pivoting toward fossil fuels and nuclear power to bolster national security and support the booming AI sector. Expanding data centers are creating massive electricity demand, straining the grid and prompting regionalized governance. Private capital is increasingly funding small modular reactors to overcome regulatory hurdles and meet energy needs. Geopolitically, potential oil production increases from Venezuela and Iran may contain global prices. Ultimately, the administration is prioritizing domestic production and supply chain resiliency over climate-focused subsidies, treating energy infrastructure as a core strategic asset to maintain a competitive edge against China. [MDN: In other words, common sense is now the governing philosophy of the land under Trump. And it can’t happen soon enough.]

Trump sends a geothermal love letter to coal, oil, and natural gas

CleanTechnica

The Trump administration is championing geothermal energy as a reliable, 24/7 baseload power source, granting it special status alongside fossil fuels and nuclear energy. While traditional renewables like wind and solar are excluded from this preference, geothermal benefits from advanced drilling technologies borrowed from the oil and gas sector. Initiatives like the 13-state Geothermal Power Accelerator and expedited permitting for projects in Nevada highlight this support. Although intended to complement domestic energy, geothermal’s expansion into power generation and HVAC systems poses a long-term threat to coal, natural gas, and oil by offering a clean, constant alternative. [MDN: What the lefties of CleanTechnica get wrong is that geothermal doesn’t “threaten” oil and natural gas. It uses the VERY SAME drilling techniques used by the shale industry. It employs the same companies the shale industry uses. It’s complementary, not competitive. And it exposes the LIE that drilling (and fracking) are somehow environmentally damaging, because it the environment is damaged when drilling for O&G, why isn’t it damaged when the VERY SAME methods are used for geothermal?]

INTERNATIONAL

Crude settles higher after volatile week

Bloomberg/Rigzone

Oil prices stabilized near $60 a barrel following a volatile week, rebounding slightly after a sharp 4.6% plunge. While President Trump’s softened rhetoric toward Iran reduced immediate fears of supply disruptions, a continued U.S. military buildup in the Middle East maintains a lingering risk premium. Additional support came from export issues in Kazakhstan and the North Sea, even as low prices forced Continental Resources to halt drilling in North Dakota. As U.S.-Ukraine talks loom as a potential bearish factor, strategists warn that prolonged price suppression may discourage essential industry investment, threatening future production and economic stability.

You could soon buy a BYD electric car in Canada under a new trade agreement between the nation and China that was announced on Friday, Jan. 16.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Canada will allow up to 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into its market, with the most-favored-nation tariff rate of 6.1%. Carney's office said the amount of Chinese EVs it plans to allow to be sold in Canada ""corresponds to volumes in the year prior to recent trade frictions on these imports (2023-2024), representing less than 3% of the Canadian market for new vehicles sold in Canada.""

Carney's office said ""it is expected that within three years, this agreement will drive considerable new Chinese joint-venture investment in Canada with trusted partners to protect and create new auto manufacturing careers for Canadian workers, and ensure a robust build-out of Canada’s EV supply chain.""

""With this agreement, it is also anticipated that, in five years, more than 50% of these vehicles will be affordable EVs with an import price of less than $35,000, creating new lower-cost options for Canadian consumers,"" Carney's office said.

Who are the current biggest EV sellers in Canada?

These were the top-selling EV models in Canada from 2020-2024, according to the Canada Energy Regulator:

Tesla Model 3

Tesla Model Y

Hyundai Kona Electric

Volkswagen ID.4

What do unions think about Canada allowing Chinese EVs to be sold there?

The Unifor union, which is Canada's largest private sector labor group, panned the deal to allow Chinese EVs to be sold in Canada.

""This is a self-inflicted wound to an already injured Canadian auto industry,"" Unifor National President Lana Payne said in a statement. ""Providing a foothold to cheap Chinese EVs, backed by massive state subsidies, overproduction and designed to expand market share through exports, puts Canadian auto jobs at risk while rewarding, labour violations and unfair trade practices.""

Payne also said the decision will make it harder for Canada to solved problems caused by U.S. tariffs on Canadian vehicles and rollbacks to U.S. EV policies that she said have harmed the nation's autoworkers.

""Finding a resolution to U.S. auto tariffs just got more difficult as Canada has surrendered the leverage of opening our market to China,"" she said.

What do US EV supporters think about Canada allowing Chinese EVs to be sold there?

U.S. electric car supporters blamed President Donald Trump's tariffs for opening the door to the Canada-China deal.

""When U.S. trade policy becomes chaotic, unpredictable and destructive, bad outcomes are inevitable,"" Murphy continued. ""President Trump has really bungled the job when it comes to standing up for U.S. auto jobs and North American auto manufacturing.""

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Albert Gore, the executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association in Washington and the son of former Vice President Al Gore, said in a statement the Canada-China announcement, and also a previous announcement of a similar deal between China and the European Union, ""shows that the global automotive market’s interest in electric transportation remains strong.""

NEW DEP CHIEF — POLITICO’s Ry Rivard: In 2023, the head of the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters saw the man he’d championed as the nation’s “greenest governor” getting eclipsed by progressive governors in other states.

So Ed Potosnak stripped Phil Murphy of the superlative, publicly airing frustrations with Murphy that had been growing among the state’s environmentalists. A month later, Murphy gave a major speech to unleash a new series of climate change goals that gave New Jersey the most aggressive clean energy target of any large state at the time.

Now Mikie Sherrill has picked Potosnak to lead the Department of Environmental Protection, a move that would put an environmental advocate in charge of regulating a major industrial state.

Potosnak was a former high school chemistry teacher and an education fellow in a congressional office before becoming the executive director of the state chapter of the League of Conservation Voters in 2012. He’s a council member in Franklin Township. He is also a licensed contractor, something both he and Sherrill touted when his nomination was announced last week.

POUND THE TABLE — POLITICO’s Ry Rivard: Phil Murphy’s top environmental regulator stayed busy right until the end of the administration to finalize sweeping coastal development rules, advance a massive water pollution settlement and release strict drinking water standards for lead and copper.

During his five years on the job, Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn LaTourette shepherded through complex regulations, including first-in-the-nation environmental justice standards, recovered more than $3 billion in settlement money from industrial polluters and sparred with Republican lawmakers and industry lobbyists.

LaTourette’s advice for his successor — expected to be environmental advocate Ed Potosnak — is to pound the table for money to help pay for water projects because of an approaching “fiscal cliff” for infrastructure funding.

PJM DATA CENTER PLAN — POLITICO’s Mona Zhang: PJM, the regional grid operator that serves 13 states including New Jersey, has finally released its proposal for how to handle an influx of data centers driving up energy prices in the region.

“This is not a yes/no to data centers. This is ‘How can we do this while keeping the lights on and recognizing the impact on consumers at the same time?’” PJM board chair and interim President David Mills said in a statement.

The grid operator started looking into handling data center demand in August through a process that fast-tracks decision making within the organization. The proposal comes on the same day that the White House convened a meeting with a bipartisan group of governors representing states in the PJM region. PJM itself was not informed or involved in the meeting.

PERMITTING CHANGES SUPPORT: New York Gov. Kathy Hochul’s push to change the State Environmental Quality Review Act in order to speed up home building has broad public support, according to a poll released today by Open New York, a pro-development advocacy group.

The poll conducted by Global Strategy Group found 63 percent of likely New York voters would favor overhauling the measure to hasten affordable housing construction. A similar majority of voters, 61 percent, said they would be more likely to vote for a state legislator that supports reforming the law. And 57 percent said they would be “more favorable” toward Hochul if she signed changes into law, the poll found. The survey of 800 likely New York voters was conducted Nov. 4-10 last year, with a margin of error of +/- 3.5 percentage points.

The survey is being released as Hochul is pressing for the changes in the legislative session as she presses to stifle housing costs.

“The polling is very clear: New Yorkers from every region, age, ethnicity and political party support modernizing SEQRA because they know it’s key to addressing both the affordability crisis and the climate crisis,” said Open New York Executive Director Annemarie Gray. — Nick Reisman

ARMY CORPS FUNDING QUESTIONS: Two New York lawmakers want more information about the status of Army Corps of Engineers funding for the Hudson River after threats by President Donald Trump’s budget director. White House budget director Russ Vought threatened Army Corps projects primarily in Democratic-led states in October, during the government shutdown.

Reps. Ritchie Torres and Adriano Espaillat sent a letter to Vought last week demanding updates about the status of the Hudson Raritan Estuary program given those statements and the lack of subsequent information.

“These projects strengthen ecosystems that mitigate the effects of intense storms, as well as improve connectivity and ecological health in local tributaries,” the letter states. “All of the projects will improve the community, environment, and lives of countless New Yorkers living in and around the Hudson Raritan Estuary.” — Marie J.

What you may have missed

ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITTING PUSH — POLITICO’s Mona Zhang: Gov. Kathy Hochul is seeking a major overhaul of the state’s environmental review law in a bid to spur the development of affordable housing and infrastructure projects.

“We’re taking a hard look at the environmental review processes that have not been updated in half a century,” Hochul said in her State of the State address. “Right now, they slow down the very projects that help us fight climate change, create housing and strengthen our communities.”

Seemingly all corners of New York chimed in to support the proposal, including mayors from across the state, labor leaders, local business groups, homebuilders and environmental advocates. But the exact details of what she’s proposing still remain to be seen and could ultimately prove contentious.

MICRON LAWSUIT — POLITICO’s Marie J. French: Micron’s future neighbors are challenging the state’s environmental review of the semiconductor factory that’s expected to create more than 4,000 jobs as Gov. Kathy Hochul and other officials celebrate the start of construction.

The lawsuit filed Friday argues state and local authorities failed to follow New York’s signature environmental review statute in permitting the semiconductor factory in Clay. It raises concerns about the project’s impacts on about 200 acres of wetlands, potential chemicals that will be used at the plant and the emissions from the factory.

The lawsuit was filed by a local resident group and Jobs to Move America, a nonprofit that has organized residents and raised concerns about the lack of enforceable employment commitments, including for local community members.

THE COST OF DATA CENTERS — POLITICO’s Marie J. French: Gov. Kathy Hochul is moving to get ahead of a potential wave of large new data centers in New York and address concerns about their potential to drive up energy costs.

Hochul announced plans to require data centers to pay more for energy — or bring their own sources. It’s an approach that’s drawn bipartisan support, including from President Donald Trump and California Democrats.

“Data centers are vital for an innovative future. But they guzzle up tremendous amounts of energy and leave ratepayers footing the bill,” Hochul said during her State of the State address.

New York hasn’t seen major new data center development yet, but there are thousands of megawatts of proposed projects — some speculative, others actively seeking local approvals — looking to connect to the state’s grid. Demand for data centers is driven by the explosion in artificial intelligence usage.

EMPIRE WIND RESUMES — E&E News’ Ian M. Stevenson: A federal judge has allowed an offshore wind project off New York to resume construction, a major reprieve for the multibillion-dollar project that was on the brink of abandoning work after receiving a stop-work order from the Trump administration last month.

TRUMP TO TECH FIRMS: PAY UP — POLITICO’s Matt Daily: President Donald Trump and a bipartisan group of governors will direct the the nation’s biggest grid operator to hold a special auction for technology companies to fund the construction of new power plants needed to supply data centers.

PUSHING PACKAGING REDUCTION: A new analysis of New York’s Packaging Reduction and Recycling Infrastructure Act found that the bill could benefit New Yorkers to the tune of more than $400 million a year.

The PRRIA passed the Senate last session and made it through its Assembly committees, but didn’t get a floor vote.

Advocates point to the financial benefits of the legislation, including fewer waste management costs and new revenue from reimbursements. An analysis of nine municipalities from environmental group Beyond Plastics and Bennington College found that implementing the PRRIA would result in an estimated $411 million in financial benefits, including $380.5 million for New York City, $12.7 million for Hempstead and $2.6 million for Syracuse.

“There’s no good way to dispose of trash as landfills across the state … fill up and close,” said Sam Fein, chief city auditor for Albany. “We need to reduce the amount of trash we create.”

The bill drew intense lobbying last session, with opponents arguing that it would end up increasing costs for consumers.

“This legislation could increase household costs by upwards of $732 per year on top of already high prices for many everyday items,” Ken Pokalsky, vice president of The Business Council of New York State, said in a statement. “There is nothing in this bill that would guarantee that any cost-shifting relief provided to municipalities will actually reduce local tax burdens.” — Mona Zhang

STATE ENERGY LEADERS ON NUCLEAR GOAL: Major questions remain about how New York’s agencies will execute Gov. Kathy Hochul’s 5-gigawatt nuclear goal. The costs could be enormous — the state’s own evaluation found new nuclear to be more expensive in the near term than carbon capture and storage with a wide range of uncertainty. The next large-scale new nuclear plant may take more than a decade to build, according to that state report. But Hochul is betting on new nuclear plants that run almost constantly to provide a baseline of emissions-free energy to bolster the grid, in line with analysis in the state’s recently approved energy plan.

The Public Service Commission will likely start a new proceeding to incentivize the 4 gigawatts of new nuclear Hochul backed during her State of the State address. “We will move as quickly as possible to bring about the governor’s directive,” PSC Chair Rory Christian said. He said that resource diversity is a critical part of the state’s energy mix.

“We have nuclear that can provide a significant amount of baseload, which is generally more affordable and provides more in terms of grid reliability than renewables currently available,” Christian said. “This is not about devoting ourselves to a specific technology — it’s about devoting ourselves to the reliability and affordability of the grid overall.”

The commission has an ongoing process looking at technologies to achieve the state’s 2040 zero emissions electricity target in the climate law. Christian said that’s still being evaluated and the commission will issue its order “in due time.” He declined to commit to any action by the end of this year.

NYSERDA President and CEO Doreen Harris said the governor’s target allows the authority to “solve for the number” as it advances the forthcoming nuclear master plan. That will address issues including community engagement, supply chain investments and workforce needs. “It allows these pieces to come together in a manner that is cohesive,” Harris said. “We will now have a number that the private sector can be solving for and frankly that we can be working toward with the federal government where we see alignment as well as the actions from the state outside of the Public Service Commission that will be necessary.” — Marie J. French

SOLAR COST SAVINGS: Expanding distributed solar and battery storage throughout New York could save $1 billion by 2035, according to a new study by Synapse Energy Economics for the trade group Coalition for Community Solar Access.

While the state is on track to meet its 10 gigawatts of distributed solar by 2030, it could save even more by expanding distributed solar and storage while shoring up reliability.

“Solar energy is the cheapest form of energy to produce and a linchpin for affordability,” state Sen. Pete Harckham said in a statement. Harckham introduced a bill to accelerate distributed solar, which is in the Senate Environmental Conservation Committee.

The report looked at what would happen if the state increased its distributed solar to 20 gigawatts by 2035, a major goal of solar industry groups this session: $1 billion in avoided energy costs, including $542 million in savings upstate and $481 million in savings downstate. It would also save an estimated $947 million in carbon dioxide emissions costs.

It would reduce demand on the grid and lower the market clearing price for the New York Independent System Operator. Storage can also enhance those benefits by charging during low demand and discharging during high-demand periods.

Increasing distributed solar and storage would help insulate consumers from the volatility of gas prices and help the state with electrification as peak demand moves from the summer to winter. — Mona Zhang

HOCHUL FOCUSES ON NUCLEAR, UTILITY COSTS — POLITICO’s Marie J. French and Mona Zhang: Gov. Kathy Hochul is focusing on building new nuclear power plants and reining in rising utility bills as she elevates her focus on affordability in an election year.

The governor’s State of the State proposals include a number of changes to utility-rate setting, an effort to ease permitting rules, particularly for housing, and programs to prepare for the impacts of climate change.

“We can make energy more affordable and reliable while still leading the nation in sustainable investments,” Hochul said during her speech in Albany.

Beyond a long-term effort to build new nuclear, the governor last week didn’t advance any major new policies or funding to reduce emissions from buildings or transportation. That’s frustrating for some environmental advocates who want to see continued progress toward New York’s climate goals, which it is not on track to meet.

DANSKAMMER PLANS TO RETIRE: The rarely needed Danskammer power plant on the shore of the Hudson River in Orange County has filed to retire in August. The 530-megawatt gas- and oil-powered plant once sought to repower with a new combined cycle gas plant, but Gov. Kathy Hochul rejected an air permit for the project in 2021. The New York Independent System Operator posted the deactivation notice with a retirement date of August. This triggers a review by the grid operator to check for any reliability impacts from the proposed retirement. — Marie J. French

Lately, President Trump has been talking about making sure that AI data centers pay their fair share for electricity costs.","On the campaign trail, President Trump promised to cut Americans' energy bills in half — cheaper gasoline, cheaper electricity. He also said he'd ""unleash"" American energy production, often repeating the catchphrase ""Drill, baby, drill.""

One year in, the price of gasoline is down about 20%. But the U.S. oil industry is definitely not drilling, baby, drilling. The price of oil is just too low to justify more of it — although within the last year, companies have won major lobbying victories that soothe that sting. Meanwhile, electricity costs are rising and expected to rise more.

Cheap gasoline: check

The U.S. benchmark price for oil is down about 20% from where it was a year ago, and the average retail gasoline price — the price drivers pay at the pump — is down nearly 10%.

Now, presidents — whoever they are — do not get to decide the price of gasoline. The price of crude oil is the biggest factor, and crude prices are set in a complex global marketplace that responds to a number of factors.

In the past year, cheaper crude has been largely driven by a global oversupply of oil, which in turn was largely driven by a series of decisions by the oil cartel OPEC+. The cartel repeatedly put more barrels on the market, depressing global prices but seizing more market share for its members.

However, Dan Pickering, the chief investment officer at Pickering Energy Partners, says the president also put significant pressure on OPEC to bring down global crude prices. As a result, he gives Trump partial credit for today's low prices.

""I think if we look at oil down 20% in 2025, that you have to say that political dynamics drove at least half of that,"" he says. ""And as we go into 2026, I think those dynamics will still be at play.""

Moving forward, the president's push to produce more oil from Venezuela could also help keep global crude prices lower for longer — if he persuades companies to invest.

Analysts with the gas prices app GasBuddy found that U.S. households spent, on average, $177 less on gasoline in 2025 than 2024, thanks to lower prices, and they predict that expenditures will continue to fall in 2026, saving Americans a collective $11 billion next year.

Drill, baby, drill? Not so much.

Those lower oil prices are exactly why ""Drill, baby, drill"" didn't happen.

The number of active drilling rigs in the U.S., the largest oil producer in the world, has dropped by more than 6% year-over-year, at last count. That means fewer new wells are being drilled. And that's true even as the Trump administration has made it easier for companies to start new projects, including by making more federal lands and waters available for leases.

With U.S. oil prices under $60 a barrel and the global market generally oversupplied with crude, it's just not profitable for companies to drill a bunch of new wells right now.

The Trump administration has many close allies in the U.S. oil industry. But this is a perennial point of disagreement between them: The president loves cheap oil, while companies would prefer prices to be higher than they are today.

This disagreement was actually called out by Secretary of Energy Chris Wright — a former fracking executive. Speaking to CBS News' Face the Nation this month, he called President Trump ""no helper to the oil and gas industry"" because ""he's driven down the price of oil.""

It's true that many U.S. oil workers wince every time the president talks about $50 crude or pushes for more production from OPEC. But it's not quite fair to call the administration ""no helper.""

The American Petroleum Institute, or API, is the most powerful lobbying arm of the U.S. oil and gas industry. Before Trump was reelected, the group laid out a dozen different policy priorities — a wish list. Tax policy changes that would help oil companies; more access to drilling in the Gulf; a boost in exports of liquefied natural gas; the repeal of requirements for cleaner and more efficient cars, which would have pushed down oil demand over time; the elimination of a fee for releasing planet-warming methane.

""By our count, every single one of them was completed in 2025, with the exception of legislative permitting reform,"" Mike Sommers, the president and CEO of API, said on a recent call with reporters. (""Permitting reform"" refers to a series of changes to federal laws that would make it easier for companies to build things like pipelines and other large projects that often face local opposition. It's been a hot topic in Congress for years.)

Sommers says U.S. companies can weather low oil prices in the short term and make business decisions with an eye toward the future.

And in the long term, the administration's policy changes support higher oil demand for years to come by doing things like slowing down the shift toward electric vehicles, while also cutting the costs of oil production, including by easing environmental rules.

Electricity costs are rising

Electricity prices have been increasing for years now, and 2025 was more of the same.

""Across most states and in most markets, what we see is that prices have gone up,"" says Helen Kou, an analyst with BloombergNEF.

Based on trends in wholesale power markets — where your local electric company buys its power, an expense they pass on to you — that's likely to continue. Kou said that in New York and New England, wholesale prices are up more than 60%, and in the mid-Atlantic they're up 45%.

""Almost 1 in 3 households, or over 80 million Americans, are struggling to pay their utility bills,"" says Charles Hua, who runs Powerlines, a national energy consumer education nonprofit that encourages people to get more involved in their public utility commissions.

Why are costs going up? Hua points to three primary reasons: an aging power grid, the cost of natural disasters, and higher fuel costs, especially natural gas.

Kou says that for 2025, natural gas prices were the clear driver of increases. While oil and gasoline are cheap, natural gas — which is used for home heating and power plants — has gone up more than 50% from last year's annual average. U.S. exports of natural gas have increased (one of API's requests), and sending more natural gas overseas means less is available domestically.

Natural gas prices have been up and down over the past few years. They spiked in 2022, after Russia invaded Ukraine. And they were unusually cheap in 2024 before rising again in 2025. While they're far from record highs, the increase has been enough to significantly shift electricity markets.

These causes are complex and date back years before Trump's return to office. But experts say the Trump administration's electricity policy has not focused on lowering natural gas costs, improving the grid or mitigating the effects of natural disasters. Instead, it has aligned with his goal of reversing Biden-era climate policies. The White House has ordered coal-powered power plants to stay open for longer. Those power plants are typically expensive to operate, raising concerns about prices. Kou says keeping them online could hypothetically help meet rising demand, but only if those plants are located where demand is growing.

The administration is also investing in nuclear power — that, too, could potentially help with costs, but only in the long term, Kou says, because nuclear plants take so long to approve and build.

Some of the administration's moves could actually increase electricity bills in the future.

Large solar and wind projects provide more cost-competitive energy than natural gas, nuclear and coal projects, according to financial services firm Lazard. But the Trump administration has ended federal tax credits for solar and wind projects early, and canceled more than $13 billion in funds for green energy projects

Trump has also said he won't permit any new wind projects, and the administration has attempted to stop offshore wind projects that are already under construction, leading to court battles. That's been criticized not just by renewable energy advocates, but by many business groups, because it creates uncertainty and discourages investments in projects that could be supplying more energy into the grid.

""As a general matter, the thing that you can do that most clearly helps reduce prices is to remove barriers to new energy investment,"" says James Coleman, a nonresident senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""And the thing that basically just increases prices is increasing uncertainty or barriers to energy.""

The administration is also rolling back efficiency standards for appliances. Those standards actually cut consumer bills by reducing energy use, Hua notes.

Meanwhile, some things that could meaningfully cut costs have simply not been prioritized by this administration. ""There are solutions that are available today that can be put on the grid that would meaningfully resolve a lot of these solutions,"" Hua says, pointing to technologies that allow more power to be moved on the existing grid, or better match supply and demand. ""It doesn't solve everything, but it provides some immediate relief … and that just has not been as much of a focus"" for the Trump administration, he says.

Lately, President Trump has been talking about making sure that AI data centers pay their fair share for electricity costs. Hua says there is a genuine opportunity to cut energy bills for ordinary Americans as data center demand for electricity goes up, depending on how costs are spread out.

But for now, the Trump administration's pledge to cut utility bills remains an unmet promise.

Despite overseeing the launch of petrol-fuelled vehicles including the GLC, E-Class (W124) and C-Class (W206/SC06), his focus has shifted significantly.

Since Ola became Chairman of the Board of Management and CEO in 2019, the automotive giant has aggressively expanded its portfolio under the Mercedes-EQ brand, with the aim of achieving up to 50% electrified sales by 2030.

Ola told ABC News about his personal transition from combustion to electric power during an interview released on 20 January 2025.

“I used to work at AMG, I am a petrol head, I love the V8, I was in Formula 1. Nobody needs to convince me about the passion for motorsports and what it’s all about.""

However, he says that his recent experiences behind the wheel have changed his perspective on drivetrain capabilities.

“But the last few years, I have been driving electric vehicles and the power performance, but also the quietness of those vehicles, is unbelievable,” he says.

High-performance electric models

Addressing concerns that electric models might lack the character of their predecessors, Ola points toward future developments for the brand that focus on robust output.

“For the hardcore performance fans, we’re going to launch in 2026 a whole new high-performance, electric AMG car. That will blow your mind,” says Ola.

He also mentions technological features that cater to traditionalists who may miss the auditory feedback of an engine.

“And if you want it to sound like a V8, you can do that too,” he says.

Overcoming market headwinds

The transition to electric mobility faces obstacles, particularly within the US market. Throughout 2025, reports indicated a challenging environment for automakers.

This was driven by slowing customer demand, high production costs and the elimination of federal incentives.

These challenges are expected to continue into 2026 as manufacturers navigate the complex shift from early adopters to the mass market.

The removal of federal tax credits at the end of September 2025, which previously offered US$7,500 for new EVs and a US$4,000 credit for used EVs, took away a major purchasing incentive.

Ola addresses how the company strategy has evolved in this climate since the launch of the EQS, the flagship luxury electric car for Mercedes-Benz.

“Ultimately, all markets will have to find a new equilibrium. The transformation toward zero emissions is not something that happens in a few years,” he says.

He emphasises the global nature of its operations and the varying speeds of adoption.

“We sell cars in more than 150 countries around the world. To expect that transformation to be a straight line where everything happens at the same pace, that is unrealistic.”

While acknowledging that EV makers are in competition, Ola suggests the trajectory is clear.

“We’re going to have different swim lanes,” he says. “We are car companies, we will serve those swim lanes. But the destination we’re ultimately going toward is zero emissions. That I am convinced about.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/01b944256b45031bbe9d8c72c5e3fb9a:179edbc07fa2bb245f939a650b0a9fa1/ola.png.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 12:00:59.227995

Otherwise, your data will be deleted if pv magazine has processed your request or the purpose of data storage is fulfilled.","Duke Energy brought a 50 MW battery energy storage system online this month at the location of the former Allen coal plant in North Carolina. This facility represents the first of several planned storage deployments at the site where the utility retired its legacy coal units. The project utilizes existing transmission infrastructure on Lake Wylie to store electricity for use during peak demand periods on the regional grid.

The four-hour battery system consists of lithium-ion units designed to provide 200 MWH of energy. Duke Energy said it completed the installation ahead of schedule and under budget with an investment of approximately $100 million.

The project qualifies for federal tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act including a 10% bonus for reinvesting in a community formerly dependent on coal production, said the utility.

Storage capacity at this location will help Duke balance the intermittent nature of solar generation, which has seen significant growth in North Carolina. Based on current deployment rates, it is likely that solar will surpass wind as the third-largest source of electricity. And solar may soon topple coal as the second-largest source of electricity generation in the United States.

The batteries can charge using surplus energy from nearby solar farms or the Catawba Nuclear Station during low demand hours. This stored energy is then dispatched to the grid in the morning or evening when residential and commercial usage reaches its daily peaks.

Construction on a second and larger battery project is slated to begin at the same site in May with a capacity of 167 MW. Duke Energy also proposed a third battery installation and a regional operations center for renewable energy at the former Allen plant. These efforts form part of a broader utility plan to deploy over 6,000 MW of energy storage by 2035 to replace retiring fossil fuel capacity.

Instead, it has aligned with his goal of reversing Biden-era climate policies. The White House has ordered coal-powered power plants to stay open for longer. Those power plants are typically expensive to operate, raising concerns about prices. Kou says keeping them online could hypothetically help meet rising demand, but only if those plants are located where demand is growing.

The administration is also investing in nuclear power — that, too, could potentially help with costs, but only in the long term, Kou says, because nuclear plants take so long to approve and build.

Some of the administration's moves could actually increase electricity bills in the future.

Large solar and wind projects provide more cost-competitive energy than natural gas, nuclear and coal projects, according to financial services firm Lazard. But the Trump administration has ended federal tax credits for solar and wind projects early, and canceled more than $13 billion in funds for green energy projects

Trump has also said he won't permit any new wind projects, and the administration has attempted to stop offshore wind projects that are already under construction, leading to court battles. That's been criticized not just by renewable energy advocates, but by many business groups, because it creates uncertainty and discourages investments in projects that could be supplying more energy into the grid.

""As a general matter, the thing that you can do that most clearly helps reduce prices is to remove barriers to new energy investment,"" says James Coleman, a nonresident senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""And the thing that basically just increases prices is increasing uncertainty or barriers to energy.""

The administration is also rolling back efficiency standards for appliances. Those standards actually cut consumer bills by reducing energy use, Hua notes.

Meanwhile, some things that could meaningfully cut costs have simply not been prioritized by this administration. ""There are solutions that are available today that can be put on the grid that would meaningfully resolve a lot of these solutions,"" Hua says, pointing to technologies that allow more power to be moved on the existing grid, or better match supply and demand. ""It doesn't solve everything, but it provides some immediate relief … and that just has not been as much of a focus"" for the Trump administration, he says.

Lately, President Trump has been talking about making sure that AI data centers pay their fair share for electricity costs. Hua says there is a genuine opportunity to cut energy bills for ordinary Americans as data center demand for electricity goes up, depending on how costs are spread out.

But for now, the Trump administration's pledge to cut utility bills remains an unmet promise.

Lately, President Trump has been talking about making sure that AI data centers pay their fair share for electricity costs.","On the campaign trail, President Trump promised to cut Americans' energy bills in half — cheaper gasoline, cheaper electricity. He also said he'd ""unleash"" American energy production, often repeating the catchphrase ""Drill, baby, drill.""

One year in, the price of gasoline is down about 10%. But the U.S. oil industry is definitely not drilling, baby, drilling. The price of oil is just too low to justify more of it — although within the last year, companies have won major lobbying victories that soothe that sting. Meanwhile, electricity costs are rising and expected to rise more.

Cheap gasoline: check

The U.S. benchmark price for oil is down about 20% from where it was a year ago, and the average retail gasoline price — the price drivers pay at the pump — is down nearly 10%.

Now, presidents — whoever they are — do not get to decide the price of gasoline. The price of crude oil is the biggest factor, and crude prices are set in a complex global marketplace that responds to a number of factors.

In the past year, cheaper crude has been largely driven by a global oversupply of oil, which in turn was largely driven by a series of decisions by the oil cartel OPEC+. The cartel repeatedly put more barrels on the market, depressing global prices but seizing more market share for its members.

However, Dan Pickering, the chief investment officer at Pickering Energy Partners, says the president also put significant pressure on OPEC to bring down global crude prices. As a result, he gives Trump partial credit for today's low prices.

""I think if we look at oil down 20% in 2025, that you have to say that political dynamics drove at least half of that,"" he says. ""And as we go into 2026, I think those dynamics will still be at play.""

Moving forward, the president's push to produce more oil from Venezuela could also help keep global crude prices lower for longer — if he persuades companies to invest.

Analysts with the gas prices app GasBuddy found that U.S. households spent, on average, $177 less on gasoline in 2025 than 2024, thanks to lower prices, and they predict that expenditures will continue to fall in 2026, saving Americans a collective $11 billion next year.

Drill, baby, drill? Not so much.

Those lower oil prices are exactly why ""Drill, baby, drill"" didn't happen.

The number of active drilling rigs in the U.S., the largest oil producer in the world, has dropped by more than 6% year-over-year, at last count. That means fewer new wells are being drilled. And that's true even as the Trump administration has made it easier for companies to start new projects, including by making more federal lands and waters available for leases.

With U.S. oil prices under $60 a barrel and the global market generally oversupplied with crude, it's just not profitable for companies to drill a bunch of new wells right now.

The Trump administration has many close allies in the U.S. oil industry. But this is a perennial point of disagreement between them: The president loves cheap oil, while companies would prefer prices to be higher than they are today.

This disagreement was actually called out by Secretary of Energy Chris Wright — a former fracking executive. Speaking to CBS News' Face the Nation this month, he called President Trump ""no helper to the oil and gas industry"" because ""he's driven down the price of oil.""

It's true that many U.S. oil workers wince every time the president talks about $50 crude or pushes for more production from OPEC. But it's not quite fair to call the administration ""no helper.""

The American Petroleum Institute, or API, is the most powerful lobbying arm of the U.S. oil and gas industry. Before Trump was reelected, the group laid out a dozen different policy priorities — a wish list. Tax policy changes that would help oil companies; more access to drilling in the Gulf; a boost in exports of liquefied natural gas; the repeal of requirements for cleaner and more efficient cars, which would have pushed down oil demand over time; the elimination of a fee for releasing planet-warming methane.

""By our count, every single one of them was completed in 2025, with the exception of legislative permitting reform,"" Mike Sommers, the president and CEO of API, said on a recent call with reporters. (""Permitting reform"" refers to a series of changes to federal laws that would make it easier for companies to build things like pipelines and other large projects that often face local opposition. It's been a hot topic in Congress for years.)

Sommers says U.S. companies can weather low oil prices in the short term and make business decisions with an eye toward the future.

And in the long term, the administration's policy changes support higher oil demand for years to come by doing things like slowing down the shift toward electric vehicles, while also cutting the costs of oil production, including by easing environmental rules.

Electricity costs are rising

Electricity prices have been increasing for years now, and 2025 was more of the same.

""Across most states and in most markets, what we see is that prices have gone up,"" says Helen Kou, an analyst with BloombergNEF.

Based on trends in wholesale power markets — where your local electric company buys its power, an expense they pass on to you — that's likely to continue. Kou said that in New York and New England, wholesale prices are up more than 60%, and in the mid-Atlantic they're up 45%.

""Almost 1 in 3 households, or over 80 million Americans, are struggling to pay their utility bills,"" says Charles Hua, who runs Powerlines, a national energy consumer education nonprofit that encourages people to get more involved in their public utility commissions.

Why are costs going up? Hua points to three primary reasons: an aging power grid, the cost of natural disasters, and higher fuel costs, especially natural gas.

Kou says that for 2025, natural gas prices were the clear driver of increases. While oil and gasoline are cheap, natural gas — which is used for home heating and power plants — has gone up more than 50% from last year's annual average. U.S. exports of natural gas have increased (one of API's requests), and sending more natural gas overseas means less is available domestically.

Natural gas prices have been up and down over the past few years. They spiked in 2022, after Russia invaded Ukraine. And they were unusually cheap in 2024 before rising again in 2025. While they're far from record highs, the increase has been enough to significantly shift electricity markets.

These causes are complex and date back years before Trump's return to office. But experts say the Trump administration's electricity policy has not focused on lowering natural gas costs, improving the grid or mitigating the effects of natural disasters. Instead, it has aligned with his goal of reversing Biden-era climate policies. The White House has ordered coal-powered power plants to stay open for longer. Those power plants are typically expensive to operate, raising concerns about prices.

Please read our guidelines for opinion pieces before submitting an Op-Ed. Submissions that do not adhere to our guidelines will not be considered for publication.

OPINION – The Trump Administration’s raid in Venezuela reveals a dangerous truth about the fossil fuel economy: so long as we remain dependent on dirty expensive fuels – chaos, violence, and corruption will flourish. But it doesn’t have to be this way – the clean energy solutions that can end this pattern are already at our fingertips, and it’s up to California to continue to lead the way out of this mess.

As Trump himself acknowledged, this attack is fundamentally about oil. But an illegal invasion – that has reportedly killed 80 civilians and members of security forces – is an incredible gamble on global security to steal a resource that’s becoming obsolete. All while the rest of the world races ahead on clean energy innovation.

California faces an important choice as we enter a critical election year: We can continue to allow our political processes to be corrupted by an oil industry willing to wage war and risk lives for profit, or we can be emboldened by this moment and elect leaders who are committed to investing in clean energy from renewable resources, prompting peace and prosperity.

We know all too well the costs of fossil fuel dependency. Over just the past three months, more than 200 oil spills have polluted our ports, harbors and waterways. That’s an average of 70 spills per month. As you read this, more than 4,000 gallons of oil and contaminated wastewater spilled from a pipeline in Monterey County near the Salinas River, a key source for drinking water and irrigation. And those are just the costs of transporting oil. Burning it is causing 10,000 premature deaths every year in California, as well as mega-fires and other extreme weather disasters that continue to devastate communities across our state.

The Trump administration will stop at nothing to force fossil fuels onto a public that increasingly is rejecting them. A few days ago, the Trump Administration overrode California safety objections and demanded the state restart a pipeline that ruptured in 2015, spilling over 100,000 gallons of crude oil in Santa Barbara County. And this week, federal officials are suing California cities Morgan Hill and Petaluma to block energy efficient electric building codes that help cities build more housing more quickly and affordably by bypassing polluting methane gas pipelines.

This is fossil fuel dependency in action: chaos and costs passed to communities while oil industry profits flow upward to executives, backed by federal power.

The race for the next governor of California represents a critical battleground in this epic fight of the people vs corporations. Candidates who tackle corporate accountability head-on will win in California. We need a candidate who is up to the challenge of fighting for the clean and prosperous future we know is possible. We cannot afford leaders who will stay on the sidelines or bow down to corrupted special interests. It’s time to kick the oil industry out of Sacramento and follow the will of the people.

And the evidence is clear that there are only benefits ahead. California must stay the course on the state’s significant progress on electric vehicle adoption and efficiency while growing our clean mobility options. County planners in Kern County—the heart of the state’s oil production—recently credited the region’s “vast solar and wind potential” as supporting an emerging energy hub. This represents economic opportunity, not sacrifice.

Rather than giving in to the bullying led by the army of oil and gas lobbyists who flood Sacramento every single legislative session trying to lock us into short-term thinking, it’s time for California leaders to redouble our commitment to ending our reliance on dirty expensive fuels. When we accelerate our transition to clean energy we’re creating good jobs, building clean infrastructure and resilience, and supporting healthy and thriving communities.

Clean energy is affordable energy, and it’s ours for the taking – no military operation needed.

The incentive, unveiled Monday, is part of a renewed push to boost electric-car adoption and support the struggling auto industry after demand slumped when subsidies ended in late 2023. While the government aims to support local carmakers, it will not impose origin-based restrictions.

“I am convinced of the quality of European and German brands,” Environment Minister Carsten Schneider said at a press conference on Monday. “I cannot see any evidence of this postulated major influx of Chinese car manufacturers in Germany, either in the figures or on the roads — and that is why we are facing up to the competition and not imposing any restrictions.”

The decision is a boon for affordable Chinese brands, such as BYD Co., that are gaining ground in Europe. While Chinese automakers already face tariffs on EVs imported to the European Union, they’re still able to sell cars profitably in the region thanks to low manufacturing costs at home. Brussels is considering a minimum price system to replace import tariffs.

Germany’s green light for the Chinese contrasts with approaches taken elsewhere. In the UK, the biggest European market for Chinese-made EVs, grants introduced last year effectively exclude battery vehicles from China, mandating environmental standards including low carbon emissions from the battery and assembly process. France’s so-called social leasing program includes similar stipulations.

Germany’s fresh round of funding, first outlined in October, is expected to support purchases of around 800,000 vehicles through 2029, according to the environment ministry. Subsidies will range from €1,500 to €6,000 depending on household income, family size and the vehicle type, and are aimed primarily at low- to middle-income buyers.

The program is set to benefit manufacturers such as Volkswagen AG and Stellantis NV, which are adding more affordable electric models.

EV sales in Germany have fluctuated wildly, recovering last year after a slump in 2024 following the previous government’s decision to scrap subsidies. Germany has repeatedly missed official targets for EV adoption, though prospects are improving as cheaper models reach showrooms. These include Renault SA’s R5 E-Tech and VW’s compact ID. Polo, priced around €25,000.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s ruling coalition has also extended a tax exemption for EVs through 2035, a move the finance ministry estimates will cost about €600 million in lost revenue through 2029. Merz has been a vocal advocate for easing the EU’s proposed phaseout of combustion engines.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/20/PDTN/88264193007-bizautoevchinagermanyfilepicdmt.jpg?crop=2996,1687,x0,y153&width=2996&height=1687&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-20 11:05:55.657901

In 2025, data centers in Texas had a maximum power demand of about 8 GW, compared to the state grid’s peak energy demand of 94 GW, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages the grid.
By 2030, one in five data centers are expected to exceed 1 GW in maximum energy demand.
By 2035, that number is expected to be one in three of all data centers, according to Bloom Energy.
“Grid power is not easily available at all and prices have gone up,” said Aman Joshi, chief commercial officer at Bloom Energy.","Bloom Energy, a California-based company that provides onsite power generation for electricity-guzzling data centers, also found that the grid demand driven by data centers in Texas is expected to exceed 40 gigawatts by 2028. The report is based on a survey of both electric utilities and data center developers that was conducted throughout much of last year.

In 2025, data centers in Texas had a maximum power demand of about 8 GW, compared to the state grid’s peak energy demand of 94 GW, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages the grid. One gigawatt is enough to energize about 700,000 homes for a year.

Texas currently has about 387 data centers scattered across the state.

Drawn by cheap gas, available land, and a regulatory market more friendly to natural gas power, companies are flocking to Texas to build more data centers that will support the growth of the artificial intelligence industry.

The growth of data centers in Texas is projected to outpace any other state in the country over the next several years, propelling Texas above other top markets with tighter regulations on new gas power generators, like Oregon and California, according to Bloom Energy.

Data centers are also getting larger. By 2030, one in five data centers are expected to exceed 1 GW in maximum energy demand. By 2035, that number is expected to be one in three of all data centers, according to Bloom Energy.

Nationally, the maximum energy demand by data centers was about 80 GW in 2025 and is expected to balloon to 150 GW in 2028, according to Bloom Energy. The rate of growth is causing issues as expectations by developers seeking power for data centers run into limitations by the utilities that provide that power, Bloom Energy found. Developers in Texas that responded to the survey typically expected to be connected to the grid about a year before the utility expected to have that power available.

The company found that disconnect between power providers and data center developers is only widening as demand for the centers increases.

“Power can no longer be treated as a downstream consideration,” read the report. “Operators that continue to plan projects around traditional grid assumptions risk falling behind on both schedule and scale.”

To circumvent those issues, more data centers are relying on power plants developed alongside and attached to new data centers, like the fuel cells Bloom Energy creates or natural gas power plants. About one-third of all data centers are expected to have onsite power generation by 2030, according to the report.

“Grid power is not easily available at all and prices have gone up,” said Aman Joshi, chief commercial officer at Bloom Energy. “As you think about onsite generation, no matter where you are in the U.S., 100% of onsite generation is largely happening with natural gas and Texas certainly has a lot of access [to gas].”",https://www.oaoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2025-09-23T212241Z_813534783_RC2SXGAN2MGU_RTRMADP_3_TECH-OPENAI-TEXAS.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 11:06:02.244393

We’ll be working hard to defend this funding and to pass perpetual, adequate clean water funding through the WATER Act.
In 2026, we’ll also oppose carbon dioxide injection underneath our oceans and the use of carbon dioxide in oil drilling.
We can expect more attacks on independent farmers and ranchers, on climate protections, and on the Clean Water Act.
In 2026, we’re strengthening our Food & Water Watch community, because we know community is how we win these fights.","From fighting data centers to opposing Trump’s rollbacks, here’s how we’ll protect our health, environment, and communities in 2026.

The first year of the Trump administration was hard, to say the least. Trump and his cronies showed their capacity for horrific cruelty and outrageous power grabs. They worked hand-in-hand with greedy corporations to make our lives less healthy, less safe, and more expensive. But this past year also showed what remains possible when dedicated people take action together.

With you, we defended many essential programs and protections. We’ve also won incredible victories at the state and local level. We stopped Congress from rolling back an important lead protection rule, defended funding for school lunches, defeated Big Ag’s Cancer Gag Act in Iowa, stopped data center proposals in Pennsylvania, and more.

Now, as we head into 2026, we’re ready to continue the fight against Trump and win major victories in our communities. Here are our biggest priorities.

Fighting Big Ag Handouts in Congress

Battles over spending bills in Congress — first in Trump’s Big Ugly Bill, and then through the spending bill that led to a government shutdown — have been a central arena for Trump and his cronies pushing their pro-corporate, anti-people agenda. In 2026, we’ll continue organizing people power to oppose this agenda, especially against two particular bills: the EATS Act and the Cancer Gag Act.

First, the EATS Act threatens state and local governments’ authority to enact their own protections for consumers, farmers, and animals. Second, the Cancer Gag Act would shield pesticide corporations from lawsuits alleging health harms connected to their products. The purpose of these bills is clear: let corporations do what they want, no matter the impact on people or the environment. We’ll be opposing EATS and Cancer Gag measures, however they might appear in Congress.

At the same time, Trump and his allies have taken aim at federal food assistance programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Tearing food assistance from families is especially galling at a time when Trump’s deregulatory policies are also handing corporations even more power, which they can use to raise the prices of essentials. We’ll continue to shine a light on these dangerous efforts and build opposition to them.

While we hold the line against the worst of Trump’s agenda, we also know we need massive changes to reach our vision of safe, affordable food for all. We’ll continue working with our allies in Congress to pass bills that will transform our food system, like the Farm System Reform Act and a halt to new Big Ag mergers.

Protecting Clean, Affordable Water

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has the responsibility to defend clean drinking water, but under Trump, the agency has rolled back protections. In 2026, we will push the EPA to do its job and protect us against toxic contamination of our drinking water.

Last year, Food & Water Watch members won an incredible victory. We pushed seven governors to petition the EPA alongside our legal petition to monitor microplastics in our drinking water! Now, we’ll continue to pressure the EPA to heed that petition and take this important step toward strong regulations.

We’re also opposing efforts to gut protections against lead and PFAS forever chemicals in our drinking water. We’ll oppose Trump’s efforts to roll back important limits on certain PFAS in our water, and keep the pressure on the EPA to defend the Lead out of Water Rule from industry challenges.

Besides reversing protections on clean water, Trump has also threatened federal funding for water infrastructure that is essential for keeping water safe and affordable. We’ll be working hard to defend this funding and to pass perpetual, adequate clean water funding through the WATER Act.

Opposing Fossil Fuel Infrastructure

In 2026, we’re continuing to oppose federal policies that entrench the dirty energy polluting our communities and making our energy more expensive. We’ll also keep pushing to end the billions of dollars in subsidies that Big Oil and Gas receives each year and the wasteful tax benefits lavished on the industry’s carbon capture and storage scam.

At the same time, we’ll continue combating efforts to strip protections against the industry’s dangerous, polluting infrastructure. That includes the hazardous carbon pipelines that are part of the carbon capture and storage boondoggle.

With advocates like you, we blocked Congressional measures that would have allowed corporations to pay for fast-track reviews and measures that would have allowed the federal government to force state and local governments to accept carbon pipelines.

But this fight isn’t over — we’ll continue defending communities’ right to protect themselves from dangerous infrastructure. In 2026, we’ll also oppose carbon dioxide injection underneath our oceans and the use of carbon dioxide in oil drilling.

Stopping Energy- and Water-Hungry Data Centers

The data center boom driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency is one of the defining issues of our time. These facilities are guzzling our water, entrenching fossil fuels, and spiking our energy bills. They’re worsening the climate crisis and affordability crisis — all for Big Tech’s profit.

Last year, we became the first national organization to call for a nationwide halt to all new data centers. We also worked with local communities to successfully stop data centers from being built in their backyards. We’ll expand our work fighting these facilities at the local, state, and national level in 2026 and beyond.

Slowing Trump’s Agenda Through the Courts

The Trump administration is barreling through the law to undo decades of progress that protects communities. We can expect more attacks on independent farmers and ranchers, on climate protections, and on the Clean Water Act.

But we’ll be using the law to stand up for our health and environment against the worst of Trump’s agenda. In 2026, we’ll be defending climate regulation — including Biden-era rules to limit oil and gas industry methane pollution — from Trump’s rollbacks, suing to force Trump’s EPA to update national water pollution limits for slaughterhouses, fighting to maintain clean water protections for streams and wetlands, and appealing a court’s approval of Trump rules that allow factory farms to keep their air pollution secret.

At the state level, we’ll be using the law to fight programs and agency decisions that open the doors for more pollution in our communities. In California, we’re suing the state for its Low Carbon Fuel Standard that incentivizes harmful factory farm biogas nationwide.

In New York and New Jersey, we’re challenging the state and federal approvals of the Northeast Supply Enhancement fracked gas pipeline. And we’ll be continuing our work to rein in factory farm pollution, from Colorado to Minnesota, Montana to Ohio, and beyond.

Winning at the State and Local Level

With Trump in office, state and local organizing are more important than ever. Our victories in 2025 have shown that we win real improvements in people’s lives, despite the chaos and harm at the federal level.

From building support for Climate Superfund Laws in six states across the country , to stopping harmful projects like data centers and pipelines, we’ll continue this work in 2026. And we’re expanding our work in Massachusetts and Connecticut fighting for a Climate Superfund bill and in Michigan fighting factory farms.

In Pennsylvania, the 37th municipality has passed a zoning law to protect their communities from fracking since we started the Municipal Ordinance Project in 2018. In 2026, we’ll build on this support toward a fracking ban in all of Allegheny County. With Pennsylvania in the crosshairs of the Big Tech industry for its data centers, we’ll also build on our successes in 2025 to defeat more local data center projects.

In Florida, where state regulators recently rubber-stamped the largest rate hike in U.S. history, we’re building on our powerful campaign for affordable, clean energy. That includes introducing a bill that would force the state’s electric utility to increase energy efficiency and reduce fossil fuel use.

In New Jersey, we’re gathering momentum behind the state’s Climate Superfund Act; so far, we have the support of more than a hundred New Jersey groups, 60 legislators, and over 65 municipalities. We’re also fighting to get gas hookups out of Jersey City, as we’ve already done in New York City and New York State.

In Oregon, we’ve worked with allies to build grassroots support for factory farm protections and pass a bill that allows local governments to enact setbacks between factory farms and homes, schools, and other buildings. This year, we’ll build on that success to organize support for local setback ordinances in Oregon communities.

In California, we’re working to stop oil and gas drilling statewide and continuing to build support for the state’s Climate Superfund bill. We’re also fighting a compressor station in Ventura, the notorious Aliso Canyon gas storage facility, the Montezuma carbon capture and storage project, and hydrogen projects like Angeles Link and Scattergood.

In New Mexico, we’re working to stop the expansion and entrenchment of factory farms through the state’s Clean Transportation Fuel Program, and we’re advocating for state protections from these polluting facilities. The state must finalize its new surface water permitting program and include strong protections against factory farm waste.

In Iowa, we defeated Bayer’s Cancer Gag Act in the state legislature last year, defending people’s right to sue pesticide companies for alleged harms caused by their products. Now, we’re preparing for a potential Round 2 with Big Ag. At the same time, we’ll fight to pass our Blueprint for Clean Water, a suite of legislative changes needed to rein in factory farm pollution and tackle Iowa’s drinking water crisis.

In Maryland, we’re building on our success overriding Governor Moore’s veto of the RENEW Act study, which will calculate the costs of climate change in the state. This is an important first step for passing a Climate Superfund Law, which we’ll continue building support for. We’ll also make sure the City of Baltimore implements a water bill debt forgiveness program that we won in 2019.

In New York, we’ve built an incredible movement of passionate activists fighting dirty infrastructure across the state. In 2026, we’ll continue our work to get fossil fuels out of New York City buildings, push for statewide halts on all new factory farms and new data centers, and fight data center proposals at the local level.

With You, We Have So Much to Look Forward to in 2026!

Though we’ve seen so many low points and cruelty from the Trump administration, we’re heartened to see our movement grow. In 2025, our community grew to 4,000 volunteers and 2.3 million supporters. From gathering petitions at farmers’ markets to meeting with elected officials, from taking to the streets to making gifts that power this work, our members are the foundation of this movement.

In 2026, we’re strengthening our Food & Water Watch community, because we know community is how we win these fights. Together, we’re building the people power we need to combat corporate greed and Trump’s policies, and to win real protections for our most precious resources.",https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Summer-Victories-1024x427.png,N,,2026-01-20 11:05:31.088023

The financing will support the development, construction, and operation of commercial and community solar projects spread across multiple U.S. markets. Commercial operation dates are expected to fall between December 2025 and 2026, according to the companies. Some projects are also expected to qualify for Inflation Reduction Act investment tax credit adders tied to domestic content and “energy community” designations.

The deal uses Goldman Sachs’ “End-to-End Distributed Generation” structure, which the parties said provides a single source of third-party capital for the portfolio. Goldman Sachs served as sole lender and tax equity investor.

Radial said the capital will help it monetize federal tax incentives more efficiently while advancing a diversified, multi-market distributed generation pipeline at scale.

Today, Fluence has developed 273 energy storage projects across 48 markets and expanded into digital applications for renewables and storage.

In 2022, Fluence announced that it had partnered with a contract manufacturer to open a new manufacturing plant in Utah. That September, the site began shipping out Fluence Cubes to be used in its products across the continent. Those products include the Gridstack, used by utilities, developers, and independent power producers to deploy efficient, cost-effective projects; the Smartstack, which offers greater density and a more intelligent platform; and Ultrastack, the highest-performance tier used by power grid operators for transmission infrastructure. The Utah facility was initially capable of producing 75 cubes per week, but eventually ramped up to 150 per week.

At the time of the 2022 announcement, Fluence’s production presence was heavily concentrated in Asia. In fact, the contracted manufacturing facility in Vietnam continues to provide fully built products for the Asia-Pacific and European markets. As Peter Silveira, then senior director of manufacturing, told Energy-Storage.news, although the Vietnam facility continued to produce the modular base units for American products, the Utah facility would provide final assembly, offering customization, configuration, and more options for local transportation and logistics companies.

The Utah plant is just one example of Fluence’s onshoring manufacturing operations to the U.S. The company also opened a spare parts hub in Utah, specifically chosen for its proximity to major storage markets. This site enables Fluence to provide better support for customers’ operations and projects, while customers avoid the overhead costs and land requirements associated with on-site storage. These spare parts hubs can ship a needed part or component within 24 hours, whereas it would take 2 weeks to arrive from Vietnam.

Also in August 2022, Fluence opened a product testing lab in Pennsylvania, one of only three such sites operated by the company. It was an essential addition to speed up the launch of new energy storage products, and was the first to offer testing at full system, or Core, scale. “Findings at the lab are expected to reduce commissioning times and yield early identification of issues, allowing resolutions to be implemented prior to deployment at customer sites,” the company noted in the press release.

Based on these new sites, it is evident that closer proximity to customers enables Fluence to better serve its customers in North America. As Carol Couch, former chief supply chain and manufacturing officer, explained in the press release, “The markets we serve have unique use cases, customer needs, and regulatory requirements, and these new facilities are an expansion of the ongoing regionalization of our operations.” It makes sense that these moves were mirrored by close competitors. For example, Oregon-headquartered Powin Energy, then ranked the fifth-largest battery energy storage system integrator, contracted with Celestica to produce its storage product at Celestica’s facility in Monterrey, Mexico, around the same time.

Two years later, in 2024, Fluence announced the production of battery modules in Utah, using battery cells from Smyrna, Tennessee, making the latter the first U.S. facility to produce LFP battery cells for utility-scale stationary energy storage. This mission to expand the use of domestically sourced components was prompted by the Inflation Reduction Act’s domestic content bonus tax credit and the growing demand for utility-scale storage. Fluence is also committed to onshoring the production of all major products and components of its energy storage systems to the U.S., with additional manufacturing added in Arizona and Texas. John Zahurancik, currently Chief Customer Success Officer, reflected, “We are moving quickly to deliver domestically manufactured energy storage solutions that meet our customers’ needs, reduce supply chain risks for projects, and support the nation’s energy independence.”

Fluence’s American facilities help the company avoid supply chain issues and control costs, thereby stabilizing costs for customers as well. In 2022, Couch elaborated, “At a time when the energy storage industry has seen increased supply chain disruptions, this production hub will be particularly important in strengthening business continuity and improving flexibility for meeting customer needs.” In 2024, domestic production of battery modules and cells enabled Fluence to respond to increases in tariffs on batteries sourced from China and prepare itself for future trade shifts.

Plus, domestic production enhances national security. “In addition to U.S. manufacturing, Fluence is committed to cybersecure products,” Fluence noted in the 2024 press release, with system software being developed solely in the U.S., Germany, and India.

The economic benefits should not be overlooked, either. The Salt River Project and Ørsted sourced all the enclosures for the Eleven Mile Solar Center, a development in Pinal County, Arizona, featuring 300 megawatts (MW) of solar and a 300 MW battery energy storage system, from Fluence’s Utah operations. That project represents a $1 billion investment that created more than 1,000 construction jobs and will generate about $80 million in tax revenue. It also boosted local energy reliability, with enough capacity to power 65,000 homes and store 1,200 megawatt-hours (MWh) daily. Eloy Mayor Micah Powell reacted, “This energy project is a first of its kind in our region and will have a huge impact on energy reliability for our local area.”

Last year, U.S. Senator John Curtis (R-UT) visited Fluence’s Utah battery module plant. “In Utah, we’ve seen firsthand how smart policies—like energy tax credits—can drive innovation, strengthen our economy, and create real opportunity. I was pleased to visit Fluence’s energy storage operations at the manufacturing facility in Tooele County to see the value of these incentives in meeting both our energy production and economic development goals,” he reflected.

Although some of Fluence’s projects stalled last year due to policy uncertainty, CEO Julian Nebreda told Energy-Storage.news that those projects are once again advancing forward. Zahurancik looks toward the future with profound optimism: “This facility is building the future of energy storage right here in Utah, and we’re helping to build the foundation for the United States to once again be a leader in battery manufacturing.”",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/smartstack-9-9-announcement-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 11:05:05.040648

Andy Blumenfeld, director of data analytics at McCloskey by Opis weighed in, noting that continuing coal power generation is only a short term strategy due to the significant maintenance required to maintain the nation’s stable of aging plants, which the Department of Energy has already set aside $525 million to begin addressing. “We need the power, and the coal units are there now.

Health care policy dominated the congressional agenda in 2025 and is poised to do so again in 2026. Disputes over health care insurance affordability was a major contributor to the recent federal government shutdown — the longest in U.S. history, lasting 43 days. The continuing resolution agreement that reopened the government in November 2025: 1) extended federal funding through Jan. 30, 2026, 2) fully funded programs within the Department of Agriculture, FDA, and the Department of Veteran Affairs, and 3) secured a vote on legislation to preserve the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA’s) open_in_new enhanced premium tax credits (PTCs).

The Lower Health Care Costs Act (S 3385 open_in_new), which aimed to extend the enhanced PTCs until 2028, ultimately failed to garner the 60 votes necessary to proceed through the Senate. Early in the new year, Congress continues to face the same funding and policy cliff regarding the enhanced PTCs. To complicate matters, in late December, there was a discharge petition open_in_new related to The Health Subsidies Extension Measure (HR 1834) open_in_new, which garnered support from members of both sides of the aisle in the U.S. House of Representatives to force a floor vote on a three-year extension of the enhanced PTCs. On Jan. 8, after a procedural vote the day before, this legislation passed the House open_in_new (230 to 196) and advanced to the Senate.

Lawmakers from both parties acknowledge this bill is likely to fail in the Senate, where previous three-year extension efforts stalled. That said, efforts to reach a compromise are ongoing. A bipartisan Senate group is close to finalizing legislation, the Consumer Affordability and Responsibility Enhancement (CARE) Act open_in_new, to reestablish enhanced PTCs for two years, implement minimum premium payments, and introduce income caps. Additionally, it includes cost-sharing reduction measures and expanded access to health savings accounts.

A Brief History

2014 Launch

When the ACA private health insurance marketplace system open_in_new (also called ACA exchanges) launched in 2014, four years after the ACA was enacted in 2010, PTCs were available to individuals and families earning between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level. They were designed to ensure affordable marketplace coverage based on income by covering the difference between the full premium (set by insurers) and an affordable amount based on income.

While this structure significantly expanded coverage, affordability gaps open_in_new persisted due to high premiums, age ratings open_in_new, and regional cost variations open_in_new — particularly for middle-income households, self-employed and gig workers, small business owners, rural communities, and older adults. This group of 40 to 50 million people fit into what is commonly referred to as the “missing middle open_in_new,” meaning they earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, are too young for Medicare, or don’t have job-related health insurance.

2021 and 2022 Expansions

In 2021, Congress temporarily expanded enhanced PTCs through the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) open_in_new in response to pandemic-related economic disruption. These changes increased subsidy levels and eliminated the 400% federal poverty level income cap for two years, allowing higher-income households to qualify for assistance if premiums exceeded a fixed share of income, starting at 0% for low incomes and capped at 8.5% (the original range was 2% to 10%).

In 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act open_in_new extended these enhanced PTCs through the end of 2025, setting up the current expiration cliff and causing subsidies to revert to pre-ARPA levels on Jan. 1, 2026. Since enhanced PTCs began in 2021, health insurance enrollment through ACA marketplaces reached 24.3 million in 2025, more than double the 11.4 million who were enrolled in 2020. About 22.4 million enrollees (92%) received enhanced PTCs in 2025.

Ongoing Proposals

For years, some members of Congress have pushed to make the enhanced PTCs permanent or to extend them further, citing record marketplace enrollment, historically low uninsured rates, and improved market stability (S 3385 open_in_new). Other members, by contrast, have resisted clean extensions without offsets or structural reforms. Recent alternative proposals have included:

Reverting to original tax credit levels combined with consumer-directed health savings accounts (S 3386 open_in_new and S 3362 open_in_new).

Greater reliance on out-of-pocket payment tools rather than premium-based subsidies, market-oriented reforms (e.g., association health plans and regulatory flexibility).

Expanded oversight provisions to address fraud (HR 6703 open_in_new).

In December 2025, the Senate voted on some of these competing approaches. None advanced, leaving the enhanced PTCs to expire open_in_new.

Potential Impacts

Analysts project that the lapse of enhanced PTCs will result in 2026 coverage losses. The Urban Institute estimates that approximately 4.8 million more people will become uninsured open_in_new without the extensions in place, with more than 7 million people losing subsidized marketplace coverage overall. This would add to the already 26 million Americans who have no health coverage, a steady level since 2016. KFF estimates that average net marketplace premium payments would more than double open_in_new without the enhanced PTCs. Early state-level data open_in_new already suggests that higher premiums are leading some households to drop coverage altogether, insure only select family members, skip filling prescriptions, or take on increased medical debt.

For public health systems, higher uninsured rates open_in_new translate directly into delayed or forgone care, which leads to:

Reductions in preventive screenings. Interruptions in chronic disease detection and management.

Decreased access to maternal and behavioral health care.

Worsening outcomes for existing conditions or emergent medical events.

Uninsured populations tend to be diagnosed at later disease stages with more severe disease and face higher mortality rates. These coverage losses increase pressure on local safety net providers open_in_new (e.g., hospital emergency rooms and federally qualified health centers) and expand uncompensated care costs that hospitals and state/local budgets absorb. Hospitals overcrowded with uninsured patients open_in_new are at risk of reduced system capacity during public health emergencies open_in_new.

Going Forward

To date, Congressional efforts to extend the ACA PTCs have stalled, and the path forward is unclear. It’s possible that Congress attaches legislation to a moving vehicle such as an appropriations bill or, alternatively, addresses health care broadly in a reconciliation package later this year.

After the first year of the Trump administration, working Americans are feeling the consequences of the administration’s misguided economic policies. 2025 was marked by chaotic tariff announcements, increasing costs for everyday essentials, and rising unemployment, as well as historic cuts to health care, food assistance, and clean energy that are driving up costs. The Trump administration’s first year of economic turbulence does not leave most Americans optimistic about the year ahead, with almost 70 percent of Americans predicting 2026 will be a year of economic difficulty.

The Trump administration’s tariffs are driving up household costs

Americans are feeling the financial strain of the administration’s economic policies, with two-thirds of Americans expressing concern in December 2025 about the impact of tariffs on their finances. According to the Harvard Business School Pricing Lab, the costs of everyday household items have risen following the Trump administration’s massive new tariffs. Compared with pre-tariff trends from October 2024 to March 2025, the prices of household essentials increased significantly in 2025, including nondurable household goods such as cleaning supplies and toilet paper (up 5 percent), household furnishings (up 8 percent), and clothing (up 14 percent).** The Trump administration’s tariffs are also increasing the costs of big-ticket items such as cars and making it more expensive to build new homes. According to the Yale Budget Lab, the Trump administration’s tariffs will cost the average household $1,700 annually. Despite the Trump administration’s claims that it would end inflation on “Day 1” of the second term, inflation remained above the Federal Reserve’s target rate of 2 percent throughout 2025. Two notable studies have attributed elevated inflation to the Trump administration’s tariff policies, finding that the tariffs add as much as 0.7 and 0.5 percentage points to the consumer price index and the personal consumption expenditures price index, respectively.

Grocery prices are higher

The Trump administration promised to lower grocery prices on Day 1, yet on Day 365 food prices continue to reach record highs. In December 2025, food prices grew at their fastest monthly rate since fall 2022. The price of beef has increased 16 percent and coffee has risen by nearly 20 percent between January and December 2025. American consumers paid more than 6 percent more for fruits, as well as for fish and other seafood, as a direct result of the administration’s tariffs, compared with pre-tariff trends. One analysis of a typical supermarket shopping cart found that prices increased by an average of 5 percent from December 2024 to December 2025. Grocery prices are the top concern for many Americans, as most adults reported feeling stressed about grocery costs in 2025 and nearly half of respondents reported difficulties affording food. This is particularly concerning as cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program go into effect following the Big Beautiful Bill that President Donald Trump signed in July 2025, a law that makes the biggest-ever cuts to people’s pantries.

The Trump administration promised to lower grocery prices on Day 1, yet on Day 365 food prices continue to reach record highs.

There are more workers unemployed and fewer job opportunities

Unemployment ticked up to its highest level in more than four years in November 2025, growing from 4 percent in January 2025 to 4.4 percent in December. (Figure 1) While 0.4 percentage points may seem relatively small, that is an additional 638,000 workers without jobs. Job seekers are struggling to find opportunities in the current economy, with the typical person taking 10 weeks, on average, to find a job after becoming unemployed in 2025. People of color, especially Black men and women, are experiencing greater difficulty finding work during the Trump administration’s first year. Additionally, younger workers struggled to find opportunities: The unemployment rate for workers ages 16 to 24 jumped by 1.3 percentage points from January to December 2025

The Trump administration’s first year in office marked the weakest job growth outside of a recession since 2003, with only 584,000 jobs added for the full year, compared with more than 2 million in 2024. Of those jobs, 85 percent were added before the administration announced the “Liberation Day” tariffs in April 2025. Average monthly job growth in 2025 was less than one-third of the 2024 average, at 49,000 jobs per month compared with 168,000 per month in 2024. (Figure 2)

FIGURE 2

Despite the Trump administration’s claims that the tariffs would bolster American manufacturing in 2025, the manufacturing industry lost 72,000 jobs from April to December 2025. Employment was growing slowly before the tariffs, but every month after they were enacted saw job losses for manufacturing workers. (Figure 3)

FIGURE 3

Health insurance is more expensive

The Trump administration and congressional Republicans made deep cuts to health care in the Big Beautiful Bill, and Americans are seeing the costs of health insurance rise in 2026. The Affordable Care Act’s enhanced premium tax credits expired at the end of 2025, resulting in significantly higher premium costs for millions of Americans with marketplace coverage. For 2026, net premium payments were expected to increase 114 percent from the year prior. For people with incomes below 250 percent of the federal poverty level, premiums are projected to cost over four times more in 2026. In 2025, on average, a 55-year-old couple earning $90,000 a year paid $638 per month, or $7,650 per year, for a silver plan; today that same plan costs $2,179 per month, or $26,153 per year. Some marketplace insurers also raised rates to account for tariff impacts on the industry. As a result, 1.4 million fewer Americans have selected marketplace plans in 2026, and that enrollment decrease is expected to grow as consumers realize their costs have spiked. Americans with employer-sponsored insurance are also experiencing increased premiums, as new Trump administration regulations allow private health insurance plans to charge higher deductibles and cost-sharing this year.

5 Ways the Trump Administration Is Driving Up Health Care Costs for Families

Natasha Murphy

Residents in nearly every U.S. state face higher utility bills

Millions of residents across 49 states and Washington, D.C., will face higher utility bills or proposals for increased rates by 2027—costing consumers nearly $85.8 billion by 2028. In 2025, electricity prices increased by 2.5 times more than the annual inflation rate, which is the highest annual increase since December 2014. *** Average natural gas wholesale spot prices also increased 56 percent in 2025 from the 2024 annual average, despite President Trump’s promise to cut energy prices in half within his first 12 months. Home heating costs are projected to rise in the winter months as a result of higher energy costs, making American households in several states more vulnerable to falling behind on utility bills and facing utility shutoffs. Within the first half of the Trump administration’s second term, an additional 117,000 households went into severe utility debt—now affecting roughly 14 million Americans across the country. The Trump administration’s repeated attacks on clean energy—cutting thousands of jobs in the clean energy sector, gutting renewable energy programs, canceling or delaying private investment, and making the United States more dependent on oil—are directly contributing to rising utility prices.

Conclusion

Despite President Trump’s claims that 2025 was the “greatest first year in history” for an American president, Americans’ attitudes about their economic security and the latest economic data say otherwise. With increased costs of everyday items due to tariffs and fewer job opportunities, families are feeling the direct impacts of the Trump administration’s harmful economic policies.

The platform already made its debut in Europe in September with the battery-electric SUV iX3 at the IAA.

BMW has long planned to begin producing Neue Klasse models at its US plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina, this year. The factory has already been prepared for this transition, and the company has also established a battery assembly plant in Woodruff. Under the “local for local” concept, this facility was intended to be supplied with battery cells from AESC’s new plant in Florence, also located in South Carolina.

With the right policy interventions, shared electric mobility can accelerate sustainable urban transport, reduce congestion, and make clean mobility more accessible and affordable.","India’s urban mobility challenge is reaching an inflection point. Deteriorating air quality and worsening traffic congestion across metro cities are no longer episodic concerns, but persistent structural issues that directly impact public health, productivity, and quality of life. As policymakers sharpen their focus on clean fuels and electric mobility, Budget 2026 presents a timely opportunity to rethink how India approaches urban transport and who it is truly designed for.

Over the past few years, both the Central and State governments have taken commendable steps to accelerate electric vehicle adoption. However, much of this support has been oriented towards personal vehicle ownership, with shared mobility models receiving comparatively limited attention.

Why Shared Mobility Needs Policy Parity

Despite their potential, shared mobility models face structural barriers under current policy frameworks. Incentives and fleet electrification targets often focus on conventional EV ownership and overlook Low-Speed Electric Vehicles (LSEVs) and mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) providers. This is despite the critical role LSEVs play in last-mile connectivity, urban commuting and hyperlocal deliveries.

The challenge is compounded by the exclusion of LSEVs from EV fleet-conversion targets mandated for food delivery, e-commerce and quick commerce companies. While these mandates aim to decarbonise last-mile logistics, overlooking LSEVs limits the scale and speed at which meaningful impact can be achieved. As India’s economy expands and personal vehicle ownership rises, this policy gap risks reinforcing congestion rather than alleviating it.

LSEVs and the Realities of Urban Transport

Several states, including Delhi, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh, have introduced progressive EV policies with incentives for the manufacturing and purchase of two- and four-wheelers. These are important steps. However, large-scale personal EV adoption alone will not solve India’s urban mobility challenge. Road space remains finite; congestion continues to worsen, and concerns around emissions persist as long as electricity generation is not entirely clean.

In contrast, shared LSEVs offer a far more efficient use of urban infrastructure. They enable seamless short-distance movement, strengthen last-mile connectivity from public transport hubs, and reduce reliance on personal vehicles for everyday travel. Crucially, they provide an affordable mobility solution for millions of gig workers and delivery partners who may not have the means to own vehicles of their own.

GST Roadblocks Holding Back MaaS

A critical structural challenge for shared electric mobility lies in the current GST framework, particularly in the differential treatment of battery models. Electric vehicles sold with fixed batteries attract a concessional GST rate of 5 per cent. However, under battery swapping or battery as a service models, which are essential for shared mobility and high utilisation fleets, the energy supplied is taxed at 18 per cent. This disparity creates a cost imbalance that disadvantages swappable battery ecosystems, despite their ability to reduce downtime, improve asset utilisation, and support scalable shared mobility operations.

The impact of this tax anomaly is significant. Shared mobility and MaaS operators function in a capital-intensive and price-sensitive environment, yet they cannot claim refunds on input tax credits for services. This locked capital restricts the sector’s ability to scale fleets, invest in charging and swapping infrastructure, and expand services to new cities, ultimately slowing the growth of shared electric mobility at a time when cities urgently need efficient and low-emission transport solutions.

A Budget Moment to Reset Priorities

Budget 2026 offers a crucial opportunity to recalibrate India’s clean mobility strategy. Rationalising GST for battery swapping, enabling input tax credit refunds for BaaS services, and including LSEVs within subsidy and fleet-electrification frameworks would provide immediate relief and long-term momentum to shared electric mobility.

With the right policy interventions, shared electric mobility can accelerate sustainable urban transport, reduce congestion, and make clean mobility more accessible and affordable. If India’s transport transition is to be truly transformative, it must prioritise shared solutions alongside personal ones. Budget 2026 has the opportunity to make that shift, and shape cities that move better, breathe easier, and work smarter.",https://static.businessworld.in/Budget 2026 Story B_850x600 -2_20260120183005_ogImage_43.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 11:04:02.869389

James Risch (R-Idaho), objecting to the privileged status of a bill (S.J. Res. 98) that would require the ending of U.S. military force against Venezuela in the absence of authorization from Congress. Risch said the bill was unnecessary because “the recent actions in Venezuela were limited in scope, short in duration and done to protect U.S. interests and citizens. What President Trump has done in Venezuela is the definition of the president’s Article II Constitutional authorities as commander in chief.” The bill sponsor, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), said Congressional oversight was necessary because the U.S. was still taking hostile action against Venezuela, and could seize more Venezuela government officials, as it recently seized Nicolas Maduro.

About Reju Reju is a textile-to-textile materials regeneration company focusing on creating innovative solutions for recycling post-consumer polyester textiles and PET waste.","Governor Kathy Hochul today announced that French textile-to-textile regeneration company Reju plans to establish a $390 million textile regeneration hub on an 18.9-acre vacant lot at Eastman Business Park in the City of Rochester — its first in North America. Reju, a materials regeneration company, focuses on creating innovative solutions for regenerating polyester textiles and post-consumer polyethylene terephthalate waste from discarded textiles. Reju’s technology brings the concept of a circular economy to life. At the Rochester facility, the company expects to regenerate the equivalent of 300 million articles annually that would otherwise have ended up as textile waste in a landfill. Reju’s plans call for the creation of approximately 70 new jobs, including engineers, technicians, machinists, and a variety of production roles. The company expects to be operational at the site by the end of 2029.

“New York State is committed to creating good paying jobs, and supporting innovative projects and companies that are working to keep materials out of landfills and protecting our planet,” Governor Hochul said. “Reju’s ambitious project will create approximately 70 new jobs at Eastman Business Park, and will show how smart investments can turn waste into opportunity, further supporting our state’s overall green economy efforts and creating a brighter future for everyone.”

Following remediation of the site, Reju will construct a 145,000 square-foot facility where it will use proprietary technology developed with IBM Research to regenerate textile waste, starting with polyester, into high-quality Reju Polyester. This regenerated material has a 50 percent lower carbon footprint than virgin polyester and is engineered to be recyclable multiple times, reducing the industry’s reliance on fossil-based inputs. Through partnerships with global brands, mills, and waste aggregators, Reju transforms garments destined for landfills or incineration into yarns and fabrics ready for consumer use.

Reju is owned by Technip Energies, a leading engineering and technology company with over 17,000 employees across 34 countries. Reju has been operating a pilot facility in Frankfurt, Germany since October 2024, and in May 2025, the company announced the selection of a site for its first full-scale operation in Europe in The Netherlands.

Reju CEO Patrik Frisk said, “As our first Regeneration hub in the United States, this site selection in Rochester, New York is a major leap forward in building a truly global circular system. We are proud to bring Reju’s sustainable manufacturing and jobs to the Rochester community. Reju is investing in a future where post-consumer textile waste becomes a resource, not a liability. It’s a signal to the market that circularity at scale is possible and now is the time to ensure the momentum continues to build”

Empire State Development is assisting Reju with the project through a $4 million capital grant and is offering up to $1 million through the performance-based Excelsior Jobs Tax Credit Program in exchange for job creation commitments. Monroe County, the City of Rochester and Greater Rochester Enterprise are also assisting with the project.

Empire State Development President, Commissioner and CEO Hope Knight said, “Reju’s decision to expand into New York State represents the latest in Governor Hochul’s efforts to promote a circular economy. As we continue to pivot away from the single-use, disposable model, we are supporting new ideas that reduce overall pollution and keep resources out of landfills, while boosting sustainability and generating new economic growth.”

Governor Hochul is committed to improving textile industry sustainability and recycling. In October of 2022, the Governor signed a law aimed at supporting and expanding the state's plant and animal fiber textile manufacturing industry, promoting the use of locally sourced materials in an effort to reduce environmental impact and strengthen the local supply chain. The Governor also announced $10 million in state funding for the Fashion Innovation Center (FIC), which is managed by a consortium of universities, businesses, and non-profits, that is focused on the research and development of sustainable textiles and new recycling technologies. In 2023, the State Department of Environmental Conservation also announced a plan that prioritizes a circular economy, aimed at minimizing waste, ensuring materials are kept in use.

New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Amanda Lefton said, “Under the leadership of Governor Hochul, New York State continues to lead on diverting waste from landfills and returning materials back to productive use, which creates further progress towards our climate goals. Establishing a circular economy is fundamental to reducing pollution and diverting materials from landfills. With nearly 1.4 billion pounds of clothing, footwear, sheets, towels and other textile materials thrown away in New York each year, this major textile recycling facility in Rochester will support our statewide efforts to reduce and divert waste, while creating local jobs.”

The reinvigorated Eastman Business Park, the site where Kodak began manufacturing photographic film and paper more than a century ago, is a top priority of the Finger Lakes Regional Economic Development Council. Today, the campus supports over 100 companies, employing over 6,000 people.

Eastman Business Park President Jim Moran said, “Kodak is thrilled to welcome Reju to Eastman Business Park. We look forward to supporting Reju’s goal of building a system where textile waste doesn’t exist by leveraging the unique infrastructure and capabilities of our park.”

State Senator Jeremy Cooney said, “Today’s announcement means new jobs, new investments, and a new legacy being built in the Eastman Business Park. I want to thank Governor Hochul and Empire State Development for their work to bolster our local economy and continue to cement Monroe County as a place where businesses want to grow and expand their operations.”

Assemblymember Harry Bronson said, “I am proud to welcome Reju to Rochester and thank them for choosing Eastman Business Park for their North American textile regeneration hub. With this significant investment, they are not only contributing to our legacy as a city of innovation in arts and technology but helping to advance NY's green economy. In giving textiles a new purpose, Reju is demonstrating that the future of good jobs in New York is in renewable resources.”

Monroe County Executive Adam Bello said, “Reju’s $390 million investment is a significant milestone for Monroe County, creating high-quality green jobs and positioning our region as a global leader in the sustainable circular economy. By choosing Eastman Business Park for its first North American hub, Reju is building on our community’s rich legacy of innovation and proving that Rochester remains a premier destination for advanced manufacturing. Thank you to Governor Hochul for her steadfast support and continued leadership in bringing transformative projects like Reju to our community.”

City of Rochester Mayor Malik D. Evans said, “I am proud of the City’s Business Development team’s role in bringing Reju to Rochester, which will create good-paying jobs for our residents, power the growth of Eastman Business Park as an international employment center and strengthen our economy’s position as an innovation hub in the growing waste-reduction market. I look forward to welcoming the Reju team to Rochester and seeking opportunities to expand their local presence even further. I am also grateful to Governor Kathy Hochul, Empire State Development Commissioner Hope Knight and all the partners who helped make this tremendous investment in our city possible.”

Greater Rochester Chamber of Commerce President and Finger Lakes Regional Economic Development Council Co-Chair CEO Bob Duffy said, “Thank you to Patrik Frisk and the whole Reju team for this significant and transformative investment in Greater Rochester. Innovations like those pioneered by Reju have always been in our community’s DNA, and we are proud to welcome this cutting-edge global company into our region. Their decision to revitalize and reuse space in Eastman Business Park is representative of a broader transformation happening in Rochester, paying homage to our historical legacy and signaling a bright future rooted in 21st-century jobs and opportunities. Thank you to Governor Hochul and all other partners who helped make this possible. We are excited to welcome Reju to Rochester and continue to support their growth and success.”

Greater Rochester Enterprise President & CEO Matt Hurlbutt said, “We are pleased that Reju chose Rochester, NY for its first North American operation, drawn by the region’s exceptional assets and advantages. GRE played an important role by connecting Reju leadership to state and local partners and identifying regional assets to accelerate the company’s growth plans. The unique infrastructure assets at Eastman Business Park, delivered by Kodak and RED Rochester partners, will support Reju’s technology and future innovations.”

(Madison, WI) — As Wisconsin voters express deep concern about rising energy costs and grid reliability, a newly released statewide survey of 500 likely voters finds overwhelming, bipartisan support for natural gas as a critical part of the state’s clean energy future.

The poll, conducted December 1–2 on behalf of Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future, shows Wisconsin voters want an energy approach that lowers costs, keeps power reliable, and accelerates the transition away from coal without sacrificing affordability for working families.

Despite national rhetoric that often frames natural gas as incompatible with climate goals, Wisconsin voters, including Democrats, see natural gas as a necessary partner to renewable energy and a realistic pathway to cutting emissions while protecting consumers.

Key Findings from the Survey Include:

74% of Wisconsin voters say they are concerned about their current economic situation, underscoring the importance of energy affordability.

60% of voters report their electric bills are higher than they were this time last year.

80% of voters say affordability and finances are their top energy concern, compared to just 38% who prioritize low emissions.

69% of voters hold a favorable view of natural gas, the highest positive image of natural gas recorded in any state tested by Natural Allies to date.

78% of voters support expanding natural gas infrastructure to help transition away from coal, including strong majorities of Democrats (78%), Independents (76%), and Republicans (79%).

57% of voters support building more natural gas infrastructure to lower energy prices, compared to just 23% who favor phasing out natural gas even if it leads to higher bills.

73% of voters say residents and businesses should have the freedom to choose the energy that works best for them, rejecting mandates that force electric-only buildings.

69% agree Wisconsin’s energy policy should prioritize affordable and reliable power for the state’s manufacturing and agriculture-based economy, even if it slows the transition away from fossil fuels.

“These results show Wisconsin voters are far more pragmatic than the national energy debate suggests,” said Peter Barca, President, Wisconsin Natural Allies. “Democrats want to cut emissions but also believe in protecting working families from higher costs and unreliable power. This poll makes clear that voters, including Democrats, understand natural gas is a necessary partner to renewables if we’re serious about replacing coal, keeping energy affordable, and maintaining a reliable grid. Supporting natural gas isn’t abandoning climate goals, it’s how we achieve them.”

The survey also finds that voters strongly support using natural gas to replace coal, which still generates roughly 30 percent of Wisconsin’s electricity. By a 66-point margin, voters favor expanding natural gas infrastructure to facilitate that transition, a rare point of consensus across party lines.

“Democrats don’t have to choose between climate progress and energy affordability, voters are telling us they expect both,” said former Congressman Tim Ryan (D-OH), Co-Chair of Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future. “This Wisconsin poll confirms what we’re seeing nationwide: natural gas is a proven partner to renewables – lowering emissions, protecting working families from higher energy costs, and keeping the grid reliable. If we’re serious about reducing carbon emissions and winning back the trust of working-class voters, natural gas must be part of the solution.”

While Wisconsin voters broadly support renewable energy, the poll shows that purely zero-carbon mandates without regard for cost or reliability face significant skepticism, particularly among working and middle-class voters. Instead, voters favor a balanced energy mix that keeps power affordable and dependable as clean energy technologies continue to scale.

The findings come as Wisconsin faces growing electricity demand driven by manufacturing growth, data centers, and electrification trends, while voters express low confidence that large corporations will fully absorb the cost of new infrastructure without passing it on to consumers.

The poll was commissioned by Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future and conducted by MAD Global Strategy, a bipartisan public strategy firm. The data is based on a text-to-web survey of 500 likely voters residing in Wisconsin and is part of a broader series of state-level energy polls conducted across the country.",https://www.wispolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WisPoliticsIconSocial.png,N,,2026-01-20 11:04:43.151698

According to Spark, TipRanks’ AI Analyst, TSE:NBM is a Neutral.

The score is held down primarily by weak financial performance (pre-revenue operations, widening losses, and ongoing cash burn with funding dependence). Offsetting this are constructive technical trends (price above major moving averages with moderate momentum) and a strong set of positive corporate developments tied to orders, offtake, and scaling efforts; valuation provides limited support due to negative earnings and no dividend yield.

Since our announcement in July at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit, the joint venture has been laying the necessary groundwork to move as quickly as possible to build new, dispatchable generation to serve large-load data centers in Pennsylvania.

In addition, we support legislation that's been proposed in Pennsylvania to facilitate construction of new, dispatchable generation in the Commonwealth. That proposed legislation includes long-term contracting provisions with independent power producers and would also allow regulated utilities, including PPL Electric Utilities, to build and own regulated generation again. We continue to believe that whoever is able and willing to build new generation should be encouraged to do so. And at PPL, we are absolutely willing and able to be part of the solution.

We're committed to bringing our expertise forward to move the President's announcement from concept to reality. And we will continue to engage with a wide range of stakeholders, including federal and state leaders and data center developers, to address today's energy challenges and ensure a safe, reliable and affordable energy future for our customers ─ all while enabling the U.S. to win the AI race.""

‘Turbulent.’

Of all the single words that could be used to describe what kind of year 2025 was for the auto industry and individual dealers, Peter Wirth believes that one works best.

And it might even be an understatement.

Indeed, a sector that was working itself back to normalcy after COVID, chip shortages, a lack of inventory, scarce supplies of used cars, and inflation was hit with tariffs as well as a seismic shift in priority when it comes to electric vehicles.

This added up to some interesting times — that’s another adjective used heavily to describe the year that was — as well as a roller-coaster year for sales that ended up mostly flat or a few percentage points higher than 2024.

“It wasn’t a bad year; it was just a lot of ups and downs and changes — with tariffs being the obvious one, but there was also the huge change in course as far as electric vehicle adoption, which had a huge impact on manufacturers, but also on us,” said Wirth, owner of Mercedes-Benz of Springfield, referencing the expiration of federal tax credits for new and used vehicles after Sept. 30 and an abrupt U-turn on mandates concerning the percentages of new car sales that had to be EVs.

Carla Cosenzi, president of TommyCar Auto Group, which boasts four stores selling Nissan, Hyundai, Volkswagen, and Genesis, agreed. She said 2025 was a solid year, one that started strong as consumers sought to beat tariffs and ended somewhat sluggishly.

“We started to really see it around October,” she said, adding that manufacturers, perhaps anticipating a slowdown due to factors ranging from tariffs to still-high interest rates, ramped up the incentives to engage consumers, who stand to benefit from higher inventories.

“Overall, it was a really good year for us,” she said, adding that Hyundai and Nissan both posted solid numbers and finished strong, making up for some slower months in the middle.

As 2026 rolls on, the pendulum is shifting even more toward normalcy and perhaps less volatility, although no one can project too far ahead in this business, said Ben Sullivan, chief operating officer for Balise Motor Sales, which owns 26 dealerships across Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut.

Indeed, the focus is shifting back to hybrids and gasoline-powered cars, and manufacturers are providing plenty of incentives to buy and lease them, including 0% financing in some cases, he said, adding that he projects 2026 will be a good year for auto buyers and, thus, a better one for dealers.

“From a consumer point of view, I’d say 2026 will be a very positive year,” Sullivan said. “And from the dealer perspective, we’re actually pretty bullish on where this is going to go. Affordability is such a key part of consumer behavior, and the fact that availability and the incentives are going to be there for the consumers prompts us to believe we’ll be growing by 5% to 7% this year.”

Wirth agreed, noting that Mercedes has rolled out aggressive sales programs for January.

“Mercedes is putting their money where their mouth is as far as being on a growth trajectory,” he explained. “They sold 303,000 units last year, and they want to sell 325,000 to 330,000 this year; that’s a 10% increase, and it’s one of the reasons we’re incredibly optimistic for this year.”

“It wasn’t a bad year; it was just a lot of ups and downs and changes — with tariffs being the obvious one, but there was also the huge change in course as far as electric vehicle adoption, which had a huge impact on manufacturers, but also on us.”

For this issue, BusinessWest talked with area dealers about the turbulence of 2025 and the prospects for more normalcy, probably the most since COVID, in 2026.

Shifting Gears

As he talked with BusinessWest about the year that was and the years ahead, Wirth said he sympathizes with car manufacturers, who have had to cope with many different, and often dramatic, changes to the landscape in recent years, especially with tariffs and changing policy on EVs.

“I don’t envy my colleagues in corporate because it’s really hard to deliver on three fronts at the same time — electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids, and combustion-engine cars, which is what’s happening right now,” he said. “This significant change in policy — and no one knows how it’s going to change in three years again — makes it really difficult for the manufacturers.”

Sullivan agreed. “For manufacturers, it takes three to five years to develop a vehicle program, and they were all assuming that, at some point, we’d have to be 100% electric, and they put a bunch of their development money down that stream,” he explained. “And now, the federal government is saying that this is no longer what they need to do. So all the manufacturers are trying to adjust and adapt just in the EV market — and that was just one of two large challenges that hit us last year.”

The other factor was tariffs, which hit some makers harder than others, he said, noting, as others did, that these factors are prompting hard decisions, many of which will take years to materialize, about where cars will be made — and what cars will be made.

For dealers and consumers, these issues changed some buying patterns and, in many ways, altered the sales calendar.

Indeed, when tariffs were first announced last March, there was a surge in sales as consumers looked to beat the tariffs, said Wirth and others we spoke with, making March and April better than they normally are and some of the subsequent, normally heavier months lighter.

“When you look at the first half of the year, it shook out the way we expected; it was just more volatile,” he said, summoning another word to describe 2025. “You had a higher high than you were projecting, and then a lower low.”

This was just one of the many intriguing aspects of this past year, said those we spoke with, noting that what is being called a retrenchment on EVs was certainly another. Indeed, sales spiked in the run-up to the end of the $7,500 federal government purchase incentive on Sept. 30, resulting in a record for the third quarter of 2025 (about 12% of the U.S. market), before falling off in the months that followed.

Cosenzi said EVs are still selling, in part due to incentives offered by the state, but they were off by roughly 10% in 2025 over the year prior — better than many other dealers are reporting because the TommyCar dealerships are in Hadley and Northampton, which she described as a great market for EVs — and this pattern is expected to continue into 2026.

The focus is now shifting to hybrids and gasoline-powered cars, with an even greater emphasis on SUVs, said Sullivan, adding that, due to the tariffs and shifts on EVs, makers are doing some model trimming because some offerings are no longer popular, cost-effective, or both.

Drive Time

Looking down the road and toward the year ahead, those we spoke with expressed optimism about the big picture and the manner in which car makers are incentivizing consumers to buy and lease.

As Wirth noted earlier, Mercedes has set ambitious goals for 2026 and is backing them up with programs and incentives that are similar to those intended to drive sales at year end.

“Our January programs are essentially as good as our outgoing December programs were, which is something I’ve never seen before with them,” he noted. “They’re really trying to hit the ground running and maintain and ultimately increase their market share in the luxury market.

“They were all assuming that, at some point, we’d have to be 100% electric, and they put a bunch of their development money down that stream. And now, the federal government is saying that this is no longer what they need to do.”

“And while it’s still very early,” continued Wirth, who spoke with BusinessWest in the first week of January, “they seem to be starting on the right foot.”

Cosenzi and Sullivan agreed, noting that conditions are right for a solid 2026, meaning dealers have inventory (especially for what’s in demand, meaning hybrids and SUVs); they have incentives, including attractive lease deals and financing rates for purchases; and are stocking more used cars, although they’re still in somewhat short supply.

“We’re putting a lot of focus on used vehicles heading into 2026, especially those under that $30,000 price range,” said Cosenzi, adding that TommyCar has created a buying center to maximize opportunities in a still-challenging market and build an inventory.

“We’re really working to have the right-priced pre-owned vehicles that can go through the stringent certified process to give the consumers the confidence they’re looking for,” she explained, adding that there is strong demand for such vehicles, especially SUVs, in the Five College area.

Sullivan said the stars are aligning as the industry moves into 2026. “Interest rates are starting to trend down, and availability of cars is getting better, unlike during COVID,” he noted, adding that the attractive incentives that were being offered to incentivize EVs, back when the pressure was on to sell those models, have been shifted to gas and hybrid models.

“Now that the manufacturers are not under that regulation anymore, you will see in 2026 some better incentives coming back, like attractive lease payments, low APR, and customer cash, because the manufacturers can afford to do that,” he explained. “So I think that will be a very big positive for consumers as we roll into 2026; their affordability matrix will be a lot better than it was in 2024 or even 2025.”

Meanwhile, Sullivan sees some general improvement in used car availability as new car inventories have improved and consumers can replace aging vehicles and enter into new leases rather than buying cars coming off lease, and this is another source of optimism heading into 2026.

As for EVs, dealers still have them, and they’re still selling them, but the pendulum has swung, with those who have been on the fence about such vehicles now more incentivized to stay on the gas or plug-in hybrid side, the latter of which provides some attractive middle ground for those looking to reduce their carbon footprint.

These are just a few of the issues that will shape 2026, a year that will still be interesting, but probably — that’s probably — less turbulent for dealers and consumers.",https://businesswest.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Autos2.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 11:04:10.275735

Fair value edged down slightly from US$21.62 to US$21.43, which points to a modestly lower central estimate for the units in the updated model.

The discount rate moved marginally lower from 7.90% to 7.87%, a small adjustment to the required rate of return that feeds into the valuation.

Revenue growth was revised from 7.70% to 7.20%, reflecting a more conservative stance on how quickly the top line is expected to expand in the forecast period.

The net profit margin nudged higher from 6.35% to 6.41%, indicating a slightly stronger assumption for how much profit the business could keep on each dollar of future revenue.

The future P/E was adjusted from 14.75x to 14.69x, which is a very small change in the earnings multiple applied to projected results and keeps the overall valuation framework broadly consistent.

Not only would the legislation scrap protections valued by environmentalists, but it would also continue the GOP’s use of the rule-busting Congressional Review Act for actions that have not been traditionally seen as rules.

“Mining is huge in Minnesota. And all mining helps the school trust fund in Minnesota as well. So it benefits all schools in the state,” said sponsor Rep. Pete Stauber (R-Minn.), chair of the Natural Resources Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources.

Stauber and the administration are eager to see Twin Metals, a subsidiary of Chilean mining firm Antofagasta, develop a mine in the national forest.

“By locking up the Duluth Complex — the world’s largest untapped copper-nickel deposit — President Biden cemented our nation’s reliance on foreign adversarial nations like China for critical minerals that will be necessary for the United States to compete and win in the 21st Century,” Stauber said in a release last week.

The Congressional Review Act makes it easier for Congress to overturn administration rules by simple majority within a certain timeframe. Because the Biden administration did not submit its Minnesota mining limits as a rule, they remained vulnerable.

Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) is helping lead the opposition and argues the CRA, signed by President Bill Clinton, wasn’t meant to go after the withdrawal of federal lands from new drilling and mining. Democrats are still examining the procedural options if the bill reaches the Senate.

“Pete Stauber is attempting to use a devious strategy to undo what has — after extensive review — been settled policy for years,” Smith said in a statement. “It would set a dangerous precedent. It is also dramatically unpopular. Minnesotans have made it clear they do not agree with Stauber’s efforts to sell out the Boundary Waters to line the pockets of a Chilean mining company. I will fight this effort as strongly as I can.”

Last year the Senate parliamentarian ruled against using the Congressional Review Act against Biden-era EPA waivers for California emissions rules. Republicans then moved to bypass the ruling.

Even though using the CRA against a land withdrawal would be unprecedented, it’s similar to the GOP using the law against land-use plans and development restrictions in several states. Democrats then called it an improper application of the law that left decades of natural resources plans open to being struck.

Ingrid Lyons, executive director of Save the Boundary Waters, said she’s trying to “prevent this dangerous, unprecedented use of the CRA which fundamentally threatens public lands and other land management agency decisions, making them vulnerable to any politicized nullification attempt that anyone in Congress wants to make.”

She added about her opposition to Stauber’s measure: “It’s about the Boundary Waters, but it’s also so much broader.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/70/d7/e6fa143f41c393e5b788580f2d07/u-s-congress-86364.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 08:58:28.950423

Barrage scheme could play key role in protecting property and wildlife habitats from rising sea levels

Change follows detailed studies using updated Environment Agency flood maps

As work continues on building the business case required for schemes of national public interest, new studies have revealed how the world’s largest tidal power project on the River Mersey would protect communities and wildlife habitats from flooding.

Detailed analysis of updated Environment Agency flood maps shows how the proposed Mersey Tidal Power project would not only provide enough clean energy to power hundreds of thousands of homes for 120 years but would also protect homes and businesses from rising sea levels.

As a result, Liverpool City Region Combined Authority has announced a major evolution of the project – transforming it from a clean energy scheme into a dual-purpose infrastructure project that will offer flood protection.

The change, which the Combined Authority will be asked to approve at its 23 January meeting, follows detailed studies which show the Mersey estuary faces significant risk from sea level rise. A tidal barrage could play a critical role in mitigating these risks, safeguarding homes, businesses, and vital infrastructure across the region.

Originally conceived as a renewable energy project to harness tidal power from the River Mersey, the tidal barrage scheme now aims to deliver a dual benefit: generating up to 1 giga-watt of low-carbon electricity and providing long-term flood protection. This aligns with Liverpool City Region’s Climate Action Plan and resilience strategy.

Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram said:

“Mersey Tidal Power has the potential to deliver clean, predictable energy for up to 120 years, create thousands of skilled green jobs and apprenticeships, and cement our place as Britain’s Renewable Energy Coast.

“But as we further shape these plans, we’re also being honest about the reality we face. Rising sea levels are already changing our coastline, and we must adapt. A tidal barrage on the Mersey could become a major line of defence – protecting homes, businesses and vital infrastructure, while setting a new national example for how we respond to climate change.

“The Thames in London already has flood defences, and this is now a consideration for areas the Mersey runs through. Because this is about far more than generating energy – it’s about future-proofing our region. By building flood protection into its design, we’re tackling two of the defining challenges of our time: cutting carbon emissions and strengthening our resilience to climate change.

“Quite simply, the case for tidal power has never been clearer – for our economy, our communities and our planet.”

Councillor Anthony Burns, Cabinet Member for Net Zero, added:

“The Mersey Tidal Power Project is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver clean, affordable energy while protecting our communities from the impacts of climate change. It’s an iconic solution that will benefit our region for decades to come.”

The project, classified as a Nationally Significant Infrastructure Project under the Planning Act 2008, is currently in Phase 4 of development, which includes environmental assessments, engineering design, and preparation for a Development Consent Order submission. While the full business case is now expected in 2030, the Combined Authority continues to work with Government and partners to accelerate progress.

At noon ET today, it will have been one year since President Donald Trump was inaugurated for his second term, during which he promised to Make America Great Again, again. That was his high-level pledge to voters, but at rallies and in interviews, the eventual winner of the 2024 election made hundreds of specific promises about what he would do when he returned to office.

Academic research suggests national leaders generally follow through on their campaign platforms—a 2017 cross-national study found governing parties fulfill a “clear majority” of pledges—but has that been true of Trump during the first year of his second term? To find out, TMD analyzed 142 rallies that Trump spoke at in the run-up to the 2024 general election—along with five press conferences, 13 interviews and podcasts, two debates, and 33 other appearances—and broke down hundreds of distinct campaign promises.

Trump and his administration have done a number of things in office that he did not discuss or emphasize on the campaign trail—striking Iran’s nuclear program, capturing Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro, gutting the U.S. Agency for International Development, dramatically expanding his use of the pardon power—but today’s piece focuses on the promises Trump did make during the 2024 campaign, and whether or not he followed through.

Here’s what we found:

Immigration

Regaining control of America’s southern border and cracking down on illegal immigration more broadly were the most consistent and prominent themes of Trump’s campaign. As he told a crowd in Freeland, Michigan, on May 1, 2024, “On day one of my new administration, I will seal the border, stop the invasion, and send Joe Biden’s illegal aliens back home where they belong.”

More specifically, one of his most frequently made promises was to carry out “the largest deportation operation in American history.” As he clarified in Glendale, Arizona, on August 23, 2024, “larger even than President Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 1950s.” In his first campaign rally for his re-election, in Waco, Texas, on March 25, 2023, Trump promised to “use all necessary state, local, federal, and military resources to carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history.”

So, did Trump carry out the largest deportation operation in American history? According to a December 19 Homeland Security Department press release, the agency’s enforcement operations have deported more than 622,000 people since Trump took office in January, in addition to an “estimated 1.9 million self-deportations.” A recent New York Times analysis puts the total number of deportations closer to 540,000, including 230,000 people arrested inside the country by ICE officials and 150,000 people arrested by Customs and Border Protection agents at the border. That’s fewer than the 650,000 total deportations in 2024 and the 590,000 in 2023 under Biden, when border crossings were at record highs.

That said, the Trump administration has dramatically shifted interior enforcement. The Times found that deportations from ICE arrests inside the country during Trump’s first year have already exceeded the total such deportations during Biden’s entire term. The Trump administration also expanded enforcement against illegal immigrants without additional criminal records, with Cato Institute analysis showing that as of late November, 73 percent of ICE detainees had no criminal conviction, and arrests of people without criminal convictions or charges increased more than 1,200 percent year-over-year.

Other specific Trump immigration promises included:

“immediately ban all sanctuary cities in the United States.” (Madison Square Garden, on October 27, 2024).

“will deploy the U.S. Navy to impose a fentanyl blockade ... boarding and inspecting ships to look for fentanyl.” (Dubuque, Iowa, September 20, 2023)

“invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network.” (Coachella, California, on October 12, 2024)

“end catch and release … restore Remain in Mexico. … bring back Title 42.” (Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, on September 28, 2024)

“sign on day one, an executive order ending automatic citizenship for the children of illegal aliens.” (Pickens, South Carolina, on July 1, 2023)

“shut down all entries through Kamala’s migrant phone app.” (Saginaw, Michigan, on October 3, 2024)

“demand that Congress impose criminal penalties on any future administration that erases America’s borders.” (Columbia, South Carolina, on January 28, 2023)

“immediately ask Congress for funding to hire 10,000 new border agents.” (Tempe, Arizona, on October 24, 2024)

“ban all welfare and federal benefits from illegal aliens.” (Tempe, Arizona, on October 24, 2024)

How’s he faring on those promises a year later?

Trump announced last week that, effective February 1, the government would suspend all federal funds to 11 states hosting sanctuary cities, in addition to Washington, D.C. He has not attempted to “ban” or “prohibit” them as he pledged on the campaign trail.

The U.S. Navy has not imposed a blockade to bar fentanyl shipments from reaching the U.S., though the military’s dozens of strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific in recent months targeted boats that the administration claimed were smuggling drugs.

Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act in March to deport suspected affiliates of the Venezuelan-based gang Tren de Aragua, though a federal appeals panel issued an injunction in September blocking the move.

Axios reported last February that ICE had released 461 illegal immigrants under “catch and release.” The Trump administration moved to restore the “Remain in Mexico” program but not Title 42 restrictions, which would allow for the immediate expulsion of migrants on public health grounds without permitting them to make asylum claims.

On day one, Trump signed an executive order redefining constitutional birthright citizenship to exclude individuals born in the U.S. to parents residing in the country unlawfully or on a temporary legal status. Courts have blocked the move, but the Supreme Court picked up the case in early December and is expected to weigh in on the merits this year.

On Inauguration Day, the Trump administration terminated CBP One’s asylum appointment function, which had allowed nearly a million migrants to legally schedule their arrival at ports of entry. In March, DHS relaunched the app as CBP Home, retaining some original features—such as Form I-94 access and cargo inspection scheduling—while adding a new function allowing illegal immigrants to register for voluntary self-deportation.

Trump has not urged Congress to pass any legislation penalizing foreign countries for illegal immigration into the U.S. The president did cite such immigration as a reason for placing tariffs on Mexico.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) allocated funding for 3,000 additional customs officers and 3,000 new Border Patrol agents.

Trump issued an executive order in February stipulating that “no taxpayer-funded benefits go to unqualified aliens,” and, in April, moved to eliminate all legal pathways for illegal immigrants to obtain benefits from Social Security Act programs.

As with his plans for illegal immigration, Trump has at least attempted to fulfill most of his campaign pledges around legal immigration.

On September 20, 2023, Trump told a rally in Dubuque, Iowa, that he would “bring back the travel ban and expand it even further.” In December, his administration placed complete travel bans on 19 countries and partial travel bans on 19 others, and on January 14, the State Department announced it was suspending all approvals of permanent visa applications from 75 countries. The crackdown also extended to legal refugees. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has moved to end temporary legal status for nationals from 11 countries, although courts have temporarily blocked the administration from immediately revoking legal credentials in some cases.

In Derry, New Hampshire, Trump promised to “implement strong ideological screening of all immigrants,” and in Las Vegas on October 28, 2023, he told the Republican Jewish Coalition that he would “cancel the student visas of Hamas sympathizers on college campuses.” U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, in a policy alert issued in August, updated its protocol to allow officers, in cases “where an exercise of discretion is required,” to screen applicants for “any involvement in anti-American or terrorist organizations.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in March that the Trump administration revoked 300 student and other temporary visas, telling reporters at the time, “If they’re taking activities that are counter to our foreign, to our national interest, to our foreign policy, we’ll revoke the visa.”

One notable promise remains unfulfilled. Trump told the All-In Podcast—co-hosted by David Sacks, his current White House AI and Crypto Czar—in June 2024 that when “you graduate from a college, I think you should get automatically, as part of your diploma, a green card.” The Trump administration has not created a program to extend green cards or other temporary legal protections for recent college graduates.

Foreign Policy

One of Trump’s other most-repeated campaign promises was to swiftly end the Ukraine war. In 2023, he told crowds in Windham, New Hampshire, that “before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled.” He would repeat this line, verbatim, in Rock Hill (South Carolina), Greensboro (North Carolina), Rome (Georgia), Vandalia (Ohio), Freeland (Michigan), Wildwood (New Jersey), and Green Bay (Wisconsin), among many other places and states.

At some events, Trump changed this deadline to after he entered office. On August 5, 2024, he told livestreamer Adin Ross, “If I win, the first thing I’m going to do is get Putin and Zelensky to make a deal.” He also told a CNN town hall on May 10, 2023, that, upon reentering the White House, he would “have that war settled in one day, 24 hours.”

One year later, however, the war is still ongoing. Though negotiations continue, the Kremlin has refused to engage in any ceasefire proposals, maintaining that Russia will only accept a permanent peace deal if that deal provides Russia with the entirety of Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, among other stipulations. That’s a nonstarter for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who maintains that his country will not cede territory to Russia. Still, Trump has tried to negotiate a deal and has positioned the U.S. as a leading intermediary in the talks. Trump has invited Zelensky and Putin to the U.S. for separate in-person visits, and a U.S. delegation—led by White House special envoy Steve Witkoff and the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner—has met regularly with Ukrainian and European diplomats, as well as Kremlin authorities. Most recently, Witkoff and Kushner spoke with Ukrainian officials in Florida over the weekend, and both sides plan to discuss negotiations again later this week in Davos, Switzerland, ahead of the World Economic Forum. To learn more about the state of the war and negotiations to end it, read the January 9 issue of TMD.

Besides Ukraine, Trump’s foreign policy pledges included:

“build an iron dome over our country, a state-of-the-art Missile Defense Shield, made in the USA.” (January 22, 2024, in Laconia, New Hampshire)

“hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable for unleashing the China virus upon the world.” (Manchester, New Hampshire, April 27, 2023)

“ask for the resignations of every single senior military official who touched the Afghanistan disaster.” (Asheboro, North Carolina, on August 21, 2024)

“immediately reinstate all sanctions on the murderous Iranian regime” and “shut down Iranian energy.” (Derry, New Hampshire, October 23, 2023)

“demand that Europe pay much more for the cost of defense.” (Freeland, Michigan, May 1, 2024)

“begin the largest peacetime recruitment drive in the history of the Armed Forces.” (Asheboro, North Carolina, August 21, 2024)

On these:

Trump has laid out plans for what he has since referred to as the “Golden Dome” and selected the design for the system’s missile defense shield, hoping that it will be operational by January 2029, a target that analysts say is unrealistic. Last week, Trump posted on Truth Social that acquiring Greenland was “vital for the Golden Dome.”

The Trump administration has not officially cited China’s role in the lead-up to the COVID-19 pandemic as a justification for numerous trade restrictions on China, including tariffs.

Though Trump has called for firing military officers involved in the 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal and the Pentagon is conducting a formal review, no officers have yet been fired specifically for their role in the pullout.

The Trump administration has repeatedly issued sanctions on the Iranian regime and its affiliates shipping Iranian oil and other illicit products. Last week, Trump announced in a Truth Social post that he would add a 25 percent tariff rate increase to any country “doing business” with Iran.

North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member nations in June agreed to increase defense spending from 2 to 5 percent of that country’s gross domestic product (GDP) by 2035.

Last month, Defense Department spokesman Sean Parnell said that, in fiscal year 2025, the military recorded the largest share of its annual recruitment target in more than 15 years.

“Woke” Issues & Education

Another one of Trump’s most-repeated promises on the campaign trail was to keep biological males out of women’s sports. Transgender policies and other issues related to “wokeness” were a core theme of the campaign, with Trump promising to:

“sign a new executive order to cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity.” (Concord, New Hampshire, on January 19, 2024)

“not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate.” (Doral, Florida, on July 9, 2024)

“create massive incentives for states and school districts to adopt crucial reforms to protect parents’ rights.” (Columbia, South Carolina, on January 28, 2023)

“support universal school choice.” (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on June 22, 2024)

“sign a law to prevent child genital mutilation in all 50 states.” (Rapid City, South Dakota, on September 8, 2023)

“ban the Department of Veterans Affairs from wasting a single cent to fund transgender surgeries or sex change procedures.” (Windham, New Hampshire, on August 8, 2023)

“restore the Trump ban on transgender in the military.” (Dubuque, Iowa, September 20, 2023)

Trump issued several gender-focused executive orders on his first day back in office, including one that rescinded dozens of orders issued by the Biden administration. One of those day-one orders redefined federal definitions to recognize only two sexes, mandated that government-issued documents and passports “accurately reflect the holder’s sex,” blocked federal funding of “gender ideology,” and required federal inmates to be held in detention centers matching their sex. Trump also targeted federal diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives that same day, signing an executive order to end what the Trump administration called “illegal and immoral discrimination programs.” That included revising federal policies and training procedures to end “discriminatory” DEI practices, and terminating all DEI and “environmental justice” positions and programs in the federal government. Shortly after, Trump signed two more orders that:

blocked the federal government from funding surgical or hormone-based gender-transition interventions and research for minors, and

implemented a plan to review and remove “gender ideology or discriminatory equity ideology” from public K-12 schools.

Months later, in late September, the Trump administration froze more than $65 million in federal funding to school districts in Chicago, New York City, and Fairfax, Virginia, for maintaining their DEI and transgender policies—including for school athletics and bathrooms—against the request of federal officials. Last month, the administration proposed new rules to pull Medicaid and Medicare funding for hospitals that provide gender-transition surgeries, hormone treatment, or other puberty-suppressing interventions.

On the other promises:

In January, Trump signed an executive order, titled “Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling,” that blocks the beneficiaries of federal funding from promoting “gender ideology or discriminatory equity ideology.” That same order also directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to coordinate with state attorneys general and local district attorneys to pursue legal action against K-12 teachers and school officials who facilitate a minor student’s social transition.

Trump signed an executive order in February to pull federal funding from universities and local school districts that require students to receive the COVID-19 immunization. The order does not address mask requirements.

Trump’s January executive order targeting “radical indoctrination” in public K-12 schools also directed administration officials to create a plan that ensures school policies protect parental rights.

In a different executive order issued in late January, Trump laid out plans to expand school-choice offerings.

In a January executive order, Trump barred hospitals and medical institutions that provide surgical or hormone-based gender-transition interventions and research for minors from receiving federal funds.

In March, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced that, in response to a Trump-issued executive order, it would no longer provide gender-transition hormone therapy for those not previously receiving the treatments.

Trump revoked a Biden-issued order that permitted transgender individuals to enter the U.S. military, and, in May, the Supreme Court allowed the Defense Department to restrict “individuals with gender dysphoria” from joining military service while legal challenges continue.

Economic Policy

On the campaign trail, Trump pitched a renewed American economy built on tariffs, killing the so-called “Green New Deal,” and dramatically increasing American energy production and manufacturing. He told his supporters in Saginaw, Michigan, on October 3, 2024, that “starting on day one of my new administration, we will end inflation, and we will make America affordable again.”

Year-over-year inflation decreased slightly in the first three months of Trump’s term, according to the consumer price index, and in no month was the annual inflation rate higher than 3 percent, the rate when Trump took office. Inflation remains nowhere near its multi-decade peak immediately following the COVID-19 pandemic, but concerns about prices have not been completely alleviated, with annual inflation above 2.5 percent each month since June.

Trump has reversed course on several climate initiatives, though. On his first day in office, he re-withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement and ended federal calculations estimating social costs of greenhouse gas emissions. Earlier this month, the Trump administration withdrew from 66 United Nations entities, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Trump also signed orders to deregulate oil production and fast-track permits for fossil fuel and nuclear power development, and the Interior Department in October opened 1.56 million acres in the tundra of Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas drilling. U.S. crude oil production reached an all-time high in October, the last month for which data is currently available, averaging nearly 13.87 million barrels per day—an increase of about 5.5 percent from January.

During the campaign, Trump promised a hardline trade agenda—notably stating in October 2024 that “the most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff, and it’s my favorite word”—and planned for the trade restrictions to come in the form of a “Trump Reciprocal Trade Act.” Rather than legislation, however, he instead signed an executive order on April 2, a day Trump deemed “Liberation Day,” only to issue a 90-day pause on the duty hikes one week later.

Trump also promised a number of changes to tax policy. He said that, “when I get to office, we are going to not charge taxes on tips” (Las Vegas, Nevada, on June 9, 2024); that there would be “no tax on overtime, and very important for your seniors, no tax on Social Security benefits for our seniors” (Greenville, North Carolina, on October 21, 2024); that he would “support a tax credit for family caregivers who take care of a parent or a loved one” (Madison Square Garden, on October 27, 2024); and that he would “make interest on car loans tax-deductible” (Prescott Valley, Arizona, on October 13, 2024). The One Big Beautiful Bill Act that he signed into law last summer allows workers to deduct tips from their federal income in tax filings, allows non-exempt workers to deduct overtime pay, makes certain seniors eligible for additional tax deductions, expands the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, and allows owners of certain cars purchased after 2024 to deduct up to $10,000 of their car-interest loan. More generally, Trump promised to “make the Trump tax cuts permanent” (Waterford Township, Michigan, on February 17, 2024)—and the OBBBA permanently extended tax cuts passed in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

On a range of other promises:

“will terminate Biden’s atrocious electric car mandates and rapidly restore American energy independence.” (Council Bluffs, Iowa, on July 7, 2023)

The Biden administration never implemented an explicit electric vehicle mandate, though the EPA finalized emissions standards that critics characterized as a de facto mandate. The OBBBA removed tax credits for new electric car purchases and imposed stricter foreign-entity-of-concern requirements on battery manufacturing credits, while also planning to ease regulations on gas-powered vehicle emissions.

“end Joe Biden’s natural gas export ban on behalf of the people of Pennsylvania, who I love.” (Schnecksville, Pennsylvania, April 13, 2024)

In January, Trump lifted a Biden administration pause on liquefied natural gas (LNG) export permit applications, and, one month later, the Energy Department approved its first new LNG export project.

“cut your energy prices in half … in 12 months.” (Traverse City, Michigan, on October 25, 2024)

According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, the U.S. city average price of gasoline fell 3.4 percent in the 12 months ending December 2025, while the price of electricity rose 6.7 percent and natural gas climbed 10.8 percent over the same period.

“end the Biden assault on ethanol.” (Council Bluffs, Iowa, on July 7, 2023)

While the Biden administration expanded market protections for ethanol, such as issuing temporary summer waivers and allowing sales of higher-ethanol-content gasoline, the Trump administration issued the same emergency waiver in April.

“revoke China’s most favored nation status” and “implement a four-year plan to phase out all Chinese imports of essential goods and gain total independence from China.” (Waco, Texas, on March 25, 2023)

The U.S. has not revoked China’s “most favored nation” trade status, but Trump issued a presidential memorandum in January directing Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to examine whether China is abiding by trade accords. The U.S. currently charges an effective tariff rate of more than 30 percent for most Chinese imports, down from a brief peak of 145 percent in April. Trump has not announced any four-year plan for trade policy with China.

“ban Communist China from buying up American farmland and other critical infrastructure.” (Council Bluffs, Iowa, on July 7, 2023)

In July, the U.S. Department of Agriculture released a national security plan sharing that the agency planned to expand disclosure requirements for foreign owners of U.S. farmland and increase penalties for “late and knowingly false filings.”

“will put 100 or 200 percent tariffs on every car” built in a Chinese-owned Mexican plant. (The Joe Rogan Experience on October 25, 2024)

Trump has not levied new tariffs specifically targeting Mexican-based, Chinese-owned auto facilities.

“create a new Cabinet position for a senior member of my administration, who will be tasked exclusively with doing everything in the federal government’s power to reduce the cost of living.” (Albuquerque, New Mexico, on October 31, 2024)

While Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in March that Trump plans to appoint an “affordability czar” and advisory council, no such positions have been established to date.

Crime & Law

On the campaign trail, Trump called for many different classes of criminals to automatically get the death penalty. He told a crowd in Manchester, New Hampshire, on April 27, 2023, that he “will ask Congress to pass legislation ensuring that drug dealers, drug kingpins, and human traffickers receive the death penalty,” then told another crowd in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on April 2, 2024, that he would ask for a bill “ensuring that anyone who murders a police officer will receive immediately the death penalty.“ At many campaign events, he announced, “I’m hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or law enforcement officer.”

In office, Trump lifted the Biden administration’s 2021 pause on federal executions and directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the death penalty in cases involving the murder of a law enforcement officer or capital crimes committed by an illegal immigrant—but the president’s order applies only to federal charges.

Trump did fulfill one of his most repeated campaign promises: “to take over the horribly run capital in Washington, D.C.” In August, Trump placed the D.C. Metropolitan Police under federal control and deployed thousands of National Guard troops alongside a surge of federal law enforcement officers. City figures show that violent crime decreased 29 percent in 2025 from the year before, with homicides falling 32 percent, robberies dropping 37 percent, and sex abuse down 29 percent—though crime had already been declining before the federal intervention, and researchers dispute how much credit the National Guard deployment deserves. The administration also cleared dozens of homeless encampments and adopted a no-tolerance policy for street homelessness in the nation’s capital—though critics note that cleared homeless people generally relocate to less visible locations rather than entering housing. Still, the White House’s D.C. agenda has largely focused on security rather than his broader promise to “clean it up, renovate it, and rebuild our capital city.” His D.C. rebuilding effort has mostly been isolated to the East Wing of the White House.

Trump also repeatedly promised “to indemnify all police officers and law enforcement officials throughout the United States to protect them from being destroyed by the radical left for taking strong actions on crime.” In office, Trump signed an executive order in April to provide legal assistance and indemnification to law enforcement officers “who unjustly incur expenses and liabilities for actions taken during the performance of their official duties to enforce the law.”

He also told a crowd in Atlanta, Georgia, on August 3, 2024, that not only would his administration “never defund the police,” but it was going to “overfund the police if we have to.” To date, the Trump administration hasn’t boosted federal funding to local police departments, and the Justice Department terminated 373 grants worth about $500 million, primarily to nonprofits, providing funding for projects such as community violence intervention and victim services.

Trump also promised to “direct the DOJ to investigate every radical district attorney and attorney general in America.” In October, a federal grand jury indicted New York Attorney General Letitia James—who filed a civil lawsuit against Trump in 2022—on charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution. But a federal district judge dismissed the indictment in November, ruling that acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Lindsey Halligan, whose office filed charges against James, was improperly appointed.

In August, Trump partially followed through on his promise in State College, Pennsylvania, on October 26, 2024, to “put in legislation immediately upon getting to Washington that makes it an absolute penalty to burn our American flag [of] one year in prison.” He didn’t sign any law on the matter, but he issued an executive order directing Bondi to prosecute individuals who desecrate the American flag and, in doing so, break “applicable, content-neutral laws, while causing harm unrelated to expression, consistent with the First Amendment.” To learn more about the order and its potential legal implications, read Kelsey Dallas’ SCOTUSblog explainer.

Another promise that was partially completed was to pardon January 6 offenders on a “case-by-case [basis],” with a particular focus on those who weren’t violent, as Trump told Time magazine on November 25, 2024. Though he did follow through on this, his eventual pardon was much more sweeping, applying to more than 1,500 January 6 offenders, including individuals charged with and convicted of violent acts.

On unfulfilled pledges, Trump has not made any moves to “establish a federal task force to use every authority that we have at our disposal to end squatting in America” (Green Bay, Wisconsin, on April 2, 2024), nor “appoint a real special prosecutor to investigate every detail of the Biden crime family of corruption” (Pickens, South Carolina, on July 1, 2023).

Other Promises

Trump delivered nearly 1,000 hours of campaign speeches, media appearances, and interviews in the run-up to the 2024 election, and the above focuses primarily on the issues that he brought up most frequently. At points during the campaign, he also promised:

“if I’m elected this November, for the first time ever, your government will pay for or require insurance companies to pay for all costs associated with IVF fertility treatment.” (Johnstown, Pennsylvania, on August 30, 2024)

“will support baby bonuses for the new baby boom that will be coming.” (Waco, Texas, on March 25, 2023)

“land an American astronaut on Mars.” (Latrobe, PA, on October 19, 2024)

“ask Congress to put a bill on my desk delivering national concealed carry reciprocity.” (Manchester, New Hampshire, on April 27, 2023)

“will support a constitutional amendment to put term limits on members of Congress.” (Waco Texas, on March 25, 2023)

“will hold a competition to build new freedom cities throughout our country, giving countless Americans a new shot at home ownership.” (Waco, Texas, on March 25, 2023)

“will build a full-service VA hospital in New Hampshire right now for your veterans.” (Concord, New Hampshire, on January 19, 2024)

“will once again make stopping veteran suicide a top priority of my administration.” (Windham, New Hampshire, on August 8, 2023)

“abolish every Biden COVID mandate and rehire every patriot who was fired from our military with an apology and with back pay.” (Windham, New Hampshire, on August 8, 2023)

That he would release the Epstein list and UFO files (Lex Fridman podcast, on September 3, 2024)

Release the JFK files (The All-In Podcast, on June 20, 2024)

In office:

In October, the Trump administration announced that the pharmaceutical company EMD Serono would invest in IVF drug manufacturing operations in the U.S. In February, Trump directed his administration to prepare policy recommendations to expand in-vitro fertilization (IVF) accessibility and lower IVF treatment costs.

Trump told reporters in April that a one-time, $5,000 payment for new mothers “sounds like a good idea to me,” though no such initiative has advanced to date. The closest has been the announcement of his “Trump Accounts,” which would give parents who opt in a $1,000 government-funded investment account for their newborn—a long-term savings vehicle rather than immediate cash support.

NASA is continuing with its pre-existing plans to send a crewed mission to Mars by the early 2030s as part of its Artemis exploration program.

Trump has not lobbied congressional members to approve federal concealed carry reciprocity, and while Republican Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina introduced the proposal in Congress, the bill has yet to reach a vote on the House floor.

Trump has not pushed lawmakers to pass a constitutional amendment to implement term limits for congressional seats.

While investors have reportedly met with U.S. officials to discuss establishing deregulated “freedom cities,” including potentially on federally leased public lands or Greenland, the Trump administration has not moved forward with any such plans.

In May, Trump issued an executive order to conduct a feasibility study and action plan for expanding a Veterans Affairs medical center in Manchester, New Hampshire ,to a “full-service” hospital.

Speaking before a Senate committee in May, Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins said that the agency’s $588 million annually spent toward veteran suicide prevention research had not considerably reduced suicide rates and called for more efficient procedures. In an interview in late March, when asked about the $588 million in suicide prevention research funding, Collins emphasized, “We’ll spend whatever it takes to save a life, but we’re also got to do it in a way that actually shows a return on investment.”

In January, Trump ordered the military to reinstate service members who had been discharged or voluntarily left for failing to comply with COVID-19 vaccine requirements. Trump issued a pardon for former Army Lt. Mark Bashaw, who was court-martialed for refusing to abide by the military’s COVID-19 protocols. In August, the Trump administration wiped personal COVID-19 immunization and exemption-request records for all federal employees.

After initially opposing the public release of the “Epstein Files,” Trump signed a bipartisan legislative measure directing the Justice Department to release unclassified, Epstein-case-related files. The agency began sharing heavily redacted records last month.

Trump in January ordered that case files related to the assassinations of former President John F. Kennedy, his brother and former Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr. be made public. In March, the National Archives released the last round of previously withheld information related to JFK’s assassination.

The politics of natural gas in the age of Trump Connecticut has had its own love-hate political relationship with gas over the last 15 or so years.","Doug Burgum, the U.S. Department of Interior secretary, said the quiet part out loud.

It was a few days before Christmas, an hour or two after he had announced that five offshore wind projects under construction — including Connecticut’s Revolution Wind — was being halted “due to national security risks identified by the Department of War in recently completed classified reports.”

Burgum told Fox News another story: “We have a solution in New England right there, which is natural gas from Pennsylvania, which would generate power five to 10 times more than all these … five projects put together.”

Natural gas.

In some circles it’s viewed as the holy grail of power supply. In others it is one of the worst climate change nightmares imaginable. And then there’s pretty much everything in between.

The U.S. produces more natural gas than any other nation. It also exports more. The Trump administration has clearly said it wants to do more of both. That was a pillar of President Donald Trump’s day one executive order, Unleashing American Energy, which put renewables like wind and solar on notice while creating a glide path for extracting and marketing more fossil fuels.

The general public has many mistaken notions about natural gas. That it is clean. That it will lower energy prices. Even that it occurs as a liquid like oil. And for sure that it is a panacea.

The misconceptions about natural gas extend to its economics and its politics. But they start with what it actually is, beginning with its name.

What’s in a name

Natural gas was given that name more than a century ago to differentiate it from the prevalent form of gas at the time, which was manufactured from coal. That gas was known as coal gas, town gas, coke gas, manufactured gas — among other names.

Natural gas, most often found alongside oil, came out of the ground as gas — so it was called “natural.” It came into wide use after World War II.

These days, some environmental advocates want to change the name to highlight its main component — methane.

“Typically I don’t call it natural gas,” said Deborah Gordon a senior principal at the energy think tank RMI, where she leads the oil and gas solutions initiative within the Climate Intelligence Program. She is an engineer with a deep background in energy and has written specifically on the myths and realities of natural gas.

Underground, Gordon said, natural gas is anywhere from 60% to 90% methane. After it’s processed, the natural gas delivered via pipeline to New England is closer to 90% or more methane, she said.

Gordon is among many who point out that methane is a potent greenhouse gas. And the problems start well before it is burned as a fuel. The biggest of the problems is methane leaks into the atmosphere, Gordon and others say.

In the first 20 years after it is released, methane has more than 80 times the heat-trapping capacity of carbon dioxide, CO2, which is the most abundant greenhouse gas. After that, methane turns into carbon dioxide, at which point it adds to the long-term heat trapping and greenhouse gas buildup CO2 creates — some of which can last thousands of years.

The 2025 Global Methane Tracker report released in May by the International Energy Agency, IEA, stated: “Methane is responsible for around 30% of the rise in global temperatures since the Industrial Revolution, and rapid and sustained reductions in methane emissions are key to limiting near-term global warming and improving air quality.”

“The way we often talk about it is, CO2 building up in the atmosphere tells you how much warming the planet is ultimately going to experience over generations,” said Mark Brownstein, senior vice president of energy transition at the Environmental Defense Fund, EDF.

He previously worked for the electric and gas utility PSEG, which at one time owned the Bridgeport Harbor power plant.

“Methane in the atmosphere tells you something important about how fast the rate of increase is going to be,” he said. “Reducing methane from the oil and gas industry is the most immediate, impactful and cost-effective thing that we can do to slow the rate of climate change.”

Methane leaks when the gas is extracted, when it moves through pipelines and at many other points as it’s distributed to heat homes, pumped into power plants to generate electricity or super-cooled to convert it to liquefied natural gas for transport overseas by tanker.

Peter Raymond, a professor at the Yale School of the Environment who studies and measures global methane, said the biggest source of leaks is from waste — landfills and wastewater treatment facilities. Close behind are the natural gas leaks. Much farther behind is agricultural methane — mainly produced by ruminants, mostly cows.

“The biggest leak is in exploration,” Raymond said of natural gas leakage. “There’s considerable leaks in the distribution system that you can map and find. There’s efficiency to gain along the whole supply chain,” he said.

“Basically you don’t want it in the atmosphere at all because it has this very high potency over its short lifetime. Stopping it from leaking immediately stops that warming immediately,” said RMI’s Gordon. “CO2 builds up very slowly over time, and so stopping CO2 today, which we want to do, won’t remove all that has been built up over the last 100 years in the planet.”

Natural gas also contains standard pollutants — and those can leak, too. Gordon said they’re a mixture of everything the gas touched while it was underground, plus the volatile organic compounds methane, ethane, propane and butane. All of it can also contribute to smog.

“The whole thing is a combination of air pollution and greenhouse gas,” she said. “If the air pollution was your only issue, [gas] in fact would be a better choice than coal or oil, and it is less carbon intensive than coal or oil. So over the long term, it does have some marginal benefits relative to either one of those fuels. But when there are leaks, it does have this profound impact in the near term.”

The extent of methane leaks from natural gas and its other sources also reflects local regulatory controls, including containment systems to minimize leaks and protocols to find and fix them. Brownstein at EDF said extraction around the Marcellus Shale — the area in the Appalachian Basin that extends through Pennsylvania into New York — has better controls than the Permian Basin, which is largely in west Texas.

He said a recent EDF report showed that emissions on the New Mexico side of the Permian Basin are half of what they are in Texas. “And why is that?” he said. “Because New Mexico has a regulatory framework in place that requires companies to manage their methane emissions, whereas in Texas, they don’t.

“The first question that I would have for anybody championing natural gas coming into Connecticut is, what has the state of Connecticut done to make sure that the methane emissions are managed well within the border?” he said. “And two, what is it that suppliers bringing gas into Connecticut should be doing to manage the methane footprint of the gas that they’re selling into the region?”

A spokesperson for the American Gas Association, which says it represents more than 200 local energy delivery companies, reiterated statements on its website that “emissions from natural gas distribution systems have declined 70% since 1990,” though did not specify which emissions.

She said the group was “committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions through smart innovation, new and modernized infrastructure, and advanced technologies.” The site also lists among its commitments to “further reduce methane emissions from natural gas utility systems,” and it notes that AGA has put in place a reporting system for companies to document methane reduction actions. It also states that natural gas is “clean.”

AGA did not respond to questions about whether it supported the Trump administration delay of stricter methane emission standards, but noted the the local distribution companies were already exempt from the tighter standards.

Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, DEEP, has a pipeline safety group that monitors and manages leaks. The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority regulates the gas distribution system within the state.

But all Connecticut’s gas comes from outside its borders, and that interstate movement is overseen by federal entities.

“We don’t have jurisdiction to regulate those activities,” DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said. Producers, she said, have been better about stemming leaks at the wellheads and production facilities. Lost gas is also lost money for them.

DEEP tracks methane emissions in its annual Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory, which monitors the state’s progress towards its emissions goal. “While Connecticut has reduced fugitive emissions from older gas infrastructure by replacing older cast iron gas lines with newer PVC distribution lines, fugitive emissions have risen imperceptibly since the previous year,” its most recent report, released in September, stated.

Connecticut does not include the emissions that occur in the production of gas that eventually comes into the state. “This inventory does not capture the full effect of methane leaks into the atmosphere from the natural gas distribution system because natural gas consumed in Connecticut is produced and stored out of state,” the report also stated. New York, California and Washington do include that in their inventories.

“I think what keeps us up the most [at night] is that policymakers seem to be still reaching for gas as a solution for affordability, despite how much has changed to the contrary about the affordability of gas in the last 10 years,” said Jamie Dickerson, senior director of clean energy and climate programs at Acadia Center, a regional advocacy group for clean energy and climate change solutions.

He said even though the climate concern is still there, “we still are very concerned that natural gas would actually have an upward impact on energy prices and exacerbate the current affordability dynamics in the region.”

The counter-intuitive economics of natural gas

In certain policy circles, there has been no shortage of discussion, news stories and market analysis about the economics of Trump’s push for more U.S.-produced natural gas. And they all get at a similar idea — as gas production increases, so will the price for U.S. consumers. That may sound counterintuitive.

There are good reasons for it, though.

One is that even if all the gas was destined to be used in the U.S., producers would still need to drill, produce and transport it. Who would pay for that, including new pipelines and all the other construction components? U.S. consumers.

But a lot of the gas is not destined for use here. Much of the Trump administration’s motive for boosting production is to sell it to other countries — especially European countries trying to stop using Russian gas. They’ve been willing to pay relatively high prices, which gas producers certainly like.

If U.S. buyers want some of that gas, in order to be competitive they would to have to match those European prices. Even if you strip out the costs of liquefying it and transporting it to Europe, U.S. buyers would still face higher prices for natural gas, which seems to leave them stuck between a rock and a hard place.

The most recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, EIA, shows how stark that price increase was in 2025 alone, despite an increase in gas production. Last year, the average wholesale spot price for the benchmark Henry Hub in Louisiana increased by 56% compared to 2024, when prices hit the lowest on record when adjusted for inflation. (Prices tend to be higher in winter than summer when gas is used for both electricity and heat.)

The average prices for the two hubs used by the Northeast — one in Boston and one in New York — doubled over that same period.

According to an analysis of EIA data done by the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, there were record exports of natural gas — mainly as LNG — over the course of the first nine months of the Trump administration. They went up 22%. Costs for natural gas consumers also went up 22%.

January data from EIA predicts the benchmark natural gas price will decline in the beginning of this year, before rising sharply into 2027.

Michael Oristaglio, senior research scientist and lecturer in earth and planetary sciences at Yale University, and former director of the university’s energy studies program, said that could leave the oil industry in a bind. Since oil and gas often are a two-for-one drilling proposition — with oil prices too low for companies to want to invest and oil demand declining as well — drilling for more gas could go down with the oil ship.

“That is the issue in the Permian Basin,” he said. “The Marcellus is a little different. It’s one of the only shale formations that just produces natural gas.”

Compromising the ability to build new gas infrastructure is a shortage of natural gas turbines that is predicted to last until 2030. And even if the infrastructure could get built, tariffs might raise the cost — again, something that consumers would likely have to bear.

Even so, Connecticut is not ruling out a tilt back to natural gas use, despite years-long efforts to pivot away.

Dykes said DEEP is researching the many factors around fossil fuel use, including the critical cost-benefit analysis, as it develops its next Integrated Resource Plan, IRP, which assesses future electric needs. While she noted that the cost of electricity is highly sensitive to the delivered price of natural gas in New England, she also referenced the marching orders from her boss.

“Gov. Lamont has been speaking for more than a year now about the importance of considering all energy options as a part of an all-of-the-above approach. And he’s been very interested in understanding what the potential benefits might be of expanding gas access, particularly to help make energy costs more affordable and make the grid more reliable,” she said.

At the opposite end, Dykes has to factor in how to meet the state’s decarbonization goals and mandates. She pointed to additional gas as a potential counter-balance to renewable power that may not be available 100% of the time. But she admitted that trying to weigh the many sudden moves by the Trump administration — such as the second shutdown and now court-ordered restart of construction on Revolution Wind — can make that process daunting.

“I think the only thing that anyone really can say with certainty is that the list of uncertainties continues to grow,” Dykes said. “Unfortunately, that doesn’t relieve us of the necessity of making some decisions and making some investments, with the best information we can, to help ensure that we have a reliable and affordable grid that can meet the long term policy goals that the legislature has set here in Connecticut.”

Brad Campbell, president of the New England-based Conservation Law Foundation, CLF, and a former Environmental Protection Agency regional administrator, said that the conventional wisdom for many years was that if you wanted to lower electricity prices in New England, all you had to do was build more infrastructure to get more gas in. But he said that’s a misconception.

“Building more pipes isn’t going to reduce prices for New Englanders when the price of the commodity going into the pipe is going higher and higher,” he said. “Running another pipe — the gas industry expects that to be borne on the backs of ratepayers.”

Brownstein of EDF also pointed out that gas, unlike renewables such as wind and solar, comes with the ongoing cost of having to pay for every unit that’s consumed.

“When you say that a new gas pipeline will be run into New England, or you say that New England will build a whole bunch of new gas plants, ultimately you will pay for that every time you turn on your lights, and every time you turn on your stove,” he said. “It’s very nice for the Trump administration to say that you need all this and you should want it. It’s another thing to say to a homeowner in Connecticut, ‘Guess what you’re going to have to pay for.”’

Brownstein said in recent travels to Europe, he heard worries about the continent becoming too dependent on U.S. gas — namely, if energy prices begin to rise in the U.S., would the Trump administration restrict exports in order to keep energy prices in the U.S. low?

“They see that simply replacing their dependence on Russian gas for dependence on American gas may not be a smart bet either, particularly as the United States has become a less predictable ally,” Brownstein said.

Add to that the current dispute the U.S has with new E.U. regulations for monitoring and tightening methane emissions on oil and gas coming into the E.U. beginning next year. The U.S. has asked for an exemption. It’s unclear how that could play out — but it could push prices higher.

And there are also questions about how to move forward with existing gas infrastructure. Spend the money to repair it when needed? Replace it if necessary? Even expand it?

“We’re not doing the right cost-benefit analysis to determine where the public should be putting its money,” said Noah Berman, senior policy advocate and utility innovation program manager at Acadia Center.

That’s where politics comes in.

The politics of natural gas in the age of Trump

Connecticut has had its own love-hate political relationship with gas over the last 15 or so years. In 2013, in the state’s first Comprehensive Energy Strategy — developed by the then-new Department of Energy and Environmental Protection — converting to natural gas was a go-to strategy.

Its key goal was to take advantage of cheap prices from the fracking boom to convert more than 300,000 homes and businesses from oil to natural gas heat. Gas was touted as cleaner and a bridge fuel from oil to renewables.

Climate advocates were incensed, predicting it would entrench gas for a generation or more. There were also concerns about the lack of pipeline capacity and the cost of building out infrastructure to distribute gas to homes.

While the policy stayed in place for years, the goals were never reached and it quietly vanished as the focus turned to electrification through heat pumps, rooftop solar and storage.

But much of the region did not look kindly on more gas lines or plants. A study done in Massachusetts 10 years ago found that more gas lines weren’t needed until at least 2030. While some gas generation was built, and oil-burning plants converted to gas, local opposition contributed to stopping others — including a plant planned in Killingly.

New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Maine are, to varying degrees, exploring what are referred to as “future of gas” policies — ways to wean states off using natural gas, from very gentle pushes towards heat pumps to strict rules barring new gas hookups for homes and businesses.

But with Trump’s pro-fossil fuel and anti-renewables policies in place, New York has delayed implementation of its gas bans that would have started on Jan. 1. The state’s governor, Kathy Hochul, is now considering allowing a gas pipeline to be built after years of opposing it. The concession is said to have been the price for restarting Empire Wind construction after the first time Trump ordered it stopped earlier in 2025, though Hochul claims that is not the case. (The project was one of those recently stopped again.)

Massachusetts has recently made moves towards backing off some its climate goals — though a longstanding ruling, which keeps utilities from charging customers for new gas lines, remains in place.

Connecticut has been on the sidelines for much of this — especially cutting back on gas use. Legislation that has promoted future of gas evaluations has failed more than once in recent years, and EIA data shows that gas consumption in the state is rising.

“Connecticut is an outlier on gas consumption rates among the rest of the region,” said Acadia’s Dickerson. “If you isolate just Connecticut, the rest of New England is actually flat or declining gas consumption over the past five to 10 years.”

Acadia supports consideration of non-pipeline solutions — like promoting heat pumps, solar or geothermal energy — to avoid recommitting to natural gas when existing infrastructure has reached the end of its useful life or has safety issues.

The Trump administration has been steadily endeavoring to peel away safeguards against greenhouse gases as well as standard emissions of all sorts. It’s keeping coal plants open past their planned shutdowns. And the administration is close to rolling back more restrictive Biden administration standards for mercury and carbon emissions.

For methane specifically, it has delayed until 2034 stricter emission standards also put in place by the Biden administration. A number of groups, including EDF, are challenging that in court.

“There’s no question that the Trump administration is working to put a thumb on the scale of oil and gas,” said Brownstein of EDF. “Doubling down on natural gas exacerbates a methane problem that they’re taking no action to solve, and, in fact, undoing work that the previous administration did that actually would have made a material difference.”

An open question is whether the Trump administration — through its energy emergency executive order, or any other energy actions including quid pro quos to restart offshore wind and other projects — will be able to force natural gas into or through a state that doesn’t want it.

On Jan. 13, the EPA announced a proposed rule to limit states’ ability under the Clean Water Act to deny federal permits for infrastructure like gas pipelines if the state feels they pose a hazard to water bodies. It follows a proposed rule issued in November that would remove federal pollution protections from many inland waters and most wetlands.

“They are absolutely trying to override state authority. And their theory is that anything states do that burdens the oil and gas industry — anything that burdens big oil and big gas — should be overridden because it interferes with the President’s authority in declaring the energy emergency,” Campbell at CLF said.

“I think at the end of the day, the political pressure on governors to deliver on an affordability agenda is going to drive the same changes in policy, the same changes in the utility model and utility practice that we need to decarbonize the grid,” Campbell said. “But the one thing that seems certain is that deepening our addiction to natural gas for heat and electricity is going to only going to take us in a less affordable direction.”",https://assets.hartfordbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AIM-image1-Cromwell-CT-scaled-e1768910206180.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 08:01:17.668991

It will fund a greenfield 141 MW/677 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS) and refinance a co-located 141 MW utility scale solar PV plant, alongside a portfolio of 18 small scale distributed generation (PMGD) solar plants totalling 121 MWp. Together, these assets will enhance grid stability, reduce renewable energy curtailment, and displace carbon-intensive generation, directly contributing to Chile’s ambitious decarbonisation goals.

DNV was engaged by Toesca to provide comprehensive market consultancy for this highly diverse portfolio, spanning multiple technologies, scales, and geographies from the Atacama Desert to the Biobío Region. DNV’s experts conducted detailed market due diligence to evaluate project feasibility and performed quantitative and qualitative reviews of complex power purchase agreements (PPAs), including those with distribution companies. A key component of DNV’s work was optimising the financial viability of the BESS through advanced revenue stacking analysis, power price forecasting, and stabilised price modelling – providing lenders and developers with critical insights into future market risks and revenue opportunities.

Chile’s energy transition is advancing at remarkable speed. The country has already achieved over 60% of its electricity generation from renewable sources in 2025, with solar power alone accounting for more than 30% of total generation capacity. Chile was the first Latin American nation to introduce a carbon tax in 2017, and it is now phasing out coal faster than any other developing economy. In the first 11 months of 2025, renewable curtailments reached 5 TWh (around 15% of the available wind and solar generation), highlighting the urgent need for storage solutions to fully harness the nation’s abundant solar and wind resources. The integration of large scale battery systems such as T Power’s BESS represents the next critical step in ensuring reliability and resilience as Chile moves toward its net-zero target by 2050.

“Securing financing for a multi-technology, multi-site portfolio requires deep market insight and a clear analysis of long-term revenue streams and risks,” said Brice Le Gallo, Regional Director for SEMELA, Energy Systems at DNV. “Our advisory services helped Toesca and its financing partners navigate this complexity, demonstrating how strategic storage deployment is essential for unlocking the full potential of Chile’s renewable energy abundance and supporting its national climate ambitions.”

The successful closure of this financing package, advised legally by White & Case LLP and Claro & Cia on the Sponsor’s side and Milbank LLP and Barros & Errazuriz on the lenders’ side, highlights the crucial role of specialised technical and market advisory in de-risking large scale energy infrastructure investments. DNV’s contribution was instrumental in bridging the gap between the project’s innovative design and the requirements of international financiers, ensuring the bankability of a portfolio that is set to become a cornerstone of Chile’s cleaner energy matrix.

At its center are questions about whether it’s legal for a president to unilaterally leave a treaty approved by the Senate — and if a future president could reenter it without the Senate voting again.

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change serves as the foundation for international efforts to address global warming and is the precursor to the 2015 Paris Agreement. Participation in Paris depends on being a signatory to the convention.

President George H.W. Bush ratified the treaty with the Senate’s overwhelming approval in 1992. Trump threw that into reverse two weeks ago when he identified the UNFCCC among dozens of international organizations from which he would cease engagement. It came after he has shuttered climate offices across the government, halted offshore wind projects and urged world leaders to abandon efforts to slow global warming.

Now Trump is testing the reach of his executive authority by exiting the UNFCCC.

According to the treaty’s withdrawal clause, the U.S. can leave the convention a year after notifying the United Nations in writing. (It’s the same timeline for exiting the Paris Agreement, which will take effect for the U.S. next Tuesday.)

Whether a president can unilaterally leave a treaty under U.S. law is not addressed in the Constitution. The Supreme Court declined to answer the question in 1979, in Goldwater v. Carter, when President Jimmy Carter terminated a bilateral defense treaty with Taiwan, in order to establish formal relations with China. Congress opposed the move and Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) sued with other lawmakers. A four-justice plurality determined that while the Constitution outlines the Senate’s role in ratifying a treaty, it is silent on the chamber’s role in abandoning one.

Presidents have unilaterally withdrawn from treaties for decades. Those include the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which President George W. Bush withdrew from in 2002; and a treaty that normalized relations with Iran that Trump quit during his first administration.

“In the last 50 years, almost all U.S. treaty withdrawals have been done unilaterally by presidents,” Curtis Bradley, an international law professor at the University of Chicago, said in an email.

The mainstream legal view is that the president may quit a treaty if it’s permitted under international law and “neither the Senate’s resolution of advice and consent nor a congressional law has put limits on withdrawal,” former deputy climate envoy Sue Biniaz and law professor Jean Galbraith, argue in a recent piece in Just Security.

Some legal scholars argue that just because presidents exercise the practice of quitting treaties, it doesn’t mean the law grants them the power to do it. There have been various attempts in recent years to codify whether the power of withdrawal is exclusive to the president, or if they need help from lawmakers.

So what happens now? And is it likely that Trump’s single-handed withdrawal from the UNFCCC will be legally challenged?

First, a few questions need answers, said Harold Koh, an international law professor at Yale Law School and a former State Department legal adviser.

One is timing.

An opponent of Trump’s move could trigger a lawsuit at any time, but showing standing to sue — which legal scholars say is likely to prove challenging — would be harder if the withdrawal hasn’t been formally instituted.

A White House official said the State Department was preparing the official notification that will be sent to the U.N. Once that occurs, the U.S. would withdraw from the treaty one year later.

Next, who can bring a case?

Lawmakers could argue that the president’s action seeks to nullify a legislative branch vote and legally challenge it using what’s known as congressional standing, said Koh.

Or Congress could pass a bill saying congressional approval is needed before Trump can withdraw. The chances of that are extremely unlikely in a Republican-dominated Congress, where lawmakers have generally shrugged off Trump’s plan to quit the treaty. Even if both chambers passed such a bill, Trump could veto it. Overriding it would require a two-thirds vote in the House and Senate.

It’s also possible that another party could sue Trump, such as an individual, a state or an environmental group. The case might be difficult to bring to court, because they would have to show standing — or that they were injured by the withdrawal, said Koh.

“The standing problem with climate change, obviously, is that everybody is harmed by climate change,” he added. “So it’s hard for one individual to claim an unusual or extraordinary harm.”

A state, such as California or Massachusetts, could argue that global warming leads to a greater chance that disasters, like floods, cause increasingly expensive damage to its infrastructure or economy.

The challenge there is that the UNFCCC doesn’t contain specific obligations to reduce emissions, making it hard to show how a particular state could be harmed in a concrete way by the U.S. leaving the convention.

“I think there are real and serious harms to U.S. withdrawal,” said Galbraith at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, who added that tying those damages to a geographic location, and showing how they could be redressed, would be difficult.

“If there is a party who can sue, my guess is that the courts would either hold that the dispute presents a political question that cannot be resolved by the judiciary or they would side with President Trump on the merits,” said Bradley, from the University of Chicago.

Legal challenges could also await a future president who tries to exert executive power to reenter the treaty.

The main question would be whether Trump’s withdrawal canceled the Senate’s prior consent, requiring new legislative action, said Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. That’s never been decided.

“It’s possible the courts would say that’s a political question the courts can’t handle. It’s also possible courts say it’s not a political question, but it doesn’t have standing,” Gerrard said.

Galbraith of UPenn thinks a future administration would be able to reenter the UNFCCC based on the Senate’s 1992 ratification.

To do that, a president might issue a proclamation or memo outlining their decision. Under international law, they would only need to notify the U.N. in writing of their decision to rejoin, Galbraith said. It would take 90 days to become official.

Of course, that could be challenged. And the case could end up at the Supreme Court, which traditionally gives deference to presidents on matters of foreign affairs.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/7f/ec/fde508e34fef8b3dba133873e83a/ee-cw-schonhardt-unfcc.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 08:58:32.571910

This story, by Elise Plunk, was originally published by Louisiana Illuminator.

Communities around Louisiana, in a bid to get more information about the environmental and health impacts of industrial pollution, are taking data collection into their own hands — despite a law restricting how their research findings can be used to enforce state regulations.

The practice is called community, citizen or participatory science, and it involves data collected from non-scientists that’s passed along to researchers who use their expertise to study and understand what they mean. From air quality to fisheries impacts, the grassroots-gathered information has the potential to inform the public about impacts of nearby industry.

“Our challenge for really a couple decades has been: How can we get something that can empower the communities to be able to speak for themselves, about the issues, with data?” said Marylee Orr, executive director of Louisiana Environmental Action Network.

The Louisiana-based nonprofit, long involved with community air monitoring projects, recently posted on its website an interactive air monitoring dashboard. The site gives continuous updates from air quality sensors placed at four locations along the Mississippi River in the heavily industrialized corridor between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. The dashboard also lists locations and readings from Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality monitors.

The system, funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, uses stationary air quality sensors to measure spikes in air pollutant levels. Toxic emissions such as sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxide and volatile organic compounds can be detected, recorded and displayed on the online dashboard, providing neighboring communities with information about potential health risks.

Similar efforts to get hard numbers for air and water quality concerns are also happening in Cameron Parish, where community air monitoring and water quality research partnerships are expanding. The area is the site of three liquified natural gas (LNG) terminals, and six more LNG facilities are either under construction or in the planning stages.

Environmental groups, including the Habitat Recovery Project and For a Better Bayou, have been working to secure funding for air quality monitoring equipment and underwater sound research in an attempt to find the source of air pollution and fisheries disruptions in the region.

“Stories hold weight, and science and data holds weight,” said Habitat Recovery Project director Alyssa Portaro. “When we put these two things together, it really gives a robust picture of what’s going on.”

Fishermen and advocates alike suspect air quality and fisheries problems in Cameron have ties to the nearby LNG facilities but have no independent data to back up their suspicions. The environmental groups received grants to buy monitoring equipment and hire fishermen to collect data and partner with scientists for research projects.

“Nobody knows exactly what’s going on out here,” said Sky Leger, a fisherman who works along Cameron Parish’s coast. He and his girlfriend, restaurant worker Karri Hooper, recently got involved with community science monitoring, in part, to help track whether noise from boat traffic and LNG facility construction is impacting adjacent fishing grounds.

Around the country, scientific communities have seen growing acceptance of data collection in partnership with non-scientists.

“There’s been increasing recognition of the power of these types of projects to collect really useful data,” said Bradley Allf, a postdoctoral research associate at Colorado State University who uses participatory science to study urban ecology and conservation.

Allf studied the concept of citizen science data collection for his doctoral thesis, saying the research technique has grown in popularity as well as acceptance within the scientific community over recent decades.

“There was some hesitation around whether we can really trust data collected by people who haven’t necessarily been trained in science,” Allf said. “I don’t think that’s very true anymore.”

Despite its expanding acceptance, the struggle to increase transparency around industry’s environmental impact in Louisiana with community-gathered data faces legal hurdles.

The Louisiana Legislature approved a law in 2024 enacting strict qualitative standards for community air monitoring programs in order to be considered valid data that state regulators could use for oversight or enforcement.

Air-monitoring equipment and analysis must use the most current EPA-approved techniques, and data must be analyzed at labs the Louisiana Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program certifies, according to the legislation dubbed the Community Air Monitoring Reliability Act.

Environmental groups argue these standards, which can be costly, prices them out of being able to do research. The cost for the state’s preferred monitoring equipment runs up to $500,000, said former EPA official Larry Starfield, an adviser to Orr’s monitoring dashboard project

“That’s not something that is accessible,” said Misha Mayeur with the Habitat Recovery Project.

The equipment her group intends to buy with current grant proceeds costs around $20,000, cheaper than the regulatory monitors that cost more than their entire annual budget to buy.

The sensors the Louisiana Environmental Action Network uses for its stationary air monitoring in Southeast Louisiana, like those in Cameron Parish, aren’t up to the standards for regulatory enforcement in the 2024 state law. The regulatory monitors required in Louisiana to allege pollution violations cost around $500,000, said former EPA official Larry Starfield.

Even if the data can’t be used to enforce air quality standards for Louisiana, Orr said there’s still value in community awareness that could prompt change.

“If the data suggest a problem, it’s an opportunity for communities to invite companies to investigate their concerns,” said Orr.

Starfield said he hopes keeping the community informed could offer a way to let industry prove its willingness to cooperate and improve air quality.

“Many of the workers live in the community. Why wouldn’t you want to have a good relationship?” he said.

President and CEO of the Louisiana Chemical Association and Louisiana Chemical Industry Alliance president David Cresson responded to the launch of LEAN’s dashboard in a statement emailed to the Illuminator, saying the association was reviewing LEAN’s data and methodology.

“We hope to continue to work with LEAN to identify the areas of impact as indicated by their data, and if the specific source can be verified, take practical steps to remediate the issue,” Cresson said in a statement from the association.

And if industry chooses not to cooperate, Starfield said data can help encourage state and federal entities to get involved.

“The idea is to engage Louisiana [Department of Environmental Quality] and EPA in a situation where there’s a feeling that there’s a problem here, we’re seeing a pattern,” he said. “Certainly bringing in EPA and bringing in LDEQ and asking them to investigate … that’s absolutely a good thing.”

Fishermen in Cameron used their collective voice to engage state enforcement in August when they brought to light impacts to oysters, crabs and fish from dredging spills near the site where Venture Global’s CP2 LNG facility is being built.

Venture Global initially claimed there were no sediment spills or harmed fisheries. But at the urging of fishermen, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries sent a biologist to study the area, and the official later confirmed oysters had been killed.

“The only thing that they’re going off of is by the reports of the people that Venture Global hired,” Leger said. “But we have the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries coming out here and checking the oysters … and they are saying that there is very much so a problem with sediment being on top of those oysters in the lake.”

Portaro said this example is a strong argument for informing the community, as well as involving scientists, in documenting air and water quality issues in places like Cameron Parish.

“The fishermen were able to verify that, document it; then Fish and Wildlife came out and said, ‘Yeah, there is mud in the lake,’” said Portaro. “Sometimes the biologists on the job need the community keeping an eye on them, a well-informed community.”",https://www.sciencefriday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/SOS-FB-SIZE.png,N,,2026-01-20 09:59:51.929514

Cornex New Energy Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of China’s GCL Group, has announced major investments in Egypt’s renewable energy manufacturing sector. The company is partnering with Egypt-based Kemet Industries Group to build large-scale energy storage battery and solar photovoltaic (PV) facilities worth a combined USD 700 million.

Under the agreement, Cornex will invest USD 200 million to establish a 5 GWh energy storage battery plant in Egypt. The proposed facility will use Cornex’s battery manufacturing technology and will supply the Egyptian market as well as regional demand in the Middle East and Africa.

Seperately, Suzhou GCL Photovoltaic Technology Co., Ltd. will invest USD 500 million to build an integrated solar PV industrial base. The project will cover approximately 280,000 square metres and will integrate both solar cell and module production stages. Planned annual output will reach 5 GW once operations begin.

The PV facility will strengthen Egypt’s solar manufacturing ecosystem and reduce dependence on imported components. Lower production costs are also expected to improve the economics of utility-scale and commercial solar projects across the country.

These investments align with Egypt’s industrial strategy to position itself as a regional hub for clean energy manufacturing.

Still, EPA’s fiscal year 2026 budget will be at an all-time low. The budget also includes cuts that would eliminate the Department of Energy’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations and defund the Office of Energy Justice and Equity.

At the same time, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin is rolling out his promised “biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history,” aimed at eliminating 31 environmental and public health protections. For example, last week, the EPA announced it would stop considering the impact on human health when reviewing power plant pollution emissions. The EPA will stop calculating how much money is saved in health care costs avoided and deaths prevented from air pollution rules that curb two deadly pollutants—fine particulate matter and ozone, NBC News reported.

The compromise spending package blocks several anti-environmental riders, though, including one that would have led to the sale of public lands, and sets legally binding spending requirements to help ensure the White House can’t withhold or misuse funds.

The set of bills provides funding at near previous levels for agencies such as the Health and Human Services (HHS), National Park Service (NPS), National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), Department of Energy (DOE), U.S. Forest Service (USFS), National Science Foundation (NSF), and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) that play an important role delivering science, environmental, and energy programs.

According to Copernicus, the European Union’s climate change monitoring service, 2025 recorded as the third-warmest year ever recorded. Last year was only slightly cooler than 2023 and 2024—the warmest year on record. The past 11 years have been the 11 warmest on record, according to Copernicus data.

In 2025, the average global temperature was about 2.65 degrees Fahrenheit higher than from 1850 to 1900—the period scientists use as a reference point, since it precedes the industrial era in which massive amounts of carbon pollution have been pumped into the atmosphere.

Air temperature over global land areas was the second warmest last year, while the Antarctic saw its warmest annual temperature on record and the Arctic its second warmest.

The last three years, 2023-2025, were exceptionally warm for two main reasons, Copernicus explained. The first is the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from continued emissions and reduced uptake of carbon dioxide by natural sinks. Secondly, sea-surface temperatures reached exceptionally high levels across the ocean, associated with an El Niño event and other ocean variability factors, amplified by climate change. Additional factors include changes in the amounts of aerosols and clouds, and variations in atmospheric circulation.

As in 2023 and 2024, a significant fraction of the globe was much warmer than average in 2025. Air and sea surface temperatures in the tropics were lower than in 2023 and 2024, yet still much above average in many areas outside of the tropics. The lower tropical temperatures compared to 2023-2024 were partly due to the persistence of near-average or weak La Niña conditions in the equatorial Pacific throughout 2025. Temperatures over the tropical Atlantic and Indian Ocean were also less extreme in 2025 than in 2024.

“The fact that the last eleven years were the warmest on record provides further evidence of the unmistakable trend towards a hotter climate,” said Carlo Buontempo, Copernicus Climate Change Service director. “The world is rapidly approaching the long-term temperature limit set by the Paris agreement. We are bound to pass it; the choice we now have is how to best manage the inevitable overshoot and its consequences on societies and natural systems.”

In 2025, half of the global land area experienced more days than average with at least strong heat stress—defined as feels-like temperature of 32°C or above. Heat stress is recognized by the World Health Organization as the leading cause of global weather-related deaths. In areas with dry and often windy conditions, high temperatures also contributed to the spread and intensification of exceptional wildfires, which produce carbon, toxic air pollutants like particulate matter, and ozone, which also impacts human health. These emissions significantly degraded air quality and had potentially harmful impacts on human health at both the local and larger scales in both North America and Europe.",https://cmmonline.com/wp-content/uploads/EPA_thumbnail-4.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 09:59:56.650885

Lately, President Trump has been talking about making sure that AI data centers pay their fair share for electricity costs.","On the campaign trail, President Trump promised to cut Americans' energy bills in half — cheaper gasoline, cheaper electricity. He also said he'd ""unleash"" American energy production, often repeating the catchphrase ""Drill, baby, drill.""

One year in, the price of gasoline is down about 20%. But the U.S. oil industry is definitely not drilling, baby, drilling. The price of oil is just too low to justify more of it — although within the last year companies have won major lobbying victories that soothe that sting. Meanwhile, electricity costs are rising, and expected to rise more.

Cheap gasoline: check

The national average for a gallon of gasoline is down about 20% from where it was a year ago.

Now, presidents — whoever they are — do not get to decide the price of gasoline. The price of crude oil is the biggest factor, and crude prices are set in a complex global marketplace that responds to a number of factors.

In the past year, cheaper crude has been largely driven by a global oversupply of oil, which in turn was largely driven by a series of decisions by the oil cartel OPEC+. The cartel repeatedly put more barrels on the market, depressing global prices but seizing more market share for its members.

However, Dan Pickering, the chief investment officer at Pickering Energy Partners, says that the president also put significant pressure on OPEC to bring down global crude prices. As a result, he gives Trump partial credit for today's low prices.

""I think if we look at oil down 20% in 2025, that you have to say that political dynamics drove at least half of that,"" he says. ""And as we go into 2026, I think those dynamics will still be at play.""

Moving forward, the president's push to produce more oil from Venezuela could also help keep global crude prices lower for longer — if he persuades companies to invest.

Analysts with the gas prices app GasBuddy found that U.S. households spent, on average, $177 less on gasoline in 2025 than 2024, thanks to lower prices, and predict that expenditures will continue to fall in 2026, saving Americans a collective $11 billion next year.

Drill, baby, drill? Not so much.

Those lower oil prices are exactly why ""Drill, baby, drill"" didn't happen.

The number of active drilling rigs in the U.S., the largest oil producer in the world, has dropped by more than 6% year-over-year, at last count. That means fewer new wells are being drilled. And that's true even as the Trump administration has made it easier for companies to start new projects, including by making more federal lands and waters available for leases.

With U.S. oil prices under $60 a barrel and the global market generally oversupplied with crude, it's just not profitable for companies to drill a bunch of new wells right now.

The Trump administration has many close allies in the U.S. oil industry. But this is a perennial point of disagreement between them: The president loves cheap oil, while companies would prefer prices to be higher than they are today.

This disagreement was actually called out by Secretary of Energy Chris Wright — a former fracking executive. Speaking to CBS News' Face the Nation this month, he called President Trump ""no helper to the oil and gas industry"" because ""he's driven down the price of oil.""

It's true that many U.S. oil workers wince every time the president talks about $50 crude or pushes for more production from OPEC. But it's not quite fair to call the administration ""no helper.""

The American Petroleum Institute, or API, is the most powerful lobbying arm of the U.S. oil and gas industry. Before Trump was re-elected, the group laid out a dozen different policy priorities — a wishlist. Tax policy changes that would help oil companies; more access to drilling in the Gulf; a boost in exports of liquefied natural gas; the repeal of requirements for cleaner and more efficient cars, which would have pushed down oil demand over time; the elimination of a fee for releasing planet-warming methane.

""By our count, every single one of them was completed in 2025, with the exception of legislative permitting reform,"" Mike Sommers, the president and CEO of API, said on a recent call with reporters. (""Permitting reform"" refers to a series of changes to federal laws that would make it easier for companies to build things like pipelines and other large projects that often face local opposition. It's been a hot topic in Congress for years.)

Sommers says U.S. companies can weather low oil prices in the short term, and make business decisions with an eye toward the future.

And in the long term, the administration's policy changes support higher oil demand for years to come, by doing things like slowing down the shift toward electric vehicles, while also cutting the costs of oil production, including by easing environmental rules.

Electricity costs are rising

Electricity prices have been increasing for years now, and 2025 was more of the same.

""Across most states and in most markets, what we see is that prices have gone up,"" says Helen Kou, an analyst with BloombergNEF.

Based on trends in wholesale power markets — where your local electric company buys its power, an expense they pass on to you — that's likely to continue. Kou said that in New York and New England, wholesale prices are up more than 60%, and in the mid-Atlantic they're up 45%.

""Almost one in three households, or over 80 million American Americans, are struggling to pay their utility bills,"" says Charles Hua, who runs Powerlines, a national energy consumer education nonprofit that encourages people to get more involved in their public utility commissions.

Why are costs going up? Hua points to three primary reasons: an aging power grid, the cost of natural disasters, and higher fuel costs, especially natural gas.

Kou says that for 2025, natural gas prices were the clear driver of increases. While oil and gasoline are cheap, natural gas — which is used for home heating and power plants — has gone up more than 50% from last year's annual average. U.S. exports of natural gas have increased (one of API's requests), and sending more natural gas overseas means less is available domestically.

Natural gas prices have been up and down over the past few years. They spiked in 2022, after Russia invaded Ukraine. And they were unusually cheap in 2024 before rising again in 2025. While they're far from record highs, the increase has been enough to significantly shift electricity markets.

These causes are complex and date back years before Trump's return to office. But experts say the Trump administration's electricity policy has not focused on lowering natural gas costs, improving the grid or mitigating the effects of natural disasters. Instead, it has aligned with his goal of reversing Biden-era climate policies. The White House has ordered coal-powered power plants to stay open for longer. Those power plants are typically expensive to operate, raising concerns about prices. Kou says keeping them online could hypothetically help meet rising demand, but only if those plants are located where demand is growing.

The administration is also investing in nuclear power — that, too, could potentially help with costs, but only in the long term, Kou says, because nuclear plants take so long to approve and build.

Some of the administration's moves could actually increase electricity bills in the future.

Large solar and wind projects provide more cost-competitive energy than natural gas, nuclear, and coal projects, according to financial services firm Lazard. But the Trump administration has ended federal tax credits for solar and wind projects early, and canceled more than $13 billion in funds for green energy projects

Trump has also said he won't permit any new wind projects, and the administration has attempted to stop offshore wind projects that are already under construction, leading to court battles. That's been criticized not just by renewable energy advocates, but by many business groups, because it creates uncertainty and discourages investments in projects that could be supplying more energy into the grid.

""As a general matter, the thing that you can do that most clearly helps reduce prices is to remove barriers to new energy investment,"" says James Coleman, a nonresident senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""And the thing that basically just increases prices is increasing uncertainty or barriers to energy.""

The administration is also rolling back efficiency standards for appliances. Those standards actually cut consumer bills by reducing energy use, Hua notes.

Meanwhile, some things that could meaningfully cut costs have simply not been prioritized by this administration. ""There are solutions that are available today that can be put on the grid that would meaningfully resolve a lot of these solutions,"" Hua says, pointing to technologies that allow more power to be moved on the existing grid, or better match supply and demand. ""It doesn't solve everything, but it provides some immediate relief … and that just has not been as much of a focus"" for the Trump administration, he says.

Lately, President Trump has been talking about making sure that AI data centers pay their fair share for electricity costs. Hua says there is a genuine opportunity to cut energy bills for ordinary Americans as data center demand for electricity goes up, depending on how costs are spread out.

But for now, the Trump administration's pledge to cut utility bills remains an unmet promise.

The nation’s aging coal plants — more than 200 in all — are increasingly expensive to run, even as methane, more commonly known as natural gas, and solar become cheaper and more abundant.

“If we don’t take care of those miners that’s in there now, we’re not gonna have coal, we’re not gonna have a coal industry,” Robinson said.
Renewable energy generated more electricity than coal power for the first time last year, and Hanson said any effort to revive coal rely less on economics than on nostalgia.","Heading into President Donald Trump’s second term, coal looked like an industry nearing the end of its life. Utilities planned to retire more than half of the nation’s coal-fired power plants by 2028, no new facilities were coming online, and production had been flat for years.

Trump’s first year back in office has given the industry an opportunity to retrench. The president is an avowed supporter of coal, and his Department of Energy has repeatedly intervened to prevent plants from shutting down. At the same time, a Trump-supported boom in the construction of artificial intelligence data centers has led to a surging need for power, prompting many utilities to postpone coal facility closures.

The combination of federal intervention and rising energy demand may have stalled coal’s decline, at least for the moment. Consumption increased 13 percent last year, reversing a long downward slide and causing a bump in domestic carbon emissions. Of the 11 coal-fired plants slated for retirement last year, just two shuttered. But one of them may return: A Utah facility closed in November after losing its primary customer, but the Legislature hopes to save it by finding another buyer. Many of the utilities that committed to shutdowns over the next two years have abandoned those plans.

The administration has combined this effort to prop up coal with delays and rollbacks of rules governing pollution and miner safety, actions central to its heavily pro-coal agenda of “Unleashing American Energy.”

Still, these efforts may not reverse a decline that started nearly 20 years ago. The nation’s aging coal plants — more than 200 in all — are increasingly expensive to run, even as methane, more commonly known as natural gas, and solar become cheaper and more abundant. And although the Trump administration has promised to boost employment, layoffs have continued amid the industry’s ongoing contraction.

Coal may see a short-term reprieve, but experts see little hope of a lasting revival. “When you have to get the government to step in to put its thumb on the scale in order to help your industry,” said Sean Feaster of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, “it’s a sign that you’re not particularly competitive, right?”

Chris Wright, a former fracking executive, has played a central role in this revival by turning the Department of Energy into an industry lifeline. He has issued emergency orders delaying the retirement of at least five of the 11 plants slated for closure, and has renewed them every 90 days. That has sparked legal challenges, drawn scrutiny from regulators, and could saddle utilities and ratepayers with millions in added costs.

Wright argues that keeping them open is necessary to avoid blackouts and price spikes. Few beyond his agency are convinced. Environmental groups, energy experts, and state regulators have accused the department of misrepresenting data in its emergency claims.

“It’s just not justified,” said Michael Goggin, an analyst with Grid Strategies. “They’re grasping at what they can.” He has studied the impact of the emergency orders on behalf of Earthjustice and other groups suing to contest the delay order Wright issued in May for the J.H. Campbell coal power plant in Michigan.

Goggin warns the orders could impose significant costs on utilities. He estimates that keeping all of the various fossil fuel plants slated for retirement through 2028 open could cost ratepayers as much as $6 billion — on top of a $6 billion increase in coal-fired generation costs from 2021 to 2024. He calls the extra expense an involuntary subsidy paid by ratepayers to utilities that neither needed nor requested them.

“You’re making [the utilities] keep these plants that most likely they’re not going to need, and are very likely a waste of money,” he said. While plants like Campbell still generate a positive return from selling power, high maintenance costs make them unprofitable. That’s why many utilities have replaced them with methane or renewables.

Under the DOE orders, plant operators can seek approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to recover these costs from customers. Campbell’s owner, for instance, will spread the expense across millions of ratepayers in the Midwest. Other utilities, however, may struggle. A representative of Colorado’s Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, a rural co-op, said the organization has no idea how it will pay the expenses associated with a federal order to keep its coal plant in northwest Colorado running.

“We have no information available yet on cost recovery,” the representative said. “At this time, there is not a clear path for doing so.”

The Department of Energy did not respond to requests for comment.

Other utilities are postponing closures to meet projected demand from AI data centers. There have been at least half a dozen such delays by investor-owned utilities in the Southeast. The largest of them in Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, and Mississippi have retooled their investment plans over the last two years, pushing planned retirements into the 2030s.

Trump and Wright have endorsed this trend, arguing that coal should play a key role in powering these energy-hungry facilities. In an April executive order intended to revitalize the industry, Trump declared, “Our Nation’s beautiful clean coal resources will be critical to meeting the rise in electricity demand due to the resurgence of domestic manufacturing and the construction of artificial intelligence data processing centers.”

The situation is most extreme in Virginia, which is home to more than 600 of these operations and handles 70 percent of the world’s internet traffic. Experts believe the surge in power demand will force Dominion Energy to import more energy from fossil fuel plants beyond the state, extending the life of polluting facilities in Ohio and West Virginia.

“That region is pretty constrained in terms of supply, so that additional electricity is coming from … additional coal-fired electricity,” said Joe DeCarolis, former head of the Energy Information Administration and now a professor of engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. According to his analysis, “there’s 25 gigawatts of this aging and costly coal capacity that [will continue] to operate to meet the incremental demand that’s coming from data centers” through 2030.

In South Carolina, for instance, the utility Santee Cooper said it would need to push the closure of its Winyah Generation Plant in Georgetown from 2028 to the mid-2030s so it can meet demand from data center development. The plant has received numerous state citations for violating air emissions of sulfur dioxide and has been criticized for operating with expired wastewater discharge permits.

“I think they’re responding to market conditions and political atmosphere, and the political atmosphere is creating the market conditions,” said Marilyn Hemingway, the head of the Gullah Geechee Chamber of Commerce, who lives in Georgetown a few miles from the plant.

Hemingway is a member of a state-mandated transition council overseeing the shutdown of Winyah and Santee Cooper’s other coal assets. She said the utility has repeatedly delayed closing the plant and has yet to decide what energy source will replace coal.

“I’m not naive about this at all,” she said. “I know you have to replace it, but I find it problematic because it’s dragging this transition out.”

Living near coal plants like these may become more dangerous because of Trump’s interventions. Even as the Department of Energy has moved to keep such operations open, the Environmental Protection Agency has rolled back a suite of rules governing their air and water pollution. Over the past year, the agency repealed limits on mercury and other toxic pollutants, scrapped greenhouse gas limits, and extended deadlines allowing coal plants to dump waste, called coal ash, in unlined pits — a move that spared 11 facilities from imminent shutdown. Meanwhile, the Department of the Interior opened 13 million acres of public land for mining.

Emily Arthen, CEO of the American Coal Council, said such regulations were onerous, unnecessary, and contributed to coal’s decline. “Doing the right thing without having to be told is forefront for the industry,” she said, adding that minimal oversight allows the industry to preserve jobs.

Some miners and their families feel the sector hasn’t taken much initiative with regard to worker safety. They are particularly frustrated by the administration’s inaction on a regulation limiting exposure to silica dust, a carcinogen that causes a chronic, fatal condition called silicosis but known more commonly as black lung disease. The rule, finalized during the Biden administration after decades of advocacy, remains stuck in limbo even as the number of cases of the terminal condition skyrockets among young miners.

Vonda Robinson, vice president of the National Black Lung Association, said her only option is to keep fighting. She and her husband John Robinson, a retired coal miner, feel betrayed by an administration whose coal production goals they initially supported. Over the past year threats to mine safety offices and layoffs at the federal agency that runs black lung screenings disrupted protections for miners. Vonda Robinson even wrote to Vice President J.D. Vance, urging him to confront the epidemic. She never received a response.

“If we don’t take care of those miners that’s in there now, we’re not gonna have coal, we’re not gonna have a coal industry,” Robinson said. Her husband, who is awaiting evaluation for a double lung transplant, said he felt abandoned by the industry that fed his family.

“The coal miner’s your workhorse,” he said of the industry’s attitude toward men like him. “When you fall over dead, we’re gonna get another horse.”

Efforts to spur new coal extraction, meanwhile, are faltering. When the Interior Department opened public lands to mining, bids came in below market rate, and three projects in the West collapsed within a month. With no new coal-fired plants planned, the market for thermal coal they burn — much of it mined in the West — remains bleak. So does the market for metallurgical coal, used to make steel, which comprises most coal mined in the Eastern U.S.

Coal mining employment held relatively steady in 2025; the mining workforce stands at around 40,000 workers, less than a quarter of its size in the 1980s. But Erin Bates, communications director for the United Mine Workers of America, warned of trouble ahead. China has stopped importing metallurgical coal used to make steel, undercutting demand for ore mined largely in Appalachia. Overall coal exports fell 14 percent between January and September 2025, and international demand is expected to plateau in the coming years as renewable energy continues to expand; coal power generation fell in both China and India last year after rising for decades.

“It’s something that will trickle down,” Bates said. “The end result is, if they can’t export this coal, and the cost of coal plummets because no one’s buying it, that’s going to mean layoffs, that’s going to mean shutdowns.”

Though one stated goal of Trump’s “Unleashing American Energy” agenda is to “create jobs and prosperity” in extraction and energy production, Harvard labor economist Gordon Hanson doubts the administration’s moves will deliver. What’s actually being built, he said, are gas plants, along with wind and solar projects approved under, and funded through, the Biden administration. Renewable energy generated more electricity than coal power for the first time last year, and Hanson said any effort to revive coal rely less on economics than on nostalgia.

“Many Trump administration policies seem more symbolic than realistic,” Hanson said.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Trump-coal-order.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2026-01-20 05:58:29.938685

Lately, President Trump has been talking about making sure that AI data centers pay their fair share for electricity costs.","On the campaign trail, President Trump promised to cut Americans' energy bills in half — cheaper gasoline, cheaper electricity. He also said he'd ""unleash"" American energy production, often repeating the catchphrase ""Drill, baby, drill.""

One year in, the price of gasoline is down about 20%. But the U.S. oil industry is definitely not drilling, baby, drilling. The price of oil is just too low to justify more of it — although within the last year companies have won major lobbying victories that soothe that sting. Meanwhile, electricity costs are rising, and expected to rise more.

Cheap gasoline: check

The national average for a gallon of gasoline is down about 20% from where it was a year ago.

Now, presidents — whoever they are — do not get to decide the price of gasoline. The price of crude oil is the biggest factor, and crude prices are set in a complex global marketplace that responds to a number of factors.

In the past year, cheaper crude has been largely driven by a global oversupply of oil, which in turn was largely driven by a series of decisions by the oil cartel OPEC+. The cartel repeatedly put more barrels on the market, depressing global prices but seizing more market share for its members.

However, Dan Pickering, the chief investment officer at Pickering Energy Partners, says that the president also put significant pressure on OPEC to bring down global crude prices. As a result, he gives Trump partial credit for today's low prices.

""I think if we look at oil down 20% in 2025, that you have to say that political dynamics drove at least half of that,"" he says. ""And as we go into 2026, I think those dynamics will still be at play.""

Moving forward, the president's push to produce more oil from Venezuela could also help keep global crude prices lower for longer — if he persuades companies to invest.

Analysts with the gas prices app GasBuddy found that U.S. households spent, on average, $177 less on gasoline in 2025 than 2024, thanks to lower prices, and predict that expenditures will continue to fall in 2026, saving Americans a collective $11 billion next year.

Drill, baby, drill? Not so much.

Those lower oil prices are exactly why ""Drill, baby, drill"" didn't happen.

The number of active drilling rigs in the U.S., the largest oil producer in the world, has dropped by more than 6% year-over-year, at last count. That means fewer new wells are being drilled. And that's true even as the Trump administration has made it easier for companies to start new projects, including by making more federal lands and waters available for leases.

With U.S. oil prices under $60 a barrel and the global market generally oversupplied with crude, it's just not profitable for companies to drill a bunch of new wells right now.

The Trump administration has many close allies in the U.S. oil industry. But this is a perennial point of disagreement between them: The president loves cheap oil, while companies would prefer prices to be higher than they are today.

This disagreement was actually called out by Secretary of Energy Chris Wright — a former fracking executive. Speaking to CBS News' Face the Nation this month, he called President Trump ""no helper to the oil and gas industry"" because ""he's driven down the price of oil.""

It's true that many U.S. oil workers wince every time the president talks about $50 crude or pushes for more production from OPEC. But it's not quite fair to call the administration ""no helper.""

The American Petroleum Institute, or API, is the most powerful lobbying arm of the U.S. oil and gas industry. Before Trump was re-elected, the group laid out a dozen different policy priorities — a wishlist. Tax policy changes that would help oil companies; more access to drilling in the Gulf; a boost in exports of liquefied natural gas; the repeal of requirements for cleaner and more efficient cars, which would have pushed down oil demand over time; the elimination of a fee for releasing planet-warming methane.

""By our count, every single one of them was completed in 2025, with the exception of legislative permitting reform,"" Mike Sommers, the president and CEO of API, said on a recent call with reporters. (""Permitting reform"" refers to a series of changes to federal laws that would make it easier for companies to build things like pipelines and other large projects that often face local opposition. It's been a hot topic in Congress for years.)

Sommers says U.S. companies can weather low oil prices in the short term, and make business decisions with an eye toward the future.

And in the long term, the administration's policy changes support higher oil demand for years to come, by doing things like slowing down the shift toward electric vehicles, while also cutting the costs of oil production, including by easing environmental rules.

Electricity costs are rising

Electricity prices have been increasing for years now, and 2025 was more of the same.

""Across most states and in most markets, what we see is that prices have gone up,"" says Helen Kou, an analyst with BloombergNEF.

Based on trends in wholesale power markets — where your local electric company buys its power, an expense they pass on to you — that's likely to continue. Kou said that in New York and New England, wholesale prices are up more than 60%, and in the mid-Atlantic they're up 45%.

""Almost one in three households, or over 80 million American Americans, are struggling to pay their utility bills,"" says Charles Hua, who runs Powerlines, a national energy consumer education nonprofit that encourages people to get more involved in their public utility commissions.

Why are costs going up? Hua points to three primary reasons: an aging power grid, the cost of natural disasters, and higher fuel costs, especially natural gas.

Kou says that for 2025, natural gas prices were the clear driver of increases. While oil and gasoline are cheap, natural gas — which is used for home heating and power plants — has gone up more than 50% from last year's annual average. U.S. exports of natural gas have increased (one of API's requests), and sending more natural gas overseas means less is available domestically.

Natural gas prices have been up and down over the past few years. They spiked in 2022, after Russia invaded Ukraine. And they were unusually cheap in 2024 before rising again in 2025. While they're far from record highs, the increase has been enough to significantly shift electricity markets.

These causes are complex and date back years before Trump's return to office. But experts say the Trump administration's electricity policy has not focused on lowering natural gas costs, improving the grid or mitigating the effects of natural disasters. Instead, it has aligned with his goal of reversing Biden-era climate policies. The White House has ordered coal-powered power plants to stay open for longer. Those power plants are typically expensive to operate, raising concerns about prices. Kou says keeping them online could hypothetically help meet rising demand, but only if those plants are located where demand is growing.

The administration is also investing in nuclear power — that, too, could potentially help with costs, but only in the long term, Kou says, because nuclear plants take so long to approve and build.

Some of the administration's moves could actually increase electricity bills in the future.

Large solar and wind projects provide more cost-competitive energy than natural gas, nuclear, and coal projects, according to financial services firm Lazard. But the Trump administration has ended federal tax credits for solar and wind projects early, and canceled more than $13 billion in funds for green energy projects

Trump has also said he won't permit any new wind projects, and the administration has attempted to stop offshore wind projects that are already under construction, leading to court battles. That's been criticized not just by renewable energy advocates, but by many business groups, because it creates uncertainty and discourages investments in projects that could be supplying more energy into the grid.

""As a general matter, the thing that you can do that most clearly helps reduce prices is to remove barriers to new energy investment,"" says James Coleman, a nonresident senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""And the thing that basically just increases prices is increasing uncertainty or barriers to energy.""

The administration is also rolling back efficiency standards for appliances. Those standards actually cut consumer bills by reducing energy use, Hua notes.

Meanwhile, some things that could meaningfully cut costs have simply not been prioritized by this administration. ""There are solutions that are available today that can be put on the grid that would meaningfully resolve a lot of these solutions,"" Hua says, pointing to technologies that allow more power to be moved on the existing grid, or better match supply and demand. ""It doesn't solve everything, but it provides some immediate relief … and that just has not been as much of a focus"" for the Trump administration, he says.

Lately, President Trump has been talking about making sure that AI data centers pay their fair share for electricity costs. Hua says there is a genuine opportunity to cut energy bills for ordinary Americans as data center demand for electricity goes up, depending on how costs are spread out.

But for now, the Trump administration's pledge to cut utility bills remains an unmet promise.

Other sites, like Homes.com, Redfin and Realtor.com, continue to show First Street climate data in their realty listings.
“Climate risk data didn’t suddenly become inconvenient.
In this way, climate risk models today are better suited to characterize the “ broad environment of risk,” said Chris Field, director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment.
Overall, experts tend to agree on the utility of both private and public data sources for climate risk data, even with needed improvements.","Even as exposure to floods, fire and extreme heat increase in the face of climate change, a popular tool for evaluating risk has disappeared from the nation’s leading real estate website.

Zillow removed the feature displaying climate risk data to home buyers in November after the California Regional Multiple Listing Service, which provides a database of real estate listings to real estate agents and brokers in the state, questioned the accuracy of the flood risk models on the site.

Now, a climate policy expert in California is working to put data back in buyers’ hands.

Neil Matouka, who previously managed the development and launch of California’s Fifth Climate Change Assessment, is developing a proof of concept plugin that provides climate data to Californians in place of what Zillow has removed. When a user views a California Zillow listing, the plugin automatically displays data on wildfire and flood risk, sea level rise and extreme heat exposure.

“We don’t need perfect data,” Matouka said. “We need publicly available, consistent information that helps people understand risk.”

The removal of Zillow’s data, which came a little over year after it was first introduced, began when the California Regional Multiple Listing Service questioned the validity of flood modeling completed by First Street, a climate risk modeling company, which provides climate data to Zillow and other realty sites.

“Our goal is simply to ensure homebuyers are not being presented with information that could be misleading or unfair. We have no objection to the display of accurate climate data,” the multiple listing service said in a statement.

In response to pressure from the listing service, Zillow removed all of its climate risk data, including flood, fire, wind, heat and air quality factors. Zillow still hyperlinks to First Street data in its listings, though it is easy to miss.

“Zillow remains committed to providing consumers with information that helps them make informed real estate decisions. We updated our climate risk product experience to adhere to varying MLS requirements and maintain a consistent experience for all consumers,” Zillow said in a statement.

Other sites, like Homes.com, Redfin and Realtor.com, continue to show First Street climate data in their realty listings.

First Street’s flood map shows more properties at flood risk when compared to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s flood maps, which have also been criticized for being outdated.

First Street defended its methodology. “We take accuracy very seriously, and the data speaks for itself. Our models are built on transparent, peer-reviewed science and are continuously validated against real-world outcomes,” First Street said in a statement.

Both independent academic research and research conducted by Zillow has found that disclosing flood risk can decrease the sale price of a home. “Climate risk data didn’t suddenly become inconvenient. It became harder to ignore in a stressed market,” First Street said.

Home by home climate risk predictions still remain notoriously difficult. A residence may, for example, fall right on a FEMA flood risk boundary. One home might be designated higher risk than its neighbor, either as an artifact of the mapping process or because of a real, geographic difference, such as one side of the street being higher than the other. Fire risk mapping, similarly, does not take into account home hardening measures, which can have a real impact on a home burning.

In this way, climate risk models today are better suited to characterize the “ broad environment of risk,” said Chris Field, director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. “ The more detailed you get to be either in space or in time, the less precise your projections are.”

Matouka’s California climate risk plugin is designed for communicating what he said is the “standing potential risks in the area,” not specific property risk.

While climate risk models often differ in their results, achieving increased accuracy moving forward will be dependent on transparency, said Jesse Gourevitch, an economist at the Environmental Defense Fund. California is unique, since so much publicly available, state data is open to the public. Reproducing Matouka’s plugin for other states will likely be more difficult.

Private data companies present a specific challenge. They make money from their models and are reluctant to share their methods. “A lot of these private-sector models tend not to be very transparent and it can be difficult to understand what types of data or methodologies that they’re using,” said Gourevitch.

Matouka’s plugin includes publicly available data from the state of California and federal agencies, whose extensive methods are readily available online. Overall, experts tend to agree on the utility of both private and public data sources for climate risk data, even with needed improvements.

“People who are making decisions that involve risk benefit from exposure to as many credible estimates as possible, and exposure to independent credible estimates adds a lot of extra value,” Field said.

As for Matouka, his plugin is still undergoing beta testing. He said he welcomes feedback as he develops the tool and evaluates its readiness for widespread use.

“By the end of the fourth day, we had accounted for all the residents of the Double Island community,” Buchanan said.
But more extreme weather events are all but certain thanks to climate change, and today Double Island is better prepared.
The weekend after Helene hit, she said, ​“Footprint rolled into town with a bunch of solar panels.
From Lake Junaluska to Linville Falls, recipients included fire stations such as the one in Double Island and an art collective in West Asheville.","The Double Island Volunteer Fire Department in Yancey County, North Carolina, is the beating heart of this remote community in the shadow of Mount Mitchell, about 50 miles northeast of Asheville. Once home to a schoolhouse that doubled as a church, the red-roofed building still hosts weddings, parties, and other events.

“It was built to serve as a community center,” said Dan Buchanan, whose family has lived in the area since 1747 and whose mother attended the school as a young girl. ​“A place to gather.”

Sixteen months ago, when Hurricane Helene hit this rugged corner of countryside with catastrophic floods, Double Island’s fire department was where locals turned for help.

“This is [our] ​‘downtown,’” said Buchanan, who serves as the assistant fire chief. ​“In the wake of the storm, people were like, ​‘Let’s get to the fire station.’ That was the goal of everybody.”

Fresh out of retirement and living back in his hometown to care for his ailing mother, Buchanan drew on his long career in emergency response to spring into action. With the station, powered by generators, serving as their command center, he and his neighbors gathered and distributed food, water, and other provisions to those in need. They hacked through downed limbs and sent out search teams.

“By the end of the fourth day, we had accounted for all the residents of the Double Island community,” Buchanan said. And while no one in the enclave died because of the hurricane, some suffered while they waited for medications like insulin.

A lack of drinking water and limited forms of communication were also huge obstacles. ​“When we finally got the roads cleared, and people could get in here, we were literally writing down our needs on a notepad and giving it to whomever, and then they would ferry supplies,” Buchanan said. ​“A carrier pigeon would have been nice.”

Helene was a ​“once in 10 lifetimes” storm, Buchanan said, with devastation he and the community hope to never see again. But more extreme weather events are all but certain thanks to climate change, and today Double Island is better prepared.

The station is equipped with a microgrid of 32 solar panels and a pair of four-hour batteries. The donated equipment will shave about $100 off the fire department’s monthly electric bill, meaningful savings for an organization with an annual operating budget of just $51,000.

When storms inevitably hit, felling trees and downing power lines, the self-sustaining microgrid can provide some electricity and an internet signal.

“We’ll have at least a way to run our radio equipment, run our well and basic lighting and refrigeration,” Buchanan said, adding that the latter was vital for medication. ​“It may not seem like much — but that’s the Willy Wonka golden ticket.”

Communication, he stressed, was key. ​“If you can’t communicate, you can’t get the help you need.”

The microgrid project, called a resilience hub, was made possible by a network of government and nonprofit groups that came together after Helene to help fire departments like Double Island and other community centers with long-term recovery. Now, a state grant program is injecting a burst of funds into their efforts. Using both public and private time, know-how, and money, the program aims to create a model for resilience that can be replicated nationwide.

“We aren’t only preparing for a disaster; we’re also helping utility diversification, cost savings, and normalization of the technology,” said Jamie Trowbridge, a senior program manager at Footprint Project, a leading nonprofit in the initiative. Those benefits aren’t unique to Yancey County, he said. ​“We’d like to see this be a pilot for us on what scalable microgrid technology could be across all of western North Carolina — and maybe the country.”

From disaster response to long-term resilience

The Double Island experience was common in the immediate aftermath of Helene. Across the region, communities isolated by closed roads and mountainous terrain turned to their fire departments for help.

That’s part of how Kristin Stroup got involved in the resilience hub effort. Based in Black Mountain, a popular tourist destination 15 miles east of Asheville, Stroup helped start a corps of volunteers who gathered at the town’s visitor center. In coordination with an emergency operations center based at Black Mountain’s main fire station, she led over 200 volunteers in doing whatever they could, from cooking and doling out food to making the country roads passable.

“People [were] just driving around the town with chain saws,” said Stroup, today a senior manager in energy and climate resilience with the nonprofit Appalachian Voices. The weekend after Helene hit, she said, ​“Footprint rolled into town with a bunch of solar panels. I became an instant part of their family.”

With founders who cut their teeth in international aid, the New Orleans–based Footprint Project had teamed up with the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, Greentech Renewables Raleigh, and others to pool donations of batteries, solar panels, and other equipment to deploy microgrids to dozens of sites in the region before the end of 2024. From Lake Junaluska to Linville Falls, recipients included fire stations such as the one in Double Island and an art collective in West Asheville.

By February 2025, Footprint had hired Trowbridge and another staff person to work in the area permanently. Footprint continued to cycle microgrid equipment throughout the region from its base of operations in Mars Hill, a tiny college town 20 miles north of Asheville that was virtually untouched by Helene. It launched the WNC Free Store, which donates solar panels and other supplies to residents still far from recovery — like those living out of RVs and school buses after losing their homes.

From the outset, Footprint had a critical local ally in Sara Nichols, the energy and economic development manager at the Land of Sky Regional Council, a local government partnership encompassing four counties that stretch from Tennessee to South Carolina.

“A lot of the other organizations we saw come through in the same way Footprint did, most of them did not stay. They leverage resources to do really important work, and when that work feels done, they go home,” Nichols said. ​“The fact that Footprint is working thoughtfully to figure out how our recovery and resiliency can be taken care of — while also thinking about their own organizational strategic growth — means a lot to me. They’ve been incredible partners.”

To be sure, assistance and rebuilding in the region are ongoing, and many systemic inequities exacerbated by the storm can’t be solved with a solar panel. But the power is back on. The cell towers are functioning. The roads are open. Piles of debris, from fallen limbs to moldy furniture, have been cleared. In relief parlance, western North Carolina is beginning to see ​“blue skies.”

That’s why it’s all the more important that Footprint, Appalachian Voices, and other local collaborators haven’t let up in their efforts. The web of organizations involved is thick and, seemingly, ever expanding. Last fall, the network announced it was deploying five resilience hubs around the region, including the Double Island project and a permanent microgrid at a community center in Yancey County.

“These projects, driven by a small group of determined partners, have accelerated Appalachia’s long-term resilience and preparedness,” Invest Appalachia, another nonprofit partner, said in a news release.

A burst of state funds to help expand resilience hubs in six counties

Now, the local public-private effort is getting a boost from the state of North Carolina. Under the administration of Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat who has made Helene recovery a centerpiece of his first-term agenda, the State Energy Office will deploy $5 million from the Biden-era Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to install up to 24 microgrids across six western counties impacted by Helene.

The money will also go to two mobile aid units for rural counties on either end of state — one in the east and one in the west. Dubbed ​“Beehives” by Footprint, these solar-powered portable units will be full of equipment that can be deployed to purify water, set up temporary microgrids, and otherwise respond to storms and extreme weather.

Expected recipients of the stationary microgrids could include first responders like the Double Island Fire Department and second responders like community centers. Peer-to-peer facilities and small businesses are also encouraged to apply.

Land of Sky and other stakeholders are choosing grantees on a rolling basis through next summer. There’s already been an inundation of applicants, and six grantees have been selected, including a community center about a dozen miles up the road from Double Island in Mitchell County. But organizers say they need more interest from outside the Land of Sky region, especially in Avery County, north of Yancey on the Tennessee border; and Rutherford County, east of Asheville, which includes Chimney Rock, a village that was infamously devastated by Helene and is slowly rebuilding.

Geographic distribution isn’t the only problem organizers have faced. Some entities — while undoubtedly deserving of assistance — aren’t appropriate for the government grant because they are located in areas at risk of future flooding.

“A battery underwater is not that useful,” Trowbridge said, ​“so if your site is in a floodplain, maybe this isn’t the right fit for you. But we definitely want you to know about the Beehive.”

“What we’re being tasked with as recipients of this money is to try and figure out how we make this a much bigger project,” she said. ​“That means we’ve brought in other partners like Invest Appalachia. We’ve been seeking other kinds of money. We’re using this state money to successfully build what could be a much more comprehensive resiliency hub model.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Hurricane-Helene-NC_GettyImages-2176579055.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=0618e3e51902a58bf47e16c7f3aec3ef,N,,2026-01-20 05:59:18.900399

Natural gas prices in the state rose 70% between 2020 and 2025, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and its residential electricity rates are the third highest in the country, behind only California and Hawaii. Some residents are making hard choices between paying their utility bills and buying food or health care necessities.

It is almost inevitable that the issue of affordability rather than climate change will dominate energy-policy conversations in the state — and throughout the high-priced New England region — this year.

“It’s going to be the focus for both Democrats and Republicans, those kitchen-table, pocketbook issues,” said Dan Dolan, president of trade group the New England Power Generators Association. ​“Both on the gas and the electric side, utility bill concerns are going to be front-of-mind.”

Massachusetts isn’t alone in this feeling. Across the nation, utility bills are rising far faster than inflation, and energy affordability is becoming a major political issue, propelling Democrats in several states to victory in last November’s elections. But in Massachusetts, sky-high bills are colliding with critical questions about the region’s future energy supply. The Trump administration has waged an unrelenting attack on the offshore wind developments the region was counting on to deliver new electricity, and has worsened the prospects for solar, too, by slashing tax incentives and grant programs.

“It’s supply and demand, and you’re taking away a lot of the supply that was going to be coming online in Massachusetts,” said James Van Nostrand, policy director at nonprofit organization The Future of Heat Initiative and the former chair of the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities. ​“How do you solve that?”

While everyone acknowledges the problem, there is far less consensus on what the root causes are or how to fix them. Some on both sides of the aisle blame the cost of building renewable energy and the transmission lines needed to carry it. Others point to volatile natural gas prices and the expense of replacing aging pipes. Third-party electricity suppliers that lure unsophisticated consumers into high-priced power contracts are also exacerbating matters, say many advocates. Utilities’ profit margins are under scrutiny as well.

For elected officials, the timing makes the conversation both more urgent and more complex: All six New England governors’ seats and more than 1,200 state legislator positions across the region will be up for election this fall.

A major part of the challenge is that there are more than two sides to the argument. Almost no one is advocating for a full return to fossil-fueled power plants or for a renewables-only grid. But the spaces in between are filled with permutations and possibilities that are difficult to sum up and sell. ​“Affordability” is being used to justify widely divergent energy proposals, including plans that opponents say could make the problem worse or which trade off climate goals in the name of bringing down costs.

“The long-term solutions are complicated and nuanced, and don’t lend themselves neatly to those political debates,” Dolan said.

Action underway in Massachusetts

Though Democrats control the Massachusetts legislature by vast margins, not everyone is on the same page about how to tackle the affordability crisis.

In March 2025, Gov. Maura Healey, a Democrat who is up for reelection, unveiled her energy-affordability agenda. It includes plans to create the state’s first discount rate for moderate-income households, expand tiered rates for low-income customers, and help residents access existing programs that could help them trim their bills. Two months later, she introduced a sprawling energy-affordability bill she said would save residents about $10 billion over the next 10 years through measures like reducing bill charges, making sure utilities don’t pass certain expenses on to customers, and removing barriers for nuclear development.

Last month, state utility regulators, at Healey’s request, opened an investigation into electricity and gas delivery costs, with an eye to determining if any charges can be removed, consolidated, or redesigned to save consumers money.

But in November, Democratic state Rep. Mark Cusack, House chair of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, countered Healey’s proposal with his own package that included many of the same provisions — alongside several that set off alarm bells in the clean-energy community.

The bill, which was approved by Cusack’s committee on a 7-0 vote, called for making the state’s 2030 emissions target nonbinding, slashing funding for energy-efficiency programming, and limiting climate and clean-energy initiatives that impact customers’ utility bills.

The existence of these provisions signals how far concerns about affordability have shifted the conversation in the state, said Paula García, senior manager of energy justice research and policy for the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“This thing of revisiting the climate commitments that the state has in place was not something that was being discussed at the beginning of last year,” she said.

Cusack’s bill, which is widely expected to be the vehicle for energy legislation this session, is now in the House Ways and Means Committee. The measure will be revised there before potentially advancing to a floor vote that could send it to the Senate.

Controlling the narrative

The bill’s final form will depend in large part on who can come up with a clean, compelling narrative to back their position, said advocates and observers. Some worry that efforts to paint energy efficiency and renewable energy as the culprits behind rising bills have gotten a head start.

“We allowed fossil-fuel interests to drive the narrative that it’s all those clean and green things,” Kyle Murray, director of state program implementation at the nonprofit Acadia Center. ​“Unfortunately, that’s what’s taken hold.”

The idea has a sort of commonsense allure: After all, energy bills have risen at the same time as Massachusetts has been increasing its focus on renewable energy development and expanding its energy-efficiency programming, so it’s not difficult to imagine a connection between these trends. The flames have been fanned by federal officials like Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who claims wind and solar are driving up costs for the states reliant on them.

Local renewable-energy opponents continue to push this interpretation of the affordability crisis. Last week, nonprofit Always On Energy Research released a report arguing that a switch to renewable power would cost New England up to $700 billion more by 2050 than leaning on natural gas or nuclear power plants. The analysis was sponsored by right-wing organizations, including the Yankee Institute, Fiscal Alliance Foundation, and Americans for Prosperity Foundation.

Murray called the report’s numbers ​“magical thinking, completely at odds with reality.” Acadia Center is attempting to counter that argument with a new series of explainers outlining its analysis of what is driving volatile energy prices, with a strong emphasis on the cost of natural gas and the benefits of renewables. Other advocates also say they will be working on educating lawmakers about the complex subject and urging them to keep up the push for clean energy.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2172092199.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=e4cc3931781b5cbfee1cc97b2d1eb7e8,N,,2026-01-20 05:58:37.885124

The US 800V electric vehicle architecture market size was valued at USD 1.13 billion in 2025. The market is expected to grow from USD 1.34 billion in 2026 to USD 9.92 billion in 2035 at a CAGR of 24.9%, according to latest report published by Global Market Insights Inc.

The demand for EVs with ultra-fast DC charging capabilities and longer ranges has increased from consumers, resulting in many OEMs implementing the Electric City (800 volts) architecture into their manufacturing processes to allow for less charging time and efficient energy usage. The consumer's need for relieving anxiousness regarding their range and provides convenience, created a push towards High-Voltage Systems and Ultra-Fast Charging stations that will be compatible with Next-Gen Electric Vehicle (NG-EV) products.

In 2025, Lucid Motors began shipping the Lucid Gravity SUV manufactured utilizing an 800-volt or higher electrical system that allows for very fast (i.e., 200 miles added to an EV in about 11 minutes on very fast CCS charging stations) and long-range (450 mile) capabilities. The introduction of the Gravity demonstrates an increasing trend of using high-voltage (800 volt or more) electrical systems in the American market for premium electric vehicles.

The three major manufacturers based out of the US i.e. Lucid Motors, Tesla Corporation, and Stellantis announced or started to introduce and increase production of 800-volt capable electric vehicle models that highlight the attributes of high-performance and the capability of being rapidly charged. In addition to providing consumers and OEM with better acceleration and Thermal Efficiency at 800V, these electric vehicles will support consumers and OEM in differentiating products in premium markets and increasing competitiveness.

In addition to EV market supplies being bolstered by federal government initiatives, such as the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program (NEVI) and the broader electrification policies included in the Inflation Reduction Act, which will support the development of EV's adoption as a whole, there will be an indirect increase in the Number of Manufacturers adopting 800V Systems with Ultra-Fast Charge Stations. The actions by federal authorities serve to eliminate or reduce barriers that prevent OEM's from pursuing high-voltage Electric Vehicle deployment.

By 2025, major automotive manufacturers entered expanded partnerships with manufacturers of Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Wide Bandgap (WBG) Semiconductor manufacturers to develop High-Voltage Power Electronics Together. The collaborations created by automotive manufacturers and semiconductor chip manufacturers has helped facilitate the building of supply chains for 800-V power modules and inverters that enable the support of rapid charging, greater efficiency, and advanced performance of EV powertrain systems.

US 800V Electric Vehicle Architecture Market Trends

Automakers are adopting 800V architectures in their vehicles to provide faster charging, higher efficiency and lower thermal losses for greater range and performance in both battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs).This trend is growing rapidly with auto manufacturers launching new vehicles and work with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) on the development of the next generation of high-voltage components.

In 2025, Lucid Motors began deliveries of the Lucid Gravity SUV, which is based on an 800 volt (or more) electrical system, allowing for ultra-fast charging (around 200 miles in around 11 minutes with high-power CCS chargers) and long range (around 450 miles). The Gravity is representative of the increasing use of high-voltage systems in premium, mass-market electric vehicles in the United States.

EV manufacturers are integrating silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductor devices into their inverters and DC-DC converters, they are optimizing efficiency and reducing overall weight of the systems. This trend is further enhancing the energy density, streamlining the overall system, and allowing the systems to utilize the industry's shift to lighter-weight, more compact, and thermally stable 800V architecture of EVs.

Charging networks are deploying ultra-fast chargers rated at 350 to 450 KW that can charge 800V EVs, thereby reducing the time for charging to around 15 to 20 minutes. This trend addresses range anxiety for consumers and continues to support OEM's accelerated rollout of EV programs in both urban and highway corridors.

The use of 800V architecture is now being extended beyond passenger vehicle applications to include commercial trucks, buses, and delivery vehicles. This trend reflects a broader electrification push across mobility segments, driven by sustainability targets and government incentives for low-emission fleets.

US 800V Electric Vehicle Architecture Market Analysis

Based on vehicle, the US 800V electric vehicle architecture market is divided passenger electric vehicles, commercial electric buses, commercial trucks and delivery vehicles and special purpose and off-highway vehicles. Passenger electric vehicles dominated the market, accounting for 74% in 2025 and are expected to grow at a CAGR of 24.4% through 2026 to 2035.

Electric vehicles (EVs) with an 800-volt architecture, are increasingly used for passenger transportation, with EVs having ultra-fast charging, longer range, and increased efficiency. In addition, automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have begun to make available BEVs with a focus on high performance and luxury. In contrast, most urban consumers prefer to purchase vehicles that are sustainable, connected, and energy efficient.

Electric bus manufacturers are integrating 800V systems to support high-capacity batteries, reduce charging downtime, and improve fleet efficiency. Many transit agencies are adopting zero-emission buses to help achieve regulatory requirements and reduce their operating costs by establishing fast-charging depots and optimizing their operations in urban and rural intercity areas.

High-voltage architectures for trucks and delivery vehicles enable quicker charging times, greater payload efficiency, and longer operational ranges. Fleet operators are increasingly deploying BEVs and PHEVs capable of 800 volts for their last-mile logistics and regional logistics due to sustainability goals as well as cost-efficiency. In addition, stricter emissions regulations have led fleet operators to deploy many of these zero-emission vehicles along major logistical corridors in the US.

Industries such as construction, mining, and agriculture are actively adopting 800-volts to produce highly powerful, thermally efficient electric vehicles with reduced emissions. As environmental regulations become stricter and the need for more sustainability-related initiatives and operationally efficient vehicles continues to evolve, the adoption of 800-volt architectures in niche industrial vehicle segments is likely to continue growing at a steady rate.

Southeast Asia has become one of the most closely watched regions for corporate clean energy deals. As data centers and manufacturing investments spread across the region, global companies are increasingly looking for ways to secure renewable power alongside their expansion plans. The demand is there, but the pathways are still taking shape. Rules differ from market to market, timelines are uneven, and developers often find themselves working with frameworks that are evolving in real time.

These conditions are familiar to Shizen Energy, which has been operating across several Southeast Asian markets after expanding from Japan. Speaking with Rei Ushikubo, Head of Carbon Free Solutions, the focus is on practical considerations: how to gauge the maturity of local regulations, how to work with on-the-ground partners, and how to match project development timelines with corporate demand. That approach is illustrated in Shizen’s first major corporate power purchase agreement (PPA) in the region.

Structuring the Google deal as rules evolve

The PPA between Google and the Consortium formed by Shizen Energy, Solarvest and HSS Engineering in Malaysia offers a close look at how large corporate renewable energy deals are taking shape in Southeast Asia. Signed under Malaysia’s Corporate Green Power Programme (CGPP), the agreement covers a 29.99 MW solar project in Kedah state, with commercial operations expected to begin in 2027.

From the start, the project developed alongside a regulatory framework that was still being refined. CGPP was relatively new when discussions began, and several implementation details continued to evolve during negotiations. “We need to keep following those regulations, and then consider the key terms on the buyer side, like Google,” said Ushikubo.

For this type of large-scale solar project, Ushikubo noted that the construction timeline is roughly comparable to that of a data center, allowing the project to be ready to supply power as demand comes online.

While Malaysia’s power system differs from Japan’s, Ushikubo said the core principles of structuring a long-term corporate PPA, such as risk allocation, remain familiar. Where the difference emerges is in how policy frameworks shape cost over time. CGPP was introduced as a capped virtual PPA program, allowing corporate buyers to purchase renewable energy attributes without physical power delivery. The program’s quota was fully subscribed by late 2023, with Shizen’s Google project among the approved capacity.

For future projects, the policy context has shifted with the introduction of CRESS. Following CGPP, the Corporate Renewable Energy Supply Scheme (CRESS) expands access through physical electricity supply via the grid under Malaysia’s third party access framework. While the scheme removes quota limits and supports larger project sizes, wheeling charges are not fixed for the entire contract period and may be adjusted every few years. Ushikubo said this adds another layer of consideration for future projects, requiring both buyers and developers to factor potential cost changes into long-term project planning.

Local partners help bridge government communication

Beyond regulatory design, execution depends heavily on who is involved on the ground. The Google PPA also marks Shizen Energy’s first utility scale solar project in Malaysia. The project is developed by a consortium led by Shizen, in partnership with local renewable energy firm Solarvest and construction firm HSS Engineering. Ushikubo noted that local partners provide essential connections with corporate buyers and government stakeholders, while Shizen contributes experience gained from previous PPA projects in Japan. “From our side, what we can contribute is our track record in PPA, so we transferred that experience to the local market,” she said.

In Japan, Shizen Energy has executed a total of 100 MW of long-term renewable energy PPAs with Microsoft, covering four solar projects.

Aside from partnerships, Shizen’s internal teams also reflect a mix of Japanese and local talent. According to Ushikubo, most members of the Malaysia team are Malaysian. This bilingual and multicultural setup extends to the company’s broader structure as well, with roughly half of the management team made up of non-Japanese executives.

Regional differences and Thailand’s DPPA potential

“We try to expand more, especially in Malaysia, because its regulations are a little bit more advanced than other countries,” said Ushikubo. Resource availability, grid readiness, and regulatory clarity differ from country to country, shaping what types of projects are feasible and how quickly foreign companies like Shizen can move forward. Malaysia stands out for having clearer off-site PPA mechanisms, which has made it a practical entry point for larger corporate deals.

Shizen also has operating assets in Vietnam and Indonesia, including 21 MW of onshore wind and 35 MW of solar in Vietnam, as well as rooftop solar projects in both countries. Across these markets, solar remains the most readily deployable option in the near term, driven by lower costs and shorter construction timelines compared with wind or hydro.

Thailand occupies a slightly different position. Having been based in Thailand five years ago, Ushikubo offered a first-hand perspective on how the country’s corporate green power needs have evolved. From a resource standpoint, Thailand is well suited for solar, and rooftop installations have already been widely adopted by manufacturers. The government is now turning its attention toward off-site procurement, including a planned 2 GW direct power purchase agreement (DPPA) pilot program targeting data centers.

While the pilot DPPA signal could open new opportunities for developers like Shizen, concerns over grid stability and curtailment remain central to policy discussions. Thai authorities have been cautious about balancing variable renewable energy with system reliability, contributing to delays in finalizing detailed rules. For Shizen, this has meant closely monitoring regulatory signals while preparing for clearer frameworks to emerge.

At the same time, Ushikubo noted that corporate buyers are increasingly seeking more diversified power profiles to better align with round-the-clock electricity demand, as solar generation presents challenges related to the power curve. “But it really depends on the timing of the power available and the pricing. It depends on the balance of those factors,” she said, adding that despite these limitations, solar remains the most commonly pursued option due to its cost advantages.

24/7 carbon-free energy becomes realistic in Southeast Asia

As corporate buyers look beyond annual matching, attention is shifting toward hour to hour carbon free electricity. In August 2025, Shizen joined the 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy Compact, an international initiative led by the United Nations aimed at achieving clean energy supply 24 hours a day, seven days a week. For Southeast Asia, Ushikubo said the goal of 24/7 carbon free energy is becoming increasingly realistic as battery prices continue to fall.

Five years ago, Ushikubo recalled, battery systems were still too expensive to be meaningfully paired with most solar projects. As costs have declined, solar plus battery configurations are now being considered for larger utility scale developments, particularly projects in the 20 to 50 MW range. Co-located battery energy storage systems can help smooth output and extend the availability of solar power beyond daylight hours, making them a more relevant option for corporates pursuing 24/7 carbon-free energy commitments.

Recent analysis from energy think tank Ember suggests that battery costs have fallen to levels where dispatchable solar is becoming economically feasible. Across global markets outside China and the United States, the total capital expenditure for a large, long-duration utility-scale battery project now averages around USD 125/kWh.

The cost decline is expected to continue. Core battery equipment prices fell by 40% in 2024 compared with the previous year, reaching a record low of USD 165/kWh, according to BloombergNEF. Over the past decade, installed battery costs have fallen by an average of 20% per year, accompanied by rapid growth in global deployment.

Even so, Ushikubo cautioned that the business case remains selective. “The battery price is coming down rapidly, but I cannot say it is one hundred percent economic yet,” Ushikubo said, adding that deployment decisions ultimately hinge on balancing cost, system design, and customer expectations. In practice, feasibility still depends on how much of a premium corporate buyers are willing to pay, how systems are designed, and whether project timelines align with demand. For now, batteries are not a universal solution yet, but an increasingly viable option under the right conditions.

Playing coordinator role in Southeast Asia green power market

Looking ahead, Ushikubo described Shizen’s role in Southeast Asia less in terms of scale or speed, and more in terms of coordination. As corporate renewable energy demand expands across the region, she sees persistent gaps between global expectations and local market realities, particularly when it comes to contract structures and regulatory interpretation.

Shizen Energy often finds itself operating between different sets of stakeholders. Global technology companies bring experience from more mature PPA markets in the United States and Europe, while local developers and utilities work within regulatory frameworks that are still evolving, said Ushikubo. Shizen’s contribution lies in navigating these intersections. Drawing on its experience in Japan and Malaysia, the company works with local partners to translate corporate procurement requirements into projects that can be structured, financed, and executed within local systems.

Following the Google project, Ushikubo said interest from technology companies continues to build, though timing and regulatory readiness remain key considerations. “If there is any opportunity to collaborate together, we are open to discuss it anytime,” she said.

This outlook mirrors the broader state of Southeast Asia’s clean energy transition. Demand is rising, ambition is clear, but pathways remain in flux. For developers operating across the region, progress is often less about moving quickly than about staying engaged, reading policy signals carefully, and working within systems that are still taking shape. As Shizen’s experience suggests, navigating Southeast Asia’s clean energy markets is not about waiting for perfect conditions, but about learning how to move forward while the rules are still being written.",https://www.reccessary.com/data/features/meta/1768794361955627581.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 05:58:51.689377

One thing to note: Although fertilizer prices are increasing, we are still below the extreme peaks we saw back in 2022.
The big takeaway for producers is that there is uncertainty in these markets, and input costs are volatile.","*This is the next article in our 2026 Southwest Economic Outlook series. Economists from Texas A&M University and Texas A&M AgriLife Extension, and Oklahoma State University and Oklahoma State University Extension provide a 2026 outlook on various topics and commodities. A digital copy of the Economic Outlook Issue is also available online.

Increasing input costs, along with low commodity prices, proved to be a signifi­cant challenge for producers in 2025. Unfor­tunately, it is likely that we could see some of these challenges continue into 2026.

Last year between April and September, the price of potash and nitrogen fertilizer increased by roughly 15%, and phosphate price increased by almost 19%. Forecasting long-term prices is difficult, but we can look at big-picture issues such as energy costs, tariffs and geopolitical conflicts to get an idea of what might be coming in 2026.

Energy costs are generally a strong pre­dictor for fertilizer prices. The correlation of energy prices with fertilizer prices is not as strong for those that depend more on mining and other inputs, such as phos­phate and potash. However, natural gas is a major input for nitrogen fertilizer pro­duction. When the cost of energy sources like natural gas increase, the baseline cost of producing common nitrogen fertilizers, such as ammonia, urea and urea ammo­nium nitrate (UAN) also increases.

The price of natural gas climbed quite a bit in the final weeks of 2025, which could lead to higher prices for nitrogen fertilizers at the start of the 2026 season. In its November 2025 Short-Term Energy Outlook, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected an average Henry Hub natural gas price of $4 per million Btu in 2026, which is about 16% above the pro­jected average price for 2025.

Fertilizer markets (along with other input markets) are directly affected by trade and policy actions. Tariffs and sanctions applied to major fertilizer exporters, such as Russia and Belarus, shifted those supplies to other markets.

China is another major fertilizer sup­plier, exporting more than 30% more fertilizer in the first five months of 2025 compared with 2024. But Chinese restrictions on phosphate and urea exports early last year had an impact on global avail­ability of those products, driving fertilizer prices up. China has since lifted those re­strictions a bit, but one of the uncertainties we face is that these policies can change with very little notice.

Most U.S. nitrogen and phosphate im­ports have been subject to at least a 10% to 15% tariff since April. According to the modified Executive Order 14257, tariffs on key fertilizer imports such as urea and UAN have been lifted, effective Nov. 13, which should alleviate some of the disrup­tion in typical trade patterns.

Suspension of U.S. tariffs on most fer­tilizer imports would likely ease costs for farmers, but further changes in policy and trade war actions would drive prices back up.

Demand plays an important role as well, driven by production and profitability. With producers facing weaker crop revenues and increased input costs, the fertil­izer-to-crop-price ratio is historically high. So not only is fertilizer more expensive, but it is also more expensive relative to the crops it helps produce. This could lead to changes in fertilizer application rates, shifts in crop rotation and, though unlikely, a slight de­crease in fertilizer demand.

One thing to note: Although fertilizer prices are increasing, we are still below the extreme peaks we saw back in 2022. We’re seeing the biggest increase in phosphate fertilizers, while nitrogen prices have been swinging a bit more.

The big takeaway for producers is that there is uncertainty in these markets, and input costs are volatile. It is important to consider long-term effects of changing fertilizer use based on current prices. Additionally, there are benefits to working closely with local retailers, agronomists and other experts who monitor local market conditions.

Profit margins for farmers in 2026 could be tight, and it will be prudent to scrutinize every dollar spent on inputs. But skimping to the point of yield loss is a false economy.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt2845192cd6494af7/67619c1cac78dc476404a1e2/swfp-shelley-huguley-fertilizer-close.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-20 03:58:45.716767

DC, UNITED STATES, January 19, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ -- To reduce and stabilize energy prices for American families that have increased 25% to 30% since January 2021, the Trump Administration has announced a bipartisan agreement urging PJM to implement an “emergency power auction” that would require technology giants to fund approximately $15 billion in new power plant construction across the PJM grid region. This initiative reflects common sense conservative governance: those who benefit from infrastructure should bear its cost.

Energy costs have increased Since 2021 due to Biden era inflation increases in fuel, equipment and labor costs that have been passed on to consumers. In addition, Utilities have faced huge costs to replace aging power plants, transmission lines, new government regulations, and grid components, with supply chain issues making these upgrades even more expensive.

Now with the United States leading the way on Artificial Intelligence (AI), there are major new demands from data centers (AI), electric vehicles, and manufacturing - outstripping supply growth and pushing prices up. President Trump feels those who benefit from this economic boom should cover the costs of energy demands for data centers.

""Energy security paid for by the companies that benefit from it, not hard-working American families, is the premise of the Trump Administrations action last week,"" said Sarah Hunt, President, Rainey Center. She continued, ""We commend President Trump for his leadership in ensuring that companies benefiting from infrastructure contribute to its funding through a competitive auction.”

Not only could this bi-partisan initiative help reduce and stabilize energy prices long term, the initiative aims to result in billions in new domestic power generation, strengthening American energy security and independence.

Sarah Hunt concluded, ""The Trump Administration's direction to PJM to initiate an emergency power auction demonstrates that pro-growth policies and consumer protection are not mutually exclusive. By leveraging market mechanisms, this initiative protects American families from bearing the cost of Silicon Valley's AI expansion while ensuring continued investment in domestic energy infrastructure.

According to The Guardian, Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, and Food and Water Watch joined a plethora of local organizations around the country in calling for a ban on new data centers, which comes amid growing backlash to the AI boom and soaring energy prices.

""I've been amazed by the groundswell of grassroots, bipartisan opposition to this, in all types of communities across the U.S.,"" Emily Wurth, managing director of organizing at Food and Water Watch, said, per the publication.

""Everyone is affected by this, the opposition has been across the political spectrum. A lot of people don't see the benefits coming from AI and feel they will be paying for it with their energy bills and water.

Wurth pointed to ""outrageous utility price rises"" as a major concern, adding that this is ""something Americans really do care about."" Households can guard against rising energy costs by investing in solar energy. The technology can significantly reduce electricity costs, even reaching $0.

TCD's Solar Explorer can help you get started, connecting you with vetted installers and potentially saving up to $10,000 on solar installations.

As the tech industry has pumped more and more money into AI — incorporating their large language models and generative systems into everything from your email account to web searches to home appliances — they've needed to build new, massive data centers that consume incredible amounts of power a day.

That demand for power has increased energy prices by an average of 13% in much of the U.S., and it has forced power companies to rely more heavily on polluting energy sources like oil, natural gas, and coal to meet those needs.

But the impact doesn't stop there.

Data centers run extremely hot and need water to stay operational. According to projections, AI data centers alone will need 6.4 trillion gallons of water to function by 2027, and all of that water comes directly from the stores people rely on in day-to-day life.

The swift increase in data centers could see 44 million tons of carbon pollution added to the atmosphere by 2030, according to The Guardian.

""The rapid, largely unregulated rise of data centers to fuel the AI and crypto frenzy is disrupting communities across the country and threatening Americans' economic, environmental, climate and water security,"" the organizations said in their letter.

It's unclear whether the pushback against data centers from these organizations will have a significant impact, but it is the latest sign that people are starting to question their use and the power demands they create, even as they continue to be built around the world.

In the meantime, homeowners can use TCD's Solar Explorer to switch to solar energy and drive down their monthly bills. The upfront costs of solar panels can be prohibitive for some, but Palmetto's LightReach solar leasing program offers $0-down options that can reduce utility rates by 20%.

Over the past year, the Republican president has rolled out numerous pro‑fossil fuel measures and offered strong support for U.S. oil firms abroad, a sharp departure from his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden’s focus on combating climate change.

Within hours of taking office, Trump declared a national energy emergency, opening the way to relaxed environmental rules and expanded drilling permits on federal land and in Alaska. He also quickly lifted Biden’s freeze on permitting new liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and sped up project approvals.

The policies are set to reinforce America’s status as the world's largest oil and gas producer. U.S. crude oil and liquids production is projected to hit a record of nearly 24 million barrels per day in 2026, accounting for 22% of global supply, according to the Energy Information Administration, opens new tab.

What’s more, the U.S. in 2025 became the first country to export more than 100 million metric tons of LNG in a single year, powered by production from new plants.

But the industry’s early enthusiasm for Trump’s “drill, baby, drill!” ethos has been tempered by his push for low energy prices and his appeals to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase output. OPEC+, which includes Russia, sharply raised production targets throughout the year, sending U.S. benchmark crude to a near five‑year low of $55 a barrel in mid‑December.

The price drop, and expectations of a future global supply glut, pushed U.S. drillers to scale back operations, with the domestic oil rig count falling 15% over the past year, according to energy service provider Baker Hughes(BKR.O), opens new tab . That pullback is set to slow the pace of U.S. output growth this year and next.

ENERGY DOMINO

At the same time, Trump has used America’s oil and gas strength to advance his “energy dominance” agenda and the so‑called Donroe doctrine, his rebranding of a 19th‑century principle asserting U.S. influence over the Americas.

The administration has wielded its oil and LNG wealth in negotiations intended to narrow trade imbalances with dozens of countries. Some counterparties, such as the European Union, have agreed to aggressive and unrealistic supply commitments that risk making buyers wary of depending heavily on the U.S. for vital energy.

The centrality of oil in Trump's strategy was made crystal clear when U.S. forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in early January on drug trafficking charges, prompting Trump to quickly announce that Washington would indefinitely take control of the oil riches of a country home to the world’s largest proven reserves – some 300 billion barrels.

In a televised White House meeting with oil executives on January 9, Trump declared that his administration would soon name the companies that will be asked to invest a combined $100 billion to rebuild Venezuela's derelict oil industry.

But it is far from clear if top companies such as Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), opens new tab or Chevron (CVX.N), opens new tab would commit to investing heavily in the Latin American country, given immense political and economic risks and long‑standing doubts about the attractiveness of developing its oil resources.

Exxon CEO Darren Woods underscored this at the White House meeting, calling Venezuela “un-investable” and citing the company’s history of being forced out of the country twice in recent decades.

Trump bristled at Woods’s remarks, calling them “too cute,” adding later that he was inclined to keep Exxon out of the country.

Defying Trump therefore risks meaningful backlash.

THE BEAR HUG

Venezuela may become a template for Trump’s broader use of U.S. oil companies as geopolitical instruments.

He could, for example, attempt to draw them into Russia as part of a sweeping deal to end Moscow’s nearly four‑year-long full‑scale invasion of Ukraine.

But deeper government involvement in commercial decision‑making carries major risks for the financial integrity of these firms.

More broadly, the growing volatility of U.S. politics – under both Democrats and Republicans – poses increasing risks for the industry, as successive administrations reverse or discard their predecessors’ policies, particularly those enacted through executive orders rather than legislation.

In short, the more friendly Trump’s policies are towards the oil sector today, the greater risk there is of significant whiplash if an environmentally focused administration comes into office.

Trump’s embrace of the oil industry was widely welcomed after what many companies viewed as Biden’s relative hostility. But his strongman style risks turning that warm embrace into a bear hug.

HMGMA, located in Georgia, sold 62,000 vehicles last year, according to Hyundai Motor Group on Tuesday. The plant began pilot production in 2024 and is the group’s key EV production hub in the United States.

Production and sales began in earnest in December 2024 with 1,006 units, and the plant currently manufactures two models: the Ioniq 5, a compact electric SUV, and the Ioniq 9, a full-size electric SUV. All vehicles produced at HMGMA are intended for the U.S. domestic market.

Industry experts say the figures are relatively strong given shifting U.S. policies on EVs.

In October last year, U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration eliminated tax credits for EV purchases, delivering a blow to sales. While some impact was unavoidable, HMGMA still managed to post over 8,000 units in both April and May 2025, though sales dropped to around 3,000 units in December that year.

The Federation of Korean Industries previously projected that the policy change could reduce Hyundai Motor Group’s U.S. EV sales by as many as 45,000 units annually.

To diversify its offerings, Hyundai Motor Group plans to begin producing its first hybrid model at HMGMA — the Kia Sportage HEV — in the first half of this year. The move is part of a strategy to use hybrids as a bridge across the so-called EV “chasm,” a period of demand stagnation.

Starting in 2028, the company also plans to deploy its humanoid robot Atlas — unveiled at CES 2026 — at HMGMA. The robot will begin with relatively simple tasks like parts sorting, gradually expanding into assembly and other manufacturing work.

Hyundai Motor Group aims to expand HMGMA’s current annual production capacity of 300,000 units to as many as 500,000.

Including output from its other U.S. facilities — Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama and Kia Georgia — the group plans to raise total local production to over 1.2 million units in the future.

The administration announced last month it was suspending leases for at least 90 days on five East Coast offshore wind projects because of national security concerns. Its announcement did not reveal specifics about those concerns.

Developers and states sued in an effort to block the order. Dominion Energy Virginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, was the first.

In federal court in Virginia on Friday, a judge said he was granting the Richmond-based company’s request for a preliminary injunction, according to the record from the hearing. This allows construction to resume while Dominion Energy’s lawsuit challenging the government’s order proceeds.

In federal court for the District of Columbia, judges ruled last week that construction could also resume on the Empire Wind project for New York by Norwegian company Equinor, and the Revolution Wind project for Rhode Island and Connecticut, by Danish company Orsted.

President Donald Trump has targeted offshore wind from his first days back in the White House. White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said last week that Trump has been clear that “wind energy is the scam of the century.” Rogers said the pause is meant to protect the national security of the American people, and “we look forward to ultimate victory on the issue.”

Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond Law School professor who has been following the lawsuits, said the three judges essentially concluded that the government did not show that the national security risk is so imminent that construction must halt.

“They concluded that Trump’s effort to halt the important, but costly, projects lacked support and would injure the entities building them, so the projects must be permitted to proceed,” Tobias said.

Sean McGarvey, president of North America’s Building Trades Unions, applauded the court rulings, which enable union workers to return to the job sites.

“With energy demand surging and prices spiking, the last thing our government should do is take any form of power generation offline,” McGarvey said in a statement. “The men and women of NABTU are proud to be constructing every offshore wind project in the United States, all under strong project labour agreements. These rulings mean our members can get back to work and keep affordable, clean, reliable power moving to our communities.”

Large, ocean-based wind farms are the linchpin of plans to shift to renewable energy in East Coast states that have limited land for onshore wind turbines or solar arrays. Orsted is also suing over the pause of its Sunrise Wind project for New York.

The fifth paused project is Vineyard Wind, under construction in Massachusetts. Vineyard Wind LLC, a joint venture between Avangrid and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, joined the rest of the developers in challenging the administration on Thursday. They filed a complaint in District Court in Boston.

Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind has been under construction since early 2024. It will consist of 176 offshore wind energy turbines providing enough electricity to power about 660,000 homes.

Dominion Energy argued that the government’s order is “arbitrary and capricious” and unconstitutional. It said after the hearing that it will now focus on restarting work to ensure the project can begin delivering critical energy in just weeks. It says the project is essential to meet dramatically growing energy needs driven by dozens of new data centers.

Virginia’s U.S. senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, along with U.S. Reps. Bobby Scott and Jennifer McClellan, said in a joint statement that the ruling is a victory for the state’s residents, who otherwise “would face increased energy costs as a result of the Trump administration’s shortsighted opposition to clean energy.”

Trump has dismissed offshore wind developments as ugly, but the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project is about 27 miles (43 kilometers) off the shores of Virginia Beach.

Amount of Driving When considering whether or not to switch to an EV, the first thing to consider is how much you drive, according to Justin Fischer, EV automotive analyst and expert at CarEdge.
“The more you drive, the more you can save with an EV,” Fischer said.
“Renting (or subscribing, through a service like Eon) removes the long-term financial risk of battery depreciation, tariffs or maintenance surprises,” Vardi explained.
“People can experience all the benefits and cost-savings of EV driving without locking themselves into a purchase during an uncertain market.","There’s a lot of reasons to buy a new car, but what are some of the indicators that it is time to change over to an electric vehicle (EV) rather than buying a traditional gas-fueled car? Turns out, there are plenty of clues, most of which include how much money you are spending at the shop and how many miles you are racking up on the road.

Here are five key signs switching to an EV will save you money.

Amount of Driving

When considering whether or not to switch to an EV, the first thing to consider is how much you drive, according to Justin Fischer, EV automotive analyst and expert at CarEdge.

“The more you drive, the more you can save with an EV,” Fischer said. “This is especially true for urban commuters, who stand to benefit from greater fuel savings in stop-and-go traffic. For drivers who either spend excessive time in traffic, or drive at least 10,000 miles per year, an EV will save you much more money, making it more likely that the math will work out in your favor.”

Charging Locations

Fischer highlighted that another key consideration is where you’ll be charging your electric vehicle.

“If you’ll be able to charge at home or work, it’s very likely that you’ll save money with an EV,” Fischer explained, adding that public fast charging is expensive, with prices ranging from 35 cents per kiloWatt-hour (kWh) to north of 65 cents per kWh. “Per mile driven, public charging is often more expensive than gas, depending on your local gas prices.”

Maintenance Costs

If your car is prone to needing repairs and costly maintenance, an EV’s maintenance costs provide even more savings, according to Joe Giranda, director of sales and marketing at CFR Classic.

“Over three years, an owner could save between $500 to $700 by not having to pay for oil changes, transmission servicing and exhaust repairs,” Giranda explained. “EVs stay longer on the road with fewer maintenance requirements, fewer moving parts, and the absence of a combustion engine.”

Societal Benefits

Government incentives and rebates can lower the upfront cost of EVs pointed out Rei Vardi, CEO and founder of Eon, sustainability-focused platform for EV car-sharing and rental space

“Consumers are also increasingly motivated by sustainability, and driving electric is one of the most impactful choices for reducing personal carbon emissions,” Vardi added.

Flexible Usage

Even with shifting incentives and rising costs, Vardi noted that many drivers are realizing that owning a car outright isn’t the only way to drive electric.

“Renting (or subscribing, through a service like Eon) removes the long-term financial risk of battery depreciation, tariffs or maintenance surprises,” Vardi explained. “People can experience all the benefits and cost-savings of EV driving without locking themselves into a purchase during an uncertain market. Flexibility is becoming its own form of savings.”

As a clean and reliable resource, nuclear energy aligns well with carbon-neutral objectives and the significant load requirements of data centers and other energy-intensive users.

Combined with vocal federal support and access to federal tax incentives established under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) and extended by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), nuclear power is well positioned to play a larger role in the US energy market. Following a series of strong federal policy signals, market confidence in nuclear offtake has increased, with renewed interest in long-term procurement emerging from technology companies scaling data centers.

Headlines have focused on the life extension of existing light-water reactor (LWR) nuclear plants and the commercial advancement of small modular reactors (SMRs). Such projects are often supported by long-term data center offtake agreements or federal guarantees, and economics have been further strengthened by the availability of production tax credits (PTCs) and investment tac credits (ITCs) enacted under the IRA.

In Depth

Existing nuclear plants: Section 45U PTC

To discourage retirement of existing nuclear facilities, the IRA added Section 45U (the zero-emission nuclear power PTC) to the Internal Revenue Code.

Section 45U provides an income tax credit for electricity that is (i) produced at a qualified nuclear power facility and (ii) sold to an unrelated person during the period from December 31, 2023, through January 1, 2033. A ""qualified nuclear power facility"" is one that was placed in service before enactment of the IRA and uses nuclear energy to generate electricity.

The credit is calculated by:

Multiplying the number of megawatt-hours of electricity produced and sold during the taxable year by 0.3 cents (as adjusted annually for inflation)

Subtracting the applicable ""reduction amount""

Multiplying the result by five if prevailing wage requirements are satisfied.

The reduction amount is the lesser of (i) the total credit amount otherwise available or (ii) 16% of the excess (if any) of gross receipts from electricity sales over a benchmark price of 2.5 cents per kilowatt-hour (adjusted for inflation). As a practical matter, no credit is available when the electricity sales price equals or exceeds approximately $43.75 per megawatt-hour.

New nuclear projects: Sections 45Y and 48E

The IRA also introduced Sections 45Y (the clean electricity PTC) and 48E (the clean electricity ITC) for electricity-generation facilities that achieve a zero-greenhouse-gas emissions rate. For facilities to qualify, they must be placed in service after December 31, 2024.

Proposed US Department of the Treasury regulations confirm that facilities using nuclear fission or fusion technologies are eligible for either the PTC under Section 45Y or the ITC under Section 48E (but generally not both). Project owners must elect which credit to claim.

If prevailing wage requirements are satisfied:

The Section 48E ITC equals 30% of a project's qualified basis.

The Section 45Y PTC equals $15 per megawatt-hour of electricity generated, subject to annual inflation adjustments.

Both credits may be increased through additional ""adders"" if the facility is located in an energy community and/or meets domestic content requirements.

Importantly, ITCs under Section 48E and PTCs under Sections 45U and 45Y may be transferred for cash to unrelated taxpayers, providing flexibility for developers that cannot fully utilize the credits themselves.

Financing outlook

Public sentiment toward nuclear power has shifted meaningfully in many regions, with increasing recognition of (and enthusiasm for!) its potential to meet growing electricity demand. While significant hurdles remain, particularly development and construction capital intensity, the availability of federal tax credits for existing facilities and new SMR projects materially improves project feasibility.

As the policy landscape continues to evolve, the OBBBA's enactment in July 2025 stands out as a pivotal moment for the nuclear sector. US Congress ultimately chose not to alter the Section 45U PTCs, a notable decision given earlier legislative drafts that sought to accelerate its repeal. While this inaction may appear uneventful, it is telling: The decision to leave nuclear untouched, even as wind, solar, and hydrogen incentives were substantially pared back, signals a firm and deliberate endorsement of nuclear energy's long‑term role in the US energy mix. The legislation goes a step further by introducing a new nuclear‑specific energy community bonus for facilities located in metropolitan statistical areas with historical ties to nuclear employment, underscoring policymakers' intention to support the technology and the communities that have sustained it. Together, these measures position nuclear power to play an increasingly consequential role in US energy's future.

In the near term, LWR projects benefiting from long operating histories and proven technology are likely to remain the most financeable component of a nuclear resurgence. At the same time, interest from offtakers in advanced reactor technologies, including SMRs, continues to grow.

Any large-scale nuclear development will require innovative financial structures. These projects are likely to involve a combination of common equity, preferred equity, multiple debt tranches, and tax credit monetization, all within a complex regulatory framework that demands careful and sophisticated structuring.

The ASEAN Power Grid represents more than an techno-economic solution to pressing power market challenges.","Southeast Asia is entering a decisive stage in its energy transition. As energy demand grows, governments are looking for ways to deliver affordable, reliable and clean electricity to homes, businesses and industries. One long-standing initiative offers a practical path forward: the ASEAN Power Grid (APG).

Energy connectivity is an important part of decarbonizing the region’s power systems. The International Energy Agency estimates that countries around the world need to double investments in power grids to meet climate targets. The APG aims to link all ASEAN Member States into a single, integrated system by 2045. By facilitating cross-border electricity trade, this will strengthen energy security and reliability, maximize renewable energy potential and, and create a larger and more stable market for power in the region.

The idea of a regional power grid first emerged in the mid-1980s. Since then, ASEAN has taken a phased approach, beginning with bilateral and sub-regional connections. These links provide the foundation for more advanced, multilateral electricity trade in the future.

A key example is the Lao PDR–Thailand–Malaysia–Singapore Power Integration Project (LTMS-PIP), which sends hydropower from Lao PDR to its neighbors. In 2023, ASEAN announced another initiative, the Brunei–Indonesia–Malaysia–Philippines Power Integration Project (BIMP-PIP), linking the eastern sub-region. Singapore has also signed agreements to import 7.3 gigawatts of clean energy from neighbouring countries in the region.

These initiatives show that the benefits of power trade are well recognized. Countries with limited renewable resources can buy clean electricity, while those with an abundance can earn from exports. Regional connectivity also makes it easier to balance variable sources like wind and solar across wider areas.

Recent studies suggest that linking power systems could cut the cost of Southeast Asia’s decarbonization by US$800 billion. Shared infrastructure means countries would need to invest less in local generation and storage capacity, which is valuable in a region where financing remains a challenge.

Beyond the financial case, there is a broader story to tell. “To encourage stakeholders to look beyond the techno-economic advantages of the APG, it's essential to highlight the long-term sustainability and just transition benefits that a more integrated grid can offer,” shares Matthew David Wittenstein, Chief of the Energy Connectivity Section at the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).

Matthew further points to the importance of showing how the APG can help deliver Sustainable Development Goal 7 in the region as well as address the energy trilemma: affordability, reliability and sustainability, especially for underserved communities in the region.

This broader view is being built into regional planning. ESCAP’s Green Power Corridor Framework offers principles and metrics to align projects with the Sustainable Development Goals. A new “Green Power Corridor Playbook” is also being developed to provide a practical guide for putting energy connectivity into action in ways that promote inclusive growth, social equity and climate resilience. It will include tools for assessing economic, environmental and social impacts, along with recommendations for policies and best practices.

Progress toward cross-border power integration is not without challenges. Many countries still focus on national energy priorities. Some place the greatest importance on security of supply, while others focus on affordability or sustainability. Ensuring that the benefits are fairly shared is essential, particularly for smaller economies. Regional cooperation could help with investment access and technology transfer so that all countries can participate fully.

The ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation (APAEC) guides regional efforts. Its next phase, starting in 2025, will place stronger emphasis on energy connectivity. Combined with ESCAP’s Regional Roadmap for Power System Connectivity and the ASEAN Centre for Energy’s (ACE) Roadmap for Multilateral Power Trade, these present an opportunity to outline crucial steps forward and better align national plans with regional and global goals.

Building the skills and knowledge to support integration is another priority. ESCAP is partnering with ACE, Clean, Affordable and Secure Energy for Southeast Asia (CASE) and the Southeast Asia Energy Transition Partnership (ETP-UNOPS) under the ASEAN Power Grid Advancement Program, which will aim to roll out sub-regional pilot projects for multilateral power trade in 2026 and beyond.

ESCAP is also working closely with the ASEAN Energy Regulators’ Network (AERN), the ASEAN Secretariat, and ETP-UNOPS to establish the ASEAN School of Regulation. The school will offer structured training, peer learning and research to support power system integration and regulatory harmonization. Its first summer programme in September 2025 involved both policymakers and young professionals, with a focus on increasing the participation of women in the energy sector.

The long-term value of the APG lies in its ability to deliver a range of benefits beyond the energy sector. New transmission corridors can bring development opportunities especially for rural areas, improve access to markets, education and health care, and support local economic growth. Adding 30 gigawatts of solar and wind capacity could create around 182,000 jobs in manufacturing, installation and maintenance. Cleaner power would help reduce air pollution, with studies suggesting power connectivity could prevent up to 15,000 pollution-induced deaths every year .

“By framing the APG as a regional development tool, rather than just a technical infrastructure project, we can expand its appeal to a broader group of stakeholders,” adds Wittenstein. He notes that this approach makes it easier to link energy connectivity with inclusion and sustainability, which in turn can increase both public support and investor interest.

The ASEAN Power Grid represents more than an techno-economic solution to pressing power market challenges. It is a platform for regional cooperation, inclusive growth and a just energy transition. As ASEAN prepares to adopt the next APAEC and renew the Memorandum of Understanding on the APG, decision-makers have a chance to shape a new narrative and turn energy connectivity into a powerful tool for transformation.

Across the United States, employees working in sterilization facilities, medical supply warehouses, and industrial operations are inhaling a toxic substance that could threaten their long-term health. Ethylene oxide (EtO) plays a crucial role in sterilizing approximately half of the nation’s medical equipment. Its importance to modern healthcare is undeniable, yet the escalating health risks associated with exposure can no longer be dismissed.

Although research spanning decades has linked EtO to life-altering illnesses, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has not revised its worker exposure limits since the early 1980s. Government agencies understand the severity of the threat. Still, the safety standards remain locked in the past.

EtO is particularly valuable because it helps sterilize medical equipment that cannot be treated with high heat or steam. In many cases, it has replaced other methods such as gamma radiation, electron beam processing, X-ray sterilization, and hydrogen peroxide plasma. The efficiency, however, carries a steep human cost.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) identifies EtO as a known human carcinogen, and even small, repeated exposures over time can cause cell DNA damage. Moreover, short-term contact with concentrated EtO emissions may trigger breathing difficulties, headaches, and neurological problems. Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and EPA acknowledge links between long-term workplace exposure and cancers, including leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and breast cancer. Its inhalation carcinogenicity in humans is highlighted in an EPA evaluation from 2016 that underpins all modern EPA cancer-risk estimates for EtO.

Communities across the country are already living with the consequences. In Willowbrook, Illinois, risk modeling data from 2018 showed cancer dangers more than 4.8 times higher than acceptable levels near a Sterigenics sterilization facility that uses EtO. The plant was closed in 2019, but right before, an EPA report acknowledged cancer risks of up to 500 to 1000 per 1 million at the site.

In Laredo, Texas, and Jackson, Missouri, the same projection map revealed cancer risk 18 times and 11 times higher, respectively, than EPA’s threshold for acceptable risk near Midwest Sterilization Corporation facilities. Other pollution projection data revealed several EtO facilities in California with elevated cancer risks around neighboring communities.

Even if these data are a few years old, they remain relevant because many of the cancers associated with EtO exposure have long latencies, spanning even 15 years after the initial exposure.

According to a 2023 study, 31 out of 654 EtO-emitting facilities in the United States have an estimated cancer risk of over 100 per 1 million. Despite this alarming evidence, many facilities continue to operate within OSHA’s outdated regulatory framework.

OSHA’s standards are stuck in the last century. OSHA’s permissible exposure limit for EtO has not changed since 1984, a time when the full extent of its toxicity was not understood. EPA now considers the chemical up to 60 times more dangerous than previously estimated, and recently adopted stricter controls intended to achieve a 90 percent reduction in hazardous EtO emissions. The agency also signaled its intention to reduce allowable workplace exposure levels to 0.1 parts per million by 2035.

Yet, OSHA’s current limit for an eight-hour workday remains at 1 part per million, 10 times higher than what other federal environmental regulators believe is safe. This disconnect leaves people closest to the hazard—such as warehouse technicians, sterilization line operators, and maintenance workers— without adequate protection.

EPA has made the first move, but if OSHA continues to delay updating its regulations, responsibility falls on state governments, labor organizations, and environmental justice advocates to demand stronger protection.

Workers deserve exposure limits supported by modern science and real-time monitoring of emissions inside and outside sterilization facilities. Thanks to the new EPA regulations, we should see more impact studies and projections that were previously halted after 2018, when EPA released its National Air Toxics Assessment.

Furthermore, companies should be required to install effective ventilation and leak detection systems, provide comprehensive protective gear, and ensure that employees undergo regular medical evaluations. These are not radical requests. The technology exists, the data are clear, and the stakes are measured in human lives.

OSHA must recognize that safeguarding workers is its core mission and not an optional set of policies. No individual should have to decide between financial security and personal health. The nation relies on a steady supply of sterile medical equipment, but that need must never justify preventable illness among those who help produce it.

The crisis is already unfolding. Now is the time to move worker protections into the modern era and ensure that the people supporting our health care system are not sacrificing their health in the process.",https://www.theregreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Cade1.20.2026-962305570.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 00:59:39.247945

The team of researchers, with support from the North Carolina Renewable Ocean Energy Program, conducted an analysis for the North Carolina coast, focused on wind turbines and marine hydrokinetic kites.
Researchers will pair the portfolio optimization framework with another model known as Tools for Energy Model Optimization and Analysis, commonly referred to as Temoa, which produces long-term analyses of energy systems.
“We are going to combine analysis from this offshore portfolio with the long-term energy planning for the Eastern Interconnection,” de Querioz said.
“Fused Portfolio Optimization for Harnessing Marine Renewable Energy Resources” was published in the journal Energy earlier this month.","A group of North Carolina State University researchers has created a model that simulates wind, waves, tides and currents to help pinpoint areas that are likely best to install offshore energy facilities.

The model, called a portfolio optimization framework, also identifies what combination of wind and marine hydrokinetic technologies, which capture energy through water flow, may work together in an area to produce the greatest amount of power.

“It’s not about only one type, but multiple sources of generation that can somehow work together to generate a more stable output of your portfolio,” explained Dr. Anderson de Queiroz, co-author of the study and associate professor of civil, construction and environmental engineering. “For example, if you think about the single source, let’s say offshore wind or wave energy, they have lots of variability with respect to their supply because it depends on natural conditions. It depends on wind speed or the ocean heights and in periods, so it’s variable.”

By locating areas where different offshore energy technologies can work together, a phenomenon researchers refer to as “complementary behavior,” power companies can get the most bang for their buck.

For context, picture an offshore field of 50 wind turbines. Within that field are marine hydrokinetic devices such as wave energy converters or underwater kite turbines that generate electricity from ocean currents and tidal streams.

“When you’re collecting the electricity, instead of collecting only from wind with transmission lines, you can also collect electricity from this other source. So, the electricity that you’re bringing to shore in that situation will be more stable because of the complementary behavior between the sources,” de Querioz said.

For the developer trying to explore and analyze where they can get the most power output possible, this model could help reduce their financial risk.

“For government analysts and planners, they can also see strategically where there are regions that would be beneficial in terms of most electricity that they are able to get to at a reasonable cost and that’s away from, for example, protected habitat areas or away from strategic areas” used by military forces, de Querioz said.

The team of researchers, with support from the North Carolina Renewable Ocean Energy Program, conducted an analysis for the North Carolina coast, focused on wind turbines and marine hydrokinetic kites.

But de Querioz points out that the model they have developed can be used globally and with any combination of technologies. And, he said, it may be applied onshore.

The research team is in the process of expanding its analysis to other regions, including the coasts of New Jersey and Virginia.

The project, which is through the Atlantic Marine Energy Center and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, will use the portfolio optimization model to support bringing electricity to the East Coast through the Eastern Interconnection.

The Eastern Interconnection spans from central Canada east to the Atlantic Coast, south to Florida and west to the foot of the Rockies. It is one of two major power grids.

Researchers will pair the portfolio optimization framework with another model known as Tools for Energy Model Optimization and Analysis, commonly referred to as Temoa, which produces long-term analyses of energy systems.

“We are going to combine analysis from this offshore portfolio with the long-term energy planning for the Eastern Interconnection,” de Querioz said. “Basically, we’re looking at the entirety of the Eastern Interconnection, and then deploying not only offshore energy, but also looking at natural gas potential, new nuclear or the potential to have energy storage, onshore solar, and things like that.”

The team is also working with the North Carolina Renewable Energy Program this year to develop an adapted design for a wave power buoy called Reference Model 3, or RM3, that converts wave energy into electrical power.

“On these, we’re going to do more specific and detailed analysis for the North Carolina coast with this new design of wave energy converters,” de Queiroz said.

He is extending an invitation to collaborate with industry, government and other scientists with an interest in the model. The model is expected to be released sometime this year. Anyone interested may contact de Queiroz by email at ardequei@ncsu.edu.

Recent Catalysts and News Recent headlines around Louisiana-Pacific have focused less on splashy product launches and more on operational follow through.
In that sense, Louisiana-Pacific stock now embodies a classic market tension: the tug of war between fear of missing further gains and fear of buying too close to the peak.","Louisiana-Pacific is not the kind of stock that usually dominates trading screens, yet its recent price action has been anything but dull. After a brisk rally fueled by resilient U.S. housing demand and optimism around repair and remodeling, the share price has cooled over the past few days, giving traders a reminder that this is still very much a cyclical name tied to lumber prices, mortgage rates and homebuilding sentiment.

Across the last week of trading, LPX has drifted slightly lower from its recent highs, with a mild pullback rather than a dramatic selloff. The tone is cautious rather than panicked: volume has been moderate, intraday swings contained, and the stock is consolidating just below its recent peak while investors reassess how much future growth is already priced in.

According to real time data from Yahoo Finance and Reuters, the last close for LPX was approximately 88.50 dollars per share, with intraday trading recently hovering close to that level. Over the past five sessions the stock has slipped a few percentage points from just above 90 dollars, reflecting a short term loss of momentum but not a breakdown in trend. Over the last 90 days, however, the trajectory is unambiguously positive: the stock has advanced strongly from the mid 60s, tracking a firm uptrend that mirrors improving expectations for construction and building products.

That medium term strength is underscored by the 52 week range. Data from Bloomberg and Yahoo Finance shows a 52 week low around 47 dollars and a recent 52 week high near 92 dollars, placing the current quote in the upper band of that channel. For anyone who lived through the stock’s slump when lumber prices normalized and housing cooled, trading close to the high end of that range is a powerful signal that sentiment has swung back toward optimism.

One-Year Investment Performance

Step back twelve months and the picture becomes even more striking. Historical price data from Yahoo Finance and Google Finance shows that LPX closed at roughly 64 dollars per share one year ago. Measured against the latest price around 88.50 dollars, that implies a gain of about 38 percent for investors who simply bought and held during a period that still felt deeply uncertain for the housing complex.

Put in practical terms, a 10,000 dollar investment in Louisiana-Pacific stock a year ago would now be worth roughly 13,800 dollars, excluding dividends. That 3,800 dollar profit is not the stuff of speculative tech legends, but for a mid cap building materials name tied to a choppy macro backdrop, it is a quietly impressive performance. The move also handily beats most major equity benchmarks over the same stretch, reinforcing the idea that disciplined investors who were willing to look through near term rate jitters have been rewarded.

The emotional journey, however, has been anything but linear. Over the past year LPX has endured spells of volatility as markets whipsawed between fears of a housing recession and hopes for a soft landing. The fact that the stock still delivered high double digit percentage returns despite those mood swings says as much about management’s execution and margin discipline as it does about the macro environment.

Recent Catalysts and News

Recent headlines around Louisiana-Pacific have focused less on splashy product launches and more on operational follow through. Earlier this week, investor attention circled back to the company as traders digested the latest housing and lumber data, with LPX trading in sympathy with homebuilders and other building products peers. The modest pullback that followed looked like classic profit taking after a strong advance rather than a reaction to company specific disappointment.

Within the last several trading days, financial media outlets including Bloomberg and MarketWatch have highlighted LPX in the context of the ongoing rotation into cyclical names that benefit from easing rate expectations. As bond yields softened, investors revisited the entire housing ecosystem, and LPX was often mentioned as a levered play on oriented strand board pricing and siding demand. No major management shake ups or abrupt strategic pivots surfaced in this window, which suggests that the stock’s short term volatility has been macro driven rather than the result of internal surprises.

Scanning company communications and news aggregators, there has not been a flurry of fresh corporate announcements in the very latest sessions. Instead, the trading pattern resembles a consolidation phase with relatively low volatility, where prior gains are being digested. In that kind of environment, even minor beats or misses in economic data can nudge LPX up or down a couple of percent, which is exactly what the market has been witnessing recently.

Wall Street Verdict & Price Targets

On Wall Street, sentiment on Louisiana-Pacific is constructive but not euphoric. Over the past month, analyst updates captured by sources such as Reuters and Investopedia show a tilt toward Buy and Overweight ratings, with a minority of firms urging more caution. For example, Bank of America maintains a Buy stance and has nudged its price target into the low to mid 90 dollar range, effectively signaling limited but still positive upside from current levels. Morgan Stanley, by contrast, leans closer to Equal Weight, arguing that a good portion of the cyclical recovery story is already embedded in the valuation.

Other coverage from firms such as J.P. Morgan and UBS broadly echoes this balanced tone. Consensus compiled by Yahoo Finance and Bloomberg indicates an average target price clustered in the low 90s, with the highest targets stretching toward the upper 90s and the more conservative estimates falling back into the high 70s. Taken together, that mix translates into an overall rating profile that is slightly bullish: Wall Street does not see LPX as a screaming bargain at present levels, but it also does not view the stock as overextended enough to warrant aggressive Sell calls.

Investors should read this verdict as a nuanced message. The analyst community is effectively saying that LPX has earned its recent rerating through earnings resilience and capital discipline, yet future returns will depend on whether housing activity and commodity input costs cooperate. In practical terms, that means the easy money of the recovery phase may already be behind the stock, while the next leg up will require continued execution and at least a benign macro backdrop.

Future Prospects and Strategy

At its core, Louisiana-Pacific is a building solutions company focused on engineered wood products, particularly oriented strand board, siding and related structural components that feed into residential construction, repair and remodeling. It has carved out a niche by pushing higher value, branded siding systems and specialty panels that can command better pricing and stickier demand than pure commodity lumber. That strategic tilt toward value added products is central to how the company plans to navigate the inevitable ups and downs of the housing cycle.

Looking ahead to the coming months, several factors will likely dictate how LPX trades. First, interest rate expectations remain paramount, because they directly influence new home sales, renovation budgets and builder sentiment. Any renewed spike in yields could cool demand and pressure oriented strand board pricing, which in turn would challenge margins. Second, supply chain normalization and input cost dynamics matter; if raw material and freight costs stay contained, the company has more room to protect profitability even if volumes wobble.

On the positive side, structural housing undersupply in North America and the aging stock of existing homes continue to underpin long term demand for the kind of products LPX sells. Even if the near term macro environment becomes choppy, the backlog of repair, remodeling and new construction activity does not disappear, it merely shifts in timing. That is why many analysts still see Louisiana-Pacific as a credible way to express a cautiously optimistic view on housing over a multi year horizon.

For now, the stock sits at an interesting junction: near the top of its 52 week range, digesting solid gains, and facing a market that has become more selective about cyclical exposure. If management can deliver steady earnings, keep leverage in check and continue mix shifting toward higher margin siding solutions, the current consolidation could eventually resolve higher. If not, any disappointment in macro data or company guidance might spark a sharper correction from these elevated levels.

Investors considering an entry today must therefore decide whether they believe the recent 90 day rally is the prelude to a longer structural uptrend or the late stage of a cyclical bounce. The one year track record suggests that patient capital has been rewarded, yet the current valuation near the top of the 52 week range demands clearer conviction. In that sense, Louisiana-Pacific stock now embodies a classic market tension: the tug of war between fear of missing further gains and fear of buying too close to the peak.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405045_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 11:07:01.118734

This move could significantly benefit Tesla, which previously shipped from China. However, a price cap on half the quota might favor Chinese brands like BYD and Nio, offering more affordable options for Canadian buyers.

Canada has decided to remove 100% tariffs on Chinese-made EVs. According to a Reuters report, this policy change could benefit Elon Musk's Tesla, which is positioned to be among the first electric carmakers to take advantage of the new arrangement. Under the deal announced last week, Canada will allow up to 49,000 vehicles to be imported annually from China, with a 6.1% tariff on most-favoured nation terms. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who recently visited China, also said the quota could rise to reach 70,000 vehicles within five years. The Reuters report cited experts who claimed that Tesla's early efforts to ship cars from its Shanghai plant to Canada and its established sales network in the country give the company an advantage. However, under one of the clauses in the agreement, half of the quota will be reserved for vehicles priced under 35,000 CAD (roughly $25,000). It's important to note that Tesla model prices are all above that number, and this could limit the company's ability to fully utilise the quota.

How Canada’s Chinese EV policy change can help Elon Musk’s Tesla

While many Chinese automakers are eager to take advantage of this opportunity as they increase exports, Tesla has a head start. In 2023, the company already set up its Shanghai plant, which is its largest and most cost-effective factory worldwide, to build and export a Canada-specific version of its Model Y.

The US automaker started shipping the car from Shanghai to Canada that same year, increasing Canadian automobile imports from China to its largest port, Vancouver, by 460% year over year to 44,356 in 2023. However, Tesla was forced to stop in 2024 and switched to shipping from its US and Berlin factories after Canada imposed 100% tariffs, saying they wanted to counter what they called China's intentional state-directed policy of overcapacity. Currently, Tesla ships Model Ys produced in Berlin to Canada, but more variants, such as cheaper Model 3s, are mostly built in China.“This new agreement could allow resumption of those exports rather quickly,” Sam Fiorani, vice president of research firm AutoForecast Solutions told Reuters. Tesla has an existing network of 39 stores in Canada, while Chinese competitors such as BYD and Nio do not yet have a sales presence there. Tesla can also likely move faster with marketing plans since it only has four core models, far fewer than its Chinese competitors, the report adds.“Tesla indeed has an advantage with its offering of a few models, versions and simple production lines so that it can be flexible to sell cars produced in any country in any market to achieve the best cost efficiency,"" Yale Zhang, managing director at Shanghai-based consultancy AutoForesight, told Reuters. Other brands that exported cars made in China to Canada before the tariffs included Volvo and Polestar, which are both owned by China's automaking group Geely.

How the price clause in Canada’s new EV policy is ‘good news’ for Chinese brands

However, the price limit will likely give Chinese brands some room to compete with Tesla. “The beneficiaries are likely to be Chinese automakers and the Canadian customers looking for an entry-level vehicle,” Fiorani added. John Zeng, head of market forecast for China at London-based consultancy GlobalData, said that the quota would also likely give Chinese carmakers a chance to test the market in Canada, where there's a large Chinese Canadian population. Canada wants to explore joint ventures and investments with Chinese companies within the next three years to build a Canadian electric vehicle using Chinese expertise, the public broadcaster CBC reported, citing a senior Canadian official. China's top EV maker, BYD, currently has an electric bus assembly plant in Ontario, Canada. Meanwhile, Trump administration officials have criticised Canada's decision. The former Biden administration also increased tariffs on Chinese EVs to 100% in 2024, essentially blocking such exports to the US.

The announcement closely followed a notice from the federal agency earlier this month that it will do its most thorough type of environmental assessment into the project, which would connect power generation infrastructure east of the Cascade Mountains to where electricity is consumed along the Interstate 5 corridor.

The meetings about the Cascade Renewable Transmission project will focus on problems the project may cause and identify alternatives to the project.

“Public input is crucial to ensure we consider all potential impacts and alternatives,” Joe Brock, a project manager with the Corps’ Portland District, said in the press release. “This process helps us better understand community concerns and make informed decisions.”

The Corps’ two virtual meetings are 1-3 p.m. Jan 28 and 6-8 p.m. Jan. 29. The agency asks people to email CRT_EIS@usace.army.mil by Jan. 23 to preregister.

The agency said its forthcoming review will look at the potential environmental, ecological, aesthetic, historical, cultural and social impacts of the project, which has faced wide-ranging opposition.

In December, key shipping groups expressed alarm about a lack of information on the project’s potential impacts to routine barge shipments of crucial fuels from Portland to the Tri-Cities.

Environmental advocates and Native groups have also fought the project. They argue it may harm endangered species in the river and undermine Native nations’ treaty-reserved rights.

“It’s death by 1,000 cuts,” Julie Carter, a lawyer and longtime policy analyst for the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fishing Commission, said last summer. “They want to dig into critical habitat — habitat that’s needed for … salmon and steelhead, for Pacific lamprey.”

Opponents like Carter worry in particular about lamprey, a species Native nations in the Columbia Basin have worked hard to save. So little is known about lamprey that the project could dig its channel right into the middle of their migration route, compounding significant harms caused by the federal hydropower dam system.

Critics also argued last year the project had not put out enough public information to be properly assessed.

Permitting slog

The Corps echoed that sentiment last spring when it said the project’s permitting applications didn’t have enough information.

But Chris Hocker, the project lead for its developer, PowerBridge, said the company has been sending the Corps all the information it wants. He takes the agency’s latest move as a sign the project’s permits are being officially considered again.

Over the summer, PowerBridge turned down expedited federal permitting from the Trump administration.

In addition to permits from the Corps, the project also needs a green light from Washington and Oregon before it can start. PowerBridge’s choice was partly due to still having to navigate the states’ long permitting processes either way, and partly to stay in the good graces of the two Democrat-controlled states.

By the end of last year, the Washington permitting process was underway with a Washington Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council hearing in Washougal.

Marching forward

Hocker said he’s happy the project is continuing to move forward through the Corps’ permitting process.

“We expected that they would require an EIS (environmental impact statement),” he added, “so that’s not a surprise and we’re anxious to go through that process.”

Hocker said federal permitting timelines vary but in general he expects the process to take about two years. The Corps’ webpage for the project says the process should be done by next winter.

In the meantime, the region faces a power transmission crisis of its own making as growing regional power consumption — especially from power-hungry data centers — blows up old demand projections, threatening to take Washington and Oregon’s climate goals with them.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47634/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/columbiagale_14-1024x6831768852561.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=7ZPfHqVs,N,,2026-01-19 22:58:19.774746

But the Trump administration largely eliminated the incentives for those products and instead chose to focus on increasing critical minerals production directly.","WASHINGTON (AP) — A bipartisan group of lawmakers have proposed creating a new agency with $2.5 billion to spur production of rare earths and the other critical minerals, while the Trump administration has already taken aggressive actions to break China’s grip on the market for these materials that are crucial to high-tech products, including cellphones, electric vehicles, jet fighters and missiles.

It’s too early to tell how the bill, if passed, could align with the White House’s policy, but whatever the approach, the U.S. is in a crunch to drastically reduce its reliance on China, after Beijing used its dominance of the critical minerals market to gain leverage in the trade war with Washington. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a one-year truce in October, by which Beijing would continue to export critical minerals while the U.S. would ease its export controls of U.S. technology on China.

The Pentagon has shelled out nearly $5 billion over the past year to help ensure its access to the materials after the trade war laid bare just how beholden the U.S. is to China, which processes more than 90% of the world’s critical minerals. To break Beijing’s chokehold, the U.S. government is taking equity stakes in a handful of critical mineral companies and in some cases guaranteeing the price of some commodities using an approach that seems more likely to come out of China’s playbook instead of a Republican administration.

The bill that Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., introduced Thursday would favor a more market-based approach by setting up the independent body charged with building a stockpile of critical minerals and related products, stabilizing prices, and encouraging domestic and allied production to help ensure stable supply not only for the military but also the broader economy and manufacturers.

Shaheen called the legislation “a historic investment” to make the U.S. economy more resilient against China’s dominance that she said has left the U.S. vulnerable to economic coercion. Young said creating the new reserve is “a much-needed, aggressive step to protect our national and economic security.”

Rep. Rob Wittman, R.-Va., introduced the House version of the bill.

New sense of urgency

When Trump imposed widespread tariffs last spring, Beijing fought back not only with tit-for-tat tariffs but severe restrictions on the export of critical minerals, forcing Washington to back down and eventually agree to the truce when the leaders met in South Korea.

On Monday, in his speech at SpaceX, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth revealed that the Pentagon has in the past five months alone “deployed over $4.5 billion in capital commitments” to close six critical minerals deals that will “help free the United States from market manipulation.”

One of the deals involves a $150 million of preferred equity by the Pentagon in Atlantic Alumina Co. to save the country’s last alumina refinery and build its first large-scale gallium production facility in Louisiana.

Last year, the Pentagon announced it would buy $400 million of preferred stock in MP Materials, which owns the country’s only operational rare earths mine at Mountain Pass, California, and entered into a $1.4-billion joint partnership with ReElement Technologies Corp. to build up a domestic supply chain for rare earth magnets.

On Wednesday, Trump announced in a proclamation that the U.S. is “too reliant” on foreign-sourced critical minerals and directed his administration to negotiate better deals. He said possible remedies would include minimum import prices for certain critical minerals.

“Reshoring manufacturing that’s critical to our national and economic security is a top priority for the Trump administration,” said Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson.

The drastic move by the U.S. government to take equity stakes has prompted some analysts to observe that Washington is pivoting to some form of state capitalism to compete with Beijing.

“Despite the dangers of political interference, the strategic logic is compelling,” wrote Elly Rostoum, a senior fellow at the Washington-based research institute Center for European Policy Analysis. She suggested that the new model could be “a prudent way for the U.S. to ensure strategic autonomy and industrial sovereignty.”

Companies across the industry are welcoming the intervention from Trump’s administration.

“He is playing three-dimensional chess on critical minerals like no previous president has done. It’s about time too, given the military and strategic vulnerability we face by having to import so many of these fundamental building blocks of technology and national defense,” NioCorp’s Chief Communications Officer Jim Sims said. That company is trying to finish raising the money it needs to build a mine in southeast Nebraska.

Relying on allies for help

In addition to trying to boost domestic production, the Trump administration has sought to secure some of these crucial elements through allies. In October, Trump signed an $8.5 billion agreement with Australia to invest in mining there, and the president is now aggressively trying to take over Greenland in the hope of being able to one day extract rare earths from there.

On Monday, finance ministers from the G7 nations huddled in Washington over their vulnerability in the critical mineral supply chains.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has led several rounds of trade negotiations with Beijing, urged attendees to increase their supply chain resiliency and thanked them for their willingness to work together “toward decisive action and lasting solutions,” according to a Treasury statement.

The bill introduced on Thursday by Shaheen and Young would encourage production with both domestic and allied producers.

Past efforts to bolster rare earths production

Congress in the past several years has pushed for legislation to protect the U.S. military and civilian industry from Beijing’s chokehold. The issue became a pressing concern every time China turned to its proven tactics of either restricting the supply or turned to dumping extra critical minerals on the market to depress prices and drive any potential competitors out of business.

The Biden administration sought to increase demand for critical minerals domestically by pushing for more electric vehicle and windmill production. But the Trump administration largely eliminated the incentives for those products and instead chose to focus on increasing critical minerals production directly.

Most of those past efforts were on a much more limited scale than what the government has done in the past year, and they were largely abandoned after China relented and eased access to critical minerals.

As of January 2026, the divergence between the United States and the United Kingdom offers a masterclass in how different policy levers—one driven by manufacturing incentives and the other by strict sales mandates—affect infrastructure and grid stability.

The Policy Engine: Mandates vs. Incentives

In the United Kingdom, the conversation is currently dominated by the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) Mandate. For 2026, this landmark legislation requires that 33% of all new car sales from manufacturers must be zero-emission. This is a significant jump from previous years and represents a non-negotiable “floor” for the industry.

In contrast, the United States continues to leverage the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Rather than a nationwide sales mandate, the US utilizes a “carrot” approach—massive tax credits for consumers and production credits for manufacturers who localize battery supply chains in North America.

Navigating the complexities of these differing policy landscapes can be challenging, especially for students undertaking comparative studies in energy policy. Understanding the nuanced impact of such regulations on market dynamics requires detailed research. For those grappling with the intricacies of such assignments, seeking assistance to do my coursework can provide invaluable support, ensuring a thorough and well-researched understanding of these critical global shifts.

Visualizing the 2026 EV Landscape

To understand the scale of this transition, we must look at the data. Below is a comparative snapshot of where both nations stand at the start of this year.

Metric (Jan 2026) United Kingdom United States ZEV Target 33% (Mandatory) N/A (Incentive-based) Public Chargers ~87,800 ~68,000 (Fast Stalls) Smart Tariff Adoption ~300,000 households Regional VPP Pilots

Charging Infrastructure: The 2026 Landscape

Infrastructure development has hit a milestone in both regions this year. The density of charging networks is no longer just a luxury but a prerequisite for compliance with the aforementioned mandates.

United Kingdom: As of early 2026, the UK has surpassed 87,000 public chargepoints, a massive increase driven by the Rapid Charging Fund and local authority grants. The focus has shifted to “hub” density, ensuring that high-power (150kW+) ultra-rapid chargers are accessible every 20 miles on major A-roads.

United States: The US has crossed the 68,000 public DC fast-charging stall mark. While the raw number of total ports is higher due to a vast Level 2 network, the geographical challenge remains. The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) formula program is finally seeing widespread project completions.

Grid Readiness and Intelligent Flexibility

The “grid challenge” has evolved from a fear of total failure to a sophisticated management task. In 2026, the focus is on Demand Side Response (DSR).

In the UK, Octopus Energy’s Intelligent Octopus platform has become a critical tool for the National Grid. By 2026, over 300,000 UK households are estimated to be on “smart” tariffs. This is supported by the National Grid’s Future Energy Scenarios (FES) 2026 update, which prioritizes “Pathways to Net Zero” through localized battery storage.

The US grid is testing similar Virtual Power Plant (VPP) models. However, the fragmented nature of US utilities means that “grid readiness” is often a patchwork of high-tech smart grids in some states and aging infrastructure in others. Mastering the technical documentation of these systems—specifically how they interact with broader fleet logistics—is a hurdle for many engineering and logistics students. For example, analyzing the OMGT 707 Transportation Systems and Logistics Processes coursework reveals the sheer mathematical complexity required to optimize these networks. This technical depth is a primary reason many choose to pay for assignments, seeking expert insights into how V2G (Vehicle-to-Grid) technology is currently being integrated into the 2026 energy landscape.

Sidebar: How Academic Research Drives EV Policy in 2026

Modern EV policy isn’t written in a vacuum. The 2026 ZEV Mandate targets and the US IRA revisions were informed by peer-reviewed research on battery lifecycle assessments and consumer elasticity. Academic institutions act as the “R&D” arm for government policy-makers. By bridging the gap between theoretical energy models and real-world grid data, students and researchers are directly shaping the laws that govern the roads today.

Key Takeaways

UK ZEV Mandate: 33% of new car sales must be electric in 2026.

US Strategy: Continued reliance on the IRA for domestic manufacturing and tax incentives.

Smart Grids: Solutions like Intelligent Octopus are proving that EVs can support the grid via DSR.

Infrastructure Growth: The UK has passed 82,000 public chargers; the US is focusing on highway corridors.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

Q: What is the UK’s ZEV Mandate for 2026?

A: It requires 33% of all new cars sold by a manufacturer to be zero-emission, with heavy fines for non-compliance.

Q: How many public chargers does the UK have now?

A: As of early 2026, there are over 82,000 public chargepoints across the UK.

Q: What is “Intelligent Octopus”?

A: It is a smart charging tariff that automatically charges EVs when the grid has excess renewable energy, helping stabilize the National Grid.

DETROIT — Federal and state leaders took to the stage at the Detroit Auto Show to talk about policy whiplash creating instability for manufacturers, stalling innovation and risking job losses as debate continues over how much government should shape the auto market.

In a fireside chat held at the auto show Jan. 14, former Democratic Party presidential candidate and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said rapidly changing federal policy is causing a potential setback to the industry.

“The other thing that I saw and heard speaking to each of the manufacturers who were displaying their incredible products was how much industry has had to contend with this whiplash from the policy side,” he said.

While every administration will have its own priorities, the changes in policy and how the industry has reacted to it has been a setback, he said, in particular referencing how administrations have handled electric vehicles.

“When you have a technology that is ultimately more advanced, policymakers cannot just put the toothpaste back into the tube,” he said. “There is no question about whether this technology will be the future of the sector.”

Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, who appeared via prerecorded responses during a panel Jan. 15, stated that policy uncertainty is creating problems for the industry. Things remained consistent until the Biden administration tried to make a push toward electric vehicles, he said.

“Nobody needs to be pro or against electric vehicles. The consumer is ultimately going to be the judge and jury on that. They make millions of decisions with their pocketbooks that drive car companies to decide what kind of vehicles to make. That was our mantra for a long time,” he said.

John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, who appeared with Moreno, said the government should support innovation, safety, emissions reduction and mobility, but not dictate consumer choices.

“That’s a very different government ambition and partnership with industry than having the government tell customers what they can and cannot buy,” he said.

Bozzella said that a degree of certainty and clarity is also needed.

“One person’s clarity could be another person’s EV mandate,” he said.

Regulations need to be able to outlast changes in presidential administrations, he said. While the president is entitled to appoint cabinet secretaries to make market adjustments, “there’s a difference between making adjustments based on market conditions, the state of technology, the cost of those types of things and tearing the entire playbook up and starting off again,” he said.

These kinds of changes are what create a problem across the industry, he said.

Additionally, Bozzella said regulation around electric vehicles needs to stay at the same pace as the demand for the vehicles to help keep investments from becoming “stranded,” he said. While there is still a demand for EVs, it’s moving at a “more realistic” pace, he said.

“Those policies are important for the development of the market over time, but we are where we are right now,” he said. “So, I think you’ll see continued investment, but it’s going to be a slower pace.”",,N,,2026-01-20 04:59:56.917644

Original article source: US power crunch looms as OKLO CEO says grid can’t keep up without new investment","The U.S. is running headlong into a power crunch driven by the explosive growth of artificial intelligence — and the nation’s energy grid is not ready for it, an executive behind a major new nuclear partnership warned recently.

Jacob DeWitte is CEO of OKLO, a California-based advanced nuclear company focused on helping large energy users add grid power through private investment rather than traditional utilities. He joined Meta executive Joel Kaplan and Energy Secretary Chris Wright for an announcement in Washington.

The Meta partnership will go a long way to add much-needed power to a key regional component of the national grid, DeWitte said, citing OKLO’s plans to develop a 1.2 GW installation in Pike County, Ohio, near the Hocking Hills.

""I think one of the really exciting things about today is announcing the fact we're going to be building a lot more power generation capabilities,"" he said, quipping that southeastern Ohio used to be an ""industrial cathedral"" and now can see new commercial rebirth for the digital and AI age.

We're On Opposite Sides Of The Aisle. But We Know America Must Win The Ai Race, Or Else

""Smaller [nuclear] plants can be built more quickly and come online faster – then you shorten the learning curve. You reduce the cost both in time and money of iteration cycles to drive technological progress and bring these technologies that have huge promise forward in terms of cost reduction… energy dominance and energy reliability and energy abundance,"" he said.

Wright and President Donald Trump have helped companies like OKLO and Meta unleash this new energy potential, to not only increase power capacity and amend structural issues but also greatly reduce the regulatory burdens private companies tend to face from Washington, DeWitte added.

With the advent of AI and its power needs, DeWitte said the U.S. energy system as it stands has ""absolutely"" not been able to keep up.

DeWitte warned that the U.S. needs to build out the power grid and invest in new installations like the Pike site:

""We are going to run out of power capacity in this country in the next several years, especially in critical industrial markets like sort of the Midwest and Northeast. The PJM interconnection [which supports the Mid-Atlantic region] is going to be undersupplied with power generation in just a matter of a few years.""

""The steps taken today are going to help alleviate that, but there's going be a lot more that's needed.""

DeWitte also addressed what he described as a common misconception surrounding the rise of data centers, which have sparked NIMBY backlash in parts of the country.

""I think sometimes people conflate [that] building these data centers [will] drive prices up – that's a scarcity mindset. We're in a world of an abundance mindset, right?"" he said.

He said Meta is committing to a total of 6.6GW of new power, calling it a ""huge amount of capacity"" to fuel the needs of decades to come, and that nuclear is a very reliable energy source.

DeWitte said one of the biggest structural choke points in bringing new energy online, and why the nation is running out of power, leading to price inflation, is the regulatory environment that has stymied growth for many years.

That dynamic, he said, has been ""fundamentally anti-energy.""

But, DeWitte said, that dynamic is changing: ""The unfortunate thing is we have to undo decades of... damage [from] not doing things to then overcome that inertia.""

""Look at the states that have the worst energy… They're largely states that have had the heaviest-handed anti-energy policies, and they're the ones that are now facing some of the biggest challenges on that point, and they are also responding, which is encouraging.""

OKLO, he said, was founded on the idea that nuclear fission can deliver massive amounts of reliable, affordable energy, noting nuclear power has some of the lowest fuel costs per megawatt-hour of any source.

""Our view of that, though, is changing a couple of things, including the business model, [and the] deployment model, including how we think about size and technology. We see opportunities to go invest in and build significant generating capacity in areas that need it and have significant development opportunities around it,"" he said, noting that brings the conversation full circle regarding its investment in the Ohio site.

When asked whether U.S. energy woes are a regulatory or market failure, DeWitte said the issue is in red tape versus demand.

""We, as a country, decided that we didn't need to build new power capacity and instead masked the challenges it imposes on industrial and economic growth by shipping jobs and production overseas,"" he said.

""Then you're just having those countries build power plants to power it. We need to bring that capability-set of manufacturing back to the country, but we need the energy to do it, and we don't have it today.""

New poll has Talarico leading, Cornyn tied with Paxton

A new poll of the state’s U.S. Senate primaries shows state Rep. James Talarico, D-Round Rock, leading U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Dallas by 9 percentage points, 47% to 38%, among likely Democratic voters, The Texas Tribune reported. The Emerson College poll indicates a significant shift since a Texas Southern University poll in December showed Crockett with a similar-sized lead.

In both polls, Talarico leads among white and Latino voters, while Crockett has a commanding lead among Black voters.

On the GOP side, the latest polls show U.S. Sen. John Cornyn and Attorney General Ken Paxton deadlocked, with Paxton at 27% and Cornyn at 26%. U.S. Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Houston, trailed with 16%. If those margins hold, that race would head to a runoff.

The survey also found Gov. Greg Abbott with a sizable lead over his main Democratic challenger, state Rep. Gina Hinojosa, 50% to 42%.

Solar power surpasses coal in feeding ERCOT grid

For the first time, solar power supplied more electricity in 2025 to the state’s main power grid than coal-fired power plants, the Houston Chronicle reported.

Solar farms provided 67,800 gigawatt-hours of electricity last year, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which is the power grid operator for most of the state. Power plants burning coal supplied 63,000 gigawatt-hours of power to ERCOT last year.

The Chronicle report notes that in 2019 solar supplied so little power to the ERCOT grid that it wasn’t even included as a separate category in its annual pie chart of where the grid’s power comes from. It is now the third-largest supplier to ERCOT, behind second-place wind and first-place natural gas. Coal has dropped to number four.

“It’s a remarkable milestone,” said Daniel Cohan, a Rice University professor who studies the state’s energy transition. “I don’t think anyone 10 years ago would have thought that solar would have surpassed coal this quickly.”

Texas set to ban smokeable cannabis this month

Smokable cannabis products currently sold legally in Texas could disappear by Jan. 25 under new rules proposed by the Texas Department of State Health Services. According to the Texas Standard, DSHS has drafted new regulations for the hemp industry, “including child-resistant packaging, stronger warning labels, expanded testing, recall procedures and fee increases of roughly 10,000% for manufacturers and retailers.”

Annual fees for hemp manufacturers would rise from $250 to $25,000 per facility, while retailers would see their registration fees jump from $150 to $20,000.

The proposed regulations would effectively outlaw most smokable hemp products.

DSHS last week heard from dozens of small hemp business owners and cannabis users, many of whom said they support stricter packaging rules and age limits but oppose the ban on smokable products and the steep hike in licensing and registration fees.

“These proposed fees don’t regulate small businesses, they eliminate them,” Estella Castro, owner of Austinite Cannabis Co., told commissioners. “This proposal would force me to close, despite doing everything right.”

Some speakers spoke in support of the proposed regulations, including a mother who said her son developed psychosis from using cannabis and required medial treatment.

DSHS expanding anti-rabies program to El Paso area

DSHS is expanding its 32nd annual Oral Rabies Vaccination Program to the El Paso area while continuing its aerial bait distribution along the Texas-Mexico border. The rabies vaccine baits will be distributed by hand in targeted areas around El Paso.

“Our mission is to vaccinate wildlife along the borders of Texas to maintain herd immunity against rabies and keep new or previously eliminated rabies variants from becoming established in any part of Texas,” said Kathy Parker, ORVP Director. “However, we continue to monitor all the counties of Texas for outbreaks and/or potential areas of rabies interest.”

The baits do not pose threats to livestock, wildlife or pets. The project costs $2 million annually and is funded by both state and federal agencies. Since the program began, no human cases of rabies attributable to the rabies variants found along the border have been confirmed in Texas.

The program covers 19 Texas counties: El Paso, Hudspeth, Culberson, Jeff Davis, Presidio, Brewster, Pecos, Terrell, Val Verde, Kinney, Maverick, Zavala, Dimmit, Webb, Zapata, Starr, Hidalgo, Cameron and Willacy.

Texas is back on top of U-Haul’s list of “growth states,” according to the Austin American-Statesman. The company determines each state’s net gain or loss by recording how many customers used one-way equipment in 2025.

This is the fourth time the state has topped U-Haul’s rankings in five years. In 2024, South Carolina topped the list but fell to No. 5 last year. In second place is Florida, followed by North Carolina and Tennessee.

Coming in dead last in U-Haul’s ranking was California.

On Thursday, Alito recused himself, citing financial interests in ConocoPhillips, the parent of Burlington Resources Oil & Gas Co., a party in a related case.
Justice Clarence Thomas asked about the practical effect of having the case heard in state versus federal court.","Lawyers for the oil giant Chevron and a small Louisiana parish squared off Monday in a case that could have major consequences for how local communities can rectify environmental damage that may have been caused by oil company operations going back decades.

In April, a Louisiana state court jury ruled that Chevron must pay almost $745 million to help restore coastal wetlands in Plaquemines Parish that were damaged as far back as World War II. Chevron is asking the Supreme Court to order the case moved to federal court, where it could get more favorable terms.

The ripple effects could be large: If the justices rule that the company can move the case to federal court, the hefty award for Plaquemines Parish could be wiped out, legal experts say. Moreover, the case could affect the outcomes of nearly a dozen other lawsuits that make similar allegations about the oil and gas industry.

The justices on Monday questioned Chevron’s arguments that it should be allowed to take the case to federal court even though its federal contracts did not squarely deal with oil drilling, which Plaquemines Parish says caused the coastal damage. Chevron’s attorneys argued that the oil production was “related to” the production of aviation fuel for World War II, which they say should be enough to meet the test to have the case heard in federal court.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. asked whether there was a “butterfly effect problem” with their argument — a reference to the concept that a butterfly flapping its wings could set off a chain of causation that could eventually lead to a tornado — suggesting that he thought almost anything could be considered “related to” a government contract.

“It’s hard to see where you stop,” he said.

Justice Neil M. Gorsuch likewise referred to the butterfly effect issue.

“The Big Bang is ‘related to’ you being here today, counsel,” he told Aaron Z. Roper, an attorney with the solicitor general’s office, which is supporting Chevron.

Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. was not present for arguments. On Thursday, Alito recused himself, citing financial interests in ConocoPhillips, the parent of Burlington Resources Oil & Gas Co., a party in a related case.

Although the case focused on a narrow legal question, experts highlighted its importance in how companies fight claims of environmental damage.

“The stakes are higher than just where this one case is going to be heard,” said Mark Davis, director of the Center for Environmental Law at Tulane University.

If the company prevails in having the verdict thrown out and the long-running case moved to federal court, other companies that do business with the federal government are likely to pursue similar arguments in the future, Davis said.

At the heart of Chevron’s case is the argument that during World War II, the firm’s predecessors played a key role in helping to expand oil extraction to meet the demands of the war. Because they were working on behalf of U.S. government interests, the company and its backers have argued, claims regarding the actions at the time should be heard in a federal court rather than at the state level.

Judges and juries in federal courts are less inclined to have a bias toward local interests, experts say. But John Carmouche, an attorney representing Plaquemines Parish, said that if his side loses at the high court, he would confidently litigate the case in federal court and seek an even higher sum.

“All they’re doing is playing the delay game, which they’ve played for 13 years,” Carmouche said in an interview.

Justice Clarence Thomas asked about the practical effect of having the case heard in state versus federal court.

Ben Aguiñaga, Louisiana’s solicitor general, which argued on behalf of Plaquemines Parish, replied that state courts were far better equipped to interpret state law.

“We want the actual experts interpreting state law, especially when we get to the Louisiana Supreme Court, on an important statute like this, and especially with respect to a problem that is so sweeping in scope,” he said.

But cases of national importance should be argued at the federal level, lawyers for Chevron argued in response to a question from Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.

“If they can prove their case in federal court, then everybody’s going to accept the outcome and they’re not going to view it as something that’s a product of local prejudice,” said Paul D. Clement, the former U.S. solicitor general who represents the company.

Plaquemines Parish filed its lawsuit in 2013 alongside five other coastal parishes. It alleged that oil companies had caused environmental damage in violation of a 1978 state law aimed at conserving the imperiled coastline.

The case in front of the high court holds particular relevance in Louisiana, where the oil and gas industry remains a massive employer and the coastal region has steadily vanished in recent decades.

One 2017 analysis by the U.S. Geological Survey found that the state had lost about 2,000 square miles of land along its coast from 1932 to 2016. That equates to losing about a football field’s worth of coastal wetlands every 34 minutes during periods of most rapid loss.

The authors called Louisiana’s wetlands “one of the most critically threatened environments in the United States” and detailed how the state had lost more wetlands than all other states in the Lower 48 combined. Those losses are projected to persist in the years ahead.

Scientists have documented how oil and gas extraction has played a significant role in the degradation of such landscapes over time. Oil spills have stressed vegetation and wildlife. The dredging of canals and construction of pipelines have altered natural hydrology, increased saltwater intrusion and undermined wetlands.

But the fossil fuel industry is hardly the only threat facing the coast, where humans have built levees that have changed the flow of the Mississippi River and constrained its historical ability to deposit sediment and build land. The process of sinking land, also known as subsidence, has continued to affect the coast.

After the $745 million verdict in April, oil industry figures sharply criticized the decision.

The verdict “not only undermines Louisiana’s position as an energy leader but also threatens our country’s trajectory to America-first energy dominance,” Tommy Faucheux, president of the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Association, said at the time.

“These lawsuits were never about restoring the coast,” he said in a statement. “As the number-one private investor in our working coast, the energy industry is already doing that. Instead, this is deep-pocketed trial lawyers driving baseless lawsuits, hoping to make millions in legal fees.”

When the Supreme Court later agreed to take up the case, Faucheux said the decision presented “an opportunity for the high court to uphold fair and consistent application of the law and to help preserve legal stability for the industry that fuels America’s economy.”

The issue on the flip side, Davis of the Tulane Center said, is the question of what obligations oil and gas firms have to rectify environmental damage caused by their operations.

“What obligations do you have to fix what you broke?” he said.",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2026/01/Coastal-Damage.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 17:00:06.896111

In December, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released updated draft risk evaluations that could again shift how industries assess and manage formaldehyde exposure. While still in the proposal stage, these revisions signal potential changes in occupational, industrial, and environmental expectations.

What’s Changing in the Updated Draft

EPA’s proposal includes several key updates designed to refine and modernize its approach to formaldehyde risk:

New Point of Departure: 0.3 ppm

The draft introduces a new Point of Departure (POD) of 0.3 ppm, representing the threshold from which EPA begins determining risk. This revised value could influence future exposure limits, risk assessments, and workplace mitigation strategies.

Revised Conditions of Use

The updated draft removes five previously evaluated conditions of use from the “unreasonable risk” category. EPA notes that these specific scenarios no longer exceed benchmark levels based on improved data and updated analytical methods.

Replacement of the January 2025 Evaluation

This proposal is intended to replace the risk evaluation finalized in January 2025. The updated draft reflects new modeling, additional exposure data, and a refined methodology.

Ongoing Work on Risk Management

EPA emphasizes that it is still revising its formaldehyde risk management rule. That process will continue even as the revised evaluation moves through review and comment periods. For industrial hygienists, this means requirements may shift again as EPA aligns the risk evaluation and risk management components.

Timeline and Opportunities to Comment

Stakeholders—including industrial hygienists, manufacturers, healthcare facilities, laboratories, and building-material producers—can provide input on the updated draft.

Public comment deadline: February 2, 2026

Full proposal available through the Federal Register:

What It Means for Industrial Hygiene Programs

While the updated draft does not immediately change compliance obligations, IH practitioners should begin reviewing potential impacts:

Assess whether current monitoring strategies align with the new POD.

Re-evaluate exposure scenarios previously considered low-risk.

Prepare for future adjustments to engineering controls or administrative practices once EPA finalizes its approach.

Mangrove’s early investors Breakthrough Energy Ventures and BMW i-Ventures also participated in the transaction for the company, which recently completed Phase 1 construction for its 1,000 tonne per annum first-of-a-kind commercial lithium refining facility in Delta, which will produce enough battery-grade materials to power approximately 25,000 electric vehicles annually.

Mangrove Lithium is building a feedstock-flexible, electrochemical lithium refining platform that produces battery-grade lithium hydroxide or lithium carbonate. The process is expected to be more economical than conventional refining methods, while also offering environmental benefits, including lower carbon intensity and reduced waste.

“Mangrove Lithium is at a pivotal moment in its growth, and CGF’s investment accelerates our expansion,” says Mangrove Lithium CEO and Co-founder Saad Dara. “We are proud of the progress to establish Mangrove Lithium as the leader in next-generation lithium processing and refining technologies, enabling a Canadian solution to strengthen the lithium supply chain, enhance energy security, and support the transition to a net-zero future. We look forward to working with CGF and our existing partners to fully commercialize our unique and proprietary technology through widescale deployment”.

The tax credit is a federal incentive designed to accelerate investment in clean technology manufacturing by providing refundable tax credits for qualifying projects, such as the Single Stack Plant. The proceeds from this transaction will support operations at Mangrove’s first Single Stack Plant while also advancing development of its next project, expected to power more than 500,000 electric vehicles annually.

“CGF was created to help Canadian companies and projects scale, and to strengthen Canada’s low-carbon supply chains. This transaction will enable Mangrove Lithium to advance its commercial development in a sector that is critical for Canada,” says Canada Growth Fund Investment Management President and CEO Yannick Beaudoin. “CGF is pleased to partner with Mangrove Lithium and to reinforce our important role to help companies create the right conditions to attract private capital.”

Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., on Jan. 13 met with officials from Growth Energy, the nation’s leading biofuel trade association, to underscore her support for ethanol production, as well as her commitment to helping strengthen our national and energy security, expand year-round E15 sales, drive down gas prices, support our farmers, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and drive rural economic opportunity in Illinois and across the country. Photos from the meeting can be found on the Senator’s website.

“Investing in clean energy has a positive ripple effect for our nation,” said Duckworth. “When we prioritize homegrown biofuels and year-round E15, we’re encouraging job growth, prioritizing our national security, reducing gas prices, protecting our environment and securing Illinois’s leadership in the energy sector for years to come.

Duckworth met with a variety of renewable energy leaders today, including Illinois-based companies such as Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) of Chicago and John Deere of Moline.

In the Senate, Duckworth has been a leader in advancing biofuels. As a founding co-chair of the Senate Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Caucus, she has been a strong advocate for expansion of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by utilizing the domestic biofuels and agricultural sectors. To help increase the availability of E15 biofuels, Duckworth helped introduce the bipartisan Nationwide Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act of 2025 and the bipartisan Next Generations Fuel Act to allow the year-round, nationwide sale of ethanol blends higher than 10 percent.

January 19, 2026 – Regina, Saskatchewan – PrairiesCan

As Canada’s energy needs evolve, communities across the country are seeking innovative solutions that deliver clean, affordable power. In Saskatchewan, small modular reactors can deliver reliable, low-emission power to meet the needs of the future while driving economic growth—but further research and testing is needed to unlock their full potential.

Today, the Honourable Buckley Belanger, Secretary of State (Rural Development), on behalf of the Honourable Eleanor Olszewski, Minister of Emergency Management and Community Resilience and Minister responsible for Prairies Economic Development Canada (PrairiesCan), announced federal support for the University of Regina to build the Small Modular Reactor Safety, Licensing, and Testing centre (SMR-SLT).

The new testing facility will ensure that Canadian researchers and businesses are equipped to safely develop and deploy these next-generation nuclear technologies. It represents a Government of Canada investment of $1.96 million through PrairiesCan, alongside $4 million from the Government of Saskatchewan.

The SMR-SLT will provide industry and academic partners with access to the first modern SMR test loops in Western Canada and will enable the testing of components under conditions that replicate operating reactors. This will support innovation, workforce development, and the safe deployment of next-generation nuclear technologies.

Canada generates 15 percent of its power from nuclear energy, but none of it is produced in Western Canada. Saskatchewan has the largest high-grade uranium deposits in the world and provides almost a quarter of the world's uranium supply for electrical generation. SMR deployment in Saskatchewan and across Canada will harness more value from our natural resources, meeting Canada’s energy production needs while driving down emissions.

The project will create 18 direct jobs, support 10 small businesses, and train a highly skilled workforce, while advancing Saskatchewan’s preparation for the estimated 2,500 to 3,500 jobs required to build and operate nuclear power plants by the mid-2030s.",https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/pedc-decp/images/news/NR - SK - U of Regina SMR - en - 960x550.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 16:58:54.165596

Developed by researchers at Texas A&M University in partnership with ExcelThermic Enterprises, the PICC system skips over the expensive solvents and high-temperature regeneration used in traditional amine-based capture technologies. Instead, it applies a basic physical principle—CO₂ dissolves in water under pressure, and escapes when that pressure drops.

In effect, PICC mimics the release of fizz from a soda bottle, but at industrial scale. The result is a system that can reportedly capture up to 99% of carbon dioxide emissions using only water, standard equipment, and pressure differentials. The same water can be recirculated, further minimizing operating costs and maintenance overhead.

From Exhaust to Storage: How PICC Works

Rather than relying on chemical reactions, PICC uses a sequence of physical steps to isolate and collect carbon dioxide. Emissions from sources like power plants, cement kilns, or hydrogen production are first cooled and compressed. This compressed gas enters an absorption unit where it meets a downward flow of cold water inside a packed column designed for maximum gas-liquid interaction.

As the CO₂ dissolves into the water, the treated exhaust exits with minimal carbon content. The now CO₂-rich water is then sent through a series of lower-pressure tanks where the gas gradually bubbles out and is collected for compression and either permanent storage or industrial reuse.

In some configurations, the process can be enhanced with small amounts of lime to improve CO₂ removal, especially from combustion air—pushing capture rates to 100% and enabling net-negative emissions when paired with biomass.

What makes this model noteworthy is its simplicity. Unlike solvent-based systems that degrade over time, require chemical handling, and involve complex thermal regeneration steps, PICC leans on well-understood physical laws and modular hardware. That translates to faster permitting, easier retrofits, and lower long-term operational risk.

A Cost Curve Shift for Heavy Industry

While carbon capture has long been seen as essential to decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors, it remains constrained by high costs. The standard amine-based systems typically capture about 90% of CO₂ at a cost between $50 and $100 per metric ton.

In contrast, early economic models for PICC suggest capture and compression at around $26 per ton. Even with added lime for full carbon removal, costs stay below $28 per ton on average—making it a compelling option for industries confronting emissions mandates and carbon pricing.

By focusing on pressure and water instead of heat and chemicals, PICC offers a scalable, infrastructure-compatible bridge for legacy assets in power, cement, and manufacturing. It won’t replace the broader need for clean energy, but it could buy time—and reduce emissions—while the transition unfolds.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20260119-102337-b1e-engin-akyurt-C0MyvY65vgY-unsplash.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 16:59:56.415705

According to data analytics and Bitcoin tracking platform Bitcoin Treasuries, the LASERS fund holds $15.6 billion in total value with Strategy stock ($MSTR) making up about $3.2 million.

Government Exposure to Bitcoin Continues Trending

The LASERS fund joins a litany of other state programs, including numerous pension funds, around the US who have exposure to Bitcoin either directly or through ETFs or proxy stocks.

While the Louisiana fund’s exposure might be relatively small, at $3.2 million, it represents a continuation of this trend and the tacit endorsement for Bitcoin as a treasury asset from yet another state-level government entity in the US.

As Coinspeaker reported in June 2025, Texas became the first US state to approve adding Bitcoin to its treasury later purchasing $10 million BTC directly. Numerous other states followed suit with proposals for their own Bitcoin treasuries, including Arizona, Michigan, Montana, and Tennessee.

Pension Funds Usually Avoid Direct Exposure

Funds such as LASERS have a mandate to increase their treasuries coupled with a strict fiduciary duty to limit exposure to volatility.

As a result, a litany of state pension funds have limited their exposure to Bitcoin to ETFs or investment in crypto-adjacent financial firms. Examples include the New York State Common Retirement Fund, California State Teachers’ Retirement System, and Florida Retirement System, each of which have significant investments in $MSTR.

In the realm of direct exposure, numerous state pension treasuries, such as the Michigan and Jersey City retirement funds, have invested heavily in Bitcoin ETFs. But very few have purchased BTC directly. The Houston Firefighters Relief and Retirement Fund (HFRR) made headlines back in 2021 when it announced a $25 million investment in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

As of January 2026, the HFRR appears to be outperforming nearly all other similar pension funds in its financial class with Bitcoin hovering above $90K against the fund’s initial purchase price of around $65K.",https://s.yimg.com/os/en/coinspeaker_us_106/94573145d6cda866ec0026111e902386,N,,2026-01-20 05:00:05.930904

She said the Ohio EPA approached them and was willing to “fully fund” the project.
“It got funded in the controlling board meeting on Monday, so the money is allocated toward the site,” Wagner said.
He then said they will be opened on Thursday, Feb. 19, at the land bank meeting.
The land bank board approved Terry Britton as president of the board.","The involvement of the Ohio EPA in a Brownfield Remediation Grant Program (BRGP) site caused the removal of the project at the monthly meeting of the Highland County Land Reutilization Corporation (land bank).

Jason Johansen, land bank administrator, said the land bank will “possibly” need to pull its application for the Bell Foundry site due to the City of Hillsboro’s intention to use a different source of grant funding for the project.

Johansen said that Lauren Walker sent an email saying that the Hillsboro Community Improvement Corporation decided to pull its involvement from this specific project so it can pursue funding from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Division of Environmental Response and Revitalization (DERR) program. She said the Ohio EPA approached them and was willing to “fully fund” the project. Walker said they “would be honored to work with them directly” and obtain the No Further Action letter and Covenant Not to Sue.

“It got funded in the controlling board meeting on Monday, so the money is allocated toward the site,” Wagner said. “The recommendation would be to, and they obviously are doing that, is to withdraw it from ODOD, letting them know, and by doing so, that allows and frees up roughly $400,000 for this board to look at other projects within the county for the best interest of the land.”

The land bank board then approved the removal of Bell’s Foundry from the BRGP.

For other BRGP projects, Johansen said the East Monroe tank farm, the former machine shop and the former East Main gas station are all complete for the 2024/25 BRGP cycle. He said all reporting has been approved and he is now waiting for the final reimbursements.

At the Rocky Fork Truck Stop, he said that he “believes” that the 90-day waiting period is over and that Tetra Tech did some samples for the monitoring wells last week.

Matt Wagner, a certified professional at Tetra Tech, said the company was out doing sampling on the wells to make sure the injections worked. He also said he anticipates having the analytical results next week and will give an update to the board on the next steps.

“But, the project obviously is under budget, still committed to the June 30 deadline for the project,” Wagner said. “You know, we’ve kept the owners as well informed in terms of what we’re doing and they’ve been cooperating since they’ve been utilizing the lot for some storage. So, with that being said, we’re just in the throes of it as we speak for actual remediation.”

Concerning the Building Demolition and Site Revitalization Grant Program, Johansen said he is still waiting for approval from the Ohio Department of Development (ODOD) for the additional projects of the 2024/25 leftover round. He said that if any of those projects cause the funds to go over the $131,140.30 leftover funds, the projects that can’t be done will be moved to the 2026 version of the (BDSRGP).

He also said his plan is to release the bids after the meeting, after which he will set the due date for Feb. 18, 2026, at 4 p.m. He then said they will be opened on Thursday, Feb. 19, at the land bank meeting. He then highlighted that the contractors do not need to be present at the meeting to be awarded any of the projects.

He said more projects can be added until April 30, 2026, with those additional projects likely to need an extension approved by ODOD because those projects would need an asbestos inspection, a possible abatement and then a demolition by June 30 if there is no extension.

The land bank board approved asbestos abatements by Industrial Installation Specialists (IIS) at 21 S. Fairfield St., Leesburg; 226 S High St., Hillsboro; 237 East Lilley Ave., Hillsboro; and 6539 Spring Hill Dr., Hillsboro, for $3,395. Johansen said the abatements would be complete and the documentation submitted to him by 4 p.m. on Feb. 18, 2026.

Johansen also gave an update on the demolition of 133 and 137 S. Washington St. in Greenfield. He said those properties are related to the former Elliott Hotel, which was included in a previous BRGP cycle. He also said 137 S. Washington is owned by the Village of Greenfield and it is being held up structurally. Greenfield is currently looking to purchase the other property from a private property owner because the property it owns has “unaffordable” renovation costs.

“This is very similar to the downtown Lynchburg buildings, where it was very difficult to tear down one without possible structural damage to the other, and I just don’t think the land bank should take on the liability, unless the adjacent property owner is willing to sign a release, which is highly unlikely, as we saw in Lynchburg,” Johansen said. “So the village would like to put these into the demolition program. I think they’re going to get ownership of that adjacent structure next to them, and really, what they want to know right now is how much would that commitment be.”

The land bank board approved the two properties to be considered two structures, and the maximum demolition price-matching cost would be $5,000.

Johansen also delivered updates of multiple other properties, which are as follows:

*Regarding 222 McClain Ave. in Greenfield, Johansen said the property was listed at $20,000 in August, but the land bank has not received any offers other than someone who said they would make payments on it until it was paid off. However, he then said the land bank received a $3,000 offer, with that offer coming from someone who also made an offer for 216 McClain Ave. in Greenfield. Following multiple members of the land bank saying they wanted the organization to recoup more of its costs from the property than $3,000, the board approved lowering the price of the property to $10,000.

The land bank board approved Terry Britton as president of the board. However, it tabled a discussion on vice president due to neither of the possibilities, Randy Mustard and Lauren Walker, being present at the meeting.

Randy Mustard and Lauren Walker were also nominated as representatives of the Paint Township Trustees and the City of Hillsboro, respectively, on the land bank board.

The next meeting of the land bank will take place on Thursday, Feb. 19, 2025, at 9 a.m.

Things remained consistent until the Biden administration tried to make a push toward electric vehicles, he said.

While there is still a demand for EVs, it’s moving at a “more realistic” pace, he said.","DETROIT — Federal and state leaders took to the stage at the Detroit Auto Show to talk about policy whiplash creating instability for manufacturers, stalling innovation and risking job losses as debate continues over how much government should shape the auto market.

In a fireside chat held at the auto show Jan. 14, former Democratic Party presidential candidate and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said rapidly changing federal policy is causing a potential setback to the industry.

“The other thing that I saw and heard speaking to each of the manufacturers who were displaying their incredible products was how much industry has had to contend with this whiplash from the policy side,” he said.

While every administration will have its own priorities, the changes in policy and how the industry has reacted to it has been a setback, he said, in particular referencing how administrations have handled electric vehicles.

“When you have a technology that is ultimately more advanced, policymakers cannot just put the toothpaste back into the tube,” he said. “There is no question about whether this technology will be the future of the sector.”

Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, who appeared via prerecorded responses during a panel Jan. 15, stated that policy uncertainty is creating problems for the industry. Things remained consistent until the Biden administration tried to make a push toward electric vehicles, he said.

“Nobody needs to be pro or against electric vehicles. The consumer is ultimately going to be the judge and jury on that. They make millions of decisions with their pocketbooks that drive car companies to decide what kind of vehicles to make. That was our mantra for a long time,” he said.

John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, who appeared with Moreno, said the government should support innovation, safety, emissions reduction and mobility, but not dictate consumer choices.

“That’s a very different government ambition and partnership with industry than having the government tell customers what they can and cannot buy,” he said.

Bozzella said that a degree of certainty and clarity is also needed.

“One person’s clarity could be another person’s EV mandate,” he said.

Regulations need to be able to outlast changes in presidential administrations, he said. While the president is entitled to appoint cabinet secretaries to make market adjustments, “there’s a difference between making adjustments based on market conditions, the state of technology, the cost of those types of things and tearing the entire playbook up and starting off again,” he said.

These kinds of changes are what create a problem across the industry, he said.

Additionally, Bozzella said regulation around electric vehicles needs to stay at the same pace as the demand for the vehicles to help keep investments from becoming “stranded,” he said. While there is still a demand for EVs, it’s moving at a “more realistic” pace, he said.

“Those policies are important for the development of the market over time, but we are where we are right now,” he said. “So, I think you’ll see continued investment, but it’s going to be a slower pace.”",https://www.candgnews.com/storage/cache/articles/10003/800t653c9182fa497a38b03bc89eba496a4a.jpeg,N,,2026-01-19 23:58:38.415023

We are working to protect the Gulf from pollution and industrial expansion that threaten its ecosystems, its wildlife, and its future.","From the Piney Woods of East Texas to the desert canyons of West Texas, from the rolling Hill Country to the marshes and bays of the Gulf Coast, Texas is defined by its extraordinary natural diversity. As Davy Crockett once put it, “Texas is the garden spot of the world.”

Soon spring rains will bring bluebonnets and Indian paintbrush, refilled creeks and rivers, and wildlife stirred back into motion. Migratory birds will return to coastal marshes and urban greenbelts, while paddlers, hikers, and anglers rediscover Texas’s rivers, lakes, and trails.

Throughout the year, Texans seek out wild adventures – pondering the starry skies of Big Bend, floating clear Hill Country rivers, fishing along the coast, and walking shaded trails in city parks from Dallas to Houston to the Rio Grande Valley. These places support wildlife and the quality of life that makes Texas home.

Each year, we stand shoulder to shoulder with Texans across the state to protect the “garden spot” we all love by protecting parks and wildlife, expanding clean energy, keeping our water safe to drink and swim in, reducing waste and expanding recycling and repair opportunities, and holding polluters accountable for harmful air pollution. In 2026, we will continue advancing practical solutions that protect both people and the places we love.

In 2026, our priorities include:

Safeguarding parks, open spaces, and wildlife habitat

Texas’ parks and natural lands provide places to explore, recharge, and connect with nature, while also supporting wildlife and ecological health. We are working to protect what we have and expand access to nature for a growing state.

Supporting the creation of new and expanded Texas state parks through the Centennial Parks Conservation Fund

Connecting landscapes through wildlife corridors, including wildlife crossings that protect animals from vehicle collisions, to preserve biodiversity and ecosystem health

Advancing clean energy

Texas leads the nation in renewable energy and we can continue to power our state while cutting pollution and protecting the landscapes and communities Texans care about.

Speeding up rooftop solar and home energy resilience through streamlined permitting

Reducing pollution and strain on the electric grid by improving the energy efficiency of, and ending taxpayer subsidies for, fast-growing data centers

Pushing back against discriminatory barriers to renewable energy development while ensuring projects are responsibly sited and built to protect land, water, and wildlife

Protecting clean water and the coast

Clean water is fundamental to public health, outdoor recreation, and thriving ecosystems. We are working to stop pollution at its source, invest in modern infrastructure, and protect Texans’ drinking water from toxic contaminants.

Stopping plastic pellet (“nurdle”) pollution before it reaches rivers, bays, and the Gulf

Fighting fecal bacteria pollution in rivers, lakes, and swimming holes by securing funding to repair and upgrade broken wastewater infrastructure that contaminates waterways and drinking water supplies

Protecting drinking water from lead, PFAS, and other toxic pollutants that threaten public health in communities across Texas

Stop oil companies from dumping fracking wastewater into the Pecos River and other waterways

Save the Lavaca River from a proposed dam which would threaten oyster reefs and fish populations

Improving recycling systems and reducing waste

Texas’s waste system is a major and often overlooked source of pollution. Landfills, trash incineration, plastic waste, and so-called “chemical recycling” contaminate air and water, drive climate change, and harm wildlife and human health — even as valuable materials that could be reused or truly recycled are thrown away. We are working to modernize recycling, cut waste at the source, and give Texans more control over the products they buy and use.

Leading the campaign to improve recycling and reduce waste in Houston

Opposing chemical recycling schemes that burn plastic, release hazardous pollution, and lock Texas into continued plastic production instead of real waste reduction

Expanding Right to Repair so Texans can fix their own products, waste less, and keep usable materials out of landfills and waterways

Protecting birds, bees and butterflies

Bees, butterflies, and birds are part of the quiet beauty of the natural world – the flicker of wings over a meadow, the hum in a garden, and the ancient migrations that return life to our landscapes. Many of these species are now in steep decline. We are working to protect them and the places they need to exist, not only for what they do, but because they belong.

Expanding pollinator-friendly habitat along roadsides, in parks, and in communities

Reducing the use of harmful pesticides that threaten bees, butterflies, birds, and other wildlife

Advancing bird-friendly design practices in buildings in Dallas and across the state

Holding polluters accountable

Air pollution is linked to asthma attacks, heart disease, premature deaths, and other serious health harms — and in Texas, much of it comes from oil and gas operations, refineries, and chemical plants. We are working to reduce dangerous air pollution, enforce existing laws, and protect public health across the state.

Reducing methane and other air pollution from oil and gas operations

Preventing harmful emissions from refineries and petrochemical plants

Expanding transit and building bikeable, walkable communities

Texas communities are stronger, healthier, and more connected when people have safe, clean and convenient options for getting around. We are working to expand public transit and create bikeable, walkable places that give Texans more freedom in how they travel and more access to jobs, schools, and everyday destinations.

Supporting the successful build-out of Project Connect to expand high-capacity public transit in Central Texas

Advancing improved service, reliability, and expansion at Dallas Area Rapid Transit and other transit systems across the state

Promoting bikeable and walkable community design, including safer streets, connected trail networks, and infrastructure that protects people walking and biking

Protecting the Gulf

The Gulf is a living, breathing place – shaped by tides and storms, rich with wildlife, and central to the natural heritage of Texas.

(RFD NEWS) — U.S. agriculture is entering 2026 with a noticeably tighter credit environment, requiring producers to be more deliberate with business planning when it comes to operating loans, refinancing, and land purchases. AgAmerica Lending says higher interest rates, compressed margins, and uneven income performance are converging just as many operations rely more heavily on financing to maintain cash flow.

Despite those pressures, balance sheets across agriculture remain relatively strong, supported by resilient farmland values. That equity has helped cushion recent volatility, but lenders are becoming more selective. According to AgAmerica, lenders are placing greater emphasis on liquidity, repayment capacity, and documentation, signaling a shift from readily available credit to more disciplined underwriting.

Crop producers face the most strain. Lower grain and fiber prices, paired with elevated input and labor costs, have tightened working capital and increased dependence on operating credit. A Farmer Mac survey cited by AgAmerica shows nearly 70 percent of ag lenders now view grain and cotton operations as their top risk concern, up sharply from two years ago.

Delinquencies remain contained, but scrutiny is increasing.

Tax Credits for 2025 Hendrix said a few common tax credits for the 2025 tax year include the following: Child Tax Credit: Up to $2,200 per qualifying child under age 17.
Earned Income Tax Credit: This is a refundable credit for working filers.
Education Expenses Tax Credits: • American Opportunity Tax Credit, or AOTC: Up to $2,500 per eligible student per year.
See more details and find other tax credits and deductions at IRS.gov/credits-and-deductions.","LITTLE ROCK — The passage of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act last year will mean significant changes for some taxpayers this season.

Laura Hendrix, extension associate professor of personal finance and consumer economics for the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture, said the changes include no tax on tips, no tax on overtime and an enhanced deduction for seniors age 65 and older.

Hendrix said some of the new changes include the following:

Increased standard deduction amounts for tax year 2025:

• $31,500 for married couples filing jointly.

• $15,750 for single filers and married individuals filing jointly.

• $23,625 for heads of household.

Elimination of taxes on:

• Overtime (for qualified overtime income up to $12,500 or $25,000 for joint filers).

• Tips (for tips totaling up to $25,000).

• This phases out for incomes above $150,000 (or $300,000 for joint filers).

Deduction for seniors:

• Effective from 2025 through 2028, individuals age 65 and older may claim an additional $6,000 deduction.

• This is in addition to the standard deduction for seniors available under existing law.

• This applies per eligible individual (or $12,000 for a married couple if both spouses qualify).

• This phases out for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income over $75,000 (or $150,000 for joint filers).

• Filers must be 65 or older on or before the last day of the tax year.

• This is available for both itemizing and non-itemizing taxpayers.

Increased State and Local Taxes, or SALT, cap:

• The maximum itemized deduction for state and local taxes is temporarily raised to $40,000 (or $20,000 for married filing separately), with a phaseout for high-income earners.

1099-K and 1099-DA:

• “Taxpayers who received more than $20,000 in payments for goods and services in more than 200 transactions through an online marketplace or payment app in 2025 should expect to receive a Form 1099-K in January 2026,” Hendrix said. “The IRS will also receive a copy of your Form 1099-K. 1099-DA is used for reporting digital assets.”

Hendrix said taxpayers should use the new Schedule 1-A to claim recently enacted tax deductions.

Some energy-efficient deductions and credits are being eliminated or capped in 2025, Hendrix said, including the following:

• Home improvements, such as energy-efficient windows, doors and solar installations, sunset after 2025.

• Electric vehicle credits (up to $7,500) go away for EVs purchased after Sept. 30, 2025.

Start Early

The Internal Revenue Service announced it will begin accepting and processing 2025 tax year returns on Jan. 26, with a deadline of April 15. Hendrix recommends preparing early for a smooth tax filing process. Hendrix said consumers should gather the following documents and information to prepare for filing:

• Bank account information for returns via direct deposit

• W-2s from employers

• 1099s from banks and other payers

• Records of digital asset transactions

• Other documents as needed to verify qualifying tax credits or adjustments

Failure to pay taxes by the deadline can result in penalties, but filing extensions are available.

“If you can’t file by the due date of your return, you can request an automatic six-month extension of time to file,” Hendrix said. “However, it’s important to note that an extension of time to file is not an extension of time to pay. You should pay any owed taxes by your original due date to avoid the penalties.”

Those who wish to file an extension should file Form 4868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, by the original due date of their return.

Optimizing Filing Status

Hendrix said that for most married people, filing jointly has benefits, but that is not always the case.

“The best way to find out if you should file jointly or separately is to prepare your tax return both ways,” Hendrix said. “Some couples may prefer to keep their finances separate. Filing separately can limit your liability for your spouse’s tax obligations or debts. Some couples may qualify for more tax credits by filing jointly.”

Major life events can also impact taxes, including marriage, divorce, a new job, having children or buying a home, Hendrix said. Visit irs.gov/individuals/managing-your-taxes-after-a-life-event to learn more.

Taxpayers should also be cautious of calls and emails, as scams are rampant during filing season. To learn more about tax-related scams, visit irs.gov/help/tax-scams.

Tax Credits for 2025

Hendrix said a few common tax credits for the 2025 tax year include the following:

Child Tax Credit: Up to $2,200 per qualifying child under age 17. Income limits and other qualifications apply.

Child and Dependent Care Credit: For the care of a qualifying child under age 13 or a dependent who cannot care for themselves.

Earned Income Tax Credit: This is a refundable credit for working filers. The maximum amount of credit is as follows:

• No qualifying children: $649

• One qualifying child: $4,328

• Two qualifying children: $7,152

• Three or more qualifying children: $8,046

Adoption Credit: This is for qualified expenses paid to adopt an eligible child. For 2025, the maximum credit is up to $17,280.

Education Expenses Tax Credits:

• American Opportunity Tax Credit, or AOTC: Up to $2,500 per eligible student per year. Up to 40 percent (or $1,000) of the credit may be refundable, meaning you can get money back even if you owe no tax.

• Lifetime Learning Credit, or LLC: Up to $2,000 per tax return per year, non-refundable. The LLC is nonrefundable, meaning it can reduce your tax bill to $0 but won't result in a cash refund.

“You cannot claim both credits for the same student in the same year, but you can claim different credits for different students in the same year,” Hendrix said. “For example, you could claim AOTC for one child and LLC for another. You also cannot claim these credits if you are claimed as a dependent on someone else's return.

“Visit IRS.gov to see details of expenses that qualify for each type of education tax credit and income limits,” Hendrix said.

Filing Resources

Depending on an individual filer’s circumstances, Hendrix recommended several filing resources.

“AARP is for filers age 50 and older, and MilTax is for military service members,” Hendrix said. “Income limits apply for most types of free filing.”

Other recommended resources include:

• IRS Free File: gov/filing/irs-free-file-do-your-taxes-for-free

• My Free Taxes: com

• Find sites for VITA and Tax Counseling for the Elderly, or TCE: for.irs.gov/s/sitelocator

• MilTax: mil/financial-legal/taxes/miltax-military-tax-services

• AARP: org/money/taxes/aarp-taxaide/

That’s why President Trump asked governors across the Mid-Atlantic to come together and call upon PJM to allow America to build big reliable power plants again.
The direction includes: Providing long-term certainty for new power generation: Provide 15-year revenue certainty for new power plants to accelerate the development of reliable power generation.
Protecting residential electricity rates: Protect ratepayers by limiting the amount existing power plants can be paid in the PJM capacity market.
The measures will also help keep electricity prices affordable for residential customers, while addressing rising demand from data centers.","U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, vice-chair and chair of the National Energy Dominance Council (NEDC), respectively, joined Mid-Atlantic governors urging PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM), to temporarily overhaul its market rules to strengthen grid reliability and reduce electricity costs for American families and businesses by building more than $15 billion of reliable baseload power generation.

The initiative calls on PJM to conduct an emergency procurement auction to address escalating electricity prices and growing reliability risks across the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. The action follows a series of PJM policies over the years that have weakened the electric grid, including the premature shutdown of reliable power generation.

President Trump declared a National Energy Emergency on his first day in office, warning that the previous administration's energy subtraction agenda left the country vulnerable to blackouts and soaring electricity prices. During the Biden administration, PJM forced nearly 17 gigawatts of reliable baseload power generation offline. For the first time in history, PJM’s capacity auction failed to secure enough generation resources to meet basic reliability requirements. If not fixed, it will lead to further rising prices and blackouts.

“High electricity prices are a choice,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright. “The Biden administration’s forceful closures of coal and natural gas plants without reliable replacements left the United States in an energy emergency. Perhaps no region in America is more at risk than in PJM. That’s why President Trump asked governors across the Mid-Atlantic to come together and call upon PJM to allow America to build big reliable power plants again. Our directives will restore affordable and reliable electricity so American families thrive and America’s manufacturing industries once again boom. President Trump promised to unleash American energy and put the American people first. This plan keeps that promise.""

""For too long, the Green New Scam has left Mid-Atlantic families in the dark with skyrocketing bills,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. “Today, under President Trump's leadership, the National Energy Dominance Council has come up with a solution to end these high costs, roll back the Biden administration’s policies of energy scarcity, and ensure we are powering the Mid-Atlantic and part of the Midwest’s future without charging its citizens a cent. This initiative will ensure we usher in the age of artificial intelligence with new power plants funded by the technology companies, not taxpayers, securing the steel of Pennsylvania, the manufacturing of Ohio, and the ships of Virginia. The Trump administration is keeping the lights on, the factories humming, and the American Dream affordable.""

The direction includes:

Providing long-term certainty for new power generation: Provide 15-year revenue certainty for new power plants to accelerate the development of reliable power generation.

Protecting residential electricity rates: Protect ratepayers by limiting the amount existing power plants can be paid in the PJM capacity market.

Ensuring data centers pay their fair share: Make data centers pay more for new generation than residential customers by allocating costs for any new generation procured to data center customers that have not self-procured new capacity or agreed to be curtailable.

Prioritizing immediate grid stability: Take other steps to ensure more affordable, reliable, and secure electricity for the American people.

The recommendations propose temporary but critical measures to ensure American businesses, especially those in some of the nation’s most manufacturing-intensive regions, have the reliable power they need to operate. The measures will also help keep electricity prices affordable for residential customers, while addressing rising demand from data centers.",https://www.bicmagazine.com/downloads/25968/download/HTVIL74PMNNGJNBJCB52DLTTE4.jpeg?cb=9a02004506a3c358255f4efd53f06326&w=960,N,,2026-01-19 17:58:50.876415

A harsher winter than in previous years has led to a sharp rise in heating needs for buildings, which remain heavily reliant on natural gas and heating oil; emissions from this sector jumped by nearly 7% in one year.","The increase was anticipated, but not its causes. After two years of decline, greenhouse gas emissions rose again in the United States in 2025, up 2.4%, according to an estimate published on January 13 by the Rhodium Group. The rebound defies the most obvious political interpretations. It does not – yet – reflect Donald Trump's repeated attacks on efforts to fight climate change, but instead is the result of a more mundane mix: a cold winter and a soaring demand for electricity, which revived the use of coal.

""It's too soon to see a meaningful impact from policy changes enacted by the Trump administration and Congress,"" said Ben King, the director of US energy at the Rhodium Group.

While additional details for the hearing are not yet available at this time, the release of the Discussion Draft marks a notable milestone in Congress’s increasingly vocal promises to address perceived shortcomings in both the landmark 2016 amendments to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) nearly ten years of implementation that followed. This is the first time that many of the contemplated legislative changes have been shared publicly.

The Discussion Draft would impose sweeping changes to many of the key sections in TSCA, including those pertaining to definitions, testing authorities, review of new chemicals, review and management of existing chemicals, TSCA Inventory nomenclature, relationship to other federal laws, citizens’ petitions, TSCA fees, and more. Although Bergeson & Campbell, P.C. (B&C®) will continue to review carefully this text and its potential implications, we are pleased to share the following highlights and initial observations.

Definitions

Changes to the statutory phrase “conditions of use” that limit EPA’s discretion to identify reasonably foreseen circumstances to those “more likely than not to be” and, in turn, narrow the scope of risk evaluations.

New Chemical Reviews

A narrowed scope of new chemical reviews, limiting the assessment to just the conditions of use “identified by the submitter of the notice” — rather than the current requirement that EPA consider known, intended, and reasonably foreseen circumstances;

A qualifier on how EPA can determine a new chemical may present an unreasonable risk, in that it must be “more likely than not that such unreasonable risk will occur”;

A nondelegable requirement for the EPA Administrator personally to issue a statement for each premanufacture notice (PMN) review that EPA fails to review timely;

A new requirement that EPA make “best efforts” to prioritize review of certain new chemical notices, including those that a submitter identifies as offering specified risk reduction benefits, eligible for Safer Choice program inclusion, or are necessary to “improve the security and resiliency of … domestic critical material supply chains” as identified by the Secretary of Commerce;

Limitations on voluntary suspensions of the new chemical review period;

Changes making EPA’s requirement to address identified risk through Section 5(e) orders now discretionary instead of mandatory; and

New authority for EPA to exempt new chemicals from the review process upon a showing that the activity has been approved by another Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member country.

Existing Chemical Risk Evaluations

New emphasis on the likelihood of exposures/hazards, directing EPA to consider only those that “are more likely than not” to result in unreasonable risk;

Explicit direction to consider the impact of existing federal regulatory limits, and not to assume noncompliance — including noncompliance with U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards;

Change to make all final risk evaluations “final agency action” and thus immediately judicially reviewable, rather than the current requirement that limits judicial review of an unreasonable risk determination until after the promulgation of a final TSCA Section 6 risk management rule;

New compensation process and provisions to address the TSCA fee issue of reliant parties that do not fairly contribute to the risk evaluation fee for the particular chemical;

Extension of TSCA fee authority for another ten years from date bill is signed into law, that would allow EPA to continue to collect fees for risk evaluation activities; and

Further direction to prioritize actual information on the chemical versus analog or modeled data.

Existing Chemical Risk Management

Change to the risk management standard, from requiring EPA to eliminate the identified unreasonable risk to a requirement that EPA “minimize, to the extent reasonably feasible” such risk; and

Amendments to TSCA Section 9 that prohibit EPA from issuing risk management rules that are “inconsistent” with other existing federal requirements.

TSCA Inventory Nomenclature

New requirements for EPA to consider the equivalency of certain Unknown or Variable Composition, Complex reaction products or Biological materials (UVCB) chemical substances, such that they would not be considered new chemical substances and not subject to PMN and review requirements in TSCA Section 5.

Citizens’ Petitions

Removal of authority for citizens to petition EPA for issuance of a TSCA Section 6(a) risk management rule — replaced with new authority for citizens to petition EPA to consider designating a chemical as a high-priority substance for risk evaluation.

TSCA Fee Collection

A ten-year reauthorization of EPA’s authority to collect fees to help defray the costs of its implementation efforts, currently set to expire at the end of Fiscal Year 2026.

Commentary

The Discussion Draft is a culmination of nearly a decade of pent-up frustration with EPA’s efforts to implement TSCA and its perceived failure to live up to the bipartisan expectations and over-brimming optimism of 2016. Nonetheless, the scope and extent of the proposed changes are surprising and begs the question of who exactly the target is of the desired “discussion.” B&C reported last year on cautious agreement by key Senate Democrats that TSCA could benefit from improvement around the edges. Some public health and environmental organizations, to the contrary, have taken the public position that legislative amendments are unnecessary. While many of the ideas outlined in the Discussion Draft are interesting and laudable, this 37-page rewrite of many of the major compromises in the 2016 TSCA amendments is not likely to gain much traction with those constituencies. In the meantime, the clock continues to tick on EPA’s TSCA fee collection authority, the expiration of which B&C believes could exacerbate the TSCA program’s ongoing resource and workload challenges. The forthcoming hearing should shed some light on initial reactions to the Discussion Draft and perhaps set the stage for another round of bipartisan debate leading to addressing the shortcomings of the 2016 amendments.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15432_3114.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 14:59:51.227913

For decades, Canada’s economic survival has relied on a single, unshakeable truth: our proximity to the United States is our greatest shield. However, as we enter 2026, that shield has begun to feel more like a cage. Prime Minister Mark Carney’s recent pivot toward China—marked by his historic January visit to Beijing—is not merely a sudden change in trade policy, but a calculated response to an increasingly transactional and unpredictable Washington. With President Trump openly musing about Canada as a “51st state” and threatening broad tariffs on continental trade, the Carney administration appears to have concluded that the “fortress North America” ideal is crumbling from within. This pivot is a “strategic realism” born of necessity, signaling that Canada can no longer afford to be a passive bystander in a trade war it didn’t start.

The immediate tension of this strategy lies in the trade-off between the $19.2 billion automotive sector and the $14.5 billion canola industry. By slashing EV duties to 6.1% for a 49,000-unit quota in exchange for China dropping its 80% punitive tariffs on Canadian seeds and shellfish, the government is making a clear choice to rescue the Prairies at the potential expense of Ontario’s industrial floor. Yet, the math suggests this is less of a “flood” and more of a managed experiment. A 49,000-unit cap represents only about 3% of the total Canadian vehicle market—essentially restoring the 2023 import levels that were largely dominated by Chinese-made Teslas. By framing this as a “stabilization effort” rather than a broad liberalization, the administration is attempting to provide a vital lifeline to farmers while keeping the actual displacement of domestic manufacturing to a minimum.

This high-wire act faces its greatest test with the looming July 1, 2026, CUSMA review. The initial analysis rightly identifies the risk of American retaliation, as Washington could view the EV quota as a “backdoor” for Chinese influence. There is a real danger that the U.S. might invoke Section 301 investigations or apply 40% “transshipment” tariffs on any Canadian-made vehicle containing Chinese components. However, Carney seems to be building a different kind of leverage. By diversifying Canada’s trade portfolio now, he is signaling to Washington that Ottawa has other options. If the U.S. demands extreme concessions during the summer review, Canada now possesses a “snap-back” chip: the ability to return to a hardline stance against China in exchange for ironclad guarantees on North American market access.

Ultimately, this shift represents Canada’s transition from a junior partner in a continental alliance to a multipolar player in a fragmented global economy. Even as the government lowers financial barriers for Chinese imports, it is simultaneously fortifying “regulatory moats” through strict cybersecurity and national-security screenings for connected vehicles. These measures allow Canada to remain technically aligned with Western security standards while reaping the economic benefits of reopened Eastern markets. It is a gamble, certainly, but it is one predicated on the belief that in 2026, the only thing more dangerous than breaking ranks with an unpredictable ally is having no rank to stand in at all.

USD: Tariff certainty is a myth

Global shocks keep piling up — Venezuela, Iran, Fed independence — and now the Greenland dispute has opened a fresh front. US President Trump has threatened a 10% tariff, rising to 25% in June, on eight key European allies for opposing US control over Greenland. The move effectively torpedoes the US‑EU trade truce agreed only six months ago and has forced Brussels to prepare retaliatory tariffs on €93bn of US goods.

The episode has re‑inflamed NATO tensions, blindsided EU leaders, and ensures Trump dominates the agenda at Davos this Wednesday. It also signals that anyone expecting a calmer second year on trade policy may need to rethink — this is starting to look a lot like last year all over again.

The tariff threat injects another layer of uncertainty into an already crowded geopolitical landscape, raising the risk of a broader risk‑off turn if rhetoric escalates. For markets, the immediate pressure point is Europe: EUR and NOK look most exposed to headline risk, while the Swiss franc looks to be the stand-out winner, acting as a natural hedge against geopolitical stress. European equities — particularly exporters and industrials — face renewed vulnerability. Industrial commodities would likely soften on tariff‑driven demand concerns, while gold and silver stand to benefit if tensions spill over into a wider volatility bid.

The US dollar reaction is likely to remain mixed and relatively contained. A modest bout of USD weakness is logical as markets price a more isolationist US stance, briefly reviving the ‘sell America’ narrative and stirring de‑dollarisation chatter, with the country’s sizeable external liabilities back in focus.

Still, investors have grown increasingly numb to tariff headlines, which tempers the downside, and some investors will likely lean into the ‘TACO trade’ — viewing Trump’s tariff threats as a negotiating tactic rather than a firm policy path — offering the dollar a degree of support. Even so, the latest developments serve as a reminder that the US economy is not immune to the uncertainty generated by Trump’s policy shifts, while lingering concerns over Fed independence — amplified by the delayed nomination of a new chair and the ongoing probe into Jerome Powell — add another layer of caution around the US currency.

Emerging Markets: Rally resumed

The global financial landscape in early 2026 is defined by a sustained period of suppressed currency volatility that has paved the way for a highly profitable regime in the foreign exchange carry trade. Following a structural shift in market dynamics during the second quarter of 2025, the inverse relationship between market turbulence and yield-seeking behavior has become more pronounced, allowing the carry index to climb steadily as investor confidence returns. This environment of relative calm has fundamentally lowered the risk premium required for cross-border investments, encouraging a broad-based migration of capital toward high-yielding assets as the fear of sudden exchange rate swings continues to dissipate.

This macro-level stability has acted as a powerful tailwind for emerging market equities, which are aggressively outperforming global benchmarks in the opening weeks of the year. Capital flows are concentrating in regions that offer the most attractive combination of yield and growth potential, with Latin American and Emerging European markets leading the pack and delivering returns that significantly outpace the broader world index. The synergy between a maturing carry trade and surging local equity valuations indicates a robust “risk-on” cycle, where the convergence of currency stability and high-growth prospects is currently rewarding investors who have pivoted toward developing economies.

The Mexican Peso is staging a surprising technical breakout, slicing through key psychological support levels near the 17.60 handle to mark its most significant weekly advance since November last year. This move has effectively invalidated several bearish divergence signals from late 2025, reclaiming momentum with enough conviction to suggest the 50-day moving average, a level it has respected for months, is no longer a ceiling but a launchpad. With USD/MXN now trading at its lowest levels since July 2024, the path of least resistance appears skewed toward further appreciation. However, sustaining double-digit returns remains a high bar for Latin American currencies as they contend with the gravity of a firming Greenback. Should 2026 see even a modest recovery in the US Dollar Index, the Mexican Peso’s yield advantage will likely struggle to drive further spot appreciation.

Muscat, Oman, January 19, 2026 – IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, announced an investment to help United Solar Polysilicon (FZC) SPC, United Solar, finance its greenfield polysilicon plant in Oman’s Sohar Freezone. The financing aims to boost the manufacturing of polysilicon, creating nearly 3,000 direct and indirect jobs, helping attract foreign direct investments, and advancing Oman’s vision for economic diversification and reduce reliance on oil.

Polysilicon is a key ingredient for the global solar photovoltaic (PV) value chain. At full capacity, the plant is expected to enable the production of approximately 40 gigawatts of solar modules annually, enough to power up to 12 million homes. It will also contribute to the avoidance of 8.8 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year. The polysilicon plant aims to strengthen the resilience and diversification of the global solar PV supply chain and expand energy access. The polysilicon produced from the plant will also be fully traceable, enhancing transparency, and competitiveness.

""The successful financial close reflects a true team effort, supported by the Omani government's agility and strong international confidence in Oman's economy, OIA as the largest shareholder, and United Solar Polysilicon's ability to deliver a world-class project responding to the global energy transition,"" said HE Mulham Al Jarf, OIA's Deputy President for Investment. ""This project will create employment opportunities for Omanis and enable SMEs, while establishing a foundation for future upstream projects and downstream renewable energy integration. It underscores the Authority's commitment to diversifying funding through partnerships with leading institutions such as IFC, and will drive expansion into solar cell and module production, amplifying its long-term economic impact.""

“This is a transformative moment for United Solar, Oman, and the global solar industry,” said Sam Zhang, Founder and Chairman of United Solar. “With OIA and IFC's support, we are building the infrastructure needed to strengthen the global solar supply chain and ensure manufacturers have reliable access to high-quality, traceable polysilicon that meets the world's most rigorous standards.”

“This financing reflects the OPEC Fund’s commitment to supporting low-carbon industrial growth and to strengthening renewable energy value chains in partner countries. By participating as a parallel lender alongside IFC and other partners, the OPEC Fund is supporting the delivery of a project that advances Oman’s economic diversification objectives, strengthens local manufacturing capacity and job creation,” said, Tareq Alnassar, OPEC Fund Vice President for Private Sector.

“Together with USP, Oman Investment Authority, and our international partners, we are committed to strengthening Oman’s export capacity, diversifying the global polysilicon supply chain, and enabling pioneering projects such as this one,” said Ashruf Megahed, IFC Regional Industry Head for Manufacturing, Agribusiness, and Services in the Middle East and Central Asia. “By reinforcing industrial capabilities, the project will significantly expand polysilicon exports, contribute to the growth of global energy production, and support Oman’s long-term economic diversification and industrial transformation.”

Once complete, the $1.6 billion plant, with several investors, will be the Middle East’s largest and only operational polysilicon manufacturing facility, with a planned annual production capacity of 100,000 tons. Oman is United Solar’s largest shareholder.

Globally, about 1,100 gigawatts of new renewable capacity must be added each year, more than double the current expansion rate. Yet renewable energy growth remains concentrated in advanced economies, leaving the vast majority of developing countries behind despite significant economic and development needs, according to a 2024 IFC report.

Polysilicon sector shifts

China’s polysilicon industry is in a state of change as the industry and government pursue ways to counteract the low prices and oversupply, which have caused problems for the sector’s biggest players.

Last year, the government unveiled a number of “anti-internal competition” laws across various industries, in order to curb the low prices and fierce competition which had emerged between Chinese firms. The polysilicon industry has seen that “cutthroat” dynamic play out over the last two years, leading to massive industry overcapacity and ensuing low prices which saw the sector’s major players post regular financial losses.

More recently, the major polysilicon industry firms, led by Daqo, Tongwei and GCL Technologies, established a RMB3 billion “inventory platform” company designed to manage the flow and level of polysilicon capacity and inventory.

Broader Clean Energy Strategy Google’s clean energy purchasing strategy goes beyond these 1.2 GW agreements.","Google has agreed to buy nearly 1.2 gigawatts (GW) of carbon-free energy to power its data centers across the United States. The tech company signed a set of long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with Clearway Energy Group (Clearway). These deals will deliver clean electricity from new wind and solar projects in Missouri, Texas, and West Virginia.

The energy will support the electric grid regions where Google’s data centers are located. The agreements are a big step for the tech giant. They help meet its rising electricity needs and cut carbon emissions from its operations.

Amanda Peterson Corio, Global Head of Data Center Energy, Google, stated:

“Strengthening the grid by deploying more reliable and clean energy is crucial for supporting the digital infrastructure that businesses and individuals depend on. Our collaboration with Clearway will help power our data centers and the broader economic growth of communities within SPP, ERCOT, and PJM footprints.”

How Google Secures Carbon-Free Power

A Power Purchase Agreement is a long-term contract between a power buyer and a clean energy producer. In Google’s case, these contracts ensure that the projects Clearway builds will sell electricity to the grid. In return, Google pays for the energy produced over many years.

Clearway agreed to provide Google with 1.17 GW of new carbon-free energy. This energy will support regional grids like SPP, ERCOT, and PJM. The total partnership includes a 71.5 megawatt (MW) clean power deal in West Virginia. This brings the total to around 1.24 gigawatts (GW) of clean energy for Google’s use.

These projects will generate wind and solar power and deliver it into U.S. grid systems that serve Google’s data centers. The total investment in the new energy infrastructure tied to these deals exceeds $2.4 billion.

Construction for the new wind and solar assets is expected to begin soon, with the first facilities planned to start operations in 2027 and 2028.

The states involved are Missouri, Texas, and West Virginia. These states cover parts of major grid regions like SPP (Southwest Power Pool), ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of Texas), and PJM Interconnection, which deliver power to millions of customers and data centers.

Why Google Is Investing in Clean Power

Google has set clear climate goals tied to its fast-growing energy use. In 2020, the company became the first major corporation to match 100% of its annual electricity use with renewable energy purchases. This means Google buys enough clean power each year to equal all the electricity its operations consume. However, this approach does not guarantee clean energy at every hour.

To address this gap, Google launched a more ambitious target. The company aims to operate on carbon-free energy, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, by 2030. This goal goes beyond traditional renewable matching. It requires clean electricity to be available every hour in the same regions where Google uses power. This makes energy sourcing more complex and increases the need for new clean generation near data centers.

Google has also committed to reaching net-zero emissions across its operations and value chain by 2030. This includes direct emissions, purchased electricity, and indirect emissions from suppliers and construction.

The tech company does not plan to rely heavily on carbon offsets for this goal. Instead, it focuses on cutting emissions at the source, mainly by cleaning up the electricity supply.

Progress so far shows both gains and challenges. In 2024, Google reported net emissions of about 18 million metric tons of CO₂-equivalent, up from 14.3 million in 2023. The increase came largely from data center expansion and higher electricity demand from artificial intelligence workloads.

At the same time, Google reduced the carbon intensity of its electricity use by about 12% compared with the previous year. This shows efficiency gains, even as total energy use rose.

Clean energy purchases play a key role in this strategy. By signing long-term power purchase agreements, Google helps bring new wind and solar projects online. These projects add clean power to local grids and lower emissions over time.

The nearly 1.2 GW of carbon-free energy announced for U.S. data centers supports this approach. It increases clean supply in regions where Google’s power demand is growing fastest.

Broader Clean Energy Strategy

Google’s clean energy purchasing strategy goes beyond these 1.2 GW agreements. The company continues to enter renewable contracts around the world. For example:

Google and TotalEnergies signed a 15-year PPA to supply 1.5 terawatt-hours (TWh) of certified renewable electricity from the Montpelier solar farm in Ohio. This power will help support Google’s data centers in that region.

Google is also active in international renewable power agreements. It has signed a 21-year PPA with TotalEnergies. This deal provides 1 TWh of solar power for its data centers in Malaysia.

In India, Google made a deal with ReNew Energy. They will build a 150 MW solar project in Rajasthan. This project will generate about 425,000 MWh of clean electricity each year, which is enough to power more than 360,000 homes.

These deals illustrate how Google is diversifying its clean energy supply by securing multiple sources and technologies across continents.\

Impact on Data Centers and Regional Grids

Data centers use large amounts of electricity. U.S. data centers’ electricity consumption reached 183 TWh in 2024, accounting for more than 4% of the nation’s total power demand amid surging AI workloads. ​This marked a continued rise from 176 TWh (4.4%) in 2023. Projections suggest 5% or higher in 2025 as hyperscale facilities expand rapidly.

When powered by fossil fuels, they also produce high carbon emissions. Clean energy purchases help reduce the carbon footprint of these facilities over time.

As data center demand continues to grow, companies like Google are adding new clean power to the grid. Long-term power purchase agreements support the construction of new wind and solar projects. These projects supply clean electricity to regional grids and benefit all users, not only data centers. This helps lower the overall carbon intensity of power systems.

What This Means for Corporate Renewable Leadership

Google’s nearly 1.2 GW clean energy purchase reflects a wider industry shift. Large technology firms are becoming some of the world’s biggest buyers of renewable power. As artificial intelligence and cloud services expand, long-term clean energy contracts help companies secure a stable power supply and manage energy costs.

These corporate agreements also play a key role in the U.S. energy market. Long-term PPAs give developers the financial certainty needed to build new renewable projects. Supported by policy incentives and rising corporate demand, U.S. wind and solar capacity continues to grow. This makes large clean energy portfolios increasingly viable for companies like Google.

The Clearway deal adds to Google’s global portfolio of renewable energy contracts. This portfolio spans multiple regions and energy technologies. By securing large volumes of clean power, Google is strengthening the sustainability of its data centers as digital demand continues to rise.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_2401582411.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 12:59:32.961948

A national study finds that more than half of those facilities may already be at risk as soon as 2050, turning future storms into potential toxic events rather than just high water.

These sites store or handle sewage, trash, oil, gas, and other materials, and many sit next to neighborhoods that already live with heavy pollution. The research, led by Lara J. Cushing at the University of California, Los Angeles and funded by the Environmental Protection Agency, concludes that low-income communities and communities of color are more likely to live close to facilities projected to flood.

Thousands of coastal facilities already on a ticking clock

To map the danger, Cushing’s team examined more than 47,600 coastal facilities, then combined their locations with sea level projections for 2050 and 2100. They focused on floods with about a one in one hundred chance of happening in any given year, a standard often used for insurance and building rules.

Under a high-pollution path, the study projects that 5,500 sites could face that level of flooding by 2100 and nearly 3,800 as soon as mid century. About 44 percent of the at-risk facilities are fossil fuel ports or terminals, with 30 percent power plants, 24 percent refineries, and 22 percent sewage treatment plants, largely in seven states including Louisiana, Florida, New Jersey, Texas, California, New York, and Massachusetts.

How rising seas can turn industrial sites into toxic floods

Sea level rise might sound slow, but it changes the starting point for every storm and high tide. As oceans warm and expand and some stretches of coastline sink, water can reach farther inland, overtopping defenses that once felt solid and pooling in low-lying industrial zones.

So what happens when floodwater moves through facilities that store fuel, chemicals, or waste? It can pick up those substances and carry them into nearby streets and homes. Public health experts such as Sacoby Wilson at the University of Maryland warn that people near sewage plants or large animal farms could encounter bacteria such as E. coli, while those near refineries face metals and chemicals tied to stomach illness, rashes, breathing trouble, and in the long run higher risks of organ damage or cancer.

Who lives closest to the danger?

The researchers then asked who lives within about two thirds of a mile of facilities that are expected to flood and compared those neighborhoods with other coastal areas that do not have an at-risk site. They found higher shares of renters, households in poverty, seniors, people who identify as Hispanic, and residents without cars near the hazardous sites.

That pattern echoes broader research on environmental injustice and earlier mapping of toxic flood risks in coastal California.Derek Van Berkel at the University of Michigan, who was not involved in the new study, said the most “alarming” part is the feedback loop as repeated floods spread contamination and make it harder for residents to recover before the next disaster.

Limits of the analysis and what could still change

Like any model, the analysis has blind spots. It leaves out some risky infrastructure such as oil and gas pipelines and does not estimate how future storms will change flooding, so the real-world threat could be higher.

The future is not fixed, and the authors say their flood model is best used as a screening tool rather than a precise forecast. Under a lower-pollution path, the study estimates that over 300 sites could avoid serious flood danger by 2100, and Thomas Chandler at Columbia University’s National Center for Disaster Preparedness calls this “a really important study” for planners trying to prevent disasters where damaged facilities spread toxins into floodwater. Cushing said “we do have time to respond and try to mitigate the risks and also increase resilience,” but that will only happen if officials, companies, and residents start planning before the next big flood arrives.

A New Approach to Power Efficiency

Researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have developed a new silicon carbide based power module designed to dramatically improve how electricity is converted and delivered. A power module is the housing that contains power electronics, which regulate the flow of electricity between systems. This new design delivers record-breaking efficiency, higher power density, and a manufacturing process that keeps costs low.

The technology is known as NREL's Ultra-Low Inductance Smart power module, or ULIS. By using silicon carbide semiconductors, ULIS can achieve five times the energy density of earlier designs while taking up less space. That combination allows manufacturers to build equipment that is smaller, lighter, and more energy efficient. The 1200-volt, 400-amp module is well suited for data centers, electrical grids, microreactors, and heavy-duty platforms such as next-generation aircraft and military vehicles.

Why Ultra-Low Inductance Matters

A key advantage of ULIS is its exceptionally low parasitic inductance, which refers to resistance that slows changes in electrical current and limits efficient power conversion. ULIS reduces this resistance by seven to nine times compared with today's most advanced silicon carbide power modules.

Because the system can switch electrical current extremely quickly and efficiently, it converts more of the available electricity into usable power. That capability allows ULIS to extract significantly more value from the same energy supply, making it a strong candidate for addressing growing global energy needs.

""We consider ULIS to be a true breakthrough,"" said Faisal Khan, NREL's chief power electronics researcher and the principal investigator for the project. ""It's a future-proofed, ultrafast power module that will make the next generation of power converters more affordable, efficient, and compact.""

Built for Reliability in Extreme Conditions

ULIS is designed not only for efficiency, but also for reliability in demanding environments. According to Khan, the lightweight yet powerful module can monitor its own condition and anticipate component failures before they happen.

This feature is especially critical for high-risk applications such as aviation and military operations. For aircraft operating at 30,000 feet or vehicles navigating combat zones, early failure detection can be the difference between mission success and catastrophic loss.

""ULIS was a truly organic effort, built entirely in-house here at NREL,"" Khan said. ""We are very excited to demonstrate its strengths in real-world settings.""

A Radical Redesign for Lower Cost Manufacturing

Many of ULIS' performance gains come from a completely new physical design.

Traditional power modules stack semiconductor devices inside box-like packages. ULIS instead arranges its circuitry in a flat, octagonal layout. This disk-shaped structure fits more components into a smaller footprint, reducing both size and weight. At the same time, its innovative current routing minimizes magnetic interference, which helps deliver cleaner electrical output and higher overall efficiency.

""Our biggest concern was that the device switches off and on very quickly, and we needed a layout that wouldn't create a chokepoint within the design,"" said Shuofeng Zhao, an NREL power electronics researcher who designed ULIS' flux cancellation architecture.

Early concepts explored complex three-dimensional shapes, including designs resembling flowers or hollow cylinders. However, these ideas proved too expensive or difficult to manufacture. The breakthrough came when the team simplified the concept into a nearly two-dimensional structure. Sarwar Islam, another NREL power electronics researcher, proposed the flattened design that balanced performance, cost, and manufacturability.

""We squished it flat, like a pancake,"" Zhao said, ""and suddenly we had a low-cost, high-performing design that was much easier to fabricate.""

Joshua Major, also part of the NREL power electronics team, developed new fabrication methods that allowed the intricate structure to be produced using only in-house tools and facilities. The result was a design that combined the electrical advantages of three-dimensional systems with the practicality of flat manufacturing.

Flexible Materials and Wireless Control

ULIS also departs from conventional materials. Traditional power modules bond copper directly to rigid ceramic bases to conduct electricity and manage heat. While effective, this approach limits flexibility.

Instead, ULIS bonds copper to a flexible polymer called Temprion. This change produces a thinner, lighter, and more adaptable structure. The material bonds to copper using only heat and pressure, and its components can be machined with widely available equipment. As a result, manufacturing costs fall into the hundreds of dollars rather than the thousands.

Another major advance allows ULIS to operate wirelessly. The module can be controlled and monitored without physical cables, functioning as a self-contained unit. This modular, Lego-like design allows it to be integrated into a wide range of systems, from data center servers to advanced aircraft and military vehicles. A patent for the low-latency wireless communication protocol, led by Sarwar Islam, is currently pending.

Designed for Future Technologies

While ULIS currently relies on advanced silicon carbide semiconductors, the design was intentionally built to evolve. The module can be adapted for future semiconductor materials, including gallium nitride and gallium oxide, which has not yet reached commercial use.

Together, these innovations support a central goal. As societies become increasingly dependent on reliable electricity, ULIS is designed to deliver efficiency without sacrificing dependability.

Where ULIS Could Make the Biggest Difference

ULIS is expected to have broad impact across multiple sectors.

In the U.S. power grid, electricity must be converted into usable forms before it reaches consumers. This process often depends on large, low-frequency equipment that wastes energy. ULIS' fast switching improves efficiency while its ability to tolerate high temperatures may reduce long-term maintenance costs.

In aviation, the module's ability to move electricity quickly and conserve energy enables lighter and more powerful converters. This could help make electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft more practical and commercially viable.

ULIS could also play a role in future fusion energy systems. Although commercial fusion remains under development, these systems will require compact and reliable pulsed power components. ULIS' ultralow inductance and durable design make it well suited for that challenge.

As industries pursue more reliable electricity, advanced artificial intelligence, and next-generation vehicles, ULIS is now available for licensing.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/1920/nrel-ulis-power-module.webp,N,,2026-01-19 13:58:48.087637

CONTACT: John Peevers Bruce Power 5193863799 john.peevers@brucepower.com","Kincardine, Ontario, Jan. 19, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Ontario Chamber of Commerce (OCC) independent economic impact analysis final report confirms a proposed new large-scale Bruce C nuclear project would deliver lasting job creation, stimulate Ontario’s economy, and reinforce Canada’s long-term energy security for decades to come.

The economic analysis – Bruce C Economic Impact Assessment – Summary of Findings — conducted by the Ontario Chamber of Commerce and Prism Economics and Analysis for the Nuclear Innovation Institute — finds that the Bruce C Project would generate major economic benefits locally, provincially and nationally, driven by both its construction and operating life.

The Bruce C project’s direct benefits would be concentrated in Ontario, contributing more than $217-billion to Ontario’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) during its 80-year lifespan; and would contribute $2.3 billion to the Clean Energy Frontier (Bruce, Grey and Huron Counties) regional GDP on an average annual basis.

“Ontario’s nuclear advantage is powering our future and showcasing the very best of Canadian technology, resources, and workers,” said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Energy and Mines. “Bruce C represents one of greatest drivers of economic growth in Canada, creating 18,900 jobs and $238 billion lift to Canada’s GDP over its 80-year lifespan. It is clear that Bruce Power’s C is essential to Ontario’s energy and economic future, as we build on-time and on-budget.”

The proposed addition of up to 4,800 megawatts (MW) of energy production through the Bruce C Project, currently undergoing a federal integrated Impact Assessment, would make Bruce Power the largest nuclear generator in the world with a capacity of 12,000 MW. The company is Canada’s largest public-private partnership and its Life-Extension Program and Major Component Replacement Project is the country’s biggest privately financed electricity infrastructure project in Canada.

“The Ontario Chamber of Commerce independent economic impact analysis confirms what our communities already know — Bruce C has the potential to be a once‑in‑a‑generation economic engine,” said James Scongack, Bruce Power’s Chief Operating Officer and Executive Vice-President. “From job creation and economic growth to long-term energy security, the benefits will be felt in the Clean Energy Frontier region, as well as across Ontario and Canada.”

Of the nearly $238-billion contribution to Canada’s GDP, approximately $61 billion would be generated during the site preparation and construction phase, and more than $176 billion during the operations phase.

“The Bruce C Project would be an investment in strengthening our communities and the economy, while empowering skilled workers and innovation across Ontario,” said Pat Dalzell, Bruce Power’s Vice-President, Corporate Affairs and Market Development. “Bruce Power is committed to creating lasting prosperity while delivering the reliable, carbon‑free electricity and cancer-fighting medical isotopes to power the next century of Canadian innovation and opportunity.”

During the proposed site preparation and construction phase, an estimated annual average total of 18,900 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs would be created or supported nationally, of which nearly 15,900 jobs would be created or supported in Ontario.

The subsequent operations phase would result in an annual average of over 6,700 FTE jobs nationally, with nearly 5,900 jobs in Ontario. Overall, more than 10,100 total FTE jobs would be created or supported in Canada each year over the Project’s entire lifespan, of which approximately 8,700 would be in Ontario.

These jobs would provide average annual labour income (including wages and benefits) of approximately $1 billion at the national level, of which nearly $900 million would be earned annually by those employed in Ontario.

Aside from employment benefits, tax revenues of $55-million annually for municipal governments within the Clean Energy Frontier would help spawn growth in Bruce Power’s surrounding communities.

“As the host community, we’re proud to work with Bruce Power to advance the Bruce C Project and understand the significant economic impact it would bring,” said Kenneth Craig, Mayor of the Municipality of Kincardine. “Our region has long been a leader in clean energy and this project ensures we remain at the forefront of Canada’s clean-energy future.”

“This project represents a transformational opportunity for Bruce County,” said Luke Charbonneau, Bruce County Warden and Mayor of the Town of Saugeen Shores. “The economic benefits, training opportunities, and long-term jobs will make life better for families and businesses throughout our region for decades.”

Bruce Power’s current Life-Extension Program and ongoing operations create and sustain 27,000 direct and indirect jobs annually.

With 95 per cent of Bruce Power’s current spend in Canada through a robust and long-standing made-in-Ontario supply chain, the Bruce C Project would build on Bruce Power’s Canadian at our Core campaign, which hinges on commitments to provide safe, reliable power to Ontario and cancer-fighting medical isotopes globally, drive the economy and strengthen partnerships with Indigenous communities.

The companies on January 7 noted that the transaction, first announced as a $16.4-billion deal a year ago, unites Constellation’s nuclear power fleet with Calpine’s natural gas-fired and geothermal generation. The cash-and-stock deal, when including debt, has a total value of $26.6 billion.

The groups said the merged company will power data centers, advanced manufacturing facilities, and critical infrastructure.

“This isn’t just about two great companies coming together—it’s about strengthening America’s future,” said Joe Dominguez, president and CEO of Constellation, in a statement “Constellation is stepping up to power America’s growth when our nation’s demand for energy is surging, and our global competitors are racing to capture AI leadership. By uniting Constellation and Calpine, we’re providing the reliable, clean energy that keeps our communities strong, our businesses competitive and our nation secure.”

‘Exciting Day’

“As a decades-long investor in power generation, ECP aims to unlock value, drive long-term growth opportunities and strengthen asset reliability—often serving as a bridge between public and private markets,” said Tyler Reeder, president and managing partner of ECP. “We are proud to have achieved those goals in partnership with Calpine’s management team and believe this combination validates that vision, setting the company up for future success while meeting the evolving needs of its customers, communities and the U.S.’s electrical grid.”

The combined company will serve 2.5 million retail and business customers nationwide. The groups said the acquisition also strengthens Constellation’s footprint in high-demand regions, including Texas and California, while maintaining significant operations in Illinois, Maryland, New York and Pennsylvania.

Constellation and Calpine together have 55 GW of generation capacity. The company will maintain headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland, along with a significant presence in Houston, Texas.

Antitrust Settlement

The U.S. Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, together with the attorney general of Texas, on December 5 said it would require divestiture of six power plants in Delaware, Pennsylvania, and Texas to resolve antitrust concerns arising from Constellation’s acquisition of Calpine. The Antitrust Division had filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to block the proposed acquisition. At the same time, the Division filed a proposed settlement that it said, upon court approval, would resolve the Division’s competitive concerns.

“The price of electricity is a pocketbook issue to American consumers working hard to afford their monthly utility bills. When it comes to their electricity bills, Americans deserve the benefit of robust competition among electricity generators,” said Assistant Attorney General Abigail Slater of the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. “This settlement includes a six-plant divestiture to an acquisition that risked harming tens of millions of electricity consumers in the mid-Atlantic and Texas. I am appreciative of the partnership with our co-plaintiff, the State of Texas, to secure relief for consumers.”

The DOJ said the divestitures “resolve the Division’s concerns that the acquisition would harm competition and lead to higher prices on consumers reliant on the ERCOT and PJM electricity grids.” Specifically, the settlement requires the companies to divest their ownership interests in four electricity plants serving PJM and two electricity plants serving ERCOT. The divested plants are:

Safeguarding Heritage Through Adaptation This transition from awareness to action signals the emergence of a new generation of agricultural stewards in southern Iraq.
They are shaping its outcome and ensuring that agricultural heritage in southern Iraq remains productive, resilient, and alive for generations to come.","Across southern Iraq, agriculture has long been the backbone of communities, sustaining livelihoods, cultures, and identities for generations. From the iconic date palms of Basra to the wheat fields and vegetable farms of Thi Qar, Maysan, and Muthanna, farming has never been simply an occupation. It is a living inheritance. Today, that inheritance is under pressure, but a new generation of farmers is reshaping its future through science, renewable energy, and climate-resilient practices.

Inheritance Under Pressure

For decades, traditional agricultural systems provided stability in southern Iraq. However, accelerating climate pressures have begun to erode these foundations. Farmers are facing chronic water scarcity, rising soil salinity, saltwater intrusion into rivers, and widening energy gaps that undermine productivity and sustainability. Practices such as flood irrigation, once effective, are increasingly incompatible with declining water availability and degraded land.

Field assessments revealed the scale of the challenge. Nearly two-thirds of surveyed farmers still relied on flood irrigation, while soil and water salinity testing remained limited. Financial constraints, lack of technical knowledge, and unreliable access to energy were consistently cited as barriers to modernization. Dependence on diesel fuel and unstable electricity supplies further increased costs and vulnerability. Without timely intervention, agricultural systems that had endured for centuries risked becoming unsustainable.

Recognizing this urgency, the Government of Japan and UNDP Iraq launched a targeted programme under the initiative “Strengthening Conflict-Sensitive, Peace-Positive Climate Action in the Southern and Euphrates Region of Iraq.” The objective extended beyond introducing new technologies. It aimed to enable farmers to transition toward low-emission, climate-resilient practices capable of protecting land, livelihoods, and social stability for future generations.

A Scientific Awakening Rooted in Local Reality

The transformation began with evidence. Prior to implementation, the project conducted surveys, land assessments, and market studies across Basra, Thi Qar, Maysan, and Muthanna. More than 250 farmers were consulted to identify constraints, priorities, and realistic entry points for change. The findings shaped a practical, context-specific curriculum designed to address salinity, inefficient water use, energy insecurity, and limited exposure to climate-smart agriculture.

Learning was grounded in practice rather than theory. In late 2025, intensive three-day trainings were delivered across the four governorates, engaging over 185 farmers in a hands-on, learning-by-doing approach. Abstract concepts were translated into tangible skills that could be applied immediately in the field.

Farmers strengthened their ability to manage land under saline and water-scarce conditions by improving drainage, increasing irrigation efficiency, and adopting measures to reduce soil degradation. They deepened their understanding of how salinity affects crops, explored salt-tolerant varieties, and learned how informed water management can restore productivity rather than exhaust resources.

For many participants, science became tangible for the first time. Farmers tested their own soil and water, measured electrical conductivity, learned by the word of mouth of peers. Knowledge shifted from distant theory to practical decision-making embedded in daily agricultural work.

The training also extended to livestock management. Improved feeding practices, manure handling, and hygiene measures demonstrated how animal health, environmental protection, and productivity are interconnected.

From Knowledge to Confidence and Action

The results were immediate and measurable. Pre- and post-training assessments showed significant gains in technical knowledge across all governorates. More importantly, these gains translated into confidence. Farmers reported a stronger ability to understand, adapt, and apply modern practices within their own constraints.

Across Basra, Thi Qar, Maysan, and Muthanna, the majority of participants expressed readiness to implement at least one new practice immediately, while others indicated strong intent to adopt changes in the near term. Improved irrigation scheduling, modern irrigation systems, and renewable energy solutions consistently ranked as top priorities.

At the center of this shift was a growing commitment to solar energy. Farmers identified solar-powered water pumping as a viable alternative to unreliable electricity grids and costly diesel fuel. Solar power offered stability, reduced emissions, and long-term affordability. When combined with improved irrigation management, it enabled farmers to reduce water loss, stabilize production during peak seasons, and protect soil and income from climate and energy volatility.

Sustainability, once perceived as an abstract concept, became a practical strategy grounded in everyday choices. Cleaner energy, smarter water use, healthier soils, and lower operating costs formed a pathway toward resilient livelihoods.

Safeguarding Heritage Through Adaptation

This transition from awareness to action signals the emergence of a new generation of agricultural stewards in southern Iraq. Farmers are no longer positioned solely as those affected by climate change. They are increasingly acting as agents of adaptation, using science and renewable energy to preserve their heritage through transformation rather than resistance.

By anchoring traditional knowledge in evidence and pairing ancestral practices with modern tools, these farmers are doing more than sustaining production. They are protecting a way of life. Fields are becoming spaces of experimentation and resilience, where solar energy replaces uncertainty, irrigation is guided by data rather than guesswork, and stewardship is measured not only by harvests, but by the long-term health of ecosystems.

They are not merely enduring the climate crisis. They are shaping its outcome and ensuring that agricultural heritage in southern Iraq remains productive, resilient, and alive for generations to come.

About the Project

The project “Strengthening Conflict-Sensitive, Peace-Positive Climate Action in the Southern and Euphrates Region of Iraq” is implemented by UNDP Iraq with the support of the Government of Japan through the Japan Supplementary Budget. It responds to intensifying climate pressures in southern Iraq, particularly water scarcity, soil salinity, land degradation, and energy insecurity, which threaten agricultural livelihoods, food security, and community stability. The initiative promotes scalable, evidence-based solutions that link climate resilience with peacebuilding and sustainable development.",https://www.undp.org/themes/custom/undpglobal/images/meta-undp-logo.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 14:59:43.467317

The Trump administration initiative calls on PJM Interconnection, which serves 67 million customers in 13 states, not including South Carolina, and Washington, D.C., to conduct an emergency procurement auction to address escalating electricity prices and growing reliability risks across the mid-Atlantic region.

PJM later on Friday unveiled its own plan, which called for big data centers to voluntarily bring their own new generation or face the potential of having their power supply curtailed during peak demand periods. The grid operator also called for the creation of an accelerated interconnection track for state-sponsored generation projects.

At a White House event, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum joined several state governors to discuss initiatives to speed the construction of more than $15 billion in new power generation on PJM, which has been criticized for being too slow to build a cushion against rotating blackouts as demand rises.

Rapid expansion of data centers to fuel things like artificial intelligence has stretched the resources of PJM and other regional U.S. electric grids. President Donald Trump is seeking to combat consumer price inflation that risks undermining support for Republicans ahead of November's midterm elections.

The White House is seeking caps on the amount existing power plants can charge in the PJM capacity market. A recent PJM capacity market auction set record-high prices for power generators that were more than 800% higher than the previous year, increasing electricity prices for homes and businesses.

The agreement would also require data centers to pay for the new generation built on their behalf – whether they show up and use the power or not - rather than buying up existing power. The concept is called BYOG, or ""bring your own generation.""

PJM said it is reviewing the principles set forth by the White House and governors. PJM was not invited to the event, a PJM spokesperson told Reuters.

PJM has forecast that the grid's peak usage in the summer will climb by about 70 gigawatts to 220 gigawatts over the next 15 years. The record summer peak for PJM was 165 gigawatts in 2006.

Since 2023, PJM says it has processed more than 170 gigawatts of new generation requests. Nearly 60 gigawatts of projects have completed PJM's study process and have either signed or been offered generation interconnection agreements.

Rising power bills in PJM's region have led to a political backlash over the last year and threats by some governors to abandon the regional grid. Last summer, nine state governors wrote an open letter to the PJM board of managers criticizing the grid operator for not doing enough to address an escalating electricity affordability crisis.

""Unfortunately, what we have seen in our region is that PJM has been too damn slow to let new generation onto the grid at a time where energy demand is going up,"" Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro said at the White House event on Friday.

Burgum said PJM has been lucky so far in avoiding widespread blackouts.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/d0/4d062032-0238-4d7f-b0ed-c71a5acb313b/66b22c3870bb0.image.jpg?crop=1762%2C925%2C0%2C0&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2026-01-19 13:59:09.816180

25%: Canada’s EV Tariff Deal With China Puts The U.S., Auto Industry On Alert

As we reported on Friday, the China-Canada deal is small for now—it’s capped at 49,000 cars for its first year, with expansion to 70,000 within five years. But it’s a start (or rather a restart, since it returns Canada to its pre-2023 tariff deal) to something potentially big: the growing expansion of Chinese EVs into North America. And as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney explicitly said, most of these imports will cost under $25,000 U.S. (about $35,000 CAD).

Naturally, not everyone is happy about what could be a threat to automotive jobs in North America. Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, blamed the Trump administration’s strained relations with Canada, reports The Hill:

“We just got absolutely rolled in this Canada – China deal. A stark foreign policy failure with domestic economic consequences,” Schatz wrote in a post on social platform X.

“The most basic principle in politics and geopolitics is loyalty to friends. And we weren’t just disloyal – we were hostile. So here we are,” he added.

President Donald Trump, for his part, appeared to give the deal a thumbs-up: “If you can get a deal with China, you should do that,” Trump told reporters. Other U.S. economic officials said Canada will ultimately regret the deal.

My colleague Kevin Williams has a good story about what’s at stake, and why leaders in the auto-producing parts of Canada are especially unhappy about the deal. And it brings plenty of concern among U.S. auto industry observers as well. From the Associated Press:

Chinese automakers will have to meet standards required for the Canadian auto market for the latest trade arrangement to be successful—standards that are similar to those in the U.S.—which is likely to incentivize Chinese auto manufacturing investment in Canada.

They’ll also have to establish which segment of the market they are targeting there: Higher-end vehicles, or less-expensive ones that sell at higher volumes.

Regardless, “It brings it home to what is needed to compete globally,” said Mark Wakefield, global automotive market lead at AlixPartners. The firm predicts Chinese brands will account for 30% of the global market by 2030.

“They’ve already started in Europe. They started in South America. Now Mexico and Canada,” Wakefield said. American carmakers “don’t want to end up as a Brazil with your ethanol-based cars that aren’t sellable anywhere else in the world and ... like Britain or Australia that used to matter in the auto world, and no longer really matter.”

Emphasis mine above, because that is indeed a scary outcome for the U.S. auto industry.

Then again, if it brings more affordable hybrid and zero-emission options to North America—and the way things are potentially going, the U.S. included—and is that such a bad thing? Ultimately, North Americans will have to make a choice: affordability or loyalty to local production.

Unless, of course, our automakers can meet people halfway and get that $50,000 average new car price down considerably.

50%: The Canada-China Trade Deal Is Good News For Tesla

Tesla had a bad year in Canada in 2025, with sales dropping nearly 64% amid the U.S. trade war and CEO Elon Musk’s multiple controversies. But the China trade deal could be good news for the electric automaker: it builds a ton of cars in China, including ones it exports to Canada (unlike the U.S.)

And now, those just got a whole lot cheaper, potentially. Here’s Reuters with more:

While many Chinese automakers will be keen to seize the opportunity as they expand exports, Tesla has an advantage as it in 2023 already equipped its Shanghai plant, its biggest and most cost-efficient factory globally, to build and export a Canada-specific version of its Model Y.

The U.S. automaker had that same year started shipping the car from Shanghai to Canada, boosting Canadian imports of automobiles from China to its largest port, Vancouver, by 460% year over year to 44,356 in 2023.

But it was forced to stop in 2024 and switched to shipping from its U.S. and Berlin factories after Ottawa imposed 100% tariffs, citing a wish to counter what they called China's intentional state-directed policy of overcapacity.

""This new agreement could allow resumption of those exports rather quickly,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of research firm AutoForecast Solutions.

Now, to see if Canadians actually line up to buy those cars.

75%: Affordability Anxiety Will Define 2026’s Car Market

But all of this, I’d argue, isn’t even a technology issue or a geopolitical one: it’s an affordability issue. The appeal of Chinese imports is that they’re good and they’re cheap—a combination that feels in short supply in the North American car market.

According to Automotive News, affordability anxiety was the overwhelming vibe at the 2026 Detroit Auto Show. And while carmakers may breathe a sigh of relief that they’re no longer under a regulatory gun to make tons of EVs now that fuel economy requirements have been eased, they can’t lean on super-expensive gas trucks to save the day like they used to:

“What’s holding the market back is certainly affordability and really the lack of low-priced vehicles,” said Michael Robinet, executive director of automotive consulting at S&P Global Mobility. “Not only in the United States, but around the world, this is a problem.”

Sen. Bernie Moreno, a former car dealer and member of the committee working to reschedule testimony from the Detroit 3 CEOs, said the Trump administration is easing regulations to help bring down vehicle costs and that automakers also have a role to play. The government is rolling back emissions standards and in September eliminated a $7,500 tax credit that had greatly fueled EV demand.

It now takes about 36 weeks of median income to buy an average new vehicle, according to Cox Automotive data. That’s down from 42 weeks three years ago but not necessarily a sign affordability has significantly improved, Cox Executive Analyst Erin Keating said.

“Even with affordable vehicles out there, fewer buyers are buying. The consensus is that this shift isn’t temporary. ... That’s one reason dealer sentiment reflects concern. The missing customers aren’t sidelined. They’re essentially excluded.”

So how do they plan to meet the moment? According to that story, Jeep and Ram parent company Stellantis is preparing more models priced under $40,000 and even $30,000 (though I’ll believe the latter when I see it) and even Ford said it might consider making sedans again after canceling all of them in 2020.

One bright spot for EV fans: the falling costs of batteries should make electric power more affordable. But clearly, the demand is there for new cars that won’t break the bank. And if the familiar automakers won’t deliver, it seems China Inc. is ready to.

100%: How Much Does It Matter To You Where Your Car Is Made?

I have owned Toyotas made in the United States, a Chevrolet and a Mazda made in Mexico, and a Kia made in South Korea (that's now made in Georgia instead), among other things. I can't say that production origin means all that much to me in a globalized world.

So is that a priority for you when you buy a car? Sound off in the comments.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) of 2025 introduced comprehensive foreign entity of concern (FEOC) rules that prohibit taxpayers considered “prohibited foreign entities” from claiming clean energy tax credits.

The FEOC rules apply to the following clean energy tax credits:

Section 45Q: Carbon oxide sequestration credit

Section 45U: Zero-emission nuclear power production credit

Section 45X: Advanced manufacturing production credit

Section 45Y: Clean electricity production credit

Section 45Z: Clean fuel production credit

Section 48E: Clean electricity investment credit

The FEOC rules are designed to prevent entities subject to certain foreign ownership, control, or influence – primarily from China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea – from benefiting from these tax credits. The rules also include restrictions based on material assistance from such entities for Sections 45X, 45Y and 48E, which took effect on January 1, 2026.

What Is a Prohibited Foreign Entity?

A prohibited foreign entity is any “specified foreign entity” or “foreign-influenced entity.”

Specified Foreign Entity

Generally, a specified foreign entity is:

any designated terrorist organization; specially designated national or blocked person identified by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC); entity alleged by the Attorney General to be involved in violations of certain federal laws relating to espionage, arms exportation, or the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEPPA); or entity determined by the Secretary of Treasury to be engaged in conduct detrimental to US national security or foreign policy;

any Chinese military company, entity subject to the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act or certain entities that are ineligible for Department of Defense contracts or funding;

the government of China, Russia, Iran or North Korea (including any agency or instrumentality thereof); any entity or business incorporated, organized, or having its principal place of business therein; or any non-publicly traded entity that, taking into account certain constructive ownership rules, is more than 50 percent owned (by vote or value, capital or profits or otherwise by beneficial interest) by any such government, entity, or business; and

any other entity identified under designated federal statutes.

Foreign Influenced Entity

Generally, a foreign influenced entity is:

any entity with respect to which, during the taxable year:

a specified foreign entity has the direct authority to appoint a covered officer (e.g., board member, CEO, CFO);

a single specified foreign entity owns at least 25 percent, or multiple specified foreign entities own 40 percent; or

at least 15 percent of its debt is issued to one or more specified foreign entities; and

an entity that, during the prior taxable year, made a payment to a specified foreign entity under a contract or arrangement that gives the specified foreign entity (or any person related to the specified foreign entity) “effective control” over any qualified facility, energy storage technology or eligible component (including the production thereof, or the extraction, processing, or recycling of any applicable critical mineral with respect thereto) of such entity (or any person related to such entity).

What Is Effective Control and How Does It Impact Clean Energy Tax Credit Eligibility?

Effective control refers to any contractual or licensing arrangement that gives a specified foreign entity authority over key aspects of a project or component, such as the ability to:

determine quantity or timing of component production or electricity output or storage;

direct sales or usage of output;

restrict access to any critical data, site of production, or part of a facility;

maintain or operate, on an exclusive basis, any plant or essential equipment; or

with respect to licensing agreements, direct sourcing, operations, or certain service arrangements or receive royalties beyond 10 years.

If a taxpayer makes a payment under such an arrangement, and such arrangement is not a bona fide purchase or sale of intellectual property, it may be classified as a foreign-influenced entity that is not eligible to claim tax credits under Sections 45X, 45Y and 48E. Effective control limitations do not apply under Sections 45Q, 45U or 45Z. For Section 48E, there is a 10-year recapture period for tax credits if such payments are made after the project is placed in service.

When Do FEOC Restrictions on Clean Energy Tax Credits Take Effect?

The effective dates for FEOC restrictions vary by tax credit type and taxpayer status, as outlined below:

Sections 45X, 45Y, 48E and 45Q

The specified foreign entity and foreign-influenced entity prohibitions apply to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (i.e., starting January 1, 2026, for calendar-year taxpayers).

Sections 45U and 45Z

The specified foreign entity prohibition applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (i.e., starting January 1, 2026, for calendar-year taxpayers).

The foreign-influenced entity prohibition applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027 (i.e., starting January 1, 2028, for calendar-year taxpayers).

What Are the Material Assistance Rules and to Which Clean Energy Tax Credits Do They Apply?

The material assistance rules are additional restrictions imposed under Sections 45X, 45Y and 48E that disqualify a project or component from tax credit eligibility if it receives “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity.” The material assistance rules apply with respect to any project the construction of which begins in 2026 or later (for qualified facilities and energy storage technology) and any components sold in 2026 or later (for eligible components).

Material assistance is measured by the “material assistance cost ratio” (MACR), which is the percentage of total direct costs (for qualified facilities and energy storage technology) or direct cost of materials (for eligible components) that are not attributable to a prohibited foreign entity.

Sections 45Y and 48E (qualified facilities and energy storage technology):

The MACR is calculated at the project level, with required threshold percentages that increase over time (e.g., for 2026, 40 percent for qualified facilities and 55 percent for energy storage technology).

Section 45X (eligible components):

The MACR is calculated for each component sold in a given year, with thresholds varying by component type and year (e.g., for 2026, 50 percent for solar components, 85 percent for wind components, 60 percent for battery components and 50 percent for inverters).

If the MACR falls below the applicable threshold, the tax credit is denied for that project or component.

How Is Material Assistance Determined, and What Can Taxpayers Do to Comply?

Material assistance is determined by calculating the MACR:

MACR = ((T – P) / T) x 100%

T = Total direct cost of all manufactured products or components

P = Total direct cost of all manufactured products or components from a prohibited foreign entity

Taxpayers must maintain documentation and, until Treasury issues new safe harbor tables (by December 31, 2026), may rely on the tables in IRS Notice 2025-08 (relating to the domestic content requirements) and supplier certifications. Suppliers who provide false certifications may be subject to penalties.

Can Clean Energy Tax Credits Be Transferred to Specified Foreign Entities?

No. The OBBBA prohibits the transfer of any portion of the tax credits under Sections 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z or 48E to specified foreign entities under Section 6418.

What Should Taxpayers and Project Developers Do Now?

China is also Canada’s second‑largest customer for agriculture, forest products and seafood products, with sales of about $13.4 billion in 2024.","Canada’s newly announced strategic partnership with China, including a reduction of surtaxes on Chinese‑made electric vehicles (EVs), is drawing criticism from labour groups which warn the move could put thousands of Canadian manufacturing and auto jobs at risk.

According to the Office of the Prime Minister, the government is responding to “a more divided and uncertain world” by “building a stronger, more independent, and more resilient economy” and “working with urgency and determination to diversify our trade partnerships and catalyse massive new levels of investment.”

Energy, clean tech and EVs

A central feature of the agreement is expanded collaboration in energy, clean technology and climate competitiveness. Both countries are described as energy “superpowers” focused on “expanding two-way energy cooperation – reducing emissions and scaling up investments in batteries, solar, wind, and energy storage.”

To support this and build up the domestic manufacturing sector, Canada will allow up to 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) into the Canadian market at the most‑favoured‑nation tariff rate of 6.1%. This volume corresponds to import levels in 2023–2024 and represents less than 3 per cent of new vehicles sold in Canada.

The Office of the Prime Minister says the arrangement is expected, within three years, to drive “considerable new Chinese joint-venture investment in Canada with trusted partners” to protect and create new auto manufacturing careers and “ensure a robust build-out of Canada’s EV supply chain.” Within five years, more than 50 per cent of these vehicles are anticipated to be priced below $35,000, potentially accelerating EV adoption and demand for skills in production, battery technology, infrastructure and after‑sales service.

Workers ‘more vulnerable’: CLC

However, the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) said the deal “represents a sharp and concerning shift in Canada’s trade and industrial strategy,” and contends that “no sector truly wins, and workers in every industry are left more vulnerable.”

According to the the group, the agreement “drastically reduces Canada’s surtax on Chinese‑made electric vehicles (EVs), creating a pathway for tens of thousands of inexpensive, state‑subsidized vehicles to flood our auto market.” The organisation says this could undermine Canada’s domestic auto industry, jeopardize jobs, suppress future investment and “erode the independent supply chain that sustains thousands of Canadian workers.”

Meanwhile, Unifor issued its own statement, warning that opening the door to China‑owned EV imports “poses extreme risk to Canadian auto jobs and the future of our entire auto sector.”

“This is a self‑inflicted wound to an already injured Canadian auto industry,” said Unifor National President Lana Payne. “Providing a foothold to cheap Chinese EVs, backed by massive state subsidies, overproduction and designed to expand market share through exports, puts Canadian auto jobs at risk while rewarding labour violations and unfair trade practices.”

Unifor said it has “long warned about the risks of letting Chinese EVs flood the North American market,” arguing that if such imports are left unchecked they will cost Canadian jobs, stall domestic investment and increase imports from low‑cost jurisdictions. The union noted that there is “virtually no Canadian content in Chinese vehicles,” and warned that “our independent auto parts supply chain would also be hard hit.”

Previously, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said that by lowering tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, “this lopsided deal risks closing the door on Canadian automakers to the American market, our largest export destination, which would hurt our economy and lead to job losses,” according to the National Post.

According to two legal experts, as Canada pushes toward an ambitious 100-per-cent zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) sales mandate by 2035, a vital question is emerging - are we truly prepared for the labour market shock this transition may bring?

Auto leverage for farm and fish gains

The CLC similarly questioned the government’s willingness to exchange leverage on industrial and auto tariffs for short‑term agricultural gains. It said “the Government’s willingness to trade hard‑earned leverage on issues like auto tariffs and North American cooperation for temporary tariff reductions on canola and some seafood products is deeply troubling,” calling the relief for agriculture and fisheries “time‑limited, uncertain beyond this year, and insufficient compensation for exposing strategic industries to global competition fueled by massive state intervention.”

This target comes against a backdrop in which China is already Canada’s second‑largest single‑country trading partner, with two‑way merchandise trade totalling $118.9 billion in 2024. Canadian merchandise exports to China reached $30 billion, while imports were $88.9 billion. China is also Canada’s second‑largest customer for agriculture, forest products and seafood products, with sales of about $13.4 billion in 2024.",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/chrr/jimw_639044334202413092.png,N,,2026-01-19 16:59:01.654847

With a commitment of C$10 million, BMI has reaffirmed its dedication toward the development of the Espanola biocarbon project.
The Espanola project is expected to produce up to 50,000 metric tons of biocarbon per year, representing five times the production capacity of the partners' Thorold Renewable Energy Facility.
""BMI acquired the Espanola site to bring it back to life and return it to productive industrial use,"" said Paul Veldman, CEO of The BMI Group.
This progression is expected to be illustrative of how CHAR Tech and BMI intend to continue to move a growing pipeline of projects forward.","CHAR Technologies Ltd. on Jan. 14 announced that the Espanola project engineering and design study continues to advance with The BMI Group. With a commitment of C$10 million, BMI has reaffirmed its dedication toward the development of the Espanola biocarbon project.

The project will be located at Bioveld North, the former pulp and paper mill site in Espanola, Ontario, which BMI recently acquired with a focus on putting wood back to work in Northern Ontario.

The Espanola project is expected to produce up to 50,000 metric tons of biocarbon per year, representing five times the production capacity of the partners' Thorold Renewable Energy Facility.

The project's final scope and BMI's final capital allocation will be determined through completion of the engineering and design study.

The proposed facility would convert locally sourced wood waste and forestry residuals into low-carbon biocarbon and synthetic gas, with the potential to valorize the gas, including either direct use on site by the broader Bioveld North facility, or upgrading the synthetic gas to renewable natural gas (RNG) in a later phase.

The engineering and design study is expected to be completed in calendar Q1 of 2026, and will define the technical scope, assess and secure available feedstock supply, and confirm the integration requirements of CHAR Tech's high-temperature pyrolysis platform into the Espanola site's existing industrial infrastructure, including utilities, biomass handling, logistics, and production scaling.

Northern Ontario's substantial forestry residual supply, combined with the site's existing infrastructure, provides a clear pathway to rapid redevelopment at scale.

""The Espanola site, with significant access to biomass materials, wastes and residuals, gives us the opportunity to scale our technology well beyond what was possible at Thorold,"" said Andrew White, CEO of CHAR Tech. ""This study is about defining the details needed to move from development into construction on a larger, more integrated facility located within one of Canada's most significant forestry regions.""

""BMI acquired the Espanola site to bring it back to life and return it to productive industrial use,"" said Paul Veldman, CEO of The BMI Group. ""Partnering with CHAR Tech allows us to move quickly into detailed planning and construction. This project is a cornerstone of our vision to put wood back to work through innovation, full-fiber utilization, and clean-energy production. Espanola is a long-term asset with the potential to create durable jobs, strengthen forestry supply chains, and anchor a new generation of low-carbon industry in the North.""

The project reflects BMI's strategy of pairing proven clean technologies with irreplaceable legacy industrial infrastructure to enable scalable, full-fiber utilization. This progression is expected to be illustrative of how CHAR Tech and BMI intend to continue to move a growing pipeline of projects forward.

The Espanola redevelopment is intended to re-establish the site as a major industrial employer and clean energy anchor in Northern Ontario, demonstrating how existing industrial assets can be repurposed to support sustainable forestry, create high-value jobs, and put wood back to work for the next century of Northern growth.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Char_Tech_Jan26_7d00bbec60.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 11:59:47.542100

Investment in clean technologies has overtaken investment in fossil fuels and clean energy is reshaping demand fundamentals.
Electric vehicles are displacing millions of barrels of oil demand per day - with that figure set to multiply by 2030.
Given that road transport accounts for around half of global oil demand, electrifying this segment has significant impacts in the long-term role and value of oil.
Within this evolving context, several trends for 2026 are plausible: Oil demand plateau becomes mainstream: financial markets will increasingly treat oil demand growth as limited or declining, not simply cyclical.","In the past weeks, markets have delivered a clear signal: even as geopolitical tensions have flared, global oil prices have remained anchored near the low-$60s per barrel. Brief price increases over Iran have reflected geopolitical risk, but they faded quickly.

That muted reaction speaks not to the irrelevance of geopolitics but to a deeper shift in the global energy landscape that will define 2026: the transition from fossil-fuel dominance toward clean electrification and resilient energy systems.

To many market observers this might look counterintuitive. Historically, supply disruptions - whether from conflict, sanctions, or domestic instability - immediately tightened global oil markets. But today, diversified supplies and weakening demand growth are dampening price sensitivity. The disruption isn’t gone, it’s just less determinative than it used to be.

Venezuela, for the record, is a red herring in this specific debate. Despite renewed attention on its oil sector – crude quality, production constraints, infrastructure decay and sanctions mean Venezuelan oil is not a market-shifting supply source. And by the time meaningful volumes could return, the market itself will have changed. Demand growth for heavy, high-sulphur crude is structurally weaker in a world moving toward electrification.

Investment in clean technologies has overtaken investment in fossil fuels and clean energy is reshaping demand fundamentals.

Clean electrification makes economies more competitive because it delivers cheaper, more stable, more efficient, cleaner and more innovative energy systems while reducing geopolitical risk. According to recent analysis, clean energy - defined broadly to include renewables, electrification technologies, efficiency measures and storage - have the potential to replace three-quarters of existing fossil fuel demand globally.

This reflects rapid deployment and sharply falling costs for renewables and electrification, especially in transport and power. Electric vehicles are displacing millions of barrels of oil demand per day - with that figure set to multiply by 2030. China sold 11 million EVs in 2024, which led to the displacement of 0.43 million barrels per day of gasoline in 2024 (this is 12% of Chinese annual gasoline consumption) and this displacement could quadruple by 2040.

It also aligns with the latest IEA World Energy Outlook cycle, which shows that oil demand peaks at around 102 million barrels per day around 2030 before entering gradual decline under current policy trajectories as well as more ambitious scenarios.

Strategic models increasingly project that electricity - mostly clean - will become the dominant energy carrier in the decades ahead.

Given that road transport accounts for around half of global oil demand, electrifying this segment has significant impacts in the long-term role and value of oil.

This structural shift has profound implications for energy security. For decades, energy policy was synonymous with oil geopolitics. Today, it’s increasingly about electricity resilience, grid flexibility, supply chain robustness and critical minerals security. Governments and businesses alike are wrestling with how to tap domestic clean resources, secure supply chains for clean energy supply technologies, batteries and grid equipment, and manage system risks caused not by single events but by cascading and compound shocks - extreme weather, cyber threats and infrastructure stress.

These trends also shape the politics of climate engagement. At COP30 in Brazil last year, leaders acknowledged the urgency of accelerating clean energy deployment, even in the absence of a globally binding fossil fuel phase-out timeline. Consensus is growing on the need to manage transition pathways, especially given the economic impact in some countries.

Looking ahead, 2026 offers a packed calendar of political and business momentum that could cement this transition:

International Conference on the Just Transition Away from Fossil Fuels hosted by Colombia and Netherlands: This gathering aims to accelerate just and practical pathways for emissions reduction and cleaner energy deployment. If outcomes align with evidence on electrification and demand peaking, it could bridge policy gaps between ambition and implementation.

COP31 (Turkey/Australia): As host and partner, these governments have signalled an intent to advance implementation agendas that prioritize energy systems transformation - grids, electrification and industrial decarbonization - rather than headline emission targets alone. The focus is shifting toward real-world policies that enable transformation at scale.

Other global dialogues are increasingly shaping the direction of economic and energy policy - including the G7, G20, BRICS, APEC and related forums. Taken together, these platforms reflect a shifting centre of gravity in global decision-making, with growing influence from the Global South on questions of development, energy security, industrial strategy and transition pathways.

Within this evolving context, several trends for 2026 are plausible:

Oil demand plateau becomes mainstream: financial markets will increasingly treat oil demand growth as limited or declining, not simply cyclical. This will tighten capital for high-cost fossil projects and elevate electricity and storage sectors as primary investment destinations.

Electrification as a driver of competitiveness drives policy action: governments will shift rhetoric and policy incentives toward end-use electrification - buildings, industry, transport - recognizing that electricity offers greater energy security and long-term economic competitiveness.

Energy security debates further reframe: security discussions will continue to centre less on crude supply routes and more on grid resilience, semiconductor and battery supply chains, and critical mineral partnerships, with discussions potentially broadening into the security implications of winding down of fossil fuels.

These shifts don’t negate the risks ahead. Gas retains a longer runway in parts of the system, coal demand remains in some regions, and fossil infrastructure persists. But the signal in prices combined with the momentum in clean deployment reveals a deeper reality: energy transitions are no longer aspirational - they are structural and investment-driven.

For business leaders and policymakers alike, the imperative in 2026 will be clear: align strategy with the realities of clean electrified economies - not because of ideology, but because economics, resilience and security demand it.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/696df644b3a2acf77a23b275/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2026-01-19 11:59:52.203219

Successful state leaders know that energy policy is economic policy, and clean energy must be central to addressing economic challenges and opportunities, even as federal progress stalls.

Take Virginia, where Governor Abigail Spanberger was sworn in last Saturday. She won in a landslide victory with a commitment to lower energy costs, modernize the electricity grid and expand clean energy and transportation programs. These are investments that can strengthen reliability and affordability for households and businesses alike.

As Virginia’s General Assembly convenes this month, here are three strategies that lawmakers can pursue to turn her commitments into action:

Build more clean energy, fast

Demand for electricity is surging, driven by electrification, manufacturing and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Solar and wind have quickly become the cheapest and easiest energy sources to deploy. Without action to remove barriers to clean energy deployment, energy costs will continue to rise.

Virginia policymakers should reinforce the state’s clean energy goals through the Virginia Clean Economy Act, streamline permitting processes to quickly get affordable energy projects online, and invest in battery storage to keep power flowing when and where it’s needed.

Other states are also moving in this direction. Massachusetts is weighing legislation to boost distributed energy resources, while Michigan is making it easier to build transmission along existing infrastructure such as highways or pipelines.

Get more out of the system we have

America’s aging grid is a bottleneck, requiring massive investment. Grid-enhancing technologies can unlock hidden capacity and improve resilience against extreme weather. While they don’t eliminate the long-term need for new transmission lines, policymakers should prioritize these types of high-value, no-regrets investments that save costs in the long run.

Virginia could build upon its existing virtual power plant program, linking solar panels, batteries and smart thermostats to boost capacity and reliability while keeping costs down. Virginia leads in these types of forward-thinking initiatives with fellow states across the South, including North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia.

Remove barriers to clean transportation

Businesses and consumers recognize the benefits of electric vehicles, most notably lower fuel and maintenance costs. Yet limited access to charging infrastructure remains a major barrier, especially in rural areas. Virginia can lead by expanding charging access, giving businesses and consumers the freedom to choose cost-saving, low-maintenance vehicles that meet their needs.

The benefits will ripple outward, delivering cleaner air, reducing health care costs, and creating thousands of new jobs.

In 2024, the clean vehicle sector supported 400,000 jobs nationwide, including 8,000 in Virginia. With federal support waning, states must keep driving this economic engine forward. Many states are doing just that already with the Affordable Clean Cars Coalition, a group of 13 states committed to making electric vehicles more affordable and practical to drive.

The path forward for states in 2026 is clear: treating affordability as an energy challenge – and acting accordingly – is the best way to deliver lower bills, strengthen local economies and secure energy system for all.

By mid 2027, AM Green expects to begin producing 0.5 mtpa of green ammonia ahead of reaching full production.

At full capacity, the project will comprise 1.95GW of alkaline electrolysers, 7.5GW of renewables, and 2GW of pumped storage. It has lined up John Cockerill electrolysers, and “round-the-clock” renewable energy power purchase agreements.

Chief Minister of the state of Andhra Pradesh, Nara Chandrababu Naidu, said the first equipment installations at the site moved the state closer to becoming a “net exporter of green energy.”

AM Green has inked a firm to supply 500,000 tonnes of Kakinada-made green ammonia to German energy firm Uniper, with first deliveries expected by 2028. The firm is also exploring shipping the green molecules to chemicals major BASF, as well as power firm RWE.

These deals could be the first examples of large-scale green hydrogen trade between Europe and India.

AM Green said the project was creating “real economic impact” by reviving legacy industrial infrastructure, creating jobs, and building a new “clean energy ecosystem in the region.”

India has increasingly been positioning itself as a major green hydrogen supplier for regions like Europe, by leaning on its strong renewables potential.","https://www.h2-view.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.h2-view.com/wp-content/files/1768709742251-e1768813868462.jpeg",N,,2026-01-19 13:58:58.817950

The partners said the on-campus facility will be used to co-develop and demonstrate intelligent and agentic AI manufacturing technologies, run joint workshops focused on AI, cybersecurity, and digital twins, and deploy hands-on demonstration “pods” inside the IntelliMake lab.

The collaboration is positioned as a response to widening readiness gaps as AI adoption accelerates. Citing Kyndryl’s 2025 Readiness Report, the company said most leaders expect AI to reshape jobs within a year, but far fewer believe their workforce is prepared—an imbalance the initiative intends to address through practical training and real-world demonstrations. Wayne State and Kyndryl plan to use the lab environment to train teams in agentic AI for manufacturing and to replicate customer challenges on a mock assembly line, with the goal of advancing from theoretical prototypes to deployable solutions.

In its initial phase, IntelliMake will pair advanced computing with modular orchestration to show how intelligent agents can identify disruptions, adapt to changes, and recover operations. The autonomous manufacturing and assembly line is intended to reduce scrap and rework, improve quality outcomes, and provide workers with more responsive tools and real-time operational insights. Kyndryl said it will support system orchestration by integrating technologies, including Kyndryl Bridge, to monitor and manage the end-to-end infrastructure powering the lab’s simulated production environment.

The partners framed the hub as part of a broader ambition to position Detroit and Michigan as leaders in smart manufacturing, citing a projected $10 trillion opportunity driven by AI agents, robotics, and digital twins that enable factories to self-optimize and reconfigure dynamically. Wayne State said the initiative leverages its location in a major manufacturing region and its industry relationships to address manufacturing modernization and workforce development challenges, while aligning university research with scalable industrial applications.

OKLO, he said, was founded on the idea that nuclear fission can deliver massive amounts of reliable, affordable energy, noting nuclear power has some of the lowest fuel costs per megawatt-hour of any source.
When asked whether U.S. energy woes are a regulatory or market failure, DeWitte said the issue is in red tape versus demand.
""Then you're just having those countries build power plants to power it.","NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles!

The U.S. is running headlong into a power crunch driven by the explosive growth of artificial intelligence — and the nation’s energy grid is not ready for it, an executive behind a major new nuclear partnership warned recently.

Jacob DeWitte is CEO of OKLO, a California-based advanced nuclear company focused on helping large energy users add grid power through private investment rather than traditional utilities. He joined Meta executive Joel Kaplan and Energy Secretary Chris Wright for an announcement in Washington.

The Meta partnership will go a long way to add much-needed power to a key regional component of the national grid, DeWitte said, citing OKLO’s plans to develop a 1.2 GW installation in Pike County, Ohio, near the Hocking Hills.

""I think one of the really exciting things about today is announcing the fact we're going to be building a lot more power generation capabilities,"" he said, quipping that southeastern Ohio used to be an ""industrial cathedral"" and now can see new commercial rebirth for the digital and AI age.

WE'RE ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE AISLE. BUT WE KNOW AMERICA MUST WIN THE AI RACE, OR ELSE

""Smaller [nuclear] plants can be built more quickly and come online faster – then you shorten the learning curve. You reduce the cost both in time and money of iteration cycles to drive technological progress and bring these technologies that have huge promise forward in terms of cost reduction… energy dominance and energy reliability and energy abundance,"" he said.

Wright and President Donald Trump have helped companies like OKLO and Meta unleash this new energy potential, to not only increase power capacity and amend structural issues but also greatly reduce the regulatory burdens private companies tend to face from Washington, DeWitte added.

With the advent of AI and its power needs, DeWitte said the U.S. energy system as it stands has ""absolutely"" not been able to keep up.

MORNING GLORY: A PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP-BRANDED ENERGY DRINK?

DeWitte warned that the U.S. needs to build out the power grid and invest in new installations like the Pike site:

""We are going to run out of power capacity in this country in the next several years, especially in critical industrial markets like sort of the Midwest and Northeast. The PJM interconnection [which supports the Mid-Atlantic region] is going to be undersupplied with power generation in just a matter of a few years.""

""The steps taken today are going to help alleviate that, but there's going be a lot more that's needed.""

TRUMP SAYS EVERY AI PLANT BEING BUILT IN US WILL BE SELF-SUSTAINING WITH THEIR OWN ELECTRICITY

DeWitte also addressed what he described as a common misconception surrounding the rise of data centers, which have sparked NIMBY backlash in parts of the country.

""I think sometimes people conflate [that] building these data centers [will] drive prices up – that's a scarcity mindset. We're in a world of an abundance mindset, right?"" he said.

TRUMP ADMIN'S ENERGY AGENDA HAILED FOR CRUCIAL 'WINS' AS GREEN ACTIVISTS LASH OUT

He said Meta is committing to a total of 6.6GW of new power, calling it a ""huge amount of capacity"" to fuel the needs of decades to come, and that nuclear is a very reliable energy source.

DeWitte said one of the biggest structural choke points in bringing new energy online, and why the nation is running out of power, leading to price inflation, is the regulatory environment that has stymied growth for many years.

That dynamic, he said, has been ""fundamentally anti-energy.""

BURGUM CALLS CALIFORNIA A ‘NATIONAL SECURITY RISK’ AS ENERGY CHIEF WARNS BLUE STATES ARE SKEWING COST AVERAGES

But, DeWitte said, that dynamic is changing: ""The unfortunate thing is we have to undo decades of... damage [from] not doing things to then overcome that inertia.""

""Look at the states that have the worst energy… They're largely states that have had the heaviest-handed anti-energy policies, and they're the ones that are now facing some of the biggest challenges on that point, and they are also responding, which is encouraging.""

OKLO, he said, was founded on the idea that nuclear fission can deliver massive amounts of reliable, affordable energy, noting nuclear power has some of the lowest fuel costs per megawatt-hour of any source.

""Our view of that, though, is changing a couple of things, including the business model, [and the] deployment model, including how we think about size and technology. We see opportunities to go invest in and build significant generating capacity in areas that need it and have significant development opportunities around it,"" he said, noting that brings the conversation full circle regarding its investment in the Ohio site.

When asked whether U.S. energy woes are a regulatory or market failure, DeWitte said the issue is in red tape versus demand.

The environmental commodity markets have played the role of scaffolding by providing the framework and support on which the energy transition can be built.
The levers of transition Emissions Trading Systems (ETS) that put a price on emissions were first launched in 2005.
But these levers only move at scale when markets make them investable; for example, when carbon emissions have been properly priced.
These regulations and increased renewable energy also translate into growing demand for certificates, and that demand makes the transition investable.","Despite strong global momentum to accelerate decarbonisation, fossil fuels still have a strong hold of the energy use across most sectors. The IEA reports that industrial energy consumption is still dominated by fossil fuels, in particular coal; and transportation relies on oil products for nearly 91 percent of its energy. As of the first half of 2025 however, the global energy supply shows a more positive picture as renewable energy overtook coal as the leading source of energy for the first time in history. But that was no miracle; that is market logic in action. The environmental commodity markets have played the role of scaffolding by providing the framework and support on which the energy transition can be built.

To explain the concept of environmental commodity with a simple analogy: If a homeowner wants to lower his or her carbon footprint, they might install some solar panels. But presuming they live in a block of flats, they might ask a friend to put solar panels on their roof instead. The flat owner helps the friend to finance that and in return can claim that they have neutralised the carbon output of their flat. What those homeowners are doing is creating a marketplace for decarbonisation opportunities, which is exactly what is happening at a macro-level between energy producers, corporates and major industry. It allows people who want to make moves to decarbonise, but who might be constrained. It allows them to invest in the move to decarbonise elsewhere. Similarly, it also enables people who have the opportunity, but not the finance, to get their projects off the ground.

The levers of transition

Emissions Trading Systems (ETS) that put a price on emissions were first launched in 2005. In addition, renewable energy certificates (GOs, IRECs, RECs) that link clean energy generation with consumer demand and fuel mandates (LCFS, REDIII) that reward low-carbon alternatives have gained their importance as tools to put a price on emissions and address environmental impact. These markets exist not to virtue-signal but to account for the cost of emissions and make decarbonisation bankable. Just as in other markets, traders, like us at STX Group, come in to facilitate pricing structures and climate solutions that simplify sales and manage risk for both the buyer and the producer. This market mechanism brings more investment to the market and is therefore an essential part of the commodities markets.

Carbon is finally being priced appropriately — and investment is following

The energy transition is ultimately executed through three levers: efficiency, switching towards renewable fuels and feedstocks, and carbon capture. But these levers only move at scale when markets make them investable; for example, when carbon emissions have been properly priced. The good news is, carbon is being appropriately priced and, as a result, environmental commodity markets have been growing rapidly over the last 20 years. New regulations are also taking effect, especially in Europe, across multiple industries. In shipping, FuelEU Maritime is reshaping fuel demand. In aviation, ReFuelEU mandates are driving uptake of sustainable fuels. RED III is pushing EU member states to increase renewables in power and heat. CBAM is levelling the playing field between domestic and foreign producers in the EU. All these regulations put more pressure on European refineries to ramp up their production of clean energy products. These regulations and increased renewable energy also translate into growing demand for certificates, and that demand makes the transition investable. The future growth of the ‘sustainable economy’ is driven largely by the widening net of regulatory compliance but also has become a lifeline for energy companies operating on markets rapidly shifting towards renewables.

While the pace of change to decarbonise the global economy is arguably still slow, we cannot ignore the emissions that have been capped and addressed because of market schemes like the ETS and a large variety of environmental commodities. To give a sense of the scale, the global EAC market has grown to over 2,400 TWh annually since its formalisation in the early 2000s, representing a size equal to more than 60 percent of the total electricity demand of the European Union. It now covers approximately 40 percent of the EU’s total GHG emissions and generates €38bn in revenues in 2024.

By my latest count, more than 70 countries now operate carbon pricing systems. Clean fuel mandates and schemes are spreading across North America and Asia. In Europe, numerous clean energy policies and regulations are making carbon a balance-sheet cost for major heavy industries including aviation, shipping and manufacturing. There are plenty more schemes similar to the existing regulation that we expect to see make a big impact in the coming years, such as sustainable aviation fuel certificates (SAFc), white certificates to drive energy efficiency and biofuel mandates. One thing is clear: emissions now carry a price, and that price is rising.

I strongly believe that market mechanisms are the most efficient way to align political ambition, corporate obligation and consumer demand to decarbonise, at an affordable cost. Without them, the transition risks becoming slower, costlier and more divisive.",https://www.worldfinance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/marketdriver-600x450.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 13:59:04.838463

The plan subsequently aims to expedite the construction of new power plants, especially natural gas-powered ones, to supply power directly to the data center sector.
This has led to more novel natural gas solutions emerging from the woodwork, such as Boom Supersonic and ProEnergy’s plans to repurpose airline jet engines to power data centers behind the meter.
Overall, residential bills across the 13 states within the network are expected to grow significantly next year, with data centers the main culprit.
""This is not a yes/no to data centers,"" PJM board chair and interim president and CEO David Mills said in a statement.","The emergency auction would be unprecedented, but it isn't surprising given the skyrocketing capacity-addition projections across the region. In its latest annual capacity auction, which closed in July, wholesale electric capacity grew 22 percent compared to last year. The Trump administration, alongside the governors, argued that the issues are compounded by the fact that large amounts of firm capacity are slated for retirement by 2030, which it argues would put increased pressure on the grid to meet the growing demand.

Therefore, to accommodate this growth, utilities across the PJM grid have announced massive increases in generation. However, due to the oft-arduous approval process and construction lag times, there has been a growing call for a more streamlined service for the data center market. The plan subsequently aims to expedite the construction of new power plants, especially natural gas-powered ones, to supply power directly to the data center sector. At the start of last year, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) found that utilities across Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia plan to build more than 20GW of natural gas power plants by 2040 to meet energy demand from the data center sector.

""Under President Trump's leadership, the administration is leading an unprecedented bipartisan effort urging PJM to fix the energy subtraction failures of the past, prevent price increases, and reduce the risk of blackouts,"" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said.

However, concerns remain over the gas turbine supply chain, with its heavily constrained nature and a stuffed order book likely a bottleneck in the drive to bring more generation online. This has led to more novel natural gas solutions emerging from the woodwork, such as Boom Supersonic and ProEnergy’s plans to repurpose airline jet engines to power data centers behind the meter.

In addition, with the repeal of many tax credits for new renewable projects, there will be increased pressure on the natural gas supply chain to meet demand.

While the plan may lead to some more generation coming online faster than expected, it is still beholden to global supply chains and may not have an immediate impact. As a result, Advanced Energy United, which represents energy companies and corporate buyers across clean-energy sectors, said the approach doesn't address core challenges such as making PJM's grid-connection process more efficient.

The clearer aim of the initiative, it seems, especially in the short term, is to assuage growing political angst over who is responsible for the costs of the new generation needed for the growth of AI.

We have already seen large bill increases in data center hubs such as Columbus, Ohio. In the city, the average residential bill is set to increase by $27 a month. Overall, residential bills across the 13 states within the network are expected to grow significantly next year, with data centers the main culprit.

In response to cost increases, legislators across several of the 13 states have seen new ratepayer rules approved by their political and regulatory bodies, which have set guidelines for who is responsible for the costs of constructing new generation and transmission infrastructure. Ohio was one of the first to enforce new rules, with new data center customers on the hook for a minimum of 85 percent of the energy they say they need each month, even if they use less. A few months after the approval, AEP Ohio, the state's largest utility, announced that it had seen its pipeline of large load capacity additions shrink as a result. The state utility said in a statement that it was the direct result of the new rules, which had culled many speculative and zombie projects.

The new auction resembles some of the aspects of the new ratepayer class approved in places like Ohio, and proposed in Virginia and Pennsylvania. Subsequently, it could be the first step towards a universal requirement that data center developers play an integral role in financing the new capacity additions needed to power the planned facilities. President Trump has not been afraid to dictate the pace of investment within the tech market, and with so many within the sector avowed allies of the President, this could make them more amenable to breaking out their checkbooks to pay for the new generation.

As of yet, it is unclear whether the new generation capacity would feed data centers via a private wire or through the grid, but it is increasingly clear that something needs to be done about the spiraling costs across the region.

An interesting wrinkle of the announcement was the fact that the RTO itself was not invited to participate, which raises serious questions about the support of the plan. However, with bipartisan backing, it seems likely that PJM will have to oblige and hold the auction as planned to avoid the wrath of an increasingly assertive President.

Following the announcement, PJM released a statement outlining a set of board-approved actions aimed at accommodating data centers and other large new electricity users.

The measures include the immediate launch of efforts to secure additional power supplies. PJM also said it will enhance load forecasting, expand the role of states, and explore options that would allow large customers to supply their own generation or participate in a connect-and-manage approach. Additional steps include establishing a fast-track interconnection process for state-backed generation projects and beginning a backstop procurement to address near-term reliability risks.

""This is not a yes/no to data centers,"" PJM board chair and interim president and CEO David Mills said in a statement. ""This is, 'How can we do this while keeping the lights on and recognizing the impact on consumers at the same time?'""

While the plan’s ability to materially lower prices or accelerate near-term capacity additions remains uncertain, it has already prompted a more proactive response from grid operators, utilities, regulators, and data center developers grappling with the pace and cost of AI-driven load growth.

The reaction to the news has been mixed. Amazon responded to the news with a positive spin. In a statement, the company said: “We share the goal of ensuring affordable, reliable energy for American families and our economy, and we applaud the bipartisanship emerging to tackle America's outdated grid challenges. Amazon is paying our full energy costs and is committed to ensuring our data centers don’t increase consumers’ electricity bills, and we've been clear that every major energy user should do the same.”

In contrast, environmental groups, such as Earth Justice, argued that the move could have drastic impacts on carbon emission levels. “If the Department of Energy were serious about affordability, it would be greenlighting clean energy, not taking extraordinary, unlawful measures to stop the quickest and cheapest solution we have. The auction proposed today might help protect consumers - but only if it’s designed and implemented right. If the auction is badly designed, it could lock in dirty, expensive infrastructure and harm already overburdened communities–even where states, citizens, and tech companies all want clean energy,” said Nick Lawton, Earthjustice attorney.",https://media.datacenterdynamics.com/media/images/IMG_0064_1_1.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 11:05:47.448190

Geopolitical twists and turns are straining long-established relationships and upending deeply held assumptions. The World Uncertainty Index, devised by economists from the IMF and Stanford University, has hit unprecedented levels in recent months.

But in this time of flux, there are still some important trends that we can identify with some confidence. Here are seven that can help us keep our bearings:

Oil and gas will still be widely used for many years to come, but the use of electricity is growing twice as a fast as overall energy demand. It’s the key energy input to the most dynamic parts of the global economy – such as AI, data centres and high-tech manufacturing – and is increasing its share of major sectors like road transport and heating through technologies such as EVs and heat pumps. Already today, more than half of the investment going into the global energy sector each year is going to electricity.

Despite some headwinds, in many countries around the world, renewables are meeting much if not all of the rising demand for electricity, often because they are the most competitive option. Solar is leading the way, as the countries that are increasingly driving energy demand, such as India, have a very high-quality solar resource, but other technologies are in play, too, including new ones coming through such as next-generation geothermal energy.

After a series of setbacks in the 2010s, nuclear is on the rise again, generating more electricity than ever before last year. Today, more than 70 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity is under construction, one of the highest levels in the past 30 years. Soaring electricity demand from data centres means tech companies are also turning to nuclear, attracted by its promise of low-emissions, round-the-clock power supply.

Traditional hazards affecting the security of oil and gas supplies are now accompanied by vulnerabilities in other areas, including electricity security, as highlighted by the recent major blackouts in Chile and Spain, and critical minerals. A single country, China, is the dominant refiner for 19 out of 20 energy-related strategic minerals, with an average market share of around 70%. More than half of these strategic minerals are subject to some form of export controls. Rising energy security risks from climate change are now also a certainty, intensifying the need to make energy systems more resilient to extreme weather events, as well as to cyberattacks and other malicious activity targeting critical infrastructure.

As energy is elevated to a matter of economic and national security, so governments are increasingly intervening to shape outcomes, rather than leaving them to the market. This is visible in energy technology supply chains, especially for critical minerals, as countries seek to counter the risks associated with China’s high market share. Trade in oil and gas is also increasingly subject to political considerations and government-to-government negotiation – or to sanctions.

Oil prices have already come under pressure because of relatively abundant supply, and the same will soon be true in natural gas markets, as the wave of new LNG export projects start operations. There is also ample manufacturing capacity for batteries, solar panels and other technologies. These trends can benefit fuel and technology importers, but they should not get too comfortable: this period of plenty and potentially lower prices could lead to reduced investments in energy, with implications for subsequent years.

The centre of gravity in the world’s energy markets is shifting as a group of emerging economies, led by India and Southeast Asia and joined by countries in the Middle East, Latin America and Africa increasingly shape energy market dynamics. They are taking up the baton from China, which accounted for more than half of global demand growth for oil, gas and electricity since 2010. That said, no other country on its own will come close to replicating China’s extraordinary energy trajectory of recent decades.

Amid today’s turmoil, focusing only on uncertainties can lead to indecision and paralysis. A wait-and-see approach on energy by governments, companies and investors risks storing up trouble for the future, given the world’s thirst for energy and the continuous need for investment. There are still some certainties that decision-makers can rely on: let’s not lose sight of them as we plan for the future.",https://iea.org/assets/front/images/iea_open_graph.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 12:00:09.290671

“This partnership builds industrial capability in a space where Australia has real advantages – scientific expertise, local feedstocks and a national interest in clean manufacturing,” McCann said.

“Our role is to help bridge the gap from research-grade to industrial-grade, commercially viable materials that can support companies like HaloCell to scale.”

The collaboration aims to address a critical bottleneck in perovskite commercialisation: high-purity input materials are available primarily as expensive, research-grade chemicals in limited quantities from international suppliers.

HaloCell Energy has established itself as a leader in Australian perovskite development, launching Australian-made perovskite modules optimised for low-light conditions and partnering with the University of Queensland to advance record-breaking tandem heterojunction perovskite solar cells.

The company’s printed modules target applications where traditional silicon panels face limitations, including aerial systems, space-based installations and indoor sensor networks.

Paul Moonie, CEO of HaloCell Energy, highlighted the partnership’s commercial significance.

“At HaloCell, we’re creating the next generation of solar solutions – lightweight, printable and tuned for real-world conditions,” Moonie said.

“To gain scale, we need access to fit-for-purpose materials at the right cost. That’s why this partnership with Lava Blue is so important.”

The agreement encompasses the development and supply of scalable perovskite precursors, the evaluation of potential offtake arrangements and joint project opportunities and engagement across the broader perovskite value chain, both domestically and internationally.

This collaboration builds on Lava Blue’s Australian Research Council-funded research into refining high-purity materials from mine waste for clean technology applications.

Lava Blue operates the Centre for Predictive Research into Specialty Materials in Brisbane, featuring demonstration-scale processing capabilities for producing 4N and 5N high-purity alumina.

The company’s technology platform addresses growing demand for speciality materials, with global high-purity alumina requirements forecast to exceed 240,000 tonnes annually by 2030, while 75% of the current supply remains concentrated in China.

Perovskite solar cells offer advantages including high efficiency, potential for low-cost manufacturing, and strong performance in low-light conditions, making them suitable for specialised applications where conventional silicon photovoltaics face constraints.

However, commercial deployment has been limited by material costs and supply chain challenges that this partnership aims to address.

The memorandum of understanding establishes a foundation for deeper collaboration as perovskite markets evolve, with both companies committed to intellectual property protection and science-based development approaches.

McCann noted the partnership’s broader significance for Australian industrial positioning: “This partnership is a signal. It shows that Australia can be more than a raw materials exporter – we can be a source of specialised, value-added inputs essential to the energy systems of the future.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/685b2d8c55474a37bb8500cf_c284c611.png,N,,2026-01-19 11:02:51.080567
