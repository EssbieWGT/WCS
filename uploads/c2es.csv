EV batteries are battery packs made up of multiple “modules” or identical parts that contain many electrochemical cells. These cells contain layers (anode, cathode, and separator layers) that are in contact with an electrolyte (typically a liquid), and those components are then stacked or rolled together in steel or aluminum, making up a cell. Different chemicals can be used in the cathode of batteries, but lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide chemistries are more frequently used in EV batteries due to their relatively high energy storage capacity to support propulsion, with lithium-ion batteries being the most common. There are, however, competing alternatives, including lead acid, nickel metal hydride, and others. Materials used for the manufacturing of EV batteries (if variably) tend to be costly and environmentally intensive to mine and refine. In addition to these chemistries, cells may contain other materials such as copper, plastics, manganese, and graphite. EV batteries drive a significant portion of the market for some of these materials. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), “in 2022, about 60% of lithium, 30% of cobalt and 10% of nickel demand was for EV batteries.”

EV Battery Reuse and Recycling Markets To Date

EV battery reuse and recycling market estimates have varied considerably but generally reflect significant US and global market growth in recent years and projected growth over the next five to ten years. One report, for example, estimated that this market was expected to grow globally from $8 billion in 2024 to over $28 billion in 2029. If improperly managed, used EV batteries can leach harmful chemicals, cause fires, and waste valuable materials. But, if properly managed, they may improve the economic and environmental sustainability of the EV market as a whole. EOL EV batteries have generally been exported for processing. One study estimated that in 2019, about 44.5 percent of lithium-ion batteries generated in the US were exported, while only about 9 percent were recycled domestically.

Due to recent investments made for recycling in the US, however, that balance has begun shifting. In 2023, US battery recycling facilities had the capacity to reclaim over 35,000 tons of materials, with roughly 175,000 additional tons reclaimed at intermediate processing facilities. In 2024, the Department of Energy projected that planned facilities over the following few years would add 76,000 tons more of capacity at recycling facilities to reclaim materials, and 197,500 tons more at intermediate processing facilities.

Researchers have noted in recent years that while states and the federal government have implemented policies to support further manufacturing and information about EOL batteries, “compared to other countries, the US lacks a mechanism to ensure that batteries will be collected and recycled.” Existing measures and current proposals at the state and federal level have not only included those aimed at driving broader EV markets, infrastructure, and manufacturing, through mechanisms like tax incentives, but on waste disposal requirements and guidance, including the implementation of extended producer responsibility policies. However, more recent federal policy shifts have begun to roll back some of those efforts, including the ending of tax credits for EVs and transitioning fleets to lower-emissions vehicles. Consequently, some researchers and stakeholders have raised concerns about how this will impact the availability of EV batteries and, therein, broader investments in reuse and recycling.

Federal Policies and Regulations:

In 2021, under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), roughly $7.5 billion in funding was provided to expand EV charging infrastructure, and $5 billion was provided for EV and low-emissions school buses.

In 2022, the US Department of Energy provided a $2.5 billion loan for lithium-ion battery cell manufacturing facilities in Ohio, Tennessee, and Michigan.4 It also provided $2.8 billion in grants towards building out the battery mineral and material supply chain.

In 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provided tax credits of $7,500 for the purchase of new EVs, and $4,000 for used ones through 2032.

EPA issued a memo in 2023 clarifying that most EOL lithium batteries are hazardous waste and can be managed under Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) requirements for “universal waste.”

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) ended the federal tax credit for EVs under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) as of September 2025, which (while recent) has reportedly contributed to a battery surplus and divestment in related manufacturing that may also impact reuse and recycling markets.",https://www.rockinst.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AdobeStock_187267636-social.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 12:58:09.736972

Pamela Bennett, a horticulture professor at Ohio State, said rock salt is the worst for plants.","Winter has its fans, but even those who enjoy playing in the snow probably dislike the chore of clearing up after a big storm that dumps several inches or even feet of snow and ice.

It’s easy to dash to the closest hardware store to grab a bag of salt, but experts say there are a lot of environmental and other factors to consider when tackling all that ice and snow.

Here’s what to know.

What kinds of salt are out there?

Rock salt, also known as sodium chloride, is the cheapest and most commonly used product. But it’s not great for the environment and it’s not the most effective option out there.

“There’s a chart we reference that’s chemical effectiveness at certain temperatures. And really, when you get to about 15 degrees or colder, you can keep applying more and more rock salt and it’s not going to do any more than it already does,” said Martin Tirado, CEO of the Snow and Ice Management Association, a trade group for industry professionals.

In those conditions, other products — calcium chloride, magnesium chloride — release heat that helps the salt work better, Tirado said.

The different formulations vary in other ways, too, including how quickly they work, their corrosiveness and how they interact with moisture. Calcium chloride and magnesium chloride can cost at least twice as much as rock salt.

But all contain chlorides that can pollute fresh water, damage shrubs, trees and grass and crumble concrete sidewalks, stoops and driveways.

Blends and coatings can reduce the corrosive nature and environmental hazards of these salts, experts say.

Calcium manganese acetate is one of the tamest de-icing products out there, developed specifically to replace rock salt and be more environmentally friendly. It is biodegradable, a corrosion inhibitor, and typically used as a liquid. But it is much more expensive and can still create issues with dissolved oxygen on bodies of water.

What about those environmental effects?

Pamela Bennett, a horticulture professor at Ohio State, said rock salt is the worst for plants. It gets them in two ways: through the roots and through the air.

Salt percolates through the soil. When plants start to draw in salty water in the spring, that dries roots, leading to dry leaves. Brown tips on leaves indicate the soil might have gotten too salty.

Salt can also reach plant foliage — in the winter, that’s evergreens — directly when it’s carried by mist and spray. That’s an issue that’s worse on major roads as a lot of traffic moves quickly.

“When you have a lot of road salt on the highways, cars are splashing and wind blows it. That salt turns into what looks like a burn,” Bennett says.

What about my pets?

Most people walking their dog in snowy places have seen what happens when they walk across a heavy salt treatment — stopping suddenly and lifting a paw as if in pain.

“Their paw pads get dry or they get little cuts because those crystals are sharp, and then they’re chewing them because that’s the only way they know to make it feel better,” said Alison Manchester, an assistant clinical sciences professor at Cornell University. If they swallow enough salt, it can lead to vomiting, too.

For some people, animal safety is a strong reason to look to a nonsalt option against ice and snow.

So what are my nonsalt alternatives?

Abrasives such as gravel and sand can help with grip, so pedestrians and tires are less likely to slip. But they also come with their own problems.

Sand that runs off into freshwater bodies — lakes, streams and rivers — can kill natural growth, Tirado said.

Sand can also accumulate in your soil, eventually becoming a problem for plant growth. It can even make a type of concrete when it mixes in clay-heavy soils, experts say.

Unconventional solutions are out there. You can buy a de-icer that wraps its chlorides in beet juice or beet extract that coats the granules for a variety of benefits, including melting ice faster, working in colder temperatures and staying where it’s put. And a Korean company, Star’s Tech, is working with material taken from invasive starfish to produce a de-icer that it says more slowly releases chloride material and thus avoids some of the corrosion and environmental problems of salt.

Be ready to shovel more than once — and don’t over-apply

Experts say preparation and strategy can make clearing ice easier. That starts with watching forecasts to see how much snow is expected.

“People wait until after the storm to start shoveling,” Tirado said. “That’s fine if you’re having 1 to 2 inches. If you start getting 3, 4 or more inches than that, you can’t wait … you need to go out multiple times. That way it keeps the paved surface more clear in a productive and proactive manner.”

Ground temperature matters. If it’s warmer, you may be able to use less than you think you need. Colder ground temperatures might require more.

Proper application of whatever you put on your sidewalk or driveway is important, too.

“The key here is to not use too much and scatter it too much,” said David Orr, director of the Local Roads Program at Cornell. “We also do probably need to get into the habit that it may not be perfectly bare and that can be OK.”

For all the excitement over the up-and-coming generation of new energy storage technologies, good old fashioned pumped hydro still accounts for about 95% of utility-scale storage in the US, and its footprint is still growing. In the latest news, the Florida-based pumped storage firm Rye Development has just received a 40-year license for the proposed 1.2 gigawatt Goldendale Energy Storage Project in Washington State.

Long-Duration Energy Storage Is Coming For Your Fossil Fuels

Pumped hydropower does just what it says. During periods of low electricity demand, water is pumped to a reservoir at a higher elevation. When demand rises, water flows by gravity to a power station below. Pumped hydro can operate under a fossil energy scenario, but wind and solar offer a more sustainable, and economical, alternative.

Pumped storage facilities can run on an open-loop basis, charging and discharging a single reservoir from a nearby river. Or they can deploy two reservoirs in a closed-loop system, helping to alleviate concerns over water availability.

Rye Development has both kinds of pumped storage facilities in its portfolio. The Goldendale Energy Storage project is a closed-loop system and it checks more than a few sustainability and economic development boxes:

Redevelops a brownfield privately owned property, the site of the former Columbia Gorge Aluminum smelter plant;

Deploys existing road and transmission infrastructure associated with the existing 136.6-megawatt Tuolumne Wind Farm;

Delivers electricity for 12 hours;

Adds zero emission grid capacity to a region where electricity demand is expected to grow 30% in 10 years;

Creates 3,000 construction jobs over 3-5 year period;

Adds $10 million annually to Klickitat County revenue for schools and other civic infrastructure

The 12-hour period also supports long-duration energy storage, which the US Department of Energy has identified as a critical need for a future grid saturated with wind and solar power. The Energy Department defines long duration as meeting a 10-hour floor, with some future technologies reaching into multiple days, weeks, and whole seasons (see more long-duration background here).

Why Pumped Storage

The long duration future is already here with pumped storage, and new systems are also emerging. The California startup Noon Energy, for example, just reached a key milestone towards commercializing a 100-hour energy storage system based on fuel cell technology, and the Massachusetts firm Form Energy is looking forward to the first commercial deployment of its 100-hour iron-air battery at the Great River Energy project in Minnesota, an effort almost six years in the making.

Against this backdrop, it’s fair to ask why more pumped hydro facilities are needed to fill out the nation’s long duration energy storage profile. One answer is that pumped hydro is a long-established industry in the US, deploying proven materials and systems. The first utility-scale pumped storage facility was constructed in Connecticut in 1929.

As illustrated by the Goldendale’s 3-5 year construction time, some pumped hydro projects can be up and running faster than a typical fossil energy project. The opportunity to deploy existing brownfields, roads, and transmission infrastructure is another positive, alongside additional opportunities for floating solar power plants.

Under the current state of technology, some analyses also indicate that pumped hydro has a lower global warming impact than other forms of energy storage, in terms of emissions related to construction and materials. “Researchers found that PSH, on average, offered the lowest GWP when compared to compressed-air energy storage, utility-scale lithium-ion batteries, utility-scale lead-acid batteries, and vanadium redox flow batteries,” the Energy Department noted in a report posted in 2024, referencing data collected in 2022 and 2023.

More Pumped Hydro For The US

That doesn’t mean the end of the road for other systems. A movement is afoot to pair pumped hydro with other forms of energy storage to achieve additional flexibility and responsiveness. A new report from the Energy Department, for example, indicates that hydropower operators can earn new revenue, and save wear and tear on their turbines, by investing in on-site battery energy storage systems. The researchers found significant results when they modeled a 60-megawatt lithium-ion battery array with a duration of just two hours at an existing hydropower dam in Missouri.

The Energy Department plans to model the hydro-plus-battery combo at additional sites, firming up the case for both hydropower and energy storage in the nation’s power generation profile.

That raises the question … why is the Energy Department lending its seal of approval to renewable energy? After all, during the second term in office of US President Donald Trump, the Energy Department has shifted priorities in favor of nuclear and fossil energy. Nevertheless, the “American Energy Dominance” policy articulated by the White House does make room for some renewables, including biomass and geothermal as well as hydropower and related technologies.

Next Steps For US Hydropower

Over the past 30 years, the US hydropower industry has turned its attention away from new, Hoover-style hydropower dams, preferring to focus investor dollars on upgrading existing resources. Considering the age of the nation’s hydropower dams and pumped storage fleet, there is plenty of room to produce additional clean kilowatts by upgrading old turbines. Adding new turbines to existing dams is another potential opportunity.

Redeveloping brownfields for new pumped storage facilities aligns with the focus on re-using existing sites. Rye, for example, has also been working on the 266-megawatt coalfields-to-energy Lewis Ridge Pumped Storage Project in Kentucky. The Lewis Ridge project reached a key milestone last summer, when Rye submitted its Final License Application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

Rye is also the firm behind the proposed 400-megawatt Swan Lake Energy Storage project in Oregon, and the 500-megawatt Western Navajo 1 Pumped Storage project in Arizona.

The Western Navajo project is of interest because it will be located on Tribal land in the vicinity of the 2.25-gigawatt Navajo Generating Station, a coal power plant that shut down in 2019. Once notorious as one of the nation’s largest single sources of greenhouse gas emissions, NGS is not likely to make the Energy Department’s growing list of aging coal power plants to be supported. The facility was largely demolished in 2020 and the grounds were re-seeded, leaving only a few buildings behind. Converting the site to other uses has been challenging, though its railway infrastructure is a potential attraction.

Another Navajo Nation pumped storage project to keep an eye on is the proposed 1.5-gigawatt, 70-hour Carrizo Four Corners Pumped Storage Hydropower project in New Mexico, a collaboration between the Navajo Nation and New Mexico State University, with other partners. The 70-hour duration is aimed at alleviating seasonal swings in electricity demand and water availability, while filling in during periods when solar and wind generation are reduced.

Also, thought I'd find out where pOwned comes from and got this summary from my ai.

“pwned” (often written jokingly as pOwned) has a fun, very internet-y origin — and it long predates US politics. The short version pwned started as gamer slang meaning utterly defeated or humiliated It came from a typo of “owned” Politics borrowed it later, especially in online culture wars The origin story 🎮 In late 1990s–early 2000s online gaming (Warcraft, StarCraft, Counter-Strike), players would trash-talk by saying someone got “owned” — meaning dominated. On QWERTY keyboards: P is right next to O So “owned” often got mistyped as “pwned” Instead of correcting it, gamers kept the typo because it sounded funny and became insider slang. Pronunciations varied: “powned” “pawned” or just “owned but harder” By the early 2000s, pwned = totally embarrassed, destroyed, no comeback possible. How it jumped into politics 🏛️ Mid-2000s internet culture (blogs, forums, early social media) started using gamer language for debate: “Facts and logic” “Owned” “Epic fail” “Mic drop” Conservatives and liberals alike used it, but right-wing online spaces leaned into “owning the libs” as a rhetorical goal: Not persuading Not debating Just humiliating the other side publicly So “pOwned” became a stylized way of saying: We didn’t just win the argument — we made them look stupid. Why it sticks around It signals in-group internet fluency It frames politics as a competitive game, not civic discussion It rewards virality and emotional impact over accuracy Subtle cultural shift Early meaning: You lost badly at something you chose to compete in. Political meaning: I provoked you into looking bad, therefore I win. That shift is why the phrase often feels smug or unserious now — it’s about status, not substance. If you want, I can also trace: when mainstream media picked it up how “owning” replaced “debate” as a political goal or why it resonates so strongly with meme culture",,N,,2026-01-23 12:39:55.359263

Stakeholders across the U.S. electric sector are preparing for Winter Storm Fern, which is expected to impact an area stretching from Texas to New York, as far north as the upper Midwest and into parts of the Southeast. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration anticipates the storm to begin today and run through Sunday.

Anticipating widespread power outages, local distribution utilities have been activating recovery plans and warning customers to be prepared. The North American Electric Reliability Corp. says it is “encouraged that industry has taken actions to prepare for what appears to be a very challenging winter storm system.”

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright has asked grid operators to be prepared to utilize up to 35 GW of backup generation.

Dive Insight:

In a Thursday letter to reliability coordinators and balancing authorities, Wright called for the Department of Energy to “prepare to issue orders” under section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act to “ensure that the tens of gigawatts of available backup generation, which would otherwise stand idle, is available during emergency conditions.”

When notified, “even merely by phone call ... I will review the facts and, if appropriate, authorize the Reliability Coordinators and Balancing Authorities to direct backup generation facilities to run as a last resort before declaring an Energy Emergency Alert (EEA) 3, thereby avoiding potential blackouts,” Wright said.

The letter offered few details about the 35 GW of backup generation, and DOE did not immediately respond to questions.

According to Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s Energy Program, the units are diesel generators located at data centers and commercial properties.

“As the order recognizes, most of these units are not grid connected, and so have no utility or coordination abilities to address a system emergency,” Slocum said in a statement. “Unmentioned in the order is the massive harm to public health stemming from long-duration operations of these polluting units.”

The Winter Storm Fern has been compared to Winter Storm Uri, which caused power outages across the country in 2021 and was particularly harsh in Texas, where almost 250 people died. The catastrophe led to reforms across the Texas utility sector, and in other areas.

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas issued a weather watch Wednesday noting the possibility for higher electrical demand and the lower reserves during Winter Storm Fern. However, grid conditions “are expected to be normal,” it said.

The Lone Star State grid operator also said it is “coordinating preparation efforts with the Texas Energy Reliability Council, the Public Utility Commission of Texas, the Texas Division of Emergency Management, and other state agencies, as well as with Market Participants.”

CenterPoint Energy, which serves the Houston area, said it has approximately 3,300 employees and contract workers ready to support “storm preparation and potential restoration” across its territory. The utility serves approximately 2.7 million customers across the Houston area and surrounding communities.

Utilities around the country have signaled to customers they are prepared for the storm and recovery. In New Jersey, PSE&G said it is ready for “significant snowfall and extended frigid temperatures,” and warned customers that “snow and ice can bring hazards that disrupt power.” The utility serves about 2.4 million electric customers and 1.9 million gas customers.

“Our crews are ready 24-7 to restore power outages and handle increased requests to repair heating systems for our customers,” John Latka, PSE&G senior vice president of electric transmission and distribution, said in a statement.

In South Carolina, Dominion Energy said customers “should take steps now to prepare and keep themselves and their families safe.” The utility serves electricity to 3.6 million homes and businesses in Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, and regulated gas service to 500,000 customers in South Carolina.

“We’re closely monitoring the forecast calling for a mix of wintry precipitation, and that kind of weather can create significant challenges for our crews,” Keller Kissam, president of Dominion Energy South Carolina, said in a statement. The utility has activated an emergency operations center from which to respond, Kissam added.

The New York grid operator has adequate generation in place under forecast conditions, but said it would be keeping a close eye on fuel supplies.

We’ve “seen generators in recent winters challenged with accessing adequate fuel capacity during very cold conditions,” Aaron Markham, vice president of operations for the New York Independent System Operator, said in a statement. “We continue to work closely with power producers, utility companies, and neighboring grid operators to assess the status of generating and transmission capacity in advance of the cold snap.”

While most of the storm preparation focus is on grid reliability and its impacts on residential consumers, financial analysts have also keyed in on potential business impacts.

“More data center, more renewables, & less coal creates a vulnerable situation,” Jefferies equity analyst Julien Dumoulin-Smith wrote in a Thursday note.

“We view reliability and resource adequacy shortfall events as key negative tail risks for independent power producers,” Dumoulin-Smith said. “High profile power outages in data center markets like [Texas] would lead to further stakeholder push-back on data center demand outpacing supply additions.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/GgNGSnc12_xmmdjaCFcEjhpBxkAzw92hFEBnUqPYUdU/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzAyODU3MTA4LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2026-01-23 12:40:59.079820

Dive Brief:

The Center for Biological Diversity and a coalition led by the Southern Environmental Law Center filed separate lawsuits this week to stop the Environmental Protection Agency from weakening standards that limit water pollution, including the release of mercury, selenium and arsenic, from coal-fired power plants.

The EPA issued a final rule in December extending compliance deadlines for effluent limitations as much as five years, until Dec, 31, 2034, giving coal-fired plants more time to assess potential pathways “to continue producing low-cost electricity into the future while meeting wastewater standards,” the agency said in the rule summary. The agency said extending the deadline is necessary “to affordably meet the nation’s growing electricity demand, including for data centers and manufacturing.”

“Arsenic and mercury from coal-fired power plants can be stopped by readily available water pollution controls, but this administration wants these dirty, outdated plants to keep dumping their toxic pollution into our rivers and lakes for years to come,” Nick Torrey, senior attorney at the SELC, said in a statement. “Our communities can’t afford more cancer-causing pollution in our waterways.”

Dive Insight:

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced in September that the agency planned to give coal-fired plants compliance extensions for what he called “heavy-handed regulations” the Biden administration issued in 2024 to stop wastewater discharges from coal-fired power plants, including limitations on wastewater and coal ash that can contain selenium, mercury, arsenic and nickel.

The EPA in September also requested information on “technology-based implementation challenges” related to the 2024 rule that it will use “to support a future rulemaking to support practical, feasible, on-the-ground implementation of wastewater pollution discharge limits,” it stated.

The Center for Biological Diversity’s lawsuit, filed Tuesday in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, seeks review of the EPA’s deadline extensions, which it published in the Federal Register on Dec. 31, 2025.

“Under the Clean Water Act, coal plants are supposed to be required to use the most modern and effective pollution control technology available before discharging toxic wastewater,” according to a Center for Biological Diversity press release. “The Trump action delays a 2024 Biden-era rule that would have brought nearly all power plants into full compliance with the Act no later than 2029 or required retirement of coal plants that could not meet the standards of the Act.”

The SELC’s lawsuit, filed in the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals on behalf of Appalachian Voices and the South Carolina Coastal Conservation League, will be part of a lottery process under the Clean Water Act to determine where all challenges to the EPA’s weakening of the rule will be heard, according to an SELC press release.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/F_X1hHmu1X7-mp1PNnsfWpgHt9JzeVLgb0lOVDnG7GE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjE5MTc0OTY1X2FNajFOT1IuanBn.webp,N,,2026-01-23 11:58:38.737232

McKinley Gray, III",,,,,https://natlawreview.com/article/top-wheel-conversation-north-carolina-labor-commissioner-luke-farley,"invited North Carolina Labor Commissioner Luke Farley to share how employers can navigate the shifting landscape of workplace regulations, along with his vision for the future.
If you favor one side or the other too much, everything gets thrown out of balance,” commented Commissioner Farley.
“I am an optimist,” and “see the folks that don’t look after their employees as a minority,” Commissioner Farley observed.
The structure of the North Carolina Department of Labor also impacts the type of services it provides to employees and employers.
“What this means is the federal government makes the regulations, but the elected Labor Commissioner enforces them…we’ve opted out of federal enforcement,” explained Commissioner Farley.","At its annual Employment Law Symposium, Ward and Smith, P.A. invited North Carolina Labor Commissioner Luke Farley to share how employers can navigate the shifting landscape of workplace regulations, along with his vision for the future.

Commissioner Farley is the youngest Labor Commissioner to be elected in a century and the youngest sitting member of North Carolina’s Council of State. His mission is to make North Carolina the safest place to work and the best place to do business – creating an environment where, in the words of North Carolina’s State Toast, “the weak grow strong and the strong grow great.”

Before entering public service, Commissioner Farley spent 14 years in private practice, focused on workplace safety law. A graduate of UNC-Chapel Hill and Wake Forest University School of Law, he is committed to protecting workers and creating more job opportunities across the state.

The discussion was moderated by Avery Locklear, a labor and employment attorney, and Will Oden, a North Carolina Board Certified Specialist in Employment Law.

“I am always impressed when someone leaves a thriving career to enter public service,” said Oden. “What inspired you to do that?”

“I spent thousands of hours building my practice and enjoyed being an attorney, but I felt there was a higher calling for me,” Commissioner Farley explained. “I wanted to do something with my life that would have a bigger impact on the state and society as a whole, and public service was the way to do that.” When discussing the role of Labor Commissioner, he stated that he “thought it was important for someone with real-world experience to be in the role,” and that he “could bring a unique insight to the position.”

Growth vs. Enforcement

The North Carolina Department of Labor has to maintain a delicate balance between enforcing regulations and the need to create an environment where the economy can thrive. “Businesses create jobs, but the workers keep businesses running. If you favor one side or the other too much, everything gets thrown out of balance,” commented Commissioner Farley.

Farley, drawing on his private and public sector experience, volunteered that many employers that fail to follow the rules and regulations do so due to a lack of awareness. “I am an optimist,” and “see the folks that don’t look after their employees as a minority,” Commissioner Farley observed.

The complexity of state and federal regulations presents an obstacle for many employers. “Especially for small businesses, many just don’t have the resources,” explained Commissioner Farley. “My role is to connect them to the resources they need and achieve compliance. We educate before we regulate, however, for the bad apples that are out there, we are not afraid to issue citations.”

Nuances of Public Sector Leadership

Commissioner Farley is looking to infuse the culture of the Department of Labor with a service-oriented approach. “The employees we protect and the businesses we regulate are essentially customers of the department,” he said. “The workers are protected by regulations, and the employers can benefit from taking advantage of our educational programs.”

Motivating employees can be a challenge, as unlike the private sector, performance-based incentives do not exist. Further, the process for terminating an employee can be extremely lengthy and bureaucratic.

“I’m working on instilling a sense of mission into our workforce. Part of this means being present for everyone, so I’ve been traveling around the state to chat with people,” added Farley. “This also means I want to know if our employers or stakeholders have an interaction that is less than professional.” Commissioner Farley then provided his personal cell phone number to audience members for that purpose.

The structure of the North Carolina Department of Labor also impacts the type of services it provides to employees and employers. North Carolina is one of only four states in the nation with an elected labor commissioner; it is the only independent Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) State Plan state with an elected labor commissioner.

“What this means is the federal government makes the regulations, but the elected Labor Commissioner enforces them…we’ve opted out of federal enforcement,” explained Commissioner Farley. “That’s great for our businesses, because instead of dealing with bureaucrats in Atlanta or Richmond, you can talk to me. You have my cell phone.”

Consultative Services

“I like the ‘educate before regulate’ idea,” said Locklear.

“The on-site consultative services program is the best tool we have at the Department to build safer workplaces. It’s free, and there’s a firewall between our investigators and the consultative services arm. Basically, we want people to feel comfortable using the service, so that it will not result in a compliance inspection,” Commissioner Farley added.

Employers can take advantage of the consultative services offering by inviting NCDOL to their workplace. While there, department staff evaluate the workplace to identify potential issues that are not up to standards. If an identified issue is corrected within a certain time frame, there is no citation.

“I know from my private practice that the idea of inviting the Department of Labor into the workplace may sound a little crazy,” joked Commissioner Farley. “But I think about it like you can do something the easy way or the hard way. OSHA can randomly show up and issue a citation if something is wrong, or you can be proactive and reach out to consultative services.”

Commissioner Farley is focused on partnering with businesses to remedy potential hazards: “We are more interested in building collaborative relationships instead of something more adversarial.”

Oden: “For employers that participate in the consultative services program, do they receive any sort of safe harbor protection?”

“There’s not a legal safe harbor if there is a violation that occurs after a consultative visit; however, there is a credit provided for citations and penalty amounts,” explained Commissioner Farley. Arranging for a consultative services visit is treated as a show of good faith. “We want to incentivize the use of these programs,” added Commissioner Farley.

In addition to on-site consultative services, Commissioner Farley mentioned the Carolina Star Program. The Carolina Star Program is a safety recognition and certification program that does provide safe harbor for employers that participate. Only 146 employers have earned the certification out of a total of around 300,000 employers across the state, making it the Department of Labor’s highest level of recognition.

Because the process to receive the certification is extremely rigorous, employers that make it into the program are exempt from random inspections. “This is great PR,” notes Commissioner Farley, “since it shows you value your employees and are going above and beyond to ensure their safety.”

Informal Conferences

However, if employers are ever investigated and subsequently cited by the Department of Labor, participating in an informal conference is another strategy that employers should consider. The term refers to an opportunity to have a discussion with the Department after receiving a citation.

“Avery and I always recommend doing this. If nothing else, it’s a great education,” advised Oden, and “[i]t helps with building relationships” with the Department personnel.

Commissioner Farley has a strong belief in the value of informal conferences: “I told my staff they should make all reasonable efforts to resolve matters in an informal conference, and that every settlement offer proposed by an employer should get a response.”

In the past, settlement offers would not receive a counter if the terms were too far away from what the Department viewed as reasonable. “We respect it if someone makes a settlement offer and responds with a counter,” Commissioner Farley commented. “Employers should take advantage of this opportunity, especially under my administration. It can help avoid costly litigation.”

Future Goals

Moving forward, Commissioner Farley would like the Department to be viewed as a fair, balanced agency – one that listens to the concerns of both employers and employees. Providing exceptional customer service to all stakeholders is another strategic objective.

Reducing fatality rates is paramount to Commissioner Farley and the Department. Currently, the number one cause of workplace fatalities are workers being struck by equipment, a statistic that Commissioner Farley believes may be due to the rise of warehousing and e-commerce in North Carolina.

“To reduce those injuries, we’re starting an alliance program with key industry partners,” Commissioner Farley explained.

Employers may be able to sleep more easily knowing it is unusual for the Department to share information with other agencies. “I don’t go out of my way to share and I don’t think OSHA matters should be tied up in some other matter,” mentioned Commissioner Farley. “Of course, if I have a legal obligation to provide information, I will provide it.”

Essential Guidance

Commissioner Farley’s advice for employers is to be cooperative, collaborative, and transparent. “If the OSHA investigators get the sense you’re hiding something, their approach to the matter will change,” he commented. “Our inspectors are passionate about workplace safety. They will push very hard to find something if they think you’re being evasive, and I don’t restrain them from that.”

Further, Commissioner Farley wants people to know the Department is focused on being collaborative and promoting common sense regulations: “My job is to protect workers, but workers are only workers if they have jobs.”

The proposal would create a 9.25% income tax for those earners.
Therefore, many small businesses would pay the higher rate under the proposal.
Gretchen Whitmer is spending the week in Davos, Switzerland, her office announced Monday, and she participated in a panel on Tuesday at the World Economic Forum with further speaking engagements scheduled later this week.
“I’m excited to tell Michigan’s story this week and build relationships directly with global leaders at the World Economic Forum.","A proposal to implement a 5% surcharge on high earners and send that money to schools would increase costs on small businesses, reduce jobs and shrink the state’s economy, an analysis from the Tax Foundation said Wednesday.

Invest In MI Kids is collecting signatures to put a graduated income tax on the ballot. Under the proposal, Michigan residents earning $500,000 per year if filing taxes individually and $1 million per year if filing jointly would pay an additional 5% in income taxes with the additional money going to schools.

The proposal would create a 9.25% income tax for those earners.

In an analysis released on Wednesday, the Tax Foundation said the higher income tax rate would reduce jobs by 43,000, cut wages by 1%, and reduce Michigan’s overall economy by $8.5 billion.

It would also lead to individuals leaving the state, the analysis said.

“As a tax on high earners, only a small share of Michigan’s population would pay the tax directly, as proponents are keen to point out. But the economic ramifications of such a high-rate tax would touch the lives of far more than those subject to the new rate,” the analysis says. “By adopting a 5% surtax and transitioning to a progressive income tax structure with a top rate of 9.25%, Michigan would immediately become an outlier regionally and nationally.”

The paper says because the vast majority of small businesses are pass-through businesses, the individual income tax is the tax that small businesses pay. Therefore, many small businesses would pay the higher rate under the proposal.

Further, the paper argues that a top marginal rate of 9.25% – higher in Detroit, Lansing,=and the 22 other cities with a local income tax – would undermine Michigan’s competitiveness in the region and the country.

“Most states are cutting income tax rates in response to greater economic mobility for both individuals and businesses, with the goal of growing their economies and encouraging in- rather than out-migration,” the paper says. “If Michigan instead chooses to follow the path of states like California, New Jersey, and New York, the result would be fewer jobs, lower pay, a higher cost of living, a smaller economy, and growing brain drain as people leave for better opportunities elsewhere.”

A joint statement from the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, Small Business Association of Michigan, Business Leaders for Michigan, Michigan Manufacturers Association, Grand Rapids Regional Chamber, Home Builders Association of Michigan, and Michigan Realtors said the business community supports investing in the state’s future, including schools.

“But how we fund those priorities and outcomes matters. This independent analysis shows the proposed graduated income tax would not stop with a small group of high earners – it would gravely affect small businesses that employ millions of Michiganders and have significant consequences for jobs, wages, and our state’s competitiveness,” the groups said in the statement. “Major tax changes should be evaluated based on real-world facts and impacts, not slogans.”

Jess Newman, Invest in MI Kids steering committee member, panned the Tax Foundation analysis in a statement, and said Michigan residents are fed up with the status quo.

“Michigan currently has a projected $1.1 billion gap in revenue, and Michigan schools stand to lose nearly $280 million in Federal investments. Millionaires currently have a lower effective tax rate than plumbers, cashiers, and teachers,” Newman said. “And Michigan students are paying the price. Families in our state are fed up with chief executive officers and politicians endlessly repeating the same baseless lines to try to protect Betsy DeVos’s fleet of yachts at the expense of our schools. Invest in MI Kids is a common sense solution that would raise over $1 billion in K-12 education by taxing less than 1% of the wealthiest individuals in Michigan. It’s 2026. No one is falling for the same billionaire-commissioned misinformation that gets trotted out every time the ultra wealthy are worried they might no longer get to pay a smaller share in taxes than everyone else.”

Touting the legal victory for House Republicans during a press conference on Wednesday, House Speaker Matt Hall said the administration needs to have a better accounting of how departments are spending money when it comes to work projects.

“The biggest problem here is the Whitmer administration doesn’t have a clue how much money there was. They’ don’t know what they’ve encumbered. They don’t know what they haven’t encumbered,” he said. “We’re in February, and they should have known this information in November when they gave it to us.”

Last Friday during the Court of Claims hearing for House v. Department of Technology, Management, and Budget et. al, the attorney for the state departments said that about 70% of the $645 million in work project funding disapproved by House Republicans was encumbered before Sept. 15, 2025, and the end of the fiscal year.

That would mean only about $200 million was left unencumbered, which is significantly less than what House Republicans thought it was.

House Republicans were granted a preliminary injunction that prevents departments from spending any of the money left unencumbered after Sept. 15.

The fact that the total was far less than what House Republicans thought it was is inconsequential, Hall, R-Richland Township, said.

“We need better financial practices,” he said. “The reason we needed a preliminary injunction is because, it’s pretty clear to me, they’re trying to shove as much of this money out of the door.”

Hall said that even $1 saved for the state would be worth it.

“And I think we can all agree it’s much more than $1,” Hall said. “So, whether it’s $100 million, or $600 million, whatever we can get from last year … I think it’s going to be better for the state.”

Hall went on to say that this was especially important in light of the January Consensus Estimating Revenue Conference, which projected lower revenue for the state in coming years.

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is spending the week in Davos, Switzerland, her office announced Monday, and she participated in a panel on Tuesday at the World Economic Forum with further speaking engagements scheduled later this week.

Whitmer said the trip to the World Economic Forum is functioning as a trade mission to promote Michigan’s economic assets on the world stage.

“I’m excited to tell Michigan’s story this week and build relationships directly with global leaders at the World Economic Forum. On issues like innovation, workforce talent, and manufacturing, we are building a bright future and making a difference for Michiganders,” she said in a statement. “We’re creating opportunity and helping workers get the skills they need for good-paying jobs. We’re building vibrant communities with bustling main streets and downtowns. I’ll keep working with anyone to grow our economy, strengthen our defense and manufacturing industries, and help more families ‘make it’ in Michigan.”

Michigan Economic Development Corporation Chief Executive Officer Quentin Messer is also on the trip, which will include meetings with international investors, senior executives, and industry leaders aimed at “expanding company footprints in Michigan, attracting new foreign direct investment, and reinforcing Michigan’s position as a trusted partner in global defense and security supply chains.”

“These investment missions allow us to present our ‘Make It in Michigan’ economic development strategy to business decision-makers in critical markets and global government leaders who are actively considering places like Michigan to expand, innovate and invest,” Messer said in a statement. “With the continued federal policy focus on accelerating foreign direct investment into the US, Team Michigan’s presence in Switzerland and at WEF is about turning relationships into results for Michigan employers, workers, and communities.”

Whitmer participated in her first panel of the forum on Tuesday, which was a discussion on electric vehicle dominance alongside former General Motors Chief Economist Elaine Buckberg and business leaders from China and Brazil.

On Wednesday, Whitmer will join Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt in a forum of American governors. Later that day, she’s scheduled to have a press conference alongside American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten, business leaders, and Beshear. Whitmer and the rest of the group are slated to “pledge to enable one million young people to acquire the skills needed to power the future of advanced manufacturing and supply chains by 2035.”

During the Tuesday panel, Whitmer said frequent policy changes at the federal level in the U.S. have made it more difficult for auto manufacturers to sustain the type of electric vehicle markets that are growing in Europe and Asia. When policies on incentives or tax subsidies for EVs can be rolled back or significantly altered with each new Congress or presidential administration, she said, manufacturers have a harder time maintaining consistency in their own contributions to the market.

“I think the back-and-forth policies at the national level have made it more difficult for industry to go all-in and ramp up the way that that some of the Chinese companies have been able to, and I think that’s something that we’re working to overcome,” she said. “But alas, I am the governor of Michigan, not the president of the United States, and so I think that that’s something we’re trying to de-risk but has been something that set us apart and made it harder in the states.”

Whitmer’s appearance on the panel at WEF comes just days after her address to the Detroit Auto Show on a chaotic year in U.S. trade policy, where she sharply criticized the way President Donald Trump has wielded tariffs during his first year back in office.

Whitmer echoed her statements from last week’s speech in Detroit when asked whether Trump’s tariffs have had the unintended indirect effect of benefiting China’s electric vehicle industry.

“There is no question that the chaotic policies that we’ve been seeing coming out of Washington DC have created a lot of hardship, not just in the auto industry, but for consumers in the United States, and obviously for relationships globally,” she said, stopping short of saying whether she believes the policies have had a positive effect on China while stifling American automakers. “I think there’s a lot of downsides to the way that they’ve been implemented in the last 12 months.”

The panelists discussed consumer culture narratives surrounding EVs and how a combination of buying trends and lackluster policy tools put the U.S. behind most of the rest of the world in electric vehicle production and sales. Buckberg said Americans’ driving habits and propensity for purchasing larger vehicles than much of the world has meant EV alternatives to the country’s most beloved cars are significantly more expensive than gas-powered standards – but new tech developments could see that price gap shrink in the coming years.

“In the U.S., we’re really spread out in our suburbs; we do more road trips because we have relatively poor rail, the use case is different. People want bigger vehicles, bigger ranges, and that just means closing that price gap between EVs and (internal combustion engine vehicles) is hard, but I think it’s the technology,” Buckberg said, noting new battery technology that’s hitting the market this year. “That’s what will be game changing … that technology change makes EVs a more perfect substitute for the internal combustion engine vehicle.”

Once prices and policy in the U.S. catch up with its automaking counterparts around the world, the experts said, the country could truly be competitive with China when it comes to EV production and use – if consumer attitudes shift alongside the industry.

When asked if she drives an EV, Whitmer laughed.

“I haven’t driven in eight years,” she said. “(But) yes, (an EV or a hybrid is) going to be the next car that I buy when I’m back to being a private citizen next year.”

The introduction of artificial intelligence in the workplace is going to “cure the illness of being unproductive,” one economics expert said at the Consensus Revenue Estimating Conference on Friday.

The only thing stopping rises in GDP and increases in work output, said Justin Wolfers, professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan, is the adoption of AI technology without focusing on its shortcomings and the unstable regulatory environment.

The improvement in productivity if companies adopted AI use widely could increase by around 56%, while typically, productivity gains are only improving 1% per year nationally, Wolfers said.

In case studies in the workplace, AI use made tasks 56% faster to complete and professional writing assignments were completed 40% faster. Some studies, according to Wolfers, have found 80% of U.S. workers could have more than 10% of their tasks affected, while 50% of U.S. workers could have more than 50% of their tasks affected.

Other case studies have found that the use of AI for 20% of all tasks could result in a 1.2% reduction in labor costs and a 0.66% in production costs, Wolfers said.

While studies range across formulas of how many tasks companies could utilize with AI, the average productivity growth in a company is around 3.1% and the effects on U.S. gross domestic product in 10 years’ time is 12%.

Wolfers said if AI follows other technological advances, it will take time to see the benefits play out.

“I think people are talking as if this is something that plays out in a very short period of time,” Wolfers said. “History suggests that’s a little bit optimistic, but there are reasons to be optimistic about this.”

However, there are still policy issues that remain around AI including chip shortages in manufacturing, energy bottlenecks due to the high energy burden data centers, and the lack of regulation slowing the adoption of AI.

Only 10% of businesses across the country have adopted AI, and 14% intend to. Michigan is slower than the national average, with 7.9% adopting AI use, and 12.4% intending to.

When it comes to Michigan’s largest industries, manufacturing and health care, Wolfers said health care is one of the only industries moving quickly towards AI integration, and modern manufacturing is seeing automation moves, changing the face of the workforce to one of more skilled labor.",https://www.detroitchamber.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Michigan-State-Capitol.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 12:58:14.531746

Partnership with the EU can support India’s ambition to become a global clean-energy manufacturing hub. It will also help India diversify its export markets, while strengthening domestic value chains across clean tech supply chains.

The economic opportunity is substantial. India’s clean-technology market could reach USD90–135 billion by 2030 across solar, wind, batteries, hydrogen, electric vehicles and grid equipment.

These benefits can be catalysed by a robust EU-India partnership that allows each side to play to their existing technological and sectoral strengths, creating a stable framework for trade and investment that supports jobs and growth.

The Trump administration has rescinded $29.9 billion of the $83.6 billion issued to clean energy projects, and is working to “de-obligate” the remainder, according to a DOE press release.

“Over the past year, the energy department individually reviewed our entire loan portfolio to ensure the responsible investment of taxpayer dollars,” said Secretary Chris Wright. “We found more dollars were rushed out the door of the Loan Programs Office in the final months of the Biden administration than had been disbursed in over 15 years. President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America’s supply of affordable, reliable and secure energy. Thanks to the Working Families Tax Cut, the newly re-structured Energy Dominance Financing is playing a key role in fulfilling that mission.”

CHARLOTTE, N.C., Jan. 23, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- With Winter Storm Fern expected to move into the Carolinas this weekend, Duke Energy crews and support teams are completing their preparations and urging customers to finalize their own storm plans.

Forecasts point to dangerous travel conditions and outages that could last several days in the hardest‑hit areas.

Our view

Rick Canavan, Duke Energy storm director:

""Forecast models continue to shift, and both precipitation type and amounts may change as the storm approaches.""

""We're making our final preparations to ensure our 18,000 crew members have everything they need to assess damage, clear trees and restore power as soon as conditions are safe.""

""Freezing rain is going to be our enemy over the days ahead. It will build up on tree branches until the weight causes them to break – bringing down power lines and poles. The freezing rain and ice will also make roads extremely difficult for our crews to navigate, slowing power restoration efforts.""

""Winter storms like this can create serious challenges. I urge customers to ready themselves and their families for outages that could extend into next week – and check in on neighbors to make sure they're prepared, too.""

The latest

Meteorologists continue tracking Fern as it approaches from the west. Snow, sleet or freezing rain could begin as early as Saturday, with ice accumulation posing the greatest risk of extended outages.

Ice buildup of a quarter inch can bring trees and branches onto power lines. A half inch or more can pull down the lines themselves.

Tree and vegetation crews are completing targeted trimming today to help reduce outage risks ahead of the storm.

More than 18,000 restoration workers will be in position across the Carolinas by Friday night.

These include Duke Energy and contracted lineworkers, vegetation specialists and storm support staff from 27 U.S. states and Canada.

Duke Energy serves about 4.7 million electric customers in the Carolinas – about 3.8 million in North Carolina and nearly 860,000 in South Carolina.

What Duke Energy is doing

Tracking the latest updates from internal meteorologists.

Positioning crews, equipment and materials in locations that may experience the most severe weather.

Standing up 22 basecamps across the Carolinas where out‑of‑state crews park their trucks, pick up supplies and equipment, eat meals and board buses to nearby hotels where they sleep.

Preparing to deploy damage assessors, lineworkers and vegetation crews once travel conditions allow.

Trimming trees and vegetation in targeted areas to reduce potential damage to power lines.

Coordinating closely with state and local emergency management officials.

What customers should do right now

What customers should know

Safety hazards: Stay away from downed power lines and storm debris. Use generators safely and follow the manufacturer's instructions.

Grid improvements: Upgrades such as stronger poles, undergrounding and self‑healing technology will help reduce some outages and speed restoration.

Extended outages remain possible: Freezing rain and ice can cause dangerous road conditions, which can slow repairs – especially in rural or heavily treed areas.

Restoration will begin as soon as conditions allow: Crews will assess damage, prioritize critical facilities and restore power as quickly and safely as possible.

In some areas, restoration may be delayed due to blocked roads, hidden damage or hazardous travel conditions.

,Indiana American Energy ,2026-01-23 15:02:09+00:00,CNN,Big tech is increasingly promising to pay for spiking power costs. But there's not much to enforce it,Ella Nilsen,,,,,https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/22/climate/big-tech-warren-electricity-data-centers,"Around the country, certain areas where data centers were built saw electricity costs jump as much as 267% compared to five years ago, a 2025 Bloomberg News analysis found.
“These commitments do not explain how Big Tech companies – not American consumers – will bear the full cost of data centers,” Warren said in a statement.
It is exceedingly difficult to know exactly how much big tech companies are actually paying electrical utilities for the power they consume.
That would essentially ensure the world’s largest companies pay for their future power needs, and the region could depend on that money to pay for power for a long period of time.
“I think that a lot of parties were in denial about this; particularly the data center industry was absolutely in denial about this.”","As an electricity crunch drives bills higher around the country, big tech companies building power-hungry data centers are increasingly offering to pay for more of the energy they consume, so everyday people don’t get stuck with the bill.

At least, that is the message from seven large tech companies in new letters responding to three Senate Democrats’ investigation into how data center buildout nationwide is impacting electricity prices. But while these companies can make commitments, there are few regulations to ensure those promises are kept.

In mid-Atlantic states especially, a sudden boom in data center growth combined with a lack of new power to supply them has caused sharp electricity bill spikes in states including Maryland, Virginia, New Jersey and the District of Columbia. Around the country, certain areas where data centers were built saw electricity costs jump as much as 267% compared to five years ago, a 2025 Bloomberg News analysis found.

Seven companies, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Coreweave, Equinix and Digital Realty, responded to questions from the senators on how many data centers they had, how much power those facilities needed, and how they plan to procure and pay for that power.

Some companies made commitments to foot the bill. In its letter to Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Google said it would pay for all of the electricity it would use to power its fleet of data centers and would make changes to how it manages and pays for energy use when the grid’s power usage is at its highest, a time period when data center power use can drive up prices for other customers.

Similarly, Meta said it pays for the “full costs for energy used by our data centers” as well as funding “new and upgraded local infrastructure,” and adding new power to the grid, in a statement to CNN.

“We’ve been committed to these principles for many years and welcome recent pushes from other companies,” Ryan Daniels, a Meta spokesperson, told CNN.

Microsoft made similar commitments last week.

In addition, several other tech companies wrote that they would support being put into a different class of electricity ratepayers that would be charged more for power than residents or other smaller commercial customers.

But the letters, provided first to CNN, offer few specifics on how exactly companies will implement these promises. Data companies are optimistic. Representatives from both Digital Realty and Equinix told CNN that they were looking forward to collaborations with elected officials, as well as the public and private sector, that would make positive change happen.

But details remain thin. “These commitments do not explain how Big Tech companies – not American consumers – will bear the full cost of data centers,” Warren said in a statement.

It is exceedingly difficult to know exactly how much big tech companies are actually paying electrical utilities for the power they consume. That’s because there are often secret contracts inked between utilities and data centers, rather than a public rate case, said Ari Peskoe, director of the Harvard Law School’s electricity law initiative.

“The devil is really in the details here,” and consumers don’t have much protection with the current system, Peskoe told CNN.

Warren and the other senators argued in statements that even after companies’ responses, there are a lot of unknowns, including how much they are paying towards the massive electrical infrastructure that connects data centers to the grid.

“If these companies are serious about paying their fair share, at a minimum they’d be more transparent about their data centers’ operations instead of forcing local communities to sign NDAs,” Warren said in a statement.

Google, in its letter, wrote that it was signing binding contracts that would ensure it sticks to the agreement to pay for its power, as well as paying for new infrastructure that is “directly attributable to our growth, protecting communities and ratepayers from bearing the burden.”

Likewise, Amazon wrote the company would “pay the full cost of the electricity we use and make substantial investments in new generation and transmission infrastructure that benefit all ratepayers,” but did not detail exactly how it would determine how much to pay for transmission infrastructure.

While there is a patchwork of states trying to adopt rules around data center companies paying higher electricity rates, there is currently no federal equivalent.

Van Hollen, whose home state of Maryland has seen neighboring Virginia’s massive data center buildout show up in residential electricity bills, has introduced a federal bill requiring companies to cover their energy costs.

“Big tech companies are finally beginning to acknowledge that their data centers are saddling consumers with higher electricity costs and straining our power grid – but they still refuse to take full responsibility for these problems they are creating,” Van Hollen said in a statement. “Without action from Congress, they will continue to evade accountability.”

Under the aggressively pro- AI and data center Trump administration, federal policy so far has been aimed at getting data centers built as fast as possible, even bypassing state and local laws meant to discourage data center growth.

However, there are signs that the public outcry over costs has reached the White House. Last week, President Donald Trump teased an announcement from Microsoft that it would cover the cost of its electricity and help update the grid, acknowledging the public concern over high electricity prices.

“We will have much to announce in the coming weeks to ensure that Americans don’t ‘pick up the tab’ for their POWER consumption, in terms of higher Utility bills,” Trump said in a Truth Social post last week.

On Friday, a group of northeastern governors and the Trump administration announced they were asking PJM, the country’s largest electrical grid operator, to hold an emergency power auction focused on getting big tech companies locked into 15-year contracts to pay for the power costs to feed their data centers. That would essentially ensure the world’s largest companies pay for their future power needs, and the region could depend on that money to pay for power for a long period of time.

Peskoe said it’s a sign that companies and the administration are taking the issue seriously – but it’s no guarantee progress will happen.

“What I think is positive is they are acknowledging there is a problem here that needs to be solved,” he said. “I think that a lot of parties were in denial about this; particularly the data center industry was absolutely in denial about this.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-12-05t145744z-1108987844-rc274ha9nd8h-rtrmadp-3-aws-20260122163628306.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-23 10:59:51.030070

,North Carolina and Evs,2026-01-23 15:00:53+00:00,News From The States,Newsom wants $200M for EV rebates. Experts say it's not enough to fix California's slump,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/newsom-wants-200m-ev-rebates-experts-say-its-not-enough-fix-californias-slump,"The Newsom administration’s budget proposal — rolled out after President Donald Trump dismantled federal electric vehicle incentives and blocked California’s clean-vehicle mandate — would cover rebates for only about 20% of last year’s EV sales.
But the limits of the governor’s $200 million EV proposal become clear in the numbers.
Nationally, the loss of the uncapped, popular federal tax credit has accelerated manufacturer write-downs and sales declines as automakers adjusted to a tougher EV market.
The Newsom administration will likely lay out the details of its proposal in a draft bill tied to the state budget.
As the state moved from budget surplus to deficit, the Newsom administration and lawmakers never adequately funded it, advocates say.","California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s $200 million plan to revive the state’s stalling electric-car market faces several fundamental problems: It isn’t enough money, it may not reach consumers quickly enough and the state hasn’t decided whether to subsidize – or exclude – wealthier buyers.

The Newsom administration’s budget proposal — rolled out after President Donald Trump dismantled federal electric vehicle incentives and blocked California’s clean-vehicle mandate — would cover rebates for only about 20% of last year’s EV sales. That CalMatters estimate assumes the state follows the model of the Clean Vehicle Rebate Program, which offered rebates of up to $7,500 toward some electric and hybrid cars before the California Air Resources Board ended it in 2023.

So far the administration has released few details about the proposal, leaving experts and lawmakers circling a basic question: Who should get the money?

“It is better than nothing, which is what a lot of things are getting right now,” said Mars Wu, a senior program manager with the Greenlining Institute, which advocates for investments in communities of color. “How far that $200 million goes really depends on how the program is going to be structured.”

A small incentive in a huge market

California’s electric car market is one the governor celebrates on the world stage. While at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland earlier this week, Newsom highlighted that California has surpassed 2.5 million clean car sales, saying the achievement came after the state “invested in this future when others said it was impossible.” He framed the number against a modest goal to get 1.5 million clean cars on the road, set more than a decade ago.

California officials remain confident the state’s policies will succeed in pushing the transition to electric cars. Even as sales have slipped, EVs will drive future electricity demand, according to a long-term forecast approved Wednesday by the California Energy Commission.

But the limits of the governor’s $200 million EV proposal become clear in the numbers. A CalMatters analysis found the incentive would cover only one out of every five EV sales, assuming similar sales to last year, and the same average rebate level as the state’s last mass-market rebate program.

Advocates are also raising concerns about how quickly the money can get to consumers. Christopher Chavez, deputy policy director at the Coalition for Clean Air, a California-focused advocacy group, warned that the proposed rebates may not reach consumers until 2027, given how long it takes to approve the budget and to set up a new program. If the funding only lasts a year, the program would leave out buyers who need time to plan or save, he added.

“It’s not going to be enough — just to be blunt about it,” Chavez said. “Two-hundred million for a mass-market program will go very quickly.”

The proposal comes as the latest sales numbers show an electric car market slump. Nationally, the loss of the uncapped, popular federal tax credit has accelerated manufacturer write-downs and sales declines as automakers adjusted to a tougher EV market.

In California, the slowdown has pushed the state further off course from its climate goals: even before Congress and President Trump blocked its vehicle mandate last year, California was struggling to hit a requirement that 35% of new cars sold in 2026 be zero-emission. Last year electric and other zero emission cars made up about 23% of new car sales in 2025, down from roughly 25% the year prior, California Energy Commission data shows.

Sales slowed down dramatically at the end of the year, when EVs and other clean cars accounted for just under 19% of new car sales in the fourth quarter of 2025 — the lowest quarterly share since mid-2022.

The Newsom administration will likely lay out the details of its proposal in a draft bill tied to the state budget. The Clean Vehicle Rebate Program would be “the foundation we’d be building from,” wrote Lindsey Buckley, an air board spokesperson, in an email, adding that the goal would be to deploy the $200 million “as soon as possible to support the market.”

Buckley said it is “speculative” to predict the impact of a new EV incentive or how quickly the money would reach consumers.

With limited funding, advocates say the question of who qualifies for the rebates becomes critical.

“What we really don’t want to see is that money going towards higher-income folks for whom it would just be kind of like a bonus coupon,” said Wu, of the Greenlining Institute.

Fast or targeted: lawmakers face a choice

How the Newsom administration and lawmakers design the state’s next EV incentive will determine how quickly the air board can deliver rebates — and whether the program avoids recreating past inequities. California ended its last, broad EV rebate program in 2023 over concerns it benefited higher-income buyers. Targeting lower-income drivers delivers the greatest benefits because they tend to drive the most, and switching to EVs saves them money on fuel and maintenance, said Ethan Elkind, a climate law expert at UC Berkeley.

But income-based “means testing” can slow programs down, requiring income verification and layers of bureaucracy that eat up funding and discourage participation.

That’s a critique of one California program aimed at low-income buyers, Clean Cars 4 All, which offers grants to help drivers trade in older, more polluting vehicles for cleaner alternatives. As the state moved from budget surplus to deficit, the Newsom administration and lawmakers never adequately funded it, advocates say.

Lawmakers provided no new funding in the 2024–25 budget year, and in the current budget cycle, the state provided only about $45 million through a combination of funds and one-time budget actions, according to the Legislative Analyst’s Office. That falls well short of a sustained, long-term commitment, said Chavez, of the Coalition for Clean Air.

“It’s become — especially as the budget has become more difficult — more of a secondary priority, which is unfortunate,” he said.

Competing ideas, no clear consensus

California’s EV problem has no shortage of potential solutions — only disagreement over which one to choose.

Some policy analysts argue the state should focus on first-time adoption. A recent brief from Atlas Public Policy found that incentives are most cost-effective when they bring a household’s first electric vehicle into the garage — because once a family owns one EV, it is far more likely to buy another.

Elkind, of UC Berkeley, said a simpler approach — a point-of-sale rebate tied to lower-priced vehicles — would be easier for the air board to administer while avoiding subsidies for high-income buyers.

“If it’s just tied to the price of the vehicle, that’s pretty straightforward,” Elkind said.

Some lawmakers told CalMatters the air board should tightly target the rebates to communities most affected by pollution and transportation costs. State Senator Ben Allen, a Democrat from El Segundo, said incentives should focus on communities that suffer the most from air pollution, “so as to increase the bang for air quality buck.”

Senator Josh Becker, a Democrat from Menlo Park, said new incentives should go to the people “who are most burdened by transportation costs and drive the most.”

Fewer easy EV buyers in California

California needs to design its next rebate program well because its most eager EV buyers are gone and the state now faces a harder, more price-sensitive market, experts said.

“California is one of the first states to sort of get into that mainstream market: and it’s a harder market to convert,” said Loren McDonald, a Danville-based EV analyst. Potential buyers now expect seamless charging and balk at waiting 30 to 40 minutes. They also are not keen to install home chargers or pay more upfront. Many, he says, stick with traditional gasoline-powered vehicles.

“We burned through the innovators and the early adopters — those people who want to save the planet, those people who make good money,” McDonald said.

“Farm groups and Midwest ethanol advocates blasted the decision to form a task force instead of passing legislation, calling it a blow to American farmers already stung by low prices, uncertain global trade, and a lack of clarity over U.S. biofuels policies,” Reuters reported. “Farm interests want year-round sales of E15 – which has higher ethanol content than the E10 now widely available at the pumps. The move would boost demand for corn, ethanol’s primary ingredient. Oil refiners have resisted increased biofuel blending mandates in the past, citing higher costs.”

“E15 sales are currently limited during summer months due to air quality regulations,” Reuters reported. “The compromise deal would establish a so-called ‘E-15 Rural Domestic Energy Council’ to investigate topics including the sale of E15, U.S. refining capacity, biofuel blending credits and other issues and to recommend legislation by mid-February, according to a copy of the draft provision seen by Reuters.”

Ethanol, Farmer Groups Outraged

Agri-Pulse’s Kim Chipman, Oliver Ward, and Lydia Johnson reported that “ethanol industry backers expressed anger and frustration Thursday after House leadership decided to create a study council for biofuel issues rather than including a year-round E15 provision in a fiscal 2026 spending package.”

“‘We are very disappointed that Congress has again failed to adopt a simple technical fix that would have made lower-cost, American-made E15 available to consumers nationwide all year long,’ Renewable Fuels Association President Geoff Cooper said, adding that a compromise deal had been broadly backed by farmers, ethanol makers, large oil refiners and several small ones,” Chipman, Ward and Johnson reported.

“‘Congress picked foreign refiners over American farmers and drivers today. What a travesty,’ said Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor,” according to Chipman, Ward and Johnson’s reporting. “‘E15 delivers cost savings for consumers and generates long-term demand for American agriculture. These have been the facts during the 12-year-long debate over the simple act of allowing consumers the choice to buy a better value fuel year-round. Failure to act will now lead to farmers missing out on a critical market during the worst farm crisis in 40 years.’”

Progressive Farmer’s Chris Clayton reported that “the president of the National Corn Growers Association vented farmers’ frustrations Thursday after learning House leadership not only prevented year-round E15 from being included in a must-pass funding bill, but instead created a council of House members charged with reexamining the Renewable Fuels Standard and helping oil refiners.”

“‘Corn growers are disgusted, disappointed and disillusioned that after spending years of calling for passage of E15, Congress has again punted, and it has done so in a spectacularly weak and offensive way,’ said Jed Bower, president of NCGA and an Ohio farmer,” Clayton reported.

Some Lawmakers Express Optimism

“Still, some Midwest Republicans expressed optimism about the outcome in the House,” Agri-Pulse’s Chipman, Ward and Johnson reported. “Iowa GOP Rep. Zach Nunn, who led the push for the E15 provision, told reporters that the measure’s backers have a ‘firm commitment from the speaker’ to work with the Trump administration ‘to be able to make sure that this is a priority to be able to get done in February.’”

“‘We’ve been working for three years on the farm bill to make this happen, and it’s something that has to pass before March 1, when both growers, blenders and the American public need to have an answer on this,’ said Nunn,” according to Chipman, Ward and Johnson’s reporting.

“Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., called the study council ‘a huge step forward,’” Chipman, Ward and Johnson reported. “‘We’re going to have the House on record that E15 needs to be done by Feb. 25. This is as clear a pathway forward as we have ever had. And this is great news for American energy dominance and for American farmers,’ Johnson told Agri-Pulse.”

California’s real test will come when its electricity demand begins to rise again—which is likely in the near future.","Earlier this month, I wrote a story about how electricity emissions rose in the US last year, amid rising electricity demand. The growth in emissions was widespread. Power plants pumped out more carbon pollution everywhere from Texas to the Northeast.

But there was one notable exception: In California, carbon emissions fell by 8%.

The decarbonization of California’s power grid has been driven by huge growth in solar and battery capacity in recent years. The state has added more than 300 large-scale solar projects and more than 200 large-scale battery projects in the last 5 years, according to Cleanview’s project tracker. Small-scale solar and battery adoption has also been significant.

The growth of solar and batteries is now cutting into the state’s fossil fuel power plant generation. Since 2023, natural gas generation has fallen by 10%.

Much of this fossil fuel displacement is happening in the afternoon and evening hours when electricity demand is highest. Batteries that charge up on abundant solar power during the day now discharge during these evening peaks when natural gas peaker plants would otherwise fire up.

The state still has a long way to go in its efforts to reach 100% clean power, but the trends are going in the right direction. That wasn’t true as recently as just a few years ago. The state’s electricity emissions were stubbornly flat for much of the last decade.

The growth of solar and batteries wasn’t the only factor behind California’s decline in emissions last year though. Falling electricity demand also helped. Homes and businesses consumed 2.4% less electricity in 2025 than they did the year before.

Here the state was an outlier, too. On every other major US electric grid—in Texas, in the Midwest, in the Northeast—electricity demand rose. In Arizona, it rose by a staggering 8%. That demand growth, which was driven in many places by data centers, meant that coal and gas plants had to run more frequently.

In California there’s been very little growth in data centers or other industrial sources of electricity demand. The state’s high electricity prices and slow permitting process have made it unattractive to hyperscale data center developers. (Slow permitting has also plagued renewable projects for decades, slowing the energy transition).

Here’s a map showing all the planned data centers in the US from our project tracker at Cleanview. Note how few are in California relative to places like Texas, the Midwest, and the Mid-Atlantic.

California’s real test will come when its electricity demand begins to rise again—which is likely in the near future.

The state has ambitious plans to electrify its transportation and buildings, putting millions of electric vehicles on the road and heat pumps in homes. That electrification will be essential to cutting emissions economy-wide, but it will also mean more demand on the grid.

Once demand starts climbing again, California will face the same challenge every other US grid struggled with last year. To decarbonize in that environment will require deploying clean energy even faster.

Baton Rouge, La. – Governor Jeff Landry today unveiled the Whole-of-Louisiana Energy Strategy, a comprehensive framework for aligning state agencies, regional and local partners, regulators, utilities, and private industry around a shared vision to unleash statewide energy dominance and elevate Louisiana’s standing as a national and global energy leader.

“Energy has always shaped Louisiana’s economy, and under President Trump’s leadership, it is once again driving America’s future. With record investment and the creation of high-wage jobs, energy is at the center of Louisiana’s economic momentum. This Whole-of Louisiana Energy Strategy brings clarity and coordination to the assets that make our state exceptional, while reinforcing our shared commitment with the President to American global energy dominance and long-term opportunity for our citizens.”

Governor Jeff Landry

The strategy builds on the unprecedented economic growth under the leadership of Governor Landry and focuses on eight statewide priorities intended to accelerate investment and innovation, position communities for long-term growth, and unleash Louisiana’s full energy potential:

Expand Louisiana’s industrial base and drill, baby, drill

Win global investments to grow local communities

Accelerate market-driven infrastructure development

Deliver strategic energy solutions

Align state services with the speed of business

Strengthen community confidence in major investments

Unleash energy innovation

Establish Louisiana as the nation’s industrial power leader

Statewide priorities are supported by Regional Opportunity Frameworks that identify how region-specific infrastructure, workforce, natural resources, and institutions align with market demand and long-term growth trends. The frameworks are designed to help prospective investors, regional partners, and local stakeholders understand how to streamline pathways for energy, industrial, and innovation-driven growth opportunities.

“Our strongest year of economic development results confirmed what happens when vision is matched with disciplined execution. This strategy builds directly on that momentum by aligning regional strengths within a clear, statewide framework for energy investment, innovation, and high-wage job creation. Through a Whole-of-Louisiana approach, LED and our partners are positioning the state to lead globally while delivering real opportunity for Louisiana workers and communities.”

LED Secretary Susan Bourgeois

The Whole-of-Louisiana Energy Strategy builds on ongoing efforts to streamline and align state government around shared priorities. LED’s 2025 Strategic Plan and 9×90 Workplan, alongside the Department of Conservation and Energy’s (C&E) new organizational model and strategic framework, provide a clear foundation for coordinated action. These efforts are strengthened by an interagency agreement between LED and C&E on state energy development and planning, and accelerated by Governor Landry’s Louisiana Lightning Speed Executive Order, which formalizes a whole-of-government approach to move projects forward with greater speed, certainty, and coordination.

“This strategy allows LED and other state partners seeking to build the state’s energy economy to provide clear guidance on permitting processes and greater predictability for companies investing here. By safeguarding the resources and communities that make growth possible, we are strengthening Louisiana’s energy leadership and future while protecting our shared environment.”

Department of Conservation and Energy Secretary Dustin Davidson

The strategy reflects a coordinated effort to ensure Louisiana capitalizes on its momentum, assets, and proven execution capability to remain a location of choice for energy production, investment, and innovation, reducing foreign energy dependence and advancing U.S. energy dominance across the world.",https://press-herald.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-23-at-7.47.35-AM.png,N,,2026-01-23 10:39:54.972764

Skills and innovation for the long term Finally, the report stresses that people and innovation will underpin the success of UK gigafactories.","Britain’s ambition to become a global leader in electric vehicle batteries is hanging in the balance, according to a new cross-party report that warns the next 12 to 18 months will determine the future of UK gigafactories and the wider automotive industry.

The UK Gigafactory Commission, backed by the Faraday Institution, has published a sweeping set of recommendations aimed at accelerating battery investment, protecting more than 200,000 automotive-linked jobs and safeguarding the UK’s industrial competitiveness.

Its central message is stark: without faster, more coordinated government intervention, the UK risks being overtaken by rivals in Europe, the US and Asia.

A narrow window for investment

Global competition for battery manufacturing is intensifying as countries race to secure supply chains for electric vehicles and energy storage.

While the UK has made progress through initiatives such as the Battery Strategy, the Industrial Strategy and targeted funding programmes, the Commission concludes that incremental progress is no longer enough.

Chaired by former Business and Defence Secretary Lord Hutton of Furness, the Commission argues that Britain is at a critical inflexion point.

Major automotive manufacturers are making long-term decisions now about where to locate production, and the availability of domestic battery supply is becoming a decisive factor.

Without new gigafactory capacity, the UK’s automotive sector faces declining exports, weaker energy security and the risk of losing production overseas.

Lord Hutton commented: “The UK is at a pivotal moment for its automotive and battery industries. This Commission sets out a practical plan for securing a new gigafactory by anchoring it to original equipment manufacturer (OEM) demand, matching international investment incentives, and fixing long-standing barriers around energy costs, planning and grid access.

“If the government acts on these recommendations in the next 12 to 18 months, the UK can protect hundreds of thousands of jobs, rebuild investor confidence and remain a serious competitor in the global race for electric vehicle manufacturing.”

The case for a more interventionist state

At the heart of the report is a call for a shift in mindset at the top of government. The Commission urges ministers to move from a reactive approach to a mission-led industrial strategy, with clear accountability for landing major investments.

One of its headline proposals is the appointment of a named Cabinet-level minister responsible for securing a new gigafactory, an EV manufacturing plant and associated battery supply chains.

This role would be supported by a dedicated Cabinet sub-committee and a small delivery team, creating a single point of leadership to cut through departmental silos and speed up negotiations.

Anchoring demand to unlock UK gigafactories

The report places particular emphasis on securing a major global automotive OEM as a demand anchor for future UK gigafactories.

According to the Commission, guaranteed demand from an OEM with near-term EV expansion plans is essential to make large-scale battery investment commercially viable.

To achieve this, it recommends senior-level government engagement, tailored incentive packages and the rapid availability of pre-approved industrial sites.

These measures would allow the UK to compete more effectively with international rivals offering generous subsidies and ready-to-build locations.

The Commission also calls for a benchmarked, investor-ready support package covering grants, energy costs and site preparation, enabling faster and more credible discussions with battery manufacturers.

Strengthening the domestic supply chain

Beyond cell manufacturing, the report highlights the importance of building resilience across the battery value chain.

It urges greater investment in domestic cathode and anode materials production, aligned with the UK’s Critical Minerals Strategy, to reduce reliance on imports.

Battery recycling is another priority. Expanding “black mass” processing and advanced materials recovery would not only improve sustainability but also strengthen supply security for future gigafactories.

Delivering genuinely shovel-ready sites through an expanded Strategic Sites Accelerator – with grid connections, water access and planning permission secured in advance – is described as essential to winning investment at pace.

Policy reform to boost competitiveness

The Commission warns that industrial competitiveness depends as much on policy certainty as on funding. It calls for action to reduce industrial energy costs by widening relief schemes for energy-intensive industries, a key concern for battery manufacturers.

It also recommends adjustments to the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate to maintain ambition while avoiding penalties that could deter growth, and urges the government to seek flexibility on the 2027 Rules of Origin deadline, given limited UK and EU capacity in battery materials.

Skills and innovation for the long term

Finally, the report stresses that people and innovation will underpin the success of UK gigafactories. It proposes a high-profile national skills campaign, inspired by the Destination Nuclear programme, alongside expanded apprenticeships, curriculum reform and industry-led training.

To keep the UK at the cutting edge, the Commission also calls for faster scale-up of next-generation battery technologies such as solid-state and lithium-sulphur, with a strong focus on manufacturability and cost reduction.

Taken together, the recommendations paint a clear picture: the opportunity is still there, but the clock is ticking.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_2333774641-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 09:40:21.768762

After losing over 40% of its value from January 2025 to April 2025, the stock finished the year strong, up around 11.4%.

Although Tesla underperformed the S&P 500, it was a much better performance than many anticipated mid-year. It didn't come without disappointing news at the end of the year, though.

A core business headed in the wrong direction

Unfortunately, 2025 was a record-breaking year for Tesla for all the wrong reasons. The company only delivered around 1.63 million vehicles in the year, 8.5% fewer than in 2024. This was the biggest year-over-year drop in its history.

In the fourth quarter, deliveries fell 16% year over year, and for the first time ever, it's no longer the world's top electric vehicle (EV) seller. That distinction now goes to Chinese automaker BYD, which sold around 2.26 million battery EVs in 2025.

Part of the reason for the decline is the emergence of lower-cost options around the world (such as BYD and Geely), as well as the expiration of government tax credits that had lowered Tesla prices for many consumers. The $7,500 U.S. federal EV tax credit expired at the end of September 2025.

Tesla's future rides on robotaxis becoming a thing

Auto sales account for close to three-fourths of Tesla's revenue, but its long-term investment case hinges on the company's ability to deliver on its robotaxi ambitions. In an ideal world, robotaxis would give Tesla a high-margin business that operates more like a software company than an automaker.

Unfortunately, the stock is priced as an artificial intelligence (AI) company and as if robotaxi commercialization is guaranteed, though that's far from the case. Which brings us to the next point.

Tesla's stock is trading beyond a premium

Even with the question mark surrounding Tesla's current core business, the stock is extremely expensive, currently trading at 201 times its projected earnings over the next 12 months. For perspective, that's more than five times higher than Nvidia, more than 6.5 times higher than Amazon, and nearly 10 times higher than Meta.

Trading that expensively means investors are pricing a lot of growth into Tesla's stock, but its current business performance far from justifies it. Even with meaningful robotaxi progress, it would be extremely hard to justify Tesla's current valuation.

Program investments will also create direct construction-related jobs as well as highly skilled roles to operate the regional electricity market.","WASHINGTON, January 22, 2026—The World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors today approved the Regional Electricity Market Interconnectivity and Trade (REMIT) Program, which will be implemented over a 10-year period across three phases to boost energy connectivity in Central Asia. The multi-phase program will establish Central Asia’s first-ever regional electricity market, increase electricity trade, expand transmission capacity, and lay the groundwork for large-scale renewable energy integration.

During the REMIT Program’s first phase, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan, as well as the Central Asian Countries’ Coordinating Dispatch Center (CDC) Energia, will benefit from program grants and concessional financing totaling $143.2 million, comprising $140 million from the World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA) and $3.2 million in grants from the Central Asia Water and Energy Program (CAWEP), to implement their respective activities.

Electricity demand in Central Asia is climbing fast and is projected to triple by 2050 under a business-as-usual scenario. As the region’s economies grow, resulting in population growth, more industries, and larger cities, the need for affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy is becoming more urgent than ever.

Despite its potential to enhance energy security and affordability, electricity trade in Central Asia remains limited, reaching only about 3 percent of total electricity demand. Variable renewables contribute only 4 percent of power generation, even though the region is endowed with abundant and highly complementary clean energy resources that remain underutilized.

The REMIT Program aims to harness the region’s complementary energy assets: hydropower in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, thermal power in Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, and the growing solar and wind potential across all Central Asia countries.

Over the next decade, the REMIT Program aims to increase electricity trade to at least 15,000 GWh annually – enough to meet the yearly needs of millions of people across Central Asia, while more than tripling transmission capacity to 16 GW and enabling up to 9 GW of clean energy resources. Strengthening regional integration will support a more balanced and resilient power system, reduce outages, and lower energy costs for households and businesses.

“The REMIT Program supports Central Asian countries’ ambition to deepen energy cooperation and create a regional electricity market. This will enable more efficient use of energy resources, including cross-border deployment of clean energy, improve access to, reliability, and affordability of electricity for people and businesses, and support jobs,” said Najy Benhassine, World Bank Regional Director for Central Asia. “By 2050, stronger electricity connectivity and trade could generate up to $15 billion in economic benefits for the region.”

The REMIT Program has total indicative financing of $1.018 billion across three phases. These funds will help finance the design and operationalization of a regional energy market, strengthen regional transmission capacity, introduce digital systems to improve grid reliability, and enhance regional institutions and coordination. Program investments will also create direct construction-related jobs as well as highly skilled roles to operate the regional electricity market.

“The launch of the Central Asian regional electricity market, underpinned by a strengthened grid, will advance energy security, support large-scale renewable integration, and unlock private investment. The first phase alone is expected to enable about 900 MW of new clean energy capacity, leveraging $700 million in private investments. This will pave the way for a more resilient and interconnected power system across this dynamic region,” said Charles Cormier, World Bank Regional Infrastructure Director for Europe and Central Asia.

Future phases will build on this foundation by expanding the market platform, reinforcing and digitalizing regional transmission networks, and strengthening regional institutions.

CDC Energia, mandated to coordinate power exchanges between Central Asian countries, will implement the market and institutional activities, while national transmission companies will carry out grid investments. A Regional Steering Committee, comprising energy ministries and implementing agencies, will oversee the overall program implementation.",https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/photos/780x439/2025/dec/tj-power-grid-780x439.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 11:40:55.213416

This commits both countries to deeper collaboration on hydrogen, CCUS, North Seas energy, energy security, and the green transition.
The offshore wind sector in Germany looks back at a turbulent couple of years: In 2023, bidders in offshore wind auctions were ready to pay billions in ""entry prices"" for building new turbines, while another auction two years later failed to attract any bidders.
With this new impetus in mind, the North Sea Summit has shifted the focus from ambition to delivery, positioning the North Sea as Europe’s self-sufficient green power hub.
Industrial policy choices around offshore wind naturally differ across North Sea countries, reflecting national circumstances and existing industrial strengths.","Crucially, offshore wind reduces exposure to volatile global fossil fuel markets that we do not control. At a time of geopolitical instability, the UK has taken decisive action to secure clean, home‑grown power at prices well below the cost of new gas generation.

Renewables are now the cheapest form of electricity to build and operate. The more we build, the more often clean power sets the wholesale price instead of gas, delivering lower bills, greater security, and long‑term economic stability.

Cooperation between the UK and its neighbours around the North Sea on offshore wind energy has steadily increased in the past years, both at the industry level and among governments. Would you say that offshore wind energy has defied the fallout of the UK's vote to leave the European Union?

The UK is always stronger when it works with its European allies, and our cooperation on offshore wind is an excellent example of this.

As Europe’s two largest offshore wind producers, both the UK and Germany have closely aligned long‑term net zero and energy transition goals and work together through frameworks such as the UK‑Germany Energy and Climate Partnership, signed in 2023. This commits both countries to deeper collaboration on hydrogen, CCUS, North Seas energy, energy security, and the green transition.

The signing of the Kensington Treaty in July 2024 was another positive step towards the UK and Germany realising our shared energy ambitions through its lighthouse project to accelerate practical cooperation across the North Seas.

This cooperation is reflected in a growing number of industry initiatives and partnerships aimed at creating physical energy infrastructure links, including the NeuConnect and Tarchon electricity interconnectors, which are under construction or being planned, respectively. They will directly link our two electricity markets for the first time and anchor collaboration in the day‑to‑day functioning of energy systems.

The launch of the UK’s Modern Industrial Strategy in 2025 has also helped maintain momentum, providing long‑term certainty for investors and prioritising clean energy industries.

Does this offer a blueprint for sustaining deeper cooperation in other policy fields?

With the wider EU, we have committed to further our collaboration on energy at the UK-EU summit in May 2025 and have since begun negotiations to pursue the linking of the UK Emissions Trading Scheme and the EU ETS, as well as agreeing to start talks on the UK’s participation in the EU’s internal electricity market.

It’s clear that more efficient electricity trading is vital to unlock growth and private sector investment in the North Seas, and only by working together in the region can we harness the immense renewable energy potential it holds.

The offshore wind sector in Germany looks back at a turbulent couple of years: In 2023, bidders in offshore wind auctions were ready to pay billions in ""entry prices"" for building new turbines, while another auction two years later failed to attract any bidders. How has the sector developed in the UK recently?

The UK also experienced difficulties in the wind sector – Allocation Round 5 (AR5), in which not a single offshore wind project was secured, was a wake-up call. The last auction round, AR6, got the industry back on its feet. Now this latest auction round – AR7 - has secured a record capacity of 8.4GW of offshore wind, the largest auction of its kind in Europe.

How was this turnaround achieved?

Offshore wind is a capital‑intensive, long‑term infrastructure sector, and outcomes can be highly sensitive to broader economic conditions such as inflation, interest rates and supply‑chain constraints. These factors have been felt across the continent and underline why policy certainty and adaptable frameworks are critical for sustaining investment at scale.

In the UK, the offshore wind sector has benefited from the stability and credibility of the Contracts for Difference (CfD) mechanism, coupled with a willingness to refine its design as market conditions change. A number of targeted reforms introduced ahead of AR7 helped maintain strong competition and investor confidence. These included updating parameters to better reflect prevailing cost and financing conditions, improving auction flexibility to support project deliverability and giving clearer visibility of the UK’s long‑term deployment pipeline.

Would you say that a ""best-practice"" approach is pursued around the North Sea in which regulators and companies learn from experiences gained in neighbouring countries?

The UK places strong emphasis on international learning and cooperation. Through the UK‑Germany Energy and Climate Partnership and wider North Sea forums, governments, regulators, and industry share experience on auction design, supply‑chain resilience, grid integration, hydrogen development and hybrid interconnector‑linked wind projects.

While approaches differ between countries, there is a clear and growing practice of exchanging lessons learned to improve outcomes across the sector.

All North Sea countries have ambitions to greatly expand their offshore wind energy capacity in the next years. Would you say that there are already adequate mechanisms in place to ensure that resources are pooled efficiently and spatial and infrastructure planning makes use of synergies or at least avoids interference?

Cross‑border interconnectors, work on hybrid interconnector‑linked wind farms, and closer dialogue on spatial and grid planning are all helping to unlock shared opportunities and reduce the risk of interference between projects. Industry engagement through North Sea cooperation frameworks has also improved visibility of future demand and infrastructure needs.

That said, the speed and scale of expansion now envisaged mean that closer coordination will remain essential to ensure that investment decisions across the region are aligned in time and scale, which is why the North Sea Summit, and the opportunity it provides to discuss these issues face-to-face, remains invaluable.

The North Sea Summit was launched in the wake of Russia's attack on Ukraine. Has this forum succeeded in injecting new resolve into wider European efforts to make offshore wind a pillar of greater energy sovereignty, including in the UK?

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the manner in which the energy supply chain was weaponised against the UK and our allies, certainly redoubled our resolve to deliver clean, homegrown power by 2030.

With this new impetus in mind, the North Sea Summit has shifted the focus from ambition to delivery, positioning the North Sea as Europe’s self-sufficient green power hub. At the 2023 North Sea Summit in Ostend in Belgium, heads of state agreed to deliver up to 300 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2050. This year’s summit will deliver on that plan.

Strengthening local manufacturing and keeping out wind turbine producers from China has been a key demand by Germany’s wind industry and many policymakers in recent years, who argue that more sovereignty and security justify higher costs. Would you say that all North Sea Summit governments share a vision of how to develop the industry going forward, or are there marked differences in some key areas?

Industrial policy choices around offshore wind naturally differ across North Sea countries, reflecting national circumstances and existing industrial strengths. In the UK, the emphasis has been on providing stable market frameworks that encourage investment and rapid deployment, while supporting domestic capability through targeted measures rather than prescriptive requirements.

Across the North Sea Summit countries, there is nonetheless a shared understanding that supply chains, skills and manufacturing capacity matter increasingly for energy security as well as economic growth. Differences tend to relate to how these elements are prioritised and sequenced, rather than to the overall objective of scaling offshore wind quickly and reliably.

The North Sea Summit offers a practical forum to exchange experience and align where appropriate, while allowing different national models to coexist within a common ambition to build a resilient and competitive offshore wind industry for the region.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2026-01-23 11:40:59.236802

If the city’s tiny municipal gas utility uses more gas than its typical daily allotment starting on Thursday, Drake said, it will be charged “an exponentially higher rate” for natural gas on the spot market.

The city is only a couple of years into a 15-year plan to pay off its natural gas bill from 2021, when gas sellers told Drake the cost of 1,000 cubic feet of gas had jumped from $3 to $200.

“Let’s hope that doesn’t happen again next week,” Drake said Wednesday.

Natural gas prices have already surged this week as the potential effects of Winter Storm Fern — whose name was bestowed by The Weather Channel — started to come into focus. In a post Thursday, the Department of Energy’s statistical agency said the benchmark Henry Hub spot price Wednesday was roughly 59 percent higher than the previous Wednesday.

An enormous front of Arctic air will slam into the central U.S. this weekend and merge with a second, moisture-laden storm system coming through California. The combined storm will move slowly eastward impacting more than 150 million people from Texas to the East Coast, forecasters warn.

Northern Great Plains states are facing temperatures down to minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Heavy snowfall extends through the Midwest into New England. Farther south, the storm is poised to bring ice storms and sleet from Texas to Virginia, according to the National Weather Service and other forecasters.

The storm is a “trifecta” danger, said Jim Robb, chief executive of the North American Electric Reliability Corp., the interstate grid operations standards organization.

In other words, extreme cold, high winds and blankets of ice, sleet and snow threaten to bring down local power lines and freeze power plants and natural gas production.

And millions of residents are still paying off the massive natural gas price spikes that occurred in during Winter Storm Uri in 2021 in Texas and other states.

Henry hub gas futures traded Thursday around $5 per million British thermal units as numerous utility companies said they would open emergency operations centers to deal with potential power and natural gas outages.

How high gas prices will climb hinges on how much natural gas production freezes and how much demand rises, said Michael Webber, a professor at the LBJ School of Public Affairs and the mechanical engineering department at the University of Texas, Austin.

Winter storms caused the largest interruptions to U.S. natural gas production over a four-year period ending in 2024, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Mathieu Utting, a natural gas and LNG markets analyst with Rystad Energy, wrote in an email to POLITICO’s E&E News that gas production has already dropped by 4 billion cubic feet a day compared to early last week, “because of wellhead freeze offs or shut-ins in anticipation of extreme winter weather.”

“For the demand side, it depends how cold it is and for how long,” Webber said. “It’s a double whammy, because customers use gas to hear their homes and electricity from gas power plants.”

Utting said the storm is expected to add around 1 billion cubic feet a day of gas demand over the next week.

President Donald Trump campaigned on making energy prices more affordable, but the White House dismissed concerns about rising natural gas prices in a statement on Thursday.

“Instead of fixating on normal market fluctuations that are being driven by a looming winter storm, the media should focus on how American natural gas output is projected to hit a record high this year,” said Taylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson.

But consumer advocates said the coming winter storm could echo concerns from 2021, when natural gas sellers made massive profits selling gas at high prices as demand surged.

“I am extremely concerned that companies will exploit this cold snap to engage in profiteering, and I think not only is that immoral, but it should be illegal,” said Tyson Slocum, director of the energy program at Public Citizen.

An existing energy affordability “crisis” is being driven by higher natural gas prices caused by record liquefied natural gas exports from the U.S., Slocum said Thursday. The natural gas industry has disputed such characterizations and said prices go up when gas supply is constrained.

“We should be regulating and curtailing exports during extreme weather events, during times when we see domestic price spikes or if we see domestic shortages,” Slocum said.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a press release Thursday he directed regional grid operators to maintain communications with his agency and to be prepared to bring backup power generation online during Fern.

In a related letter to grid operators Thursday, Wright wrote that he has directed DOE to prepare to issue orders that would ensure that “tens of gigawatts of available backup generation, which would otherwise stand idle, is available during emergency conditions.”

It was unclear Thursday evening whether he expected that backup generation to be available by the time Fern arrives this weekend.

Lessons learned

Dozens of lawsuits are still working their way through courts over sky-high natural gas prices that dominated the market during Winter Storm Uri in 2021.

Spot prices at the Henry Hub jumped from $3.76 per MMBtu on Feb. 10, 2021, to $23.86 on Feb. 17, according toEIA.

Some natural gas customers, however, saw much larger increases.

The Oklahoma Corporation Commission reported that prices spiked from around $3 per thousand cubic feet of gas to more than $1,200, ultimately leaving ratepayers on the hook to pay off nearly $5 billion in bonds issued to cover that increase in price, with interest. One thousand cubic feet of gas is roughly equivalent to 1 MMBtu.

Texas natural gas ratepayers now are paying off $3.4 billion in bonds to help natural gas utility companies stay afloat as prices also spiked in that state. That does not include the $2.1 billion in securitization bonds that the state’s grid operator is charging ratepayers to help pay generators for certain “extraordinary costs” incurred during Uri.

Meanwhile, BloombergNEF has estimated that natural gas sellers in Texas alone made about $11 billion during the five days tied to the 2021 winter storm.

While natural gas sales that occur through pipelines that cross state lines are regulated by FERC, those that occur in pipeline systems that stay contained within one state are opaque, Webber said.

Webber pointed to states like Texas, where natural gas companies can both own pipelines and the gas within the pipelines. Regulators there don’t require gas companies to report the prices at which they acquire and sell their natural gas.

“You can own title and transfer so you can control the flow of the gas,” Webber said. “The concern, and the people who feel like they were price gouged, say that the people who are selling and moving gas charge whatever they want — that it’s not a real competitive marketplace because it’s not a common carrier.”

State attorneys general in Oklahoma and Kansas filed lawsuits in Uri’s aftermath, accusing natural gas companies of price gouging.

Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond (R) said in a statement that his office would monitor natural gas supplies and market pricing during Winter Storm Fern.

“It is critical that Oklahomans are not exploited, especially during extreme weather events,” Drummond said. “While energy markets can experience volatility during periods of severe cold, those conditions do not excuse predatory behavior or violations of contractual obligations.”

Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach (R) announced last February he would abandon his price gouging lawsuit tied to overcharging during Uri. FERC, meanwhile, launched an investigation into potentially unlawful actions relating to Uri, but last November, it closed the investigation and opted not to pursue enforcement actions.

Now, government and energy industry officials are looking ahead to Winter Storm Fern.

Laura Swett, chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said Thursday that her agency is keeping a close eye on the storm, particularly in terms of electric reliability.

“From every utility that I have spoken to or grid operator, we are benefiting from our lessons learned from past extreme weather events,” Swett told reporters at FERC’s monthly meeting. “Everyone combs over those to see what we can do better next time, so I think we are as best prepared as we possibly could be.”

Learning from past events was a sentiment echoed by the Natural Gas Supply Association, whose members include producers and marketers, or sellers, of natural gas.

The groups’ members have “invested significantly in winterization and system coordination following past extreme weather events,” said Dena Wiggins, the association’s CEO, in a statement Thursday. “The pending storm has the industry laser focused on doing all we can to serve the needs of consumers.”

Storm preparations

Energy industry officials know they can expect drops in gas output as below-freezing conditions spread across the country.

Natural gas production in Texas declined by almost 45 percent during Uri, according to EIA, leading the state’s oil and gas regulator to adopt its first rules requiring natural gas operators to weatherize their equipment.

The Appalachian Basin saw natural gas production sink by more than 6 billion cubic feet a day during Winter Storm Elliott in 2022, when temperatures fell below 0 degrees Fahrenheit in parts of the Northeast.

In an advisory this week, the Railroad Commission of Texas — which oversees the state’s oil and natural gas industry — urged operators under its purview to take steps such as monitoring weather reports, listening to orders from local emergency officials and securing “all personnel, equipment and facilities to prevent injury or damage.”

Officials with the American Petroleum Institute, one of the nation’s largest oil and gas trade groups, said Thursday that the natural gas industry “remains focused on sustaining safe, dependable operations while protecting worker safety throughout this cold weather event.”

Meanwhile, concerns are growing for the grid as Fern approaches.

The storm will test the winter storm defenses installed by power plant and gas infrastructure owners and operators since Uri in 2021 and Elliott in 2022.

Grid coordinators have called on power plant operators to be at maximum readiness by delaying maintenance outages, according to NERC’s Robb.

NERC said in a winter readiness report in November that New England, the Carolinas, parts of the Tennessee Valley region and most of Texas were at an “elevated risk” of power emergencies in extreme storms.

Power plant winterization standards developed by NERC and ordered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission have been added and strengthened over the past three years. Although final actions won’t be complete in every case for two to four more years, Robb said protections are definitely stronger.

“The surface equipment in the electric sector should be well prepared for this event,” Robb said. “The issue is that those requirements don’t extend into the fuel supply because we don’t have authority to do that. So we’re banking on the gas industry doing the things that they’ve committed to do voluntarily to keep gas flowing during very cold periods.”

State regulators and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the state’s main power grid operator, made sweeping changes after Uri, when much of the state was plunged into darkness for days and more than 200 people died.

The rules require power plants to winterize their facilities, for example.

ERCOT officials said this week that they expect there will be enough generation “to meet demand this winter.”

“We are continuing to monitor the weather conditions throughout this week and keep Texans informed through our communications channels,” the grid operator said in a statement. “ERCOT will continue to deploy all available resources to manage the grid reliably and coordinate closely with the Public Utility Commission, generation providers, and transmission utilities.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/96/70/90408c6741759f5111f3c1b5fd27/transco-pipeline-32881.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 07:39:13.759843

One analysis found that bills from Indiana’s five investor-owned electric utilities shows went up 17.5% in one year, or $28 a month on average statewide.

So, I was excited to hear that House Republicans would be tackling utility affordability.

But the bill won’t help all Hoosiers.

The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission oversees eight electric utilities and 17 natural gas utilities in the state, according to the commission. However, more than 100 municipal and Rural Electric Membership Cooperatives have withdrawn from the commission’s rate jurisdiction. That includes my provider.

No shortage of suggestions heard to improve electric service affordability measure

Kerwin Olson, executive director of the consumer-focused Citizens Action Coalition, estimates up to 20% of Hoosiers aren’t protected by regulators — about one in five Hoosiers.

“The rationale is largely that those customers are taxpayers and constituents or voting members and can take complaints directly to the utility. Their only recourse really is common courts if they are not satisfied,” he said.

Olson thinks it’s fair in the context of investor-owned utilities needing more oversight. He does wish some of the state rules on deposits, late fees, reconnect charges and efficiency programs applied to all utilities.

But that’s a fight for another day.

Legislative efforts

The rest of you should be watching House Bill 1002.

Most of the bill doesn’t do anything to reduce or control your gas and electric bills. It instead provides ways to cope with them. But that doesn’t mean those provisions aren’t important.

The bill would do the following:

Require an electricity supplier that is under the jurisdiction of the IURC to offer a low-income customer assistance program that provides financial assistance to low-income residential customers for the payment of monthly bills for utility service.

Block service shut-offs to those customers during dangerously hot months. This protection already exists for cold-weather months — another time when bills jump but disconnection could harm Hoosiers.

Put all ratepayers on predictable billing plans. These plans level out your monthly bills so that your costs are more consistent. But they don’t control or lower them. And ratepayers could opt out of the program if they want.

The one section that could have a positive future impact is performance-based ratemaking.

It’s a newer concept, under consideration in other states, that would tie future rate increase requests to specific metrics. The Indiana bill would pair the new multi-year rate plans with performance metrics and incentives tied to customer affordability and service restoration.

Lawmakers may also look at peak load demand or environmental sustainability.

It’s unclear if the incentives would be enough to truly impact future rate increases, and customers wouldn’t see change for several years. But it’s a worthy discussion to have as Hoosiers struggle with higher costs.

Gov. Mike Braun is hoping to move the needle by revamping IURC’s membership and targeting rate hikes that pad company profits at the expense of ratepayers.

“Affordability is why I support Rep. Alaina Shonkwiler’s bill to hold investor-owned utility companies accountable to provide affordable energy before they can increase their profit margin,” he said during his State of the State speech.

Now, one of Tesla’s chief competitors is prepping to take the case to voters.

Electric truck manufacturer Rivian has pledged $4.6 million to get on equal footing with Elon Musk’s EV giant.

A committee calling itself the Washington Coalition for Consumer Choice and Innovation is pushing a ballot measure to open that opportunity to more electric vehicle makers.

State law blocks car buyers from purchasing electric vehicles directly from the manufacturer, so they’re forced to instead buy through dealerships. Tesla has been the sole exception to that law for over a decade. So while Rivian and luxury EV brand Lucid have showrooms in Washington, they can’t sell vehicles through them.

In a statement, the coalition said it “believes that all Washington drivers should have the option to test drive and purchase the vehicle of their choice.”

“We are currently pursuing a November 2026 ballot measure to make these choices available to Washington consumers,” the statement continues. “We believe the majority of voters will agree with us that Washington’s outdated car sales laws should be updated.”

What organizations and businesses make up the coalition is unclear.

The group has brought on California-based Winner & Mandabach Campaigns, a leading consultancy focused on ballot initiatives. The firm has worked on a number of Washington state measures, including the successful opposition to Initiative 1631 levying a carbon fee on emissions. Its website boasts of a 90% win rate for its ballot measure campaigns.

To qualify for the ballot, initiative campaigns must turn in at least 308,911 voter signatures by early July to the secretary of state’s office. The office recommends submitting at least 390,000 signatures to allow for invalid ones. The coalition’s proposal didn’t appear to have been filed with the secretary of state late Thursday.

Last year, legislation to allow companies like Rivian and Lucid to sell directly to consumers stalled in the state House. A coalition of environmental and business groups argued at the time that opening up the market would speed up sales of electric vehicles and help the state meet its goal of reducing carbon emissions in the transportation sector.

Car dealers fearful of losing business have strongly opposed these efforts. The 2025 legislation died in a legislative committee chaired by a Democratic lawmaker who owns car dealers, Rep. Amy Walen, D-Kirkland. But Walen said that didn’t play a role in the bill’s demise, saying it just lacked support.

Walen faced a complaint to the Legislative Ethics Board alleging a conflict of interest, but the board found no basis for it, noting a similar bill passed the committee in 2024 while Walen was chair.

“Rather than Respondent favoring her outside employment interests over her legislative duties as is alleged in the Complaint, it appears that there has been and continues to be a general lack of support for these aforementioned bills,” the ethics board determined.

The Washington State Auto Dealers Association declined to comment on the proposed ballot initiative.

In November, voters will also get to weigh in on an initiative seeking to bar transgender athletes from girls’ sports. The secretary of state’s office on Thursday confirmed that the measure, sponsored by the conservative organization Let’s Go Washington, received enough signatures.

Renewable Energy Employment Snapshot

Clean energy jobs are not where you think they are 🤔

Last week, we examined how renewable energy employment is growing globally, even as the nature of that growth changes. Digging on IRENA’s latest review, one pattern stands out: clean energy jobs are not evenly distributed. While capacity is expanding across countries, employment remains concentrated in a limited number of geography. Understanding why this matters is key to seeing where real clean energy career opportunities are emerging.

Despite renewable energy projects appearing worldwide, most jobs remain concentrated in a small number of countries. According to IRENA, five markets alone, China, Brazil, India, the United States and the European Union, account for the majority of global renewable energy employment. China dominates in absolute terms, with more than 7 million jobs in 2024, reflecting its scale in manufacturing, installations and related services, while other regions with growing deployment capture fewer jobs overall.

This concentration is driven less by where capacity is installed and more by where industrial activity takes place.

Solar and wind employment, in particular, is heavily shaped by manufacturing and supply chains. IRENA estimates that China alone accounts for around 58% of global solar PV jobs and over 60% of wind employment, while the top ten countries together capture more than 80% of jobs in these technologies. Countries without domestic manufacturing or strong supply chain integration tend to see renewable employment limited to installation and operations, even as capacity continues to expand locally.

Is the African Giant Taking the Bull by the Horns? 🇳🇬

While most attention on renewable energy employment focuses on established industrial hubs, recent developments in Africa’s largest economy hint at a different terrain. Last week, Nigerian government unveiled a planned $2 billion National Climate Change Fund to support emissions reduction and resilience projects, alongside a $500 million Climate Investment Platform designed to attract further climate capital. These moves are part of a broader bid to mobilise tens of billions in climate finance and align with the country’s Energy Transition Plan, which aims for net-zero by 2060 and universal energy access. Whether this strategy translates into deeper domestic capacity, stronger supply chains or a more substantial position in the clean energy landscape remains to be seen, but it signals how emerging markets are trying to shape their role, rather than simply follow global deployment trends.

The role of industrial policy, domestic manufacturing and supply chains

Where renewable energy jobs concentrate, policy choices are rarely neutral. IRENA highlights that countries capturing the largest share of employment are those that have actively supported domestic manufacturing and supply chain development. China’s dominance is not only the result of deployment scale, but of sustained industrial policy that has built vertically integrated solar and wind manufacturing ecosystems. In 2024 alone, China produced more than 80% of global solar PV modules and held around 70% of global wind turbine orders, anchoring millions of jobs within its borders.

Other countries that appear prominently in the employment data show similar patterns, though at smaller scale 👎. Brazil’s renewable workforce is closely tied to domestic biofuels and hydropower industries, while India and the European Union combine deployment targets with local content rules, manufacturing incentives, and export-oriented supply chains. Where these elements are absent, employment outcomes look very different. Countries relying heavily on imports often see rapid capacity growth without comparable job creation, reinforcing the gap between where clean energy is installed and where its economic value and jobs, are retained.

What this means for job mobility, relocation and regional career strategy?

For workers, this geographic concentration has practical consequences. IRENA’s data shows that most renewable energy jobs are created where manufacturing, engineering services and long-term operations are established, not necessarily where projects are built. As a result, job opportunities are far more abundant in countries with deep industrial ecosystems than in markets focused primarily on deployment. This limits the portability of many clean energy roles and makes relocation a structural feature of career progression rather than an exception.

The implications differ by role and career stage. Installation and construction jobs tend to be local and project-based, while manufacturing, supply chain and engineering roles cluster in a small number of global hubs. IRENA highlights that the top ten countries account for roughly 80–90% of employment in major renewable technologies, leaving limited pathways for sustained career growth in smaller or import-dependent markets. For professionals and employers alike, this reinforces the need to think strategically about location, skills specialisation and long-term mobility, rather than assuming that renewable deployment alone will generate durable local employment.

What This Means for You?

This geography-first reality changes how clean energy careers, hiring strategies and workforce planning need to be approached. Opportunity is no longer defined by where renewables are being built, but by whereindustrial capacity, skills ecosystems and long-term demand are anchored. The most resilient clean energy careers will belong to those who understand where jobs are rooted, build transferable skills and position themselves where that demand is built to last!

In a long social media thread Tuesday, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) declared that anyone who thinks Democrats should avoid talking about climate change “are wrong about pretty much everything.”

The posts are part of the debate within the Democratic Party about the best messaging ahead of the midterm elections, and as leaders grapple with their 2024 loss to Donald Trump.

“There’s a thing out there called a ‘climate husher,'” Whitehouse, the Environment and Public Works Committee ranking member, posted.

“Anyone who cares about what fossil fuel pollution is doing to Earth’s natural systems needs to ignore these so-called ‘climate hushers’ — people who think Dems should stop talking about climate.”

Immediately after losing the White House and both chambers of Congress, many Democrats said they should have focused more on kitchen table issues and less on progressive causes. Whitehouse argues climate change is compatible with that.

The senator’s lengthy thread notes that people are feeling the economic burdens of climate change throughout the country — from home insurance hikes to drops in property values. And he asserted that congressional Democrats should lean into that message rather than shy away from it.

“When leaders don’t talk about something, enthusiasm falls among voters,” Whitehouse posted. “In politics, you can often make your own wind, or you can make your own doldrums.

“The ‘climate hushers’ are conceding defeat, falling into circular reasoning, asking us to make our own doldrums. Specifically, they ignore the endemic Democratic problem of ‘poll-chasing’: we take a poll, ask where voters are, and then ape what they were thinking when the polls were taken back to them.”

In an interview about the post, Whitehouse said the “climate hushing” narrative has made its way into strategy conversations on Capitol Hill.

Indeed, many congressional Democrats have noticeably narrowed their discussions of climate change to center exclusively on rising utility bills, in response to the Trump administration’s ongoing attacks on renewable energy.

Whitehouse pushed back on this strategy, saying that the party should also continue calling out the harmful impacts of fossil fuel emissions and the influence of oil and gas companies on Trump administration policy.

Republicans have picked up on the shift and have used it to their advantage. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said on Fox Business this week: “You actually see on the left, this debate going on right now, where a lot of people within the Democratic Party, they are talking about how they’ve lost the narrative, or the culture war, on climate.”

Left-leaning thinkers and independent analysts have also argued that Democrats may have gone too far in following the lead of environmental groups they say were out of touch with most Americans.

Columnist Matt Yglesias argued in a New York Times op-ed that Democrats should not be hostile to oil and gas. Longtime energy expert Daniel Yergin wrote in Foreign Affairs about the “troubled energy transition” and the need for a “pragmatic path” forward. And Veteran Democratic operative Adam Jentleson started the think tank the Searchlight Institute to curb the influence of the “groups” on party positions, including climate.

But Whitehouse shrugged off this narrative as being fed by pollsters who “don’t even understand the climate problem.”

“I’ve been at polling presentations made to the Senate Democratic Caucus in a so-called strategy retreat that didn’t ask about climate change and didn’t ask about dark money corruption. So there’s this massive blind spot that we have as well,” he said.

Although Whitehouse has acknowledged some shortcomings to Democrats’ past depictions of climate change — “as sort of a moral imperative, as an intangible thing floating out there, something that will affect polar bears” — he has continued to stand out among Democrats on the Hill as someone who thinks policy-makers should be talking about climate change more, not less.

Instead, he has relentlessly argued — 303 times on the Senate floor, in fact — that climate is in fact an economic issue that touches all facets of life for everyone, and that fossil fuel companies are the “villains” behind it.

“Democrats and environmental groups’ climate messaging for years has been crap, and so if you go back to that crap messaging, obviously it’s not going to succeed,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean that the alternative is to throw in the towel.”

‘Cheap is clean’

Whitehouse’s fellow congressional climate hawks have mostly embraced the pivot toward talking about energy affordability rather than traditional climate priorities like decarbonization and clean air and water legislation.

Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), who last year removed “climate hawk” from his bio on X, has spoken explicitly about the need to shift on messaging, arguing repeatedly on social media and in floor speeches that Democrats need to remain focused on costs and shortages if they want their message to resonate with Americans.

“Those of us in the climate community who are used to making a more broad argument about where we are in the sweep of history have to get comfortable making a more immediate argument that says the reason prices are going up is a deliberate policy choice of the Republican Party,” Schatz said last year at an event affiliated with New York Climate Week.

Schatz in a statement this week said that he and Whitehouse were united on their ideas around “climate action.” But he doubled down on the importance of affordability messaging.

“There are think tanks and advocacy organizations that are dedicated to the proposition that climate action is incompatible with affordable energy, but those factional rivalries have been overtaken by events,” Schatz said. “Cheap is clean, and clean is cheap.”

On the House side, recent actions from the Democrats’ Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition (SEEC) have also focused squarely on energy costs and the ability of clean energy to lower Americans’ bills.

At a SEEC press conference last week meant to respond to the last year of energy and environment policy under President Donald Trump, a roster of climate-focused Democrats spoke nearly exclusively about energy prices. “Trump lied; Energy costs are up,” read the main sign at the presser.

It was a striking difference in tone from several years ago when then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2019 elevated the “existential threat” of climate change immediately upon retaking the gavel.

That year, the Democrats’ renamed a panel about global warming the “Select Committee on the Climate Crisis,” as progressives pushed the party to highlight the issue with more urgency.

Is Whitehouse alone on an island?

Whitehouse said that the narrative from Democrats around energy bills is entirely compatible with his continued push to talk about fossil fuels; the two should go hand in hand, he said.

But in interviews with a half dozen Democratic lawmakers this week, the conversations revealed many in the party are not particularly worried about leaving some traditional climate change rhetoric behind for the time being in favor of talking nearly exclusively about clean energy prices — begging the question of whether Whitehouse is digging his heels in alone.

“My theory of the case is that the argument that I’ve been making for 30 years is finally breaking through,” said Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.), SEEC’s vice chair and a former clean energy professional.

“The urgency of climate change means that we have to focus on it especially when it’s not as salient with the American people, if we are to be the leaders we claim to be,” he added. “But I think that’s largely a separable conversation from what is the best way to talk about it in any given moment, that has the most ability to move public opinion.”

Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.), a Natural Resources Committee member, said in an interview that Democrats need to focus on energy prices because Trump has used that as a justification for executive actions that bolster oil and gas.

“People, when they see the ways in which the energy policies that are serving big oil are hurting their pocketbooks, it makes it more tangible for why folks should care, in addition to the welfare of the planet,” Stansbury said.

And Rep. Kathy Castor (D-Fla.), the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce’s Energy Subcommittee, downplayed the notion that congressional Democrats were at odds over how to message on climate. Talking about affordability need not negate the focus on the impact of climate change, she said.

“I think they are one in the same,” Castor said. “Take my community in Florida. We’re still recovering from Hurricane Helen and Milton and people understand that those storms were supercharged because the Gulf was very, very hot, very warm. And the rain was unlike anything we’ve ever seen. So they are trying to afford rebuilding their homes and paying their property insurance and also suffering higher rate increases.”

Whitehouse, for his part, said that he is in step with fellow Democrats focused on climate in raising concerns about new narratives.

“I think most of the what you might call ‘climate hawks’ in the Senate see this the same way: that we fell into a hole that we need to get out of and that there is a winning message,” he said.

That means requiring data centers to pay the full cost of service, powering growth with clean energy first, and protecting water resources and ratepayers from unnecessary risk.","Wisconsin stands at a pivotal moment.

Artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and hyperscale data centers are arriving quickly, bringing enormous demand for electricity and water. The real question is not whether these investments will come, but how we manage them and who pays the costs if we get it wrong.

Families want affordable bills. Businesses want reliable power. Communities want clean water and economic opportunity. We need a common-sense approach to guide how we respond to rapid data center growth.

An unprecedented load and a real affordability risk

The scale of proposed data centers is unlike anything Wisconsin has seen.

Just two projects, one in Port Washington and another in Mount Pleasant, have requested nearly four gigawatts of electricity combined. That is more power than all Wisconsin households use today.

Meeting this demand will require massive investments in power plants, transmission lines, substations, pipelines and water infrastructure. But under Wisconsin’s current utility model, these costs are not paid only by the companies driving demand. They are instead spread across all of us who pay electric bills, including families, farms, and small businesses that won’t benefit from data center power.

For small businesses operating on thin margins, even modest increases in electric or water rates affect hiring, pricing and long-term viability. In rural communities with fewer customers sharing infrastructure costs, the impact can be even more severe.

This concern is already becoming real. Utilities are citing data center demand to justify new methane gas plants and delaying coal plant retirements. Utilities doubling down on fossil fuels should give every one of us pause.

Why costly gas is the wrong answer

Building new methane gas plants for data centers would lock customers into decades of fuel price volatility, even though cleaner options have become cheaper and faster to deploy.

Wind, solar and battery storage can come online far more quickly than fossil fuel plants and without exposing families and businesses to unpredictable fuel costs. Battery storage costs alone have fallen nearly 90% over the past decade.

Across the country, these tools are replacing methane gas plants in states as different as Texas and California.

There is also a serious risk that we will pay higher bills for decades, even when data centers stop using those methane gas plants. In Nevada, a major utility has acknowledged that only about 15% of proposed data centers are likely to be built. When speculative projects fall through, all of us are left to pay for infrastructure we actually never needed.

This is not ideology. It is basic financial risk management, and basic fairness.

Clean energy is the lowest-cost path

Wisconsin policymakers and elected officials need to put guardrails in place to protect everyday residents from the AI bubble that’s threatening the state. The core principle should be that data centers operate on 100% clean energy, not as a slogan, but because it is the lowest-cost and lowest-risk option over time.

A smart framework would require developers to:

Supply at least 30% of their power from on-site and Wisconsin-based renewable energy

Offset additional demand through energy efficiency, demand response – at least 25% of peak capacity and smart grid flexibility

Participate fully in utility efficiency and renewable energy programs rather than opting out

Each data center project should require a legally binding Community Benefit Agreement that clearly defines community protections and benefits, negotiated among developers, local governments, neighborhood-based organizations and underserved communities

This approach reduces peak demand, lowers infrastructure costs and protects existing customers while allowing data centers to advance.

Major companies like Microsoft, Google and Meta have already publicly committed to operating on carbon-free energy. We need to hold them to that. Wisconsin risks losing our competitive advantage if we default to gas-heavy solutions instead of offering clean, flexible grids.

Water is a non-negotiable constraint

Energy is not the only concern. Water matters just as much.

A single hyperscale data center can use millions of gallons of water per day, either directly for cooling or indirectly through power generation. In communities with limited water systems, that can crowd out agricultural use and raise residents’ water bills.

Wisconsin should require closed-loop cooling systems, full accounting of direct and indirect water use, and ongoing public reporting to ensure local water supplies are protected.

A practical path forward

Wisconsin does not have to choose between economic growth and affordability. We can do both if we insist on clear guardrails.

That means requiring data centers to pay the full cost of service, powering growth with clean energy first, and protecting water resources and ratepayers from unnecessary risk.

Data centers are coming. The question is whether Wisconsin families and small businesses will be partners in that growth or be left paying higher bills for decades to come.

If we choose smart clean power over costly gas, Wisconsin can lead.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-99/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/nj-powerlines-1024x6841769166318.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=yx7lm5Fd,N,,2026-01-23 11:41:13.219635

These Southern towns get dirty air. - Verite News New Orleans,Tristan Baurick,,,,,https://veritenews.org/2026/01/23/drax-air-pollution-louisiana-mississippi/,"Gloster has other industrial facilities, but the EPA lists the Drax mill as the region’s only major emitter of toxic air pollutants.
“It’s also mutagenic and neurodegenerative, which is as awful as that sounds,” said Aisha Dickerson, an environmental health researcher at Johns Hopkins University.
Buried several pages into the company’s permit updates, Drax noted that both of its Louisiana mills had exceeded their “minor source” limits for hazardous air pollutants.
One is that air pollution is magnitudes higher in Gloster, especially with VOCs, she said.
Data from dozens of air pollution monitors installed around the town show clouds of pollutants concentrated around the mill and in neighboring residential areas.","This coverage is made possible through a partnership between Verite News and Grist, a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to reporting on climate change. This story is the first of a three-part series.

It almost felt like old times for the friends and family gathered at Robert Weatherspoon’s house. The living room couches and chairs were filled, a football game was on the TV, and the aroma of bacon and butter beans drifted in from the kitchen.

What was missing was Weatherspoon’s voice. While his friends usually bring the food or cook during get-togethers, Weatherspoon is counted on to supply the laughs. The 67-year-old with an expressive, cherubic face has a reputation for devastating one-liners, off-color game commentary, and stories — skewed somewhat for comedic effect — about people everybody knows in Gloster, a mill town in southern Mississippi too small to have strangers.

But shuffling from his bed to the living room had left him breathless. Weatherspoon took a puff from his inhaler, but his throat was locked and his chest was tight. He tried a joke on an old high school buddy across the room, and it fell flat, stalled between labored breaths.

His next utterance was darker, whispered to the person with the closest ear. “I thought I was dying last night,” Weatherspoon said. “For 20 minutes, I couldn’t get out of bed, couldn’t move.” An odd thought crossed his mind as he lay there, struggling for air. “I said, ‘Let me write something before I go. I want to tell about my life. I want to put it all down.’”

The story of Weatherspoon’s late middle age might have chronicled an energetic man who still liked to jog, grow okra and peppers in his garden, chase after women, and make his friends laugh. But in 2014, a massive mill that turns trees into peanut-size pellets opened in Gloster, and “everything changed for everybody,” he said.

Operated by the British energy giant Drax, the mill and two newer ones in Louisiana — near Urania in the center of the state and Bastrop near the Arkansas line — churn out billions of pellets each year to meet surging overseas demand for electricity produced by burning wood, what the company markets as “sustainable biomass.” Alongside the mills, in communities of mostly poor, Black residents, the air is tainted with cancer-causing gases and tiny particles that can burrow deep into people’s lungs and trigger a long list of health troubles.

It’s not clear whether Drax’s activity has caused any particular individual’s health problems, but the mills release chemicals at levels federal regulators and scientists say can be toxic to humans.

In living rooms around Gloster, on front porches, and between the crumbling facades and boarded windows along the town’s main street, it’s hard to find anyone who doesn’t believe their life was better before the mill, called Amite Bioenergy.

“When I go out, I can’t hardly catch my breath,” said Helen Reed, a Gloster native. “Everything is worse since Drax came here.”

Tucked into a remote corner of southwest Mississippi, Gloster is exposed to more particulate matter and releases of toxic air than most parts of the country, according to data from the Environmental Protection Agency. Rates of cancer, asthma, and heart disease are substantially higher than the national average. Gloster has other industrial facilities, but the EPA lists the Drax mill as the region’s only major emitter of toxic air pollutants.

Wood pellets have been touted by European countries as a greener, climate-friendly alternative to coal and gas. Made from sawdust and comparatively cheap trees grown in the American South, pellets now power a large share of the United Kingdom’s electrical grid. Drax has turned the U.K.’s largest coal power station, a mile-wide complex in rural Yorkshire, into what is essentially an immense wood stove fueled with Mississippi and Louisiana pine.

Raking in billions of dollars in both profits and government subsidies, Drax foresees substantial growth in the coming years — especially in the U.S., where it’s planning new mills and an ambitious push into the booming carbon capture and storage business.

In Gloster, the industry promised prosperity for the town’s 850 residents when Drax’s mill opened 11 years ago. Gloster, Urania, and Bastrop had once been booming mill towns, producing pulp, paper, and lumber for a global market. When those mills closed in the 2000s, the local economies collapsed. Drax was seen as a godsend — a rejuvenator of the jobs, money, and pride that come with a mill that roars with life. But many people say they’ve received little more than noise, dust, and toxic air: The three nearly identical Drax mills in Mississippi and Louisiana have been forced to pay millions of dollars for hundreds of pollution violations over the past five years.

In Urania, a central Louisiana town about two hours northwest of Gloster, the penalties are having little effect, said Glen Henderson, a longtime Urania resident who lives a mile from Drax’s LaSalle BioEnergy mill. “I was born and raised in the area, and I love it here,” he said. “But if I get a chance, I’m definitely going to move.”

Hassled by the mill’s lights and noise at night and sawdust coating his car in the morning, the peace and quiet Henderson hoped to enjoy in retirement disappeared when Drax opened the mill in late 2017.

“We’ve always been a mill town,” he said. “I worked in the old mill after high school. But the mills we had around here weren’t like this. This is something else.”

Michelli Martin, a Drax spokesperson, said the company is making strides to reduce pollution. “The safety of our people and the communities in which we operate is our priority, and we take our environmental responsibilities very seriously,” Martin said. “As a company dedicated to sustainable energy production, high standards of safety and environmental compliance are always our top priority.”

Drax’s mill has only hastened Gloster’s decline, said Carmella Wren-Causey at her home on the town’s edge, where subsidized apartments abut a dense monocrop of loblolly pines. “We’re being poisoned slowly, right before our eyes,” she said. Tears ran down her cheeks and slid under the plastic tubes funneling oxygen to her nose. Diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Wren-Causey’s breathing has become so difficult that she can barely keep up with her grandson, a toddler who was scooting his bike near her oxygen tank.

“God gave me breath when he gave me life,” said Wren-Causey, who blames the mill for her declining health. “Nobody should tamper with that. But Drax took it away.”

Breaking rules again and again

When Patrick Anderson, an environmental attorney, first tried to convince Mississippi’s environmental regulators that Drax was violating the state’s pollution laws, he boiled things down to a simple equation: 1 = 1.

Because testing showed one large pellet mill in Florida had been emitting about 1,000 tons of volatile organic compounds, known as VOCs, every year, it stood to reason that the virtually identical mill in Gloster was emitting roughly the same amount, he told the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality in 2017.

But Drax was claiming its Gloster mill was keeping its emissions lower than 250 tons per year, the threshold that distinguishes “minor” from “major” sources of VOCs, a classification of pollutants that are harmful to breathe, especially for children, elderly people, and those who suffer from asthma and other lung conditions.

The minor-source designation allowed Drax to avoid more stringent regulations and higher costs associated with installing and maintaining pollution-control technologies. “One of the most troubling trends in the wood pellet industry is that facilities that should face the most rigorous air permitting standards are actually the least controlled and the dirtiest,” Anderson wrote in a 2018 report for the Environmental Integrity Project.

A year after the report, Anderson was proved right. In 2019, Drax disclosed to Mississippi regulators that the Gloster facility had been emitting an average of 796 tons of VOCs per year — more than three times the limit allowed under its permit, according to documents obtained through public records requests.

The revelation resulted in a $2.5 million fine from the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality in 2020 and elicited surprise and anger from Gloster’s residents, many of whom said they were unaware the mill posed risks to their health.

“When I first started having trouble breathing, I thought God was punishing me — but it wasn’t God doing that,” said Weatherspoon, who believes the mill’s emissions and his declining health are linked.

In a letter to Mississippi’s regulators a few years later, Drax attributed its underestimated emissions for the Gloster mill to a lack of experience with pellet production. “The pellet production industry is a relatively young industry,” the letter said. “Several wood pellet facilities, not only Amite BioEnergy LLC, initially underestimated emissions in connection with the permitting of these facilities.”

In neighboring Louisiana, state regulators also found that Drax had been breaking air quality rules. Drax’s mill near Bastrop, for instance, was supposed to cap its VOC emissions at 250 tons but had actually been releasing about 1,100 tons per year, according to a company filing with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality. In 2022, the state agency reached a legal settlement in which Drax paid $3.2 million but admitted no wrongdoing.

That settlement was the largest in more than a decade for Louisiana’s environmental regulators. But to Anderson, who now works for the Southern Environmental Law Center, it was also the extent of any serious efforts to rein in Drax’s pollution in Louisiana.

When Mississippi determined in early 2023 that the Gloster mill had also far exceeded the allowable limits of what regulators call “hazardous air pollutants,” Anderson asked Louisiana’s regulators if the mills in Urania and Bastrop were doing the same.

It was a question they couldn’t answer. A Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality spokesperson said the agency doesn’t require Drax to conduct routine testing for hazardous air pollutants, which include nearly 190 chemicals known or suspected to cause cancer, birth defects, and other serious problems, or a similar group of chemicals the agency refers to as “toxic air pollutants.” The state’s regulators also don’t conduct their own testing at Drax’s mills.

In Mississippi, the hazardous pollutants Drax released into the air above Gloster included methanol, acrolein, and tons of formaldehyde, a chemical that’s far worse than being merely carcinogenic. “It’s also mutagenic and neurodegenerative, which is as awful as that sounds,” said Aisha Dickerson, an environmental health researcher at Johns Hopkins University. Formaldehyde has the potential to both mutate human cells and trigger brain disorders, affecting memory, learning ability, and behavior.

Anderson said it’s mind-boggling that Louisiana won’t test for chemicals it knows can cause cancer and a host of other illnesses. In his yearslong campaign to get the state to change its ways, he attempted the 1 = 1 tactic, demonstrating that the Gloster mill is comparable to the Bastrop mill in Louisiana and likely has similar pollution levels.

Drax itself has called the Gloster and Bastrop mills “nearly identical.” In letters to Mississippi’s regulators, the company attempted to avoid additional emissions testing by arguing that the Bastrop mill in Louisiana was so similar to the one in Mississippi that testing from one should apply to the other. “The (Bastrop) facility was built at the same time and is very similar to Amite, such that it has the exact same process design, equipment, production, rates, and the fiber is procured from a similar wood basket,” the company wrote.

In 2024, Drax admitted to what Anderson had been saying for years. Buried several pages into the company’s permit updates, Drax noted that both of its Louisiana mills had exceeded their “minor source” limits for hazardous air pollutants. Drax didn’t say specifically how much it had been violating the 25-ton limit for these contaminants, but the company noted a “proposed emission rate” of nearly 40 tons, according to permitting documents.

Despite Drax’s admission, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality has yet to issue fines, and a spokesman declined to say what steps, if any, the agency has taken to get Drax to comply with its emissions rules. The spokesman also did not answer several questions about its enforcement actions and air quality monitoring practices.

Allegations about Drax have also come from within. In 2020, Louisiana regulators received an anonymous complaint from someone with intimate knowledge of Drax’s two mills in the state. It contained a host of allegations about chemical releases, manipulated data, ignored safety testing, and poor wastewater management. The most serious accusation was that “each facility has literally hundreds of hours of uncontrolled venting” of harmful chemicals annually, including episodes that “would easily” exceed limits on acrolein, a chemical that can irritate eyes and lungs and, according to scientists, is “probably carcinogenic.”

“Any mention of these items will cause senior management to threaten termination,” the complaint said. It also alleged that the two mills “manipulate” data “to avoid defined permit deviations.”

When the state’s inspectors followed up, they found no evidence of emissions violations in data and equipment records provided by Drax. The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality’s inspection report did not address the alleged threats of firings or manipulated data. Inspectors partially substantiated the allegations about improper waste disposal: During an inspection of the Urania mill, they found that Drax was burning waste sludge without a permit.

Drax denied the allegations, noting that the waste-disposal issue was “not a normal condition” and that the company continually works with regulators to address environmental concerns.

The ultrafine dust expelled by Drax’s mills is another major health concern, Dickerson said. The particles released during a mill’s operations are so tiny that they can slip past the lung’s defenses and penetrate the bloodstream.

“Eventually, these particles can be transported to the brain and other organs,” Dickerson said, listing cognitive impairment and stroke among the problems that can develop. “You may not see symptoms immediately, but constant exposure could mean issues down the line.”

Drax has made several upgrades and changes to reduce emissions, particularly VOCs. In 2021, the company installed a thermal oxidizer at the Gloster mill that breaks down these compounds.

“We care deeply about the safety of our people and the residents of the communities in which we operate, and we take our environmental responsibilities and compliance extremely seriously,” said Matt White, vice president of Drax’s North American operations. “Compliance is at the foundation of everything we do, and we have invested a lot of hours and resources with the goal of continuously improving our operations.”

Despite the upgrades, Drax continues to incur fines for pollution violations. In late 2024, Drax agreed to pay $225,000 for exceeding the Gloster mill’s limits for hazardous air pollutants, particularly methanol. The state also cited Drax for failing to conduct required emissions tests and maintain pollution controls and proper records.

The company’s financial penalties, which add up to about $6 million, are dwarfed by its profits, which have topped $1 billion in recent years. “Drax is so profitable and so subsidized that it powers through all of this,” Anderson said. “The fines don’t hurt their bottom line.”

In April 2025, amid complaints from residents, the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality, or MDEQ, denied Drax permission to increase its emissions. Six months later, it reversed that decision, allowing the Gloster mill to become a “major source” of hazardous air pollutants. The October 15 permit ruling essentially gives Drax permission to release pollutants at the levels that got it in trouble when it was classified as a minor emitter.

A group of Gloster residents immediately filed a federal lawsuit against Drax, alleging that the company unlawfully exposed people to “massive amounts of toxic pollutants.”

Drax has “consistently failed to meet their legal obligations not to dump pollutants … and have continued to denude U.S. forests, all for the benefit of a British company,” the lawsuit alleges.

In a motion to dismiss the case, Drax’s lawyers argued that the lawsuit fails to show “particularized injury that is traceable to (the Gloster mill’s) conduct.”

A representative from the MDEQ declined to comment on the permit decision and lawsuit but said that “MDEQ takes seriously its obligations to protect human health and the environment.”

A Drax spokesperson said the company was “pleased that (MDEQ) has listened to the clear recommendations of its own technical staff and the voices of Gloster community leaders, local businesses, and a large number of our neighbors in Gloster,” adding that the “permit will allow our plant to continue to operate, enabling us to continue providing much needed well-paying jobs in this rural corner of Mississippi, and support hundreds more across the state’s forestry and lumber industries.”

The spokesperson said that “MDEQ’s conditions, inspection regime, and our commitment to continue to invest in compliance and improving operational standards will ensure that Drax at Amite operates as safely and efficiently as possible.”

The pellet town ‘algorithm’?

Pellet manufacturers seem to have a particular set of criteria that guides them to places like Gloster, Urania, and Bastrop, said Erika Walker, an epidemiologist at Brown University who has been researching the effects of noise and pollution in communities that host pellet mills.

“It’s like there’s an algorithm that tells you where vulnerable communities are, and where people are not going to ask questions,” she said. “If you need to piss on the side of the road, where do you go? A dark area where nobody’s looking.”

Pellet mills in the South are 50 percent more likely to be located in communities with a high proportion of poor and nonwhite residents, according to a 2018 study by researchers from Tufts University and the Dogwood Alliance, a forest conservation group based in North Carolina. Of the 32 mills assessed in nine Southern states, including Mississippi and Louisiana, 18 were in counties or parishes with poverty rates above the state median. Louisiana and Mississippi are tied for the highest levels of poverty in the United States at 14 percent, according to federal data. The national rate is just under 9 percent.

Across the Deep South, state and local leaders are so desperate for economic activity that they don’t ask critical questions about what the facilities may mean for the environment or people’s health, said Dickerson of Johns Hopkins. “These communities all seem to have low-income, historically marginalized residents who might not have the time or resources to fight a permit allowing a pellet mill to come in,” she said.

In Gloster and Bastrop, Black residents make up nearly 80 percent of the population, and more than 30 percet live under the poverty line, making less than $15,650 a year. Urania’s 700 residents are mostly white but look worse off economically. According to census data, the town had a poverty rate of 40 percent and a median household income of $12,400 — about a fifth of the national average.

Martin, the Drax spokesperson, denied that Drax is drawn to areas with few white people and high poverty. “The inference that Drax uses an ‘algorithm’ to take advantage of communities is untrue,” she said. “Drax uses a number of criteria to identify and select pellet mill locations, including proximity to low-grade roundwood and sawmill residuals, transport links, and access to local supply chain.”

Walker said that Drax could alleviate many concerns about pollution if the company built its mills far from where people live. The best place to put a mill is “in the middle of the woods,” she said. The Drax mill near Bastrop may approach this ideal. Located 10 miles north of the town, the mill is surrounded by forested tracts interspersed with logging roads.

“Honest to pea, I didn’t even know it was there,” said Linda Coker, who lives nearly 2 miles from the mill and is one of its nearest neighbors.

In Urania, Drax’s LaSalle BioEnergy sits just outside the town’s limits, but a school, medical center, two churches, and several homes sit within a mile of it.

The facility’s location in Gloster is particularly troubling, Walker said. It abuts a mobile home park and other houses and is about a mile from a children’s day care center. “Literally, my first question when I visited Gloster was, ‘Who zoned this?’” she said. “It’s right out in the open. No acoustical barriers, no buffer of trees. It was shocking to see it operating right in the middle of the community.”

Noise, dust and questions

When the town of Urania was carved out of pine forests more than a century ago, its founder, a timber baron with a visionary streak, promised two often-incompatible things: industry and tranquility.

In the late 1890s, Henry Hardtner knew “the living was really rough” around his expanding lumber mill, so he platted Urania far enough away from his business that his workers could enjoy “a welcome relief” from the noise, dust, and smoke, a local newspaper recounted in 1968. The town, nestled among towering, sweet-scented longleaf pines, was named after the Greek goddess of the stars because, in Hardtner’s view, the site was downright “heavenly.”

Henderson, the Urania resident who lives a mile from the Drax mill, wishes Hardtner could see Urania now. He’d have Hardtner sit with him on his porch at 2 a.m. to listen to the near-constant clanging and banging from the LaSalle BioEnergy mill and see its lights glowing over the tops of an ever-thinning band of trees nearly a mile away. At daybreak, Henderson would show off the powdery substance coating his truck.

“This noise and dust — what are the long-term effects of all that?” he asked. “Nobody seems to know, or they don’t want to know.”

There has been little scientific research into the environmental and health impacts of the relatively new wood pellet industry, but that’s starting to change. In 2024, Walker received a $5.8 million federal grant to conduct the first study of emissions from wood pellet mills on human health in the U.S. Awarded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the grant is funding a research team that’s in the early phases of a five-year study focusing on the noise, particulate matter, VOCs, and other emissions from Drax’s Gloster mill.

The first study by Walker’s team, which includes researchers from the University of Mississippi and Drexel University, found that the noise levels in the small towns with pellet mills approach those of big cities. “The noise pollution in Gloster rivals my neighborhood, which is by an interstate in a big, industrial city,” said Walker, who lives just outside Providence, Rhode Island.

Noise from the Gloster mill’s operations and a steady stream of truck traffic to and from the facility sometimes topped 70 decibels and rarely fell below 41 decibels. The rural Mississippi town of Mendenhall, which is similar in size to Gloster but lacks a pellet mill, was typically 10 decibels quieter. “That’s an enormous difference,” Walker said. “It’s like turning a faucet into Niagara Falls.”

In Urania, Henderson said the mill seems loudest at night and in the early morning, producing a discordant clattering when he’s trying to sleep. It’s especially bad on windy nights.

“Get a north wind, and it’s rockin’ and rollin’,” he said. “It sounds like logs tumbling in a dryer.”

The impacts of noise pollution on human health are often overlooked or ignored, but a growing body of research has linked chronic exposure to high blood pressure, heart attacks, anxiety, and depression.

“Noise disrupts your sleep, disrupts your mood, and sets off a stress response that’s like your ‘fight or flight’ response, which makes your body ready to fight a threat or run from it,” Walker said. “The constant stimulation of that response can cause all kinds of health problems.”

Drax says it follows all federal guidelines on noise abatement and conducts annual surveys of its mills’ sound levels, which it characterizes as no worse than other industrial facilities.

“We also go above and beyond to insulate our buildings to mitigate any noise that would come from the hammermill and help prevent it from being audible beyond the fence line,” Martin said. “The noise from facility operation is consistent with the surrounding industrial plants and does not contribute to significant impacts above existing background noise.”

Walker’s research is ongoing, but a few preliminary findings have emerged. One is that air pollution is magnitudes higher in Gloster, especially with VOCs, she said. Data from dozens of air pollution monitors installed around the town show clouds of pollutants concentrated around the mill and in neighboring residential areas. It also showed unexpected spikes during the night. That matches the experiences of some in Gloster who said they notice foul odors and find it more difficult to breathe after dark. “At night, it’s always worse,” Weatherspoon said. “It smells disgusting.”

This could indicate pollution “dumping” during certain hours when people are less aware of the pollution, Walker said.

Drax denied that the mill releases more pollution at night. “Any suggestion that we manipulate our operations to avoid complaints or detection is completely false,” Martin said.

Another surprising trend was found in Gloster’s children. The closer a child lived to the mill, the heavier their body weight, the researchers found. “That was shocking,” said Walker, who has visited Gloster and communicates regularly with residents. “It fits with some of the things we heard at community meetings. People are steeped in the idea that you don’t want your kids playing outside because the air’s polluted. If they’re staying inside, how are they getting physical activity?”

The widening base of research is leading some residents to think that the pervasive health problems in Gloster may be tied to the air they breathe, said Wren-Causey, who is a plaintiff in the lawsuit against Drax. “It’s not just people’s lifestyles or the work they do,” she said. “It’s about what Drax is putting into the air. Now people are making a ruckus. People are starting to open their eyes.”

Sitting in his living room while his friends watched football, Weatherspoon said witnessing the dual decline of his body and his town has sparked an anger that his doctor warned could further harm his health.

“The doctor tells me, ‘Don’t get pissed off or you’re gonna die,’” he said. A friend nodded in agreement, telling Weatherspoon he really should take it easy. Weatherpoon shook his head. “When I think about what’s happened to me and what’s happening here, I get pissed off in a heartbeat,” he said.

Late in the football game, an out-of-town guest got up to leave. Weatherspoon tossed him a little gallows humor on the way out.

“Don’t come back here if you want to keep living,” he said. “It’s no joke.”

Elliott, www.nytimes.com, ivan-penn, rebecca-f-elliott",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/business/energy-environment/storm-power-outage.html,"Grid managers have instructed the country’s largest electricity providers to postpone routine maintenance on power plants and lines to ensure that those resources are available during and after the storm.
Ahead of the storm, power companies said they had activated line crews to help restore power when equipment was damaged.
The coming storm will arrive about five years after a massive winter storm caused extensive blackouts across much of Texas.
All kinds of power sources failed during that storm, but the state’s natural gas power plants and pipelines played a central role.
Much like household pipes, natural gas pipelines and other equipment that is not properly insulated can freeze, interrupting the supply of fuel to power plants.","As arctic cold and snow squalls threaten much of the United States this weekend, managers of electric grids from the Midwest to the East Coast have issued warnings that many homes and businesses could lose power.

Grid managers have instructed the country’s largest electricity providers to postpone routine maintenance on power plants and lines to ensure that those resources are available during and after the storm. Heavy snow and freezing rain weigh down tree branches and power lines, causing failures that can cripple energy systems.

Frigid cold also drives up electricity demand as heating appliances require more energy and run longer. Extreme winter weather has expanded utility peak demand in the United States beyond summer to include winter. As a result, utilities have less time to maintain and upgrade equipment, making the grid less reliable and raising energy costs for consumers.

“When you get one day of cold weather, it’s not as significant. But we’re talking about three or four days here of very low temperatures,” said Douglas Giuffre, who leads U.S. power and renewables research for S&P Global Energy.

The utility industry has been preparing for extreme weather by, among other things, upgrading equipment and trimming trees around power lines. Ahead of the storm, power companies said they had activated line crews to help restore power when equipment was damaged.

Exelon, a utility with customers from Illinois to New Jersey, said it was prepared. “Exelon is currently investing $38 billion to modernize and harden our transmission and distribution systems to make the grid more resilient, flexible and better able to withstand increasingly severe storms,” said Mike Innocenzo, executive vice president and chief operating officer at Exelon.

The energy secretary, Chris Wright, said on Thursday that the federal government had ordered that unused backup generators at data centers and “other major facilities” be made available to grids to help prevent blackouts.

The coming storm will arrive about five years after a massive winter storm caused extensive blackouts across much of Texas.

The state’s electric grid, which is largely isolated from grids in the rest of the country, was ill prepared for that storm, according to a report published by the University of Texas at Austin. Grid managers did not anticipate the severity of the storm and underestimated how much demand for electricity would rise when the weather turned bad.

All kinds of power sources failed during that storm, but the state’s natural gas power plants and pipelines played a central role. A lot of pipelines and power plant equipment froze or malfunctioned, forcing generators offline and leaving many residents shivering in their homes for days. The state has estimated that more than 200 people died because of that storm.

“We’re better prepared in some respects, but we still could be better prepared in others,” said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin.

Dr. Rhodes remains concerned about the system for transporting natural gas from production sites in West Texas and elsewhere to the power plants that burn the gas to generate electricity. Much like household pipes, natural gas pipelines and other equipment that is not properly insulated can freeze, interrupting the supply of fuel to power plants.

Up to two-thirds of natural gas processing plants in the Permian Basin, which lies in Texas and New Mexico, experienced an outage during the winter storm five years ago, the University of Texas report found.

“When it happens to the big guys, that’s when there’s a noticeable loss of gas going to the power plants and people’s houses,” said Suzie Boyd, whose company, Caballo Loco Midstream, operates networks of small natural gas pipelines in West Texas and New Mexico.

Caballo Loco was injecting antifreeze into its systems, wrapping equipment with tarps and preparing to heat pipes if needed to keep them warm through the freezing rain forecast for its area beginning on Friday. Ms. Boyd’s son even planned to sleep on a cot in a field office, she said. “We’re bracing ourselves.”

The potent winter storm that has meteorologists and residents on edge is expected to begin on Friday in the Rocky Mountains and make its way across the country through the weekend, bringing wintry precipitation to more than 160 million people from the Southwest into New England.

Officials in Texas and neighboring states were especially concerned by a forecast for a dangerous combination of freezing rain, sleet and snow that could coat trees, power lines and roads.

Even if electric grids can withstand the bad weather, consumers are likely to feel the impact for weeks to come.

Natural gas prices have already begun to rise. Production often falls during storms like this, sometimes considerably.

“It’s not necessarily the temperature itself, it’s the rate of change of temperature that’s important, and then being able to respond to that,” said Sarah Fenton, an executive vice president at Pittsburgh-based EQT, one of the country’s largest natural gas producers.

The dangerous conditions are likely to take a bigger toll on lower-income Americans, many of whom live in poorly insulated homes and have struggled with rising energy costs. Losing power during a storm could make them even more vulnerable.

“A major storm isn’t just a reliability event — it’s an affordability shock,” said Mark Wolfe, an economist and executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, an organization of state officials who administer the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. “Vulnerable families are more likely to face outages, lost wages, spoiled food and higher bills in the weeks that follow, making shut-off protections and bill-payment relief critical to recovery.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/23/multimedia/23biz-storm-power-jpfk/23biz-storm-power-jpfk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 05:39:55.082695

Duke Energy applied to build a 1,400 megawatt natural gas plant in Anderson County last summer.","Utilities are using a new South Carolina energy law to justify a request environmental advocates argue will tamp opposition to a proposed massive natural gas plant in Colleton County.

The Sierra Club, a national environmental nonprofit, wants to participate in a Public Service Commission case determining whether a proposed large natural gas plant in Colleton County properly protects the environment and ratepayers. Two local nonprofits, the South Carolina Coastal Conservation League and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, jointly applied to intervene in the same case.

Utilities Dominion Energy and state-owned Santee Cooper argued the environmental groups had similar missions and concerns about the proposed plant. They asked the Public Service Commission to require the groups to consolidate their questions and concerns about the natural gas plant at the beginning of the month, according to docket filings.

Consolidating the groups’ concerns will avoid delays during the permitting process of the plant, the utilities argued in a filing with the Public Service Commission. Plus, a state law signed in 2025 aimed at boosting generation amid skyrocketing demand for power justified the request, Dominion and Santee Cooper argued.

The law changed how rates are set and how energy projects are permitted, in addition to allowing Santee Cooper and Dominion to work together on the roughly 2,200 megawatt Colleton County gas plant. The utilities will split the generated energy and $5 billion cost. Dominion and Santee Cooper asked to build the plant in mid-December, so a decision will be made by the Public Service Commission by mid-June, under the energy law’s six-month deadline

The timeline for intervenors to present their case and the push to consolidate parties “stacks the deck” against them, said Sari Amiel, a Sierra Club attorney assigned to the case.

“It’s making it very hard for us to make arguments that represent the public interest and consumer interests,” Amiel said.

The energy law was intended to cut “red tape” for energy projects to gain approval, said state Rep. Gil Gatch, R-Dorchester. Gatch was a proponent of the bill last year. He said conservation groups sometimes slow down permitting of energy projects or rate cases, costing utilities for delays. The energy law did not prevent conservation groups or other intervenors from fully participating in a permitting case, he said.

“Conservationists, and God love them, but they always, in a litigious way, will hold up siting and all kinds of energy related litigation that goes on before the Public Service Commission,” Gatch said.

“So what it does is it not only makes it more expensive because all those costs get pushed on to the ratepayer, but it also creates a huge lag, which creates more costs,” he continued.

New energy generation, including natural gas, is badly needed in South Carolina as coal plants retire and population grows, Gatch said.

“The Canadys plant, and other plants like it, are important to get up and running to meet the needs and the crisis that’s down the road,” he said.

Allowing the public, including environmental nonprofits, to voice their concerns is important because the Canadys plant will impact ratepayers and the environment, said Taylor Allred, a state energy and climate director at Coastal Conservation League, one of the intervenors.

“This is a very big project, a very consequential project, and it’s going to be a testing ground for kind of how this new framework plays out,” Allred said.

The debate over if the Colleton County natural gas plant is aligned with environmental and consumer interests coincides with a proposal for another gas plant in the Upstate, straining resources further for intervenors, Allred said. Duke Energy applied to build a 1,400 megawatt natural gas plant in Anderson County last summer.

Can utilities combine conservationists?

Dominion and Santee Cooper want two separate parties representing environmental interests to compare their concerns and questions for the Canadys natural gas plant and consolidate any similar issues.

Both Sierra Club and the Coastal Conservation League oppose such a measure, arguing it would compromise their integrity to divulge information to one another.

“This notion is absurd, and it’s simply an attempt to take away time and resources from environmental interveners seeking to represent environmental interests in an environmental proceeding,” Allred said.

“We would have to basically run anything in our case past the other party’s clients as well,” Amiel said. “So it would be limiting our ability to litigate our respective cases.”

Both utilities argued they have a right to request intervenors to consolidate. Santee Cooper spokesperson Mollie Gore wrote in an email the law allows for “robust participation” from other parties.

“The long-held ability to consolidate representation for parties with similar interests provides Commissioners the opportunity to efficiently consider the evidence in reaching a deliberate and thoughtful decision,” Gore wrote in an email.

Where that ability comes from has also been up for debate. When Dominion and Santee Cooper asked for environmental nonprofits to consolidate, they cited the General Assembly’s 2025 energy law.

But the ability for the Public Service Commission to consolidate intervenors at the request of utilities has been in South Carolina’s siting law for decades, which lawyers for the environmental groups pointed out in their response.

The utilities say the energy law’s intention and readoption of the siting code reaffirmed their right to request consolidation.

“Consolidation of parties with substantially similar interests, such as CCL/SACE and Sierra Club, advances that legislative purpose by reducing duplicative discovery, motions practice, and cross-examination, thereby ensuring a prompt and efficient conclusion of this proceeding,” a filing from Dominion and Santee Cooper reads.",https://www.thestate.com/public/latest-news/qbig43/picture285996061/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/IMG_7289.JPG,N,,2026-01-23 05:40:07.009535

In 2025, coal-fired electricity generation increased more than 13% across the nation, easing natural gas demand and electricity costs for tens of millions of Americans.","As America moves into 2026, consumers are looking for relief from an ongoing “affordability crisis.” While prices for some key items have mercifully held steady, or even come down, other costs such as rent, dining out, and hospital visits continue to climb unabated.

U.S. electricity, the one sector that affects all consumer industries in some way, is also racing upward. America’s electricity costs have jumped 32% in just the past five years. That’s a major problem for our new digital economy.

Why are electricity prices rising so rapidly? Soaring power demand, particularly from data centers, is colliding with an electric grid already stretched to the limit. Add to that natural gas price volatility and we can see why America’s families are getting squeezed in an “affordability” crunch.

Exacerbating matters is the legacy of the Biden administration’s regulatory assault on America’s coal and natural gas power plants. The Biden team was singularly focused on reducing carbon emissions. But that agenda led to the elimination of U.S. power plants that are now needed more than ever.

Peak U.S. power demand is expected to jump 166 gigawatts in just the next five years, thanks to the vast needs of artificial intelligence and the data center boom. That’s 15 times the peak electricity needs of New York City.

This is unsustainable without more “dispatchable power,” the reliable, on-demand electricity generation provided by many of the very power plants the Biden administration sought to eliminate.

In parts of the U.S., electricity supplies are now stretched so thin that grid operators and regulators are scrambling to avoid power shortfalls. The nation’s top grid reliability regulator recently called the situation a “five-alarm fire.”

To its credit, the Trump administration is working feverishly to stop the bleeding. Instead of cutting power plants from the grid, the administration is working to rapidly expand the supply of on-demand power in the United States. As a first step, that means retaining the nation’s coal-generating capacity. Doing so could bolster grid reliability and ease some of the current price inflation.

We know this works because America’s coal fleet is already being tapped as a buffer against rapidly rising natural gas prices. Because natural gas is the leading fuel for both electricity generation and home heating, even a small change in prices can have a large impact on consumers. Consider that, in 2025 alone, heavy domestic demand and surging exports drove up U.S. natural gas prices by an astounding 70%.

Fortunately for consumers, low-cost coal generation is still an option amidst rising natural gas prices. In 2025, coal-fired electricity generation increased more than 13% across the nation, easing natural gas demand and electricity costs for tens of millions of Americans.

Keeping America’s coal plants online is an overlooked but critically important step in recovering from the Biden administration’s failed energy subtraction.

The path to lower electricity prices is through abundant, reliable energy. Using policy tools to grow America’s supply of electricity—not tear it down—will be essential to keeping the lights on this winter and taking the bite out of electricity price inflation.",https://thedailyrecord.com/files/2026/01/MBK_Column.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 05:39:58.687914

Rio Tinto and Glencore are back in merger talks that could create a US$260bn mining powerhouse, reshaping global supply of key metals like copper and iron

The global mining industry could be on the brink of major transformation as two of the sector's heavyweights, Rio Tinto and Glencore, have resumed merger negotiations.

Glencore's interest in acquiring Rio Tinto dates back as early as the 2008 financial crash, while the most concrete discussions about a merger took place in 2014, though Rio Tinto rejected Glencore's approaches.

Talks were again abandoned in March 2025, though both companies confirmed last week they are in ""preliminary discussions"" regarding a ""possible combination of some or all of their businesses, which could include an all-share merger"".

Today, with talks back on, it is thought that a deal would create an entity valued at over US$260bn, positioning it among the most influential resource companies in the entire world.

The role the global energy market is playing in these renewed negotiations is profound, with shifting attitudes and outlooks on coal contributing to the amenability of the organisations to a deal.

2. Trump at the WEF: What Did He Say About Energy at Davos?

US President Donald Trump's speech at Davos focused on the future of the US energy landscape, while also criticising the EU and China over energy

When US President Donald Trump addressed the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos this week, his remarks on energy policy sparked immediate controversy among the global elite gathered in the Swiss Alps.

The President's forceful critique of renewable energy initiatives, as well as his departure from the climate consensus that has dominated recent forums, marked a significant shift in transatlantic energy discourse.

When addressing the WEF on 21 January, President Trump wasted no time in outlining his administration's approach to American energy infrastructure.

His announcement that the US would be opening fossil fuel energy plants rather than closing them down represents a challenge to the decarbonisation strategies pursued by many of the world's nations.

Trump framed this move as a matter of economic pragmatism, positioning traditional energy sources as essential to American competitiveness and affordability going forward.

The administration's plans extend beyond merely maintaining existing infrastructure.

The President revealed that his government would be actively removing wind turbines rather than constructing new ones, describing what he termed the ""Green New Scam"" as a misguided consensus that has led countries astray.

This characterisation of renewable energy policy as fundamentally flawed economic thinking set the tone for his broader critique of European energy strategies and aligns with much of his recent criticism of the bloc as a whole.

3. UK Warm Homes Plan: What Homeowners & Businesses Can Expect

The UK Government's Warm Homes Plan targets fuel poverty with solar panels, heat pumps and batteries, backed by Octopus Energy, Centrica and E.ON

The UK has just launched the largest home upgrade programme in the country’s history committing £15bn (US$20bn) in public investment to retrofit up to five million homes with solar panels, heat pumps and battery storage by 2030.

The Warm Homes Plan, which was announced by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Energy Secretary Ed Miliband on 20 January, aims to lift one million families out of fuel poverty while accelerating the electrification of domestic heating.

The initiative comes at a moment when the UK is grappling with the legacy of volatile gas prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which cost the UK £183bn (US$246bn) according to climate think tank E3G.

The plan is has three main strands:

Direct support for low-income households

Universal access to government-backed loans

New regulations for rental properties

Low-income families stand to receive fully-funded installations worth up to £12,000 (US$16,096), covering solar panels, batteries and heat pumps depending on suitability.

The government plans to focus on neighbourhoods too, rather than individual properties. As such, social housing residents could see entire streets upgraded simultaneously.

4. Shell: What the World's Energy System Will Look Like in 2100

In its 2026 Energy Security Scenarios report, Shell maps out three different routes the energy transition could take in the years leading up to 2100

This month, Shell published the third edition of its Energy Security Scenarios report, a series in which it uses predictive modelling to forecast the future of the world's energy landscape.

In the document, which follows on from instalments in 2023 and 2025, the British energy giant includes three separate scenarios, which it calls 'Archipelagos', 'Surge' and 'Horizon'. Each of these models include different projections of how the planet's energy system will look by the year 2100.

The scenarios try to make sense of the moment the energy world finds itself in, where 80% of global power comes from fossil fuels but where the capacity of renewable sources has grown tenfold in the past decade.

It is not just the flux of the energy system itself that Shell factors into its analysis either. Each of the firm's different timelines synthesise all manner of externalities, including trade wars, AI and climate politics to paint three distinct pictures of the world at the turn of the next century.

Dr Mallika Ishwaran, who is Shell’s Chief Economist and a key member of the Shell Scenarios team, recently appeared on The Energy Podcast, which is produced by Shell, to speak about the company's methodology when creating the scenario reports.

“Scenarios are genuinely a multidisciplinary effort,"" she explains. ""The process of developing the scenarios draws on, firstly, the knowledge and expertise in energy markets and energy modelling.

“And finally it brings in the geopolitical lens that is so essential when thinking about energy. It is a combination of these different perspectives that provides a richness to our scenarios.”

Limited (CATL) introduced its new Tianxing II battery series for light commercial vehicles on January 22, 2026.
The standout of the lineup is the low-temperature sodium-ion version, marking the first mass-produced sodium-ion battery in the industry.
Designed specifically for small vans, microvans, and light trucks, this battery targets commercial vehicles operating in demanding environments.
Over time, this is expected to significantly reduce battery costs and improve the economic viability of light commercial electric vehicles.
With the Tianxing II series, CATL is clearly pushing the boundaries of battery technology—especially with sodium-ion chemistry—while addressing real-world challenges faced by commercial electric vehicles.","Chinese battery manufacturing giant Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL) introduced its new Tianxing II battery series for light commercial vehicles on January 22, 2026. The standout of the lineup is the low-temperature sodium-ion version, marking the first mass-produced sodium-ion battery in the industry.

The sodium-ion battery pack offers a capacity of 45 kWh, an energy density of 175 Wh/kg, and an impressive cycle life exceeding 10,000 cycles. It is also the first battery globally to be certified under China’s new GB 38031-2025 national safety standard. Designed specifically for small vans, microvans, and light trucks, this battery targets commercial vehicles operating in demanding environments.

One of its biggest advantages over traditional lithium-ion batteries is exceptional cold-weather performance. Even in extreme conditions as low as -40°C, the battery retains 90% of its usable capacity. It can also be charged immediately when completely frozen at -30°C, effectively eliminating the winter-related operational issues that plague electric commercial vehicles in colder regions.

Beyond performance, sodium-ion technology brings major cost benefits. Sodium is more than 1,000 times more abundant than lithium in the Earth’s crust, and its extraction costs are roughly one-twentieth that of lithium. Over time, this is expected to significantly reduce battery costs and improve the economic viability of light commercial electric vehicles.

In addition to the sodium-ion model, the Tianxing II series includes three lithium-ion variants, each tailored to specific commercial use cases:

– Fast-Charging Version: Equipped with high-rate charging technology, this version can charge from 20% to 80% in just 18 minutes. For a typical 100 kWh electric vehicle, a single fast-charging session can add around 150 kilometers of driving range.

– Long-Range Version: Setting a new benchmark for light commercial vehicles, this variant features a single-pack capacity of up to 253 kWh and delivers a maximum range of 800 kilometers. Designed for long-distance intercity logistics, it uses CATL’s Taishan pack architecture, reducing vehicle weight by approximately 260 kg compared to conventional batteries of similar capacity. This translates into higher payload capacity and lower energy consumption.

Aimed at last-mile delivery fleets and self-owned commercial vehicles in hot climates, this version uses a customized liquid-cooling thermal management system. It ensures stable fast-charging performance and long battery life even in high-temperature environments, making it ideal for short-distance, high-frequency operations such as supermarket deliveries and community distribution.

The Tianxing brand, launched by CATL in July 2024, is dedicated exclusively to commercial vehicle batteries. With the Tianxing II series, CATL is clearly pushing the boundaries of battery technology—especially with sodium-ion chemistry—while addressing real-world challenges faced by commercial electric vehicles.

Lightfoot, Hayley R. Wells",,,,,https://www.wardandsmith.com/article/top-of-the-wheel-a-conversation-with-north-carolina-labor-commissioner-luke-farley,"invited North Carolina Labor Commissioner Luke Farley to share how employers can navigate the shifting landscape of workplace regulations, along with his vision for the future.
Commissioner Farley is the youngest Labor Commissioner to be elected in a century and the youngest sitting member of North Carolina’s Council of State.
If you favor one side or the other too much, everything gets thrown out of balance,” commented Commissioner Farley.
North Carolina is one of only four states in the nation with an elected labor commissioner; it is the only independent Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) State Plan state with an elected labor commissioner.
“What this means is the federal government makes the regulations, but the elected Labor Commissioner enforces them…we’ve opted out of federal enforcement,” explained Commissioner Farley.","At its annual Employment Law Symposium, Ward and Smith, P.A. invited North Carolina Labor Commissioner Luke Farley to share how employers can navigate the shifting landscape of workplace regulations, along with his vision for the future.

Commissioner Farley is the youngest Labor Commissioner to be elected in a century and the youngest sitting member of North Carolina’s Council of State. His mission is to make North Carolina the safest place to work and the best place to do business – creating an environment where, in the words of North Carolina’s State Toast, “the weak grow strong and the strong grow great.”

Before entering public service, Commissioner Farley spent 14 years in private practice, focused on workplace safety law. A graduate of UNC-Chapel Hill and Wake Forest University School of Law, he is committed to protecting workers and creating more job opportunities across the state.

The discussion was moderated by Avery Locklear, a labor and employment attorney, and Will Oden, a North Carolina Board Certified Specialist in Employment Law.

“I am always impressed when someone leaves a thriving career to enter public service,” said Oden. “What inspired you to do that?”

“I spent thousands of hours building my practice and enjoyed being an attorney, but I felt there was a higher calling for me,” Commissioner Farley explained. “I wanted to do something with my life that would have a bigger impact on the state and society as a whole, and public service was the way to do that.” When discussing the role of Labor Commissioner, he stated that he “thought it was important for someone with real-world experience to be in the role,” and that he “could bring a unique insight to the position.”

Growth vs. Enforcement

The North Carolina Department of Labor has to maintain a delicate balance between enforcing regulations and the need to create an environment where the economy can thrive. “Businesses create jobs, but the workers keep businesses running. If you favor one side or the other too much, everything gets thrown out of balance,” commented Commissioner Farley.

Farley, drawing on his private and public sector experience, volunteered that many employers that fail to follow the rules and regulations do so due to a lack of awareness. “I am an optimist,” and “see the folks that don’t look after their employees as a minority,” Commissioner Farley observed.

The complexity of state and federal regulations presents an obstacle for many employers. “Especially for small businesses, many just don’t have the resources,” explained Commissioner Farley. “My role is to connect them to the resources they need and achieve compliance. We educate before we regulate, however, for the bad apples that are out there, we are not afraid to issue citations.”

Nuances of Public Sector Leadership

Commissioner Farley is looking to infuse the culture of the Department of Labor with a service-oriented approach. “The employees we protect and the businesses we regulate are essentially customers of the department,” he said. “The workers are protected by regulations, and the employers can benefit from taking advantage of our educational programs.”

Motivating employees can be a challenge, as unlike the private sector, performance-based incentives do not exist. Further, the process for terminating an employee can be extremely lengthy and bureaucratic.

“I’m working on instilling a sense of mission into our workforce. Part of this means being present for everyone, so I’ve been traveling around the state to chat with people,” added Farley. “This also means I want to know if our employers or stakeholders have an interaction that is less than professional.” Commissioner Farley then provided his personal cell phone number to audience members for that purpose.

The structure of the North Carolina Department of Labor also impacts the type of services it provides to employees and employers. North Carolina is one of only four states in the nation with an elected labor commissioner; it is the only independent Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) State Plan state with an elected labor commissioner.

“What this means is the federal government makes the regulations, but the elected Labor Commissioner enforces them…we’ve opted out of federal enforcement,” explained Commissioner Farley. “That’s great for our businesses, because instead of dealing with bureaucrats in Atlanta or Richmond, you can talk to me. You have my cell phone.”

Consultative Services

“I like the ‘educate before regulate’ idea,” said Locklear.

“The on-site consultative services program is the best tool we have at the Department to build safer workplaces. It’s free, and there’s a firewall between our investigators and the consultative services arm. Basically, we want people to feel comfortable using the service, so that it will not result in a compliance inspection,” Commissioner Farley added.

Employers can take advantage of the consultative services offering by inviting NCDOL to their workplace. While there, department staff evaluate the workplace to identify potential issues that are not up to standards. If an identified issue is corrected within a certain time frame, there is no citation.

“I know from my private practice that the idea of inviting the Department of Labor into the workplace may sound a little crazy,” joked Commissioner Farley. “But I think about it like you can do something the easy way or the hard way. OSHA can randomly show up and issue a citation if something is wrong, or you can be proactive and reach out to consultative services.”

Commissioner Farley is focused on partnering with businesses to remedy potential hazards: “We are more interested in building collaborative relationships instead of something more adversarial.”

Oden: “For employers that participate in the consultative services program, do they receive any sort of safe harbor protection?”

“There’s not a legal safe harbor if there is a violation that occurs after a consultative visit; however, there is a credit provided for citations and penalty amounts,” explained Commissioner Farley. Arranging for a consultative services visit is treated as a show of good faith. “We want to incentivize the use of these programs,” added Commissioner Farley.

In addition to on-site consultative services, Commissioner Farley mentioned the Carolina Star Program. The Carolina Star Program is a safety recognition and certification program that does provide safe harbor for employers that participate. Only 146 employers have earned the certification out of a total of around 300,000 employers across the state, making it the Department of Labor’s highest level of recognition.

Because the process to receive the certification is extremely rigorous, employers that make it into the program are exempt from random inspections. “This is great PR,” notes Commissioner Farley, “since it shows you value your employees and are going above and beyond to ensure their safety.”

Informal Conferences

However, if employers are ever investigated and subsequently cited by the Department of Labor, participating in an informal conference is another strategy that employers should consider. The term refers to an opportunity to have a discussion with the Department after receiving a citation.

“Avery and I always recommend doing this. If nothing else, it’s a great education,” advised Oden, and “[i]t helps with building relationships” with the Department personnel.

Commissioner Farley has a strong belief in the value of informal conferences: “I told my staff they should make all reasonable efforts to resolve matters in an informal conference, and that every settlement offer proposed by an employer should get a response.”

In the past, settlement offers would not receive a counter if the terms were too far away from what the Department viewed as reasonable. “We respect it if someone makes a settlement offer and responds with a counter,” Commissioner Farley commented. “Employers should take advantage of this opportunity, especially under my administration. It can help avoid costly litigation.”

Future Goals

Moving forward, Commissioner Farley would like the Department to be viewed as a fair, balanced agency – one that listens to the concerns of both employers and employees. Providing exceptional customer service to all stakeholders is another strategic objective.

Reducing fatality rates is paramount to Commissioner Farley and the Department. Currently, the number one cause of workplace fatalities are workers being struck by equipment, a statistic that Commissioner Farley believes may be due to the rise of warehousing and e-commerce in North Carolina.

“To reduce those injuries, we’re starting an alliance program with key industry partners,” Commissioner Farley explained.

Employers may be able to sleep more easily knowing it is unusual for the Department to share information with other agencies. “I don’t go out of my way to share and I don’t think OSHA matters should be tied up in some other matter,” mentioned Commissioner Farley. “Of course, if I have a legal obligation to provide information, I will provide it.”

Essential Guidance

Commissioner Farley’s advice for employers is to be cooperative, collaborative, and transparent. “If the OSHA investigators get the sense you’re hiding something, their approach to the matter will change,” he commented. “Our inspectors are passionate about workplace safety. They will push very hard to find something if they think you’re being evasive, and I don’t restrain them from that.”

Further, Commissioner Farley wants people to know the Department is focused on being collaborative and promoting common sense regulations: “My job is to protect workers, but workers are only workers if they have jobs.”

Conclusion

Commissioner Farley’s presence energized the Employment Law Symposium, and attendee reviews show a wide appreciation for his candor, humor, and leadership of the Department of Labor. For additional information, visit the NC DOL website at https://www.labor.nc.gov/.

The project will be built on private land at the site of a former aluminium smelter near Goldendale, Washington. Once operational, it is designed to provide up to 12 hours of energy storage and generate 1200MW.

“This is a landmark moment for the Pacific Northwest,” said Erik Steimle, Rye Development’s chief development officer. “With electricity demand and energy costs on the rise, this license represents a huge step toward a more reliable grid and affordable energy prices for the region.”

Electricity demand in the Pacific Northwest is projected to increase by more than 30% over the next decade. Developers say pumped storage hydropower can help manage peak demand and improve grid reliability by providing large-scale, long-duration energy storage.

Construction of the Goldendale project is expected to take four to five years and is projected to create more than 3000 jobs during that period, along with dozens of permanent operational positions. The project is also expected to generate more than $10m annually in local tax revenue for Klickitat County.

“The Goldendale Energy Storage Project is a win for middle-class, family-wage jobs and rural communities,” said Heather Kurtenbach, executive secretary of the Washington State Building & Construction Trades Council. “We’re excited to collaborate with Rye Development on what will be one of the largest construction projects southeastern Washington has seen in decades.”

Rye Development has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Washington State Building & Construction Trades Council and the Columbia Pacific Building & Construction Trades Council that requires contractors to hire union labor and prioritize local workers. The agreement also includes apprenticeship opportunities during the construction period.

The project site is located at the former Columbia Gorge Aluminum smelter, a brownfield property within Klickitat County’s Energy Overlay Zone, which is intended to streamline energy development. The project area overlaps with the Tuolumne Wind Farm and is expected to make use of existing roads and transmission infrastructure.

“Redeveloping the Columbia Gorge Aluminum smelter into a clean energy resource has been a longtime vision of this community,” said Richard Foster, economic development director for Klickitat County. “The project revitalises our community with good-paying jobs, stimulates local economic growth and enhances our leadership in renewable energy.”

RISKS

Plug Power recorded $971 million in non-cash impairments and $104 million in inventory adjustments due to ""decision to temper focus on certain products and markets"" and slower than expected industry growth.

Revenue negatively impacted by $22.7 million in customer warrant charges, $8 million of delayed revenue from a material handling customer, a $16 million reduction from not shipping mobile refuelers, and $12 million from production delays in cryogenics—all in the quarter.

Sanjay Shrestha stated, ""it has been slower than anticipated,"" and attributed significant Q4 revenue impacts to customer delays, site readiness, and early-stage market dynamics.

SUMMARY

Plug Power executed a major restructuring, emphasizing cost reduction and narrowed focus on material handling, electrolyzers, and hydrogen production to address a challenging industry and revenue volatility. The company secured policy and financing milestones, including Department of Energy approval for the Texas plant and a $30 million ITC monetization, while setting near-term targets for margin improvement and cash burn reduction. Management provided limited guidance beyond the first quarter, directly attributing this to market uncertainties and execution risks in project timing and customer readiness.

Electrolyzer business is positioned for substantial bookings in 2025, with opportunities in both Europe and North America backed by large institutions and customer offtake agreements.

Material handling remains a core growth driver, supported by confirmed large customer commitments and positive customer feedback on Plug’s sharpened profitability focus.

Plug remains cautious on stationary/data center and H2 Hub opportunities, expecting no material revenue from these segments in the next two to three years.

Green hydrogen production costs at the Georgia plant are currently around $5/kg before PTC, with average daily production mostly in the 11-12 ton per day range and full production achievable as dictated by demand.

Management reported that none of the company’s ATM facility or recent SEPA agreement with Yorkville has been used since mid-November, and existing convertible issuance redemptions were handled in cash, not by share sales.

INDUSTRY GLOSSARY

ITC (Investment Tax Credit): Tax credit earned for investments in eligible energy property or equipment, directly reducing tax liability or monetizable via transfer or sale.

PTC (Production Tax Credit): Tax credit based on the quantity of renewable energy produced and sold by a project; can be monetized or strategically chosen in lieu of ITC based on economics of specific assets.

Electrolyzer: Equipment that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity; used to produce green hydrogen in industrial decarbonization applications.

DOE Loan: Loan guarantee program offered by the U.S. Department of Energy to finance qualifying clean energy infrastructure; typically covers a portion of project costs with stipulated advance and drawdown rates.

Material Handling: Business segment providing hydrogen fuel cell solutions for warehouse logistics and goods movement applications (e.g., power for lift trucks and related equipment).

Gross Margin Inflection Point: The specific period when a business expects its gross profit from operations—net of direct costs—to become positive, signaling core profitability improvement.

Full Conference Call Transcript

Andy Marsh: Good morning, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter conference call. Last night, we announced significant structural change to streamline our cost base through Project Quantum Leap. Over the coming months, we'll be reducing staff, refining our product focus, and consolidating facilities. These measures are targeted to generate annualized cost savings of $150 million to $200 million. These decisions are not easy, but they are necessary. The slower than anticipated development in the hydrogen market has been influenced by multiple factors, including the pace of policy implementation, global energy and security driven by geopolitical conflicts, the higher cost of project execution and past over enthusiasm in this sector.

However, we remain confident that hydrogen will play a critical role in the future energy mix with many experts projecting, it will eventually contribute 10% to 20% of the world's energy supplies. The projects that will progress the fastest are those with a clear value proposition, strong policy support and a well-integrated value chain. As we assess our businesses, our primary focus moving forward will be on three key areas: material handling, electrolyzers and hydrogen generation to support material handling, as they align best with these attributes. In material handling, we deliver a compelling value proposition by helping customers move goods more efficiently. Plug benefits from three revenue streams in this business: products, services and hydrogen.

In 2024, we have made significant improvements in improving margins for service and hydrogen, expanding them by approximately $120 million compared to 2023, excluding the impact of customer warrant charges. Product margins however are tied to sales and factory utilization. Last year, sales were slower as we worked through price renegotiations with major customers and the transition from PPA to direct sales, that process is now complete and we expect increased deployments this year from both existing and new customers, which will improve our facility utilization and drive positive gross margin.

Additionally, hydrogen margins will continue improving with the launch of our new joint venture facility in Louisiana this month, while service is on track to reach profitability by year's end. Hydrogen production costs are a critical driver of both our profitability and the broader market development for fuel cells. By the end of this month, Plug will have 39 tons per day of capacity, while customer demand stands at approximately 55 tons per day. The DOE approval for our Limestone plant in Texas, a project creating jobs in a deeply conservative district was secured in January.

We’ve already have the necessary equipment to cover our equity investment in the project and are finalizing discussions with an external investors to complete the funding structure. Given the change in administration, we now anticipate a later start in 2025, with project completion expected 18 months to 24 months from the start date. Importantly, we do not plan to contribute additional Plug equity to complete the project and anticipate retaining a 70% to 80% ownership stake once operation. Our electrolyzer business is essential to both our near-term and long-term growth. The primary applications involve replacing gray hydrogen in sectors like refining, green ammonia and methanol production.

Global demand remains strong and we expect significant growth in both sales and bookings this year. Notably, we're executing large scale projects including the 100 megawatt deployment with GALP. Here's why I see -- and this is really important, here's why I see tremendous potential in this market for Plug. Unlike some hydrogen fuel cell market, that face challenges across the value chain such as infrastructure, fueling and financing hurdles for on-road vehicles, the replacement of gray hydrogen with green hydrogen is a much simpler transition. Customers can blend green hydrogen to existing processes without major operational changes, which accelerates deployments, speeds up time to markets and you deliver immediate benefits.

As we move forward from this restructuring and market adjustments, Plug will prioritize material handling, hydrogen production supporting material handling and electrolyzer sales alongside profitable cash generating assets in well-established markets. If the program is not tied to profitability or cash generation, Plug will not pursue the program in the near or long-term. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Sanjay to review our Q4 results, followed by Paul, who will provide insights into our financial outlook.

Sanjay Shrestha: Thank you, Andy, and good morning, everyone. 2024 was a year of recalibration for Plug. It included some successes and some challenges. On a positive front, fourth quarter 2024 marked another quarter of meaningful reduction in cash burn, continued gross margin expansion and another step change in growth of our electrolyzer business. Cash burn for the quarter was down year -- over 70% year-over-year and gross profit improved year-over-year when you exclude the non-cash charges of customer warrant and inventory adjustment. It is important to highlight that this margin expansion was accomplished despite lower revenue year-over-year. Now in terms of challenges, market growth, as Andy touched on it has been slower than anticipated.

Reported revenue for Q4 '24 came in at $191 million and full year revenue of $629 million. We are disappointed with this continuous [indiscernible] revenue despite significant improvement in sales of the electrolyzer business. We believe it is important to highlight a few key items that negatively impacted revenue in the quarter and for the full year 2024. As we highlighted in our press release issued last night, our application business revenue was impacted by a higher than usual warrant charge of $22.7 million and we had another $8 million of revenue that got pushed out related to a specific customer program in our material handling business.

In our cryogenic tanker and trailer business, we actually made a strategic decision not to ship multiple mobile refueler product to a customer in Class 8 truck space given their financial position which negatively impacted revenue by about $16 million in the quarter. In addition, we also had some production delays on few key product line in our cryogenic business that had an impact of about $12 million of revenue in the quarter. Just to reconfirm, this production impact has been already mitigated and will show up as revenue in the first half of 2025.

Despite delivering almost six fold revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2024 versus fourth quarter of 2023, our electrolyzer business in the fourth quarter was negatively impacted by multiple factors, which represented revenue impact of as much as $68 million. We expect some of this revenue to materialize in Q1 of 2025. Majority of this is related to customer delays, site readiness, with some of the projects actually getting pushed to Q2 and Q3 of this year. And frankly, this revenue fluctuation on a quarterly basis in our opinion reflects the early stage of the industry growth as both supplier and customers learn to work together and keep moving projects forward.

This factor has had a total impact of over $120 million of revenue in Q4 of 2024. Just to reiterate, we believe some of the electrolyzer opportunity will contribute to revenue in Q1 '25 and majority of the customer pushout will be revenue opportunities in Q2 and Q3 of this year. Production related delays in our cryogenic business have already been addressed and will contribute to revenue opportunity in the first half of 2025. We also expect the revenue pushout from Q4 '24 in our material handling business to contribute to revenue in Q1 of 2025.

Based on all these items that impacted Q4 '24, overall seasonality in the first half of our business and overall macroenvironment, we believe our Q1 '25 revenue will be in the range of $125 million to $140 million. You should expect to see continued gross margin improvement. We believe the year of 2025 is set up to be a year of meaningful bookings in our electrolyzer business. As Andy highlighted, given the current macroenvironment, we remain focused on driving cost down, expanding margin, and reducing our cash burn. With that, let me turn the call over to Paul to discuss the financial outlook in some more detail.

Paul Middleton: Thank you, Sanjay. Since Andy addressed some of the broader market issues and Sanjay talked about revenues and margins for the quarter, let me jump into a few specific topics. As conveyed in our filings yesterday, Plug recorded non-cash charges in the quarter of approximately $971 million for asset impairments and bad debt and OpEx, and approximately $104 million in COGS for inventory valuation adjustments. These stem from multiple factors, including the decision to temper focus on certain products and markets that are more mid-term opportunities and overall market conditions resulting in slower growth for the industry than anticipated.

In terms of impairments, this relates to property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, non-marketable equity investments, and assets associated with power purchase agreements and fuel. As a result of these impairments, it will reduce future amortization and depreciation, including a reduction of $55 million to $60 million in 2025. In regard to cash burn, we were laser focused on margin and cash flow improvement in 2024 and we saw benefits throughout the year and in particular in Q4 '24. These actions included targeted price increases, labor optimization, rooftop consolidations, improvement in production costs and leveraging our hydrogen platform with our new green hydrogen plant in Georgia coming online.

We expect in '25 to include a full year of benefits from these activities undertaken during '24. In addition, we expect initiatives and Project Quantum Leap to provide meaningful incremental improvement in margins and cash flows starting in Q2 of 2025 and building throughout the year. These additional measures will be complemented with the strategic efforts such as our new hydrogen Louisiana plant coming online in Q2 of 2025. We continue to be laser focused on driving deposit margins and cash flows in the near term. In terms of liquidity, we ended 2024 with more cash on hand than we anticipated with over $200 million in unrestricted cash.

We recently closed our first ITC transfer sale for the $30 million benefit associated with the liquefier plant -- liquefier at our Georgia green hydrogen plant, illustrating opportunities to leverage additional ITC assets. We have an effectively unleveraged balance sheet and we are currently working with existing partners on varied capital solutions. These factors, coupled with the focus on improvement in margins and cash flows put us in a strong position to achieve our near and mid-term financial goals and fund the company with the most prudent cost efficient capital solutions. I'll now turn it back over to Andy.

Andy Marsh: Okay. I guess, opening for Q&A to you.

Operator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your questions.

Colin Rusch: Thanks so much, guys. Can you talk about the maturity of the financing for a number of the projects that you're talking about in that pipeline? The project financing oftentimes is a key gatekeeper, but just want to get a sense of cash flow supporting all of those projects at this point?

Andy Marsh: Why don't you take that, Sanjay?

Sanjay Shrestha: So Colin, are you referring to some of the opportunities on…

Colin Rusch: The electrolyzers.

Sanjay Shrestha: Yeah.

Colin Rusch: Yeah. Exactly on the electrolyzers.

Sanjay Shrestha: Sure. So again, we are looking at two very large projects here in the near-term. One is in Europe and one is in North America. And the project in Europe actually is going to final investment decision here by the end of the quarter. And look, it's a fully funded project, right, backed by a very large financial institution. So financing and the opportunity set of this project should not be a challenge. And next project in North America is actually related to big methanol opportunity. Again, there was already an offtake for that methanol opportunity.

So in light of that, Colin, the biggest thing in this space, right, is before you get to FID, you got to secure that offtake, really get the financing structure looking a lot like solar and wind from an offtake standpoint. Both of the projects that we're looking at here in the first half of the year have that attribute. So we're really not concerned from an overall financing standpoint. We just want to make sure that we land the project. We've already done the basic engineering design package in this cases and looking forward to moving ahead with the customer.

Colin Rusch: Thanks so much. And then, on the material handling side, obviously, there was a lull in some of the spending in warehouse automation and some of the capacity getting digested in the warehouse space. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing from early indications? We saw some green shoots late in '24 on folks starting to spend again. But any material change in some of those spending patterns that you guys are seeing with some of those customers?

Andy Marsh: I think I'll give you one indicator, Colin, is that one of my largest customers put down money to be able to qualify under the old $48 million (ph) to support $200 million worth of business. I think that's a strong statement about their anticipated growth and expansion. We have both -- what we see and we announced, as you may remember in the fourth quarter, expansion with BMW in Germany, just to name a few of the larger customers. I can tell you that this announcement last night helps us with our customers.

I checked in with some of our sales folks who I asked to reach out after market closed to let them know what we were planning to do. What I heard was, we're happy you're going to take the steps to reach profitability. We're glad you're focusing our segment and it makes it easier to do business in the future. So it's a -- these are very, very difficult decisions. But in the material handling market, we expect that this will be well, well received.

I mean, if you take a look back -- and if you take a look back, Colin, I mean, I was just sitting here thinking about, Paul mentioned when you start thinking about the income statement level, depreciation was going to reduce $60 million. We're reducing our annualized cost between $150 million to $200 million. They're big steps to reaching profitability.

Colin Rusch: Super helpful, guys. Appreciate it.

Andy Marsh: Okay.

Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Craig Irwin with ROTH Capital Partners. Please proceed with your questions.

Craig Irwin: Thank you for taking my questions. So Andy, I wanted to ask about the DOE, right, your loan package with the DOE. There's a lot of investors criticism out there and nobody's going to know but you guys about what's actually being discussed with DOE and what the changes are? Can you maybe share with us any content of communications with DOE over the last few weeks? Do you expect this team to continue to support the loan package the way it was written? Are there any changes or updates that you might want to share with us around the loan package that would help investors understand the opportunity?

Andy Marsh: Craig, there has been discussions with the DOE and we're pleased at a working level. The individuals we have been dealing with have remained at the DOE. So we're not going through the process of reeducating the team. I think that's a big positive. I know there's lots of noise, but I can tell you when I became CEO of Plug, the first thing I did was step back and try to figure out everything that was going on. We have had regular conversations with the DOE over the past month. I personally will be spending time with them this week. So from an engagement point of view, and look, we're in very, very red districts.

We're in Texas where we're looking to build this. And I can tell you the local political teams, political folks in that region are strong supporters of this and are reaching out to make sure that this loan is executed on the deal that we came to. Look, obviously, things which are associated with more social oriented issues will be downplayed. During the call, I mentioned -- during the opening statement, Craig, I mentioned how our portion of the equity we already have with equipment, we do have a few funds who want to play side by side with us.

I would expect that construction of this project will most likely happen in the fourth quarter and that you can say 18 months to 24 months before it's completed. And I know you didn't ask this question, but I do want to highlight. We learned a lot from building Georgia, how to build a plant. And I can tell you the Louisiana build was much, much simpler. We actually learned a lot and I don't -- I think the learnings we have as well as the cost reductions it will bring to the business will be really beneficial long term.

Craig Irwin: Excellent. Then, you touched on this in your response and it was going to be my second question. So outside investors for the Texas project, you've already obviously attracted some pretty interesting attention and orders from groups like Fortescue for your Gibson -- for their Gibson island project. Can you maybe frame out for us the character of outside investors that are possible there? I know there's some global funds that are pretty active in evaluating this opportunity that really want the opportunity to invest in hydrogen. But are we looking more at private equity or other institutional investors as probable partners on the Texas project?

Andy Marsh: We are looking at -- and Sanjay and Paul, jump in. I would define most of the folks looking at our infrastructure funds looking to invest. And look, they're looking to invest in a new segment where there's growth potential. And, we have a process that's going on. We've identified two or three folks that we've been talking to. And, I think that -- I think you'll be hearing more about it during the coming months. And look, I think your first question, Craig, is important to this discussion.

Look, people want clarity what's going on with the DOE and that's part of the process in making sure that we can close these funds -- close with these funds in a timely fashion.

Craig Irwin: Thank you for that, Andy. And congratulations on the strong progress with your cash use. It's really pretty dramatic, the changes in this last year.

Andy Marsh: Yeah. Thank you, Craig. And we're looking -- we're going to continue to drive more to make sure, we're -- we have a strong financial position.

Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Saumya Jain with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.

Saumya Jain: Hey, guys. Good morning. Yeah. So how are you looking at data center backup power generation? How do you see Plug benefiting from that in 2025?

Andy Marsh: To be direct, I don't see it as a benefit in 2025. Our view is that, when it comes to hydrogen, one of the biggest challenges to make sure that you can support long duration outages and that requires a great deal of hydrogen storage on site. We think that business opportunity is a '28, '29 opportunity. Really to be successful, we really think you need hydrogen pipelines that you can store hydrogen in. And there are some data centers in Europe that could make sense in the future. But I would not expect revenue from that segment of any size over the next two to three years.

Saumya Jain: Got it. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Peterson with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your questions.

Bill Peterson: Yeah. Hi. Good morning, Paul, Andy, and team. Want to maybe take the applications question more broader than just the high power stationary. So I think at this symposium a few months ago, I guess you thought that the materials handling should probably go to 20%, 30% -- 20% to 30% year-on-year growth and now you're kind of expecting 10% to 20%. More broadly, I guess, over the next few years, what is going to drive the applications business? Is it going to be materials handling at this stage, given your comments around stationary power or at least a high power backup, maybe not viable in the next few years? And then mobility appears to be fairly challenged as well.

So what's going to drive the applications business and what's the right way to think about the growth over the next few years?

Andy Marsh: Bill, this is a real important question. I kind of touched on all my remarks. But the material handling business, you have a -- Plug established, what I'll call a micro infrastructure that can support the customer's needs and so the value chain is clear. And you look at markets like on-road mobility and stationary, there's so many other items in the value chain that have to be implemented and be successful for those businesses to grow fast over the coming two to three years. So material handling is one that we can look at and say, the pieces are in place.

It's also -- and you may have heard in my comments, when I talk about the electrolyzer market, it's not going to be folks who are going to dominate who are looking to drive mobility, it is going to be people who are able to put the end product, whether hydrogen or green ammonia or methanol or SAF directly into the value change without too much complication.

I mean, I sat through a -- about three, four months, I sat through a McKinsey presentation in D.C., and I sat back and listened to it and said to myself, they had a matrix of how one should think about markets though they weren't talking about hydrogen, specifically, they were talking about the whole renewable world. And it really was kind of a clarifier to me that you need to develop focus on value chain. And look, our business will grow as we improve. If you're a customer, what's your biggest concern when it comes to Plug? You have a business that improves the productivity of your operation.

You have a company that -- we have fixed the hydrogen issues and risks our customers may have. The biggest risk is, how will Plug perform financially? And the steps we've taken today will actually help us accelerate growth in the market. And I can tell you, I do know of some of our large customers, they're looking to accelerate their growth. If our numbers are lower today, Bill, look, we don't want to over promise. We want to make sure we deliver and so we want to set clear expectations. But I think we see a healthy market. It's why we're laser focused on material handling and why we're going to be laser focused on electrolyzers.

Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Eric Stine with Craig-Hallum. Please proceed with your [Technical Difficulty].

Eric Stine: Good morning, everyone.

Andy Marsh: Good morning, Eric.

Eric Stine: Hey. So I can appreciate it sounds like not guiding to fiscal '25 and I know, Sanjay, you gave Q1, but maybe just some commentary on the year. I mean is -- should we expect this to be your typical mix first half versus second half? How do you expect the year to play out sequentially? Any details to fill that in would be helpful.

Sanjay Shrestha: That's right, Eric. Look, I mean, as you -- as I kind of touched on it, so Q1, you have seasonality, right? Then, we are looking at sort of the macro environment that's got a lot of puts and takes, if you would. And there is a benefit, however, though of some push outs from Q4 into Q1. So when you look at this $125 million to $140 million in sales, typically, Q1 has been 10% to 15%, but given some of the push out, you can probably imagine it's more like 15% plus in terms of the revenue mix, 15% to 20%.

So in light of that, that's I think how you should think about the full year for the company at this point in time. And one other thing, we just want to make sure, as Andy touched on it, what we have the strongest visibility on is Q1. We're already obviously sitting here in the month of March. We will do the same thing when we report our Q1 earnings to give you the visibility on Q2. We're really focused on obviously driving that top line, getting the growth for the company in '25.

But the bigger focus you can appreciate hopefully is on reducing cash burn, expanding margin, and really getting to that EBITDA break even territory as soon as we can as company.

Eric Stine: Yeah. No, I totally get that, but those details are helpful. And then, maybe a good segue just on the cost reductions in your plan here in 2025, I mean, you gave pretty good detail there. I'm just curious, how deep you see those. Is there more room to go if necessary? And how do you kind of balance that between as you said, I mean, you've got, even though now you're going to be more focused, material handling electrolyzers, hydrogen, still have a big growth opportunity. So how do you kind of balance your near term objectives while still being able to execute on those longer term growth plans?

Andy Marsh: So Craig, I do believe that the learnings you receive from deploying projects actually have large benefits to other markets. Nothing makes us better at deploying electrolyzers than the fact that we learned how to build plants ourselves. Nothing helps us better for markets that will evolve in applications like stationary than getting our quality and -- of our present fuel cell products better every day. So I think that, some folks -- I'm a power engineer by training and I think a lot like a power engineer about how things scale. But when you think about fuel cells, you're really thinking about probably two, three different power levels of fuel cells.

But learnings at one level translates to the next. So we're -- look, we are making and focusing on activities that will make our financials stronger, which in the long run will really allow us to go into these other markets as they become available. So I guess that's, being successful now will help us a great deal in being successful in the future and that's the decisions we're making.

Eric Stine: Got it. And maybe I'll just sneak in one more, just for the $150 million to $200 million in targeted savings. Can you just give kind of the high level mix between cost of goods and OpEx?

Andy Marsh: I would say I'll let -- I'll take it quick. And Paul, correct me, if you disagree. I would probably say that it's almost 50-50 between COGS and OpEx.

Paul Middleton: That's a good proxy.

Andy Marsh: Yeah. Look, we haven't made -- we're obviously going through the process and I have to be respectful for our employees and others before I kind of say exact numbers.

Eric Stine: Okay. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Gianarikas with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your questions.

George Gianarikas: Hi. Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions.

Andy Marsh: Good morning, George.

George Gianarikas: Good morning. I'd like to ask Andy about your view on the policy environment in Washington. It's clearly quite confusing and just curious as to whether you can share any details on conversations you've had or your view as to how the next six months or 12 months will look? Thank you.

Andy Marsh: So, we'd say, it's obviously evolving environment and I'm going to be spending some time in D.C. later this week. When I look at the history of fuel cells in hydrogen, the supporters of it, the last time we had a real major fuel cell only bill to support the industry actually happened under President Trump and a pure Republican Congress. I can tell you last week, there was a bill introduced by Representative Tenney, who -- she in a very, very red district, supporting fuel cells and it was her second bill that she introduced in this Congress.

I think that -- look, I've been pretty clear about the fact that we felt that the previous administration implementation of the IRA, especially, when it came to hydrogen tax credits was rather disappointing. And we kind of view the new administration as more business oriented and hydrogen is actually supported strongly by the oil and gas industry, which is beneficial. I suspect there'll be ups and downs. But look, I think this is real important. There is a global market for green ammonia, green methanol. There's needs for hydrogen here in the United States for applications like ours, that's not going away. And this administration is looking for the U.S. to be energy dominant.

And to be energy dominant, you have to meet where the world sees demand and where the world sees new demand. And it is in SAF, it is in green ammonia, it is in green methanol and that's not going to change. So I think it's really important for U.S. to make sure that China doesn't dominate these industries long term. And I think many, many people in the House, in the Senate, as well as the DOE understand, Bergman, I think everybody knows was one of the biggest proponents of the hydrogen hubs. I think it just -- I know this is a long answer, but I think it just needs to settle down.

George Gianarikas: Maybe as a follow-up, I'd love your thoughts also on what's happening in Europe too? Thank you.

Andy Marsh: If I look at Europe, the -- it's one of the reasons I think Sanjay is so positive about the electrolyzer market. So much of what we're working on, for example, is in the hydrogen hubs, Hydrogen valley in Spain, where there's strong, strong support for build outs and deployments. I think that where you're going to see and I think you're going to see Germany continue to support hydrogen deployments. Obviously, the geopolitical tensions at the moment makes things a little tense.

But look, even long-term, we have a panelist who helps us in Europe, who was an ambassador to the EU, told us there could be huge, huge opportunity for projects and deployments like we do in Ukraine once all this is calmed down. So I think, Europe is -- there's certainly lots of nuances with Europe, but you can look at Spain and can see what's going on and say, hey, this is really good for Plug Power. I think you can say the same about Australia. And I think these are markets that are going to be the heart of our electrolyzer business.

And look, you've heard our announcements in Portugal, for example, with GALP, what we're doing there with what we're doing with Iberdrola in Spain. These are projects that are going in the ground now to support the economy, and all of them are supported by the governments at some level.

George Gianarikas: Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next questions come from the line of Sherif Elmaghrabi with BTIG. Please proceed with your questions.

Sherif Elmaghrabi: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.

Andy Marsh: Good morning.

Sherif Elmaghrabi: Good morning, Andy. The Georgia ITC transfer is pretty interesting. Are there other piecemeal opportunities to pull cash out of existing equipment, either Georgia or elsewhere? And is there a reason you recognize the ITC on that particular liquefier rather than the entire plant?

Paul Middleton: Yeah. Andy wants me to answer that one. So this is Paul. The short answer on the first part is, yes. We have as an example, when we turn on our plant in Louisiana, there'll be a ITC credit there associated with the liquefier as well that we can take and we'll share with our joint venture partner there, that could be similar size to what we recognized in Georgia. And then we have some additional assets that we've deployed last year for PPA opportunities that there's ITC benefits on that is probably in the 15 million to 20 million range that we're out.

We're actually working pretty closely right now to closing in the near-term on both of those opportunities. So that's meaningful and helpful in terms of the cash. And then, on the answer on Georgia is that there's a decision to make on the balance of plans as to whether you take PTC or ITC. We've decided to take the PTC benefits. We've recognized those in our results last year. And, we're going to continue to do that. Any plant that we put in place, we go through a cash benefit analysis as to is it better to take the ITC or to do the PTC. And it's -- there's many factors that fall into that.

And -- but that's the choice that we have. So that's where we stand on that for the Georgia plant.

Paul Middleton: You're welcome.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Tsung with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions.

Chris Tsung: Hey. Good morning, Andy, Sanjay, and Paul. Looking at your...

Andy Marsh: Good morning, Chris.

Chris Tsung: Hey, Andy. Looking at your care, are there -- just wanted to check, are there new conditions that you need to satisfy in order to receive the DOE loan?

Paul Middleton: I'm not sure. There's not new conditions. The loan was finalized in early January. The only thing that we have to do is, and it's approved, the way it works is the loan itself has been papered, documented and approved. Everything's there. To apply the first project, which is Texas, there's some specific things that we have to put in place in terms of like direct agreements between the DOE and the EPC contractors. An example is just one microcosm example. So those are things that we're working on. We're really close.

And they're not necessarily additional conditions that make it -- any obstacle is just really -- unfortunately, the parties that work on these things that we're working with have done many other deals with the DOE, so they're used to working with the DOE on these kind of ancillary agreements. And so it's more just, I would say, for lack of better words, the bureaucracy of just putting crossing the T's and dotting the I's and putting all those residual components in place to officially kick-off Texas as a project underneath that structure.

Chris Tsung: Great. Thanks, Paul. And just for my follow-up, on that loan, how much are you requesting as part of the first drawdown? And did you – sorry, if I missed this earlier. Did you say you're expecting proceeds in Q4 or is that when construction is expected to restart?

Andy Marsh: So we would -- I would think that Q4 is my best estimate when construction would start. Paul, maybe you can go through the process of how you pull down cash.

Paul Middleton: Yeah. So the way it'll work is, when we get the project approved and kick-off the effort there, which is really getting the EPC guy going again, EPC contractor going, which as Andy said, tentatively would be -- we're thinking would be probably in the fourth quarter. In the first month what happens is, you compile all of the anticipated invoices each month that you expect to pay as part of that project, and you submit that to the DOE and then they advance money against that.

So that's -- we're going to get credit for our equipment that we've contributed to the project, and then they will front money to pay the majority of the bills that we have to pay to construct that project as we move forward. So that's how practically it works.

Chris Tsung: Appreciate it. Thank you, guys. I'll turn it over.

Paul Middleton: Thanks, Chris.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Moore with Clear Street. Please proceed with your questions.

Tim Moore: Thanks for taking my questions.

Andy Marsh: Good morning.

Tim Moore: Good morning. The important watchpoint by investors is the positive gross margin inflection point that investors have been eagerly waiting on. You made some really good progress announcing the cost savings plan. I think your prior guidance at the symposium was the expectation back then was to maybe be slightly positive gross margin exit rate for the year. I'm just wondering now with the significant cost savings plans being rapidly implemented, do you think that exit rate still holds, or do you think you could pull it off in the third quarter for maybe positive third quarter gross margin?

Sanjay Shrestha: I mean, Tim, our goal is always hopefully trying to do things sooner rather than later. But look, given everything and all puts and takes, I think it holds in terms of Q4 of 2025 as a good target that we are looking to turn gross margin positive.

Tim Moore: Great, Sanjay. That's helpful. And the other question I had just on a different topic. Maybe can you speak to maybe the liquid hydrogen appetite and the sentiment? The H2 Hubs network rollout is a little bit behind schedule. Just can you give any color or stories on progress there with some customers and green shoots for takeaway from your production facilities?

Andy Marsh: No. Look, I think the hubs will develop. I never thought the hubs would develop that fast. If you looked at the funding for the hubs, it was years of study and implementation, and that was even under the previous administration. We never -- and I think if you even go back to previous conference calls, we never expected significant near-term or even midterm revenue from the hubs. I think hubs implementation would help the hydrogen industry later in this decade and that's always been our view. And they're just -- I would say this, they never really had a very fast schedule and I don't see them being meaningful to us over the next two to three years.

But if implemented, not only is it a sales opportunity, but really helps to build out the larger hydrogen economy. So we're supportive but probably are not stunned that they have not accelerated as fast as people may have thought. But also quite honestly, they're accelerating at a pace that the government actually laid out there. So that's kind of our thought process there.

Tim Moore: Great, Andy. Thanks for that and that's it for my questions.

Andy Marsh: All right.

Operator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Samantha Hoh with HSBC. Please proceed with your questions.

Samantha Hoh: Hey, guys.

Andy Marsh: Good morning, Samantha.

Samantha Hoh: I hate to bringing it back to -- hey, Andy. You mentioned a few times about the Texas plant being a very red district that's very pro hydrogen. And the one thing that's really striking me is just how much support the state of Texas has for hydrogen. Like, enthusiasm overall actually is quite palpable. Has there been any conversation in terms of Texas funding in any sort of stimulus or what type of initiatives that they can provide to get the industry -- hydrogen industry really more competitive or just accelerating all the developments there, if the federal government does kind of pull back on their support?

Andy Marsh: I have not -- I will be meeting with people from the Texas delegation this week. I know I have not seen anything. We do have people in Houston. I have not seen anything to date where the Texas delegation can help us the most. And the Texas government is to help move things through the DOE quicker as they learn. And I think you see both representatives and senators willing to help in that area.

Samantha Hoh: Okay. I guess the other thing that I'm kind of curious about is with like potential monetization of the PTC. I realize that, there's still a lot of questions as to what's going to happen with like a potential tax plan ultimately. But what sort of conversations are happening behind the scene in terms of opportunities, potentially monetize those once we have greater clarity? And then I guess what are your thoughts in terms of how quickly that could? Like, what kind of milestones should we be looking at? Like, how quickly can anything on that side that should occur?

Andy Marsh: Do you want to take that, Paul?

Paul Middleton: Yeah. So I guess there's two facets. One is, practically the way it works is, when you file your tax return, it's a direct pay associated with that. So worst case, we file in October like other corporates that are calendar years companies and they pay from that. What we are working with is, the tax equity broker that we used to close the ITC sale in Georgia to see if there's parties that want to discount that. It's only a few months, but it can be meaningful to us to discount and sell it off.

The good news is, we have tax opinions from a reputable big global tax firm, and all of the analysis and things that we need to put that package together and make it a very attractive opportunity to sell it off. And when we establish that, it makes a decision easier to do that for this year and start taking advantage of this year, monetizing this year's as well. So it's a work in process and it's still new. Like any new market opportunity, it takes some time to kind of nurture through it. But we're pretty actually encouraged with the interest level and how we're postured to try and possibly monetize that.

Samantha Hoh: Okay. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Dayal with H.C. Wainwright. Please proceed with your question.

Amit Dayal: Thank you, and good morning, everyone.

Andy Marsh: Good morning, Amit.

Amit Dayal: Hey, Andy. Just with respect to sort of the macro environment right now and how you're providing guidance, [Technical Difficulty] much of the sales pipeline that was built up until say 2024 is still valid? Can you give us a sense of how that aspect of the execution may have changed a little bit?

Andy Marsh: You want to take that, Sanjay?

Sanjay Shrestha: Sure. Happy to. Hey, Amit. How are you? A couple of things on this, right? So our electrolyzer business in 2025 largely is executing on the existing backlog, that really hasn't changed, right? We're hopeful that we might even be able to do slightly better than that. But it all really comes down to executing on the backlog. And just to put this in context, I mean, electrolyzer business grew about 60% -- more than 60% year-over-year from '23 to '24. We wouldn't be surprised if it's a similar growth rate again in 2025. Now, another piece of our business, which is largely backlog driven as well is our cryogenic tanker and trailer business.

We look that business slowed down a bit year-over-year from '22 to '24, largely because of some of the push out, some decisions even we made on the mobile refueler space, even the collection situation and things like that. So that business, I think, again will grow back up here in 2025 versus 2024 from a revenue standpoint. So short answer to your question, we really don't think there is any risk to that existing backlog. Obviously, we're going to want to book more business here. But one very important point to highlight here is, we talk about potential for pretty big bookings in the electrolyzer business.

Those bookings will really help '26 and beyond, not so much 2025 given the size of the project and when they move and things along those lines. But otherwise, look, we feel pretty good about the existing backlog. It's all about heads down and execute.

Amit Dayal: Thank you, Sanjay. My other questions have already been discussed. I'll take my other questions offline. Thank you.

Andy Marsh: Okay. Thanks.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ameet Thakkar with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.

Ameet Thakkar: Hi. Good morning. Just one quick one for me. Given kind of your kind of path here to positive gross margins at the end of the year and the cost cutting, I was just wondering if you could kind of share with us what your plans are in terms of kind of relying on some of the facilities you have for external equity. How much is kind of baked into the year for that? Thanks.

Andy Marsh: So, I would just say that we have not used any of that since mid-November, any of those facilities. And there is a backdrop to support the business if required.

Amit Dayal: You have utilized the convertible facility, right, for like, I think, let's say two issuances of $22.5 million in, I think, the first two months of the year. Is that separate from that?

Andy Marsh: Yeah. That's actually just payback. Instead of selling stock, we actually execute it by providing cash. Do you have anything else to comment, Paul?

Paul Middleton: Yeah. No, I think just for clarity. So we -- the convertible that we did, the preferred convertible, we did in November, there's been two elements. One is, we had some amortization on that, and then because the stock price hit $2.90, they did convert, I think it was like 10 million shares. But to Andy's point, we have not used either of the ATM facility or the recent SEPA agreement with Yorkville. So, we sit in a good position with ending $200 million in cash end of the year. And, things like the ITC help bring in liquidity. We also get the restricted cash at $50 million a quarter that comes in, in March.

So there's a lot of positive things that are helping us navigate this fiscal year.

Ameet Thakkar: Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kashy Harrison with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your questions.

Kashy Harrison: Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions.

Andy Marsh: Good morning.

Kashy Harrison: Good morning. So my first question is on Georgia. You've now had it running for around a year. Just curious where run rate utilization is on the project and how long it took to get there. And the same question for cost of goods sold. I think you guys were thinking about maybe $4-ish per kilo of production costs. But I'm just curious where actual results have landed relative to those expectations.

Andy Marsh: Do you want to take that one, Paul?

Paul Middleton: Yeah. I'd say, as you ramp and commission the plant, obviously the cost per kilogram is higher than what you expected. As we've gone through the year and really worked out the bugs and figured out how to run that plant more smoothly, you get the leverage on it, right? And so, I'd say, we're kind of in that $5-ish kilogram range…

Andy Marsh: Before the PTC.

Paul Middleton: Before the PTC, that's right. And obviously, PTC is super helpful.

Andy Marsh: Which gets it down to the 250 (ph) type range.

Paul Middleton: Exactly. So that's kind of where we're sitting at the moment. And we expect to take the pull. This year will be really good because we'll get the full year benefit of that whereas last year you only got a portion of that because the timing of turning on the plant and the periods of time that we were ramping up that facility.

Kashy Harrison: Got it. And sorry, where is the utilization?

Andy Marsh: Utilization is, we can run it full production. So, it's just based on demand. And so we need to run 15 tons a day. We will run 15 tons a day. I think most days are in the 11 tons to 12 tons per day range.

Kashy Harrison: Got it. Helpful. And then my follow-up question is, just thinking about just forward capacity. I think you talked about 39 tons per day of current capacity, current demand. I believe at 55, you're working on bringing Texas online, which is 45, so you'll have excess capacity once Texas comes online. Just given all the comments around, the slower market development than you anticipated, just wondering where you're envisioning sending those excess volumes to? Thank you.

Andy Marsh: Not exactly wanting to provide information about who we're competing against and where we're looking to provide it. What I would say is, we have a strong sales funnel and a strong sales team working those opportunities. There's big market already for liquid hydrogen. And we have opportunities for people who already buy liquid hydrogen at scale, who are very, very interested in buying scale out of Texas.

Sanjay Shrestha: Yeah. And Andy, maybe one more thing…

Andy Marsh: Yeah. Go ahead.

Sanjay Shrestha: Some of the players have decided they're exiting the green hydrogen space as we bring some of these other plants online. And demand for green hydrogen is a long-term in nature. So that I think puts us in a pretty good position as well. Just to reiterate, as Andy said, look, we even have some discussion with existing industrial gas customers to do swap arrangement.

Andy Marsh: Yeah.

Sanjay Shrestha: It's all about if you have a plant in California, if you have a demand in the east coast or in the southeast, right, then that's where you end up doing a lot of swaps. So look, we work very closely together with many of them and as Andy said, we feel pretty good about demand being there even as we bring our Texas plant online.

Kashy Harrison: Got it. Thank you.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Percoco with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.

Andrew Percoco: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Good morning, guys.

Andy Marsh: Good morning, Andrew.

Andrew Percoco: Good morning, Andy. Maybe just to start out, coming back to the DOE loan for a second, I think in the press release you guys cited $400 million of coverage from the DOE loan on $600 million of incremental investment. I mean, that implies about two-thirds coverage on an advance rate. I think you guys had previously talked about 80% advance rates on the DOE loan. So just curious what the delta is there and if there's been a change in maybe the advance rate assumptions that you're having on that facility.

Andy Marsh: Go ahead, Paul.

Paul Middleton: Yeah. There's no change. It's up to 80%. And the dynamics on each project will vary based on the size of the plant and other factors. And we also have some of that is a decent amount of contingency in those assumptions. And so, obviously with the learnings that we've had in Georgia and now Louisiana, we hope that feel like that we're in pretty good position that, we won't use all that. So that's the -- I guess the dynamic, Andrew, in terms of how it plays.

Andrew Percoco: Okay. That's helpful context. And maybe just sticking with CapEx for a second. You quote $250 million that you've already spent on the project, another $600 million that you need to spend gets you to about $850 million all in on a 45 ton per day plant. And if I just do that conversion, it implies like $19 million to $20 million of CapEx per ton per day of production, which I think is actually a little bit higher than Georgia. So just curious, can you just maybe walk through some of your assumptions there? I guess I would have thought it would be lower than Georgia just given some of the learnings that you guys have discussed.

So any color there would be helpful. Thank you.

Andy Marsh: I don't know if the math is right, but Georgia will come in around $800 million with contingency and the contingency is probably 10%, 15%. And so, there's built in contingency in that Texas number. So, overall, I think before the contingency, it'll come in around $700 million.

Andrew Percoco: Okay. Thank you.

Andy Marsh: Okay. Thanks, Andrew. And I think that's it for the day, Teal. Well, thank you everyone for joining the call. And look, we're making the tough decisions to make sure this business is successful long-term. We're laser focused on material handling and hydrogen to support it, which will really help us grow the market long-term. We're laser focused on electrolyzers and especially those applications which can be deployed rapidly. We're making some tough decisions to cut costs and make sure the company can achieve our EBITDA and gross margin goals. So thank you everyone for joining. I appreciate the time.

Reducing losses Despite the current government’s efforts, rising costs continue to dent the power sector’s sustainability.","The power sector’s high reserve margin, capacity payment obligations, and reliance on imported fossil fuels have weakened the Bangladesh Power Development Board’s (BPDB) financial strength. In a bid to urgently address the BPDB’s financial distress, the interim government, after assuming office in August 2024, undertook measures to reduce costs. Yet, the power sector registered a record revenue shortfall in fiscal year (FY) 2024–25, calling for long-term efforts to deliver results.

With the general election scheduled for 12 February 2026, the next government will be well placed to design and implement long-term reforms to steer the power sector towards sustainability while ensuring that the country’s economic growth trajectory remains intact. These reforms must include a rational power demand projection to avoid future overcapacity and associated capacity payments, greater reliance on grid power, reduced use of costly oil-fired power plants, increased renewable energy, and reduced transmission and distribution (T&D) losses.

Realistic demand assessment and power capacity expansion

Bangladesh’s power demand projection — relying on optimistic gross domestic product growth rates — has created several challenges. The power sector faces a high reserve margin, resulting in capacity payments for idle plants and a greater annual subsidy burden.

In FY2024–25, the power system’s reserve margin hovered around 61.3%, based on the maximum peak demand of 17,000 megawatts (MW) against an installed capacity of 27,414MW. While reserve margins typically rise with an increasing share of variable renewable energy (VRE), Bangladesh’s on-grid VRE share remains low. The power system’s reserve margin, excluding the VRE capacity of 762MW registered on 30 June 2025, stood at 56.8% in FY2024–25, substantiating its high surplus capacity. With power plants of a combined capacity of 6,756MW— excluding renewable energy — expected to come online before 2030, concerns remain about the persistently high reserve margin (*installed capacity recorded on 14 January 2026 was 28,909MW; derated capacity: 28,484MW). Accordingly, the next government should project a more rational power demand and refrain from adding new fossil fuel-based capacity to prudently manage the reserve margin, thereby reducing obligations for exorbitant capacity payments for fossil-fuel plants.

Enhancing electrification and modernising the grid

Bangladesh’s industries use gas for both boilers and captive power generation, avoiding significant dependence on grid power. It is a double whammy for the power sector — the surplus power capacity adds to capacity payments and BPDB’s revenue shortfall mounts.

On the other hand, with the deepening piped gas supply crisis, industries are turning to alternative fuels like compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). This increases their operational costs, raising business concerns. As CNG stations also face gas supply shortages, CNG is unlikely to fix the problem. Similarly, the recent LPG supply shortage poses a serious challenge to industries.

The next government should consider a two-pronged strategy for electrification to address the industrial energy crisis and the power sector’s concerns. It can encourage industries operating captive generators without waste heat recovery systems to shift to grid power. The cost of electricity produced in a captive power plant with 40% efficiency is about Bangladeshi Taka (BDT) 10.75/ kilowatt-hour (kWh), which is comparable to grid electricity tariffs (this cost is calculated based on a gas price of BDT40/m3 and operational expenses equal to 5% of fuel costs). Likewise, the government can push industries with inefficient gas boilers to switch to electric boilers, thereby driving demand for grid power. The additional electricity sales to high-paying industrial consumers will partially relieve the fiscal burden on the power sector. Higher power demand will also help the government increase the share of on-grid renewable energy.

The success of this electrification will hinge on transforming the national power grid to meet evolving demand and provide reliable electricity, requiring investment to make the grid flexible and modern.

Reducing losses

Despite the current government’s efforts, rising costs continue to dent the power sector’s sustainability. BPDB’s FY2024–25 annual report shows that the power sector’s year-on-year (YoY) expenses swelled by 13.94% as opposed to a 9% rise in sales revenue. The sector’s overall revenue shortfall soared to BDT556.6 billion (USD4.55 billion), marking an 18.3% YoY increase.

One of the key reasons behind the power sector’s dismal performance is its continued reliance on expensive oil-fired plants. Although the current government pledged to minimise the use of fuel oil in power generation, its share fell only marginally from 11.83% in FY2023–24 to 10.73% in FY2024–25. At the same time, power purchases from Independent Power Producers surged 25.61%while the contribution of BPDB’s economic plants declined. As a result, the government’s strategy fell short of delivering the intended results.

Likewise, the power sector’s T&D losses — after showing substantial improvement in recent years — increased marginally to 10.13% in FY2024–25 from 10.06% in the previous year.

The next government should take stock of these challenges and devise concrete strategies to operate economical plants, based on merit order dispatch, and limit T&D losses. In addition to raising the share of BPDB’s economic plants in total power generation, the government should aim to initially bring down the use of oil-fired plants to 5%, supported by renewable energy. With the integration of battery energy storage systems, it should try to limit the use of oil-fired plants. Likewise, the government should first contain T&D losses to the global average level (just less than 8%) and then strive to bring it further down to the average of the advanced economies (just over 6%).

Such interventions are financially compelling. For instance, reducing oil-fired power generation from 10.73% to 5% can help Bangladesh save BDT89.9 billion (USD0.73 billion), slashing the subsidy of BDT386.4 billion (USD3.2 billion) by 23.3%. This estimate is based on total power generation of 101,187 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in FY2024–25, an average oil-fired generation cost of ~BDT25/kWh (USD0.2/kWh) and a weighted average solar tariff of BDT9.5/kWh (USD0.078/kWh) from recently approved projects totalling 918MW. In addition, a 2% reduction in T&D losses could save the country BDT24.5 billion (USD0.2 billion), thus reducing the subsidy burden by 6.34% (average power generation cost of the grid: BDT12.1/kWh [USD0.1/kWh]).

The next government needs to strategically reboot Bangladesh’s power sector to address its persistent vulnerability, which would help contain fiscal pressures. Its efforts must focus on long-term reforms rather than quick fixes to gradually improve the sector’s sustainability.",https://ieefa.org/sites/default/files/2026-01/bangladesh-electricity.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 03:37:32.880941

The costs of electricity, heating fuels, and transportation fuels — along with the volatile and unpredictable nature of many of these costs — are straining budgets, especially for low- and moderate-income households that already spend a disproportionate share of their income on energy.

Fortunately, a variety of solutions can improve energy affordability. This hub brings together resources from RMI and other organizations that can help decision-makers understand the drivers of the affordability challenge and the tools available to address it across the electricity, buildings, and transportation sectors.

For the average American household, a little over half of energy expenditures go to gasoline, about a third to electricity, and the remainder to home heating fuels. Energy costs within those categories are shaped by multiple factors, including utility investments, fuel price volatility, inflation, housing and transportation patterns that lock in energy use, and the availability of cost-saving incentives and financing options. Understanding these drivers helps identify where interventions can be most effective.

RMI's Affordability Hub can be filtered by characteristics like sector, solution, and decision-maker to help users quickly find insights relevant to them.

A framework for solutions

Addressing residential energy affordability requires a portfolio of solutions that promote cost control, cost distribution, and customer agency:

Cost control: Avoiding unnecessary system cost growth through cost savings and cost efficiencies

Cost distribution: Allocating costs appropriately across the system and seeking alternative sources to pay for those costs

Customer agency: Providing households with choice, control, access, and predictability to manage their energy costs

Across these three solution sets, safeguards protect low- to moderate-income households from undue energy burden.

Dive Brief:

The PJM Interconnection’s board should reject a proposal from NextEra Energy and Exelon to build a $1.7-billion transmission line across central Pennsylvania, partly due to the uncertainty around data center demand forecasts, according to the Pennsylvania ratepayer advocate.

The project is part of PJM’s proposed $11.6-billion regional transmission expansion plan that is under review by the grid operator’s board. The RTEP aims to ensure a reliable grid in 2030 and is based on substantial demand growth from data centers contained in a forecast issued a year ago. A more recent forecast issued this month trimmed those expectations while still projecting growth.

“We believe that likely in-state generation buildouts or faster-to-deploy alternatives utilizing existing [right-of-ways] could solve the problems this line intends to address while imposing lower costs and providing higher benefits to Pennsylvania ratepayers,” the Office of Consumer Advocate, or OCA, said in a letter to PJM’s board on Wednesday.

Dive Insight:

PJM’s annual RTEP comes amid concerns about how data centers could make electricity more expensive for ratepayers.

In PJM, a region that covers all or part of 13 Mid-Atlantic and Midwest states and the District of Columbia, much of the focus has been on how rising capacity prices affect electric bills. The grid operator holds capacity auctions several years in advance to secure supply based on existing and projected loads, leading to price spikes that were heavily influenced by aggressive estimates of future demand.

In PJM’s last three capacity auctions, data centers accounted for $23.1 billion in costs — $21.5 billion of which were for projected data centers that were not online yet at the time of the auctions, the grid operator’s market monitor said in a Thursday presentation to the grid operator’s Members Committee.

As a result, the average cost of wholesale power in PJM jumped 49% in 2025 to $82.67/MWh, according to the presentation from Marketing Analytics. Energy accounted for 60% of that price, followed by transmission at 22% and capacity at 16%.

By comparison, in 2024, the average cost of wholesale power in PJM was $55.52/MWh, with energy accounting for 59%, transmission for 32% and capacity just 7%.

Capacity costs accounted for $13.09/MWh of the overall price of wholesale power last year, up about 260% from $3.61/MWh in 2024. Net transmission costs increased more modestly, from $17.73/MWh in 2024 to $18.53/MWh in 2025.

The Pennsylvania consumer advocate concluded that electric utility customers in that state are paying higher energy prices largely because of increased costs for bulk power grid services “driven by data center and artificial intelligence demand that is outstripping existing and forecasted supply, resulting in higher wholesale supply costs and expensive transmission grid expansion.”

The OCA’s concern centers on a 765-kV project proposed by NextEra and Exelon that would run about 221 miles from Marshall County, West Virginia, to Perry County, in central Pennsylvania. 765-kV is the highest voltage transmission line available and are not widely deployed in the U.S., but several major grid operators are building more.

Residential ratepayers across PJM would pay about $9 billion if the entire $11.6-billion regional transmission plan is approved as proposed, according to the office, which is led by Darryl Lawrence. The lead advocate is nominated by the state attorney general and confirmed by the state Senate.

PJM has said the line — called Project 237 — would help it reliably handle load growth in PPL Energy’s territory and the Mid-Atlantic region in general, according to its analysis. It would also help the grid cope with delays in offshore wind development and future generation retirements by expanding an existing 765-kV backbone into PJM’s eastern region, allowing for more flexibility in serving load, PJM staff said in the report.

But the ratepayer advocate said the approval of the NextEra-Exelon project is premature given “rapidly evolving circumstances around data center AI load, incomplete assumptions, and process concerns.”

Last week, PJM revised down its near-term load growth projections, and the Trump administration and PJM governors and PJM’s board have both called for a backstop or emergency auction to procure more power supplies — though the details of those proposals are unclear and would require regulatory approval.

The advocate said the impact of any changes on transmission needs and planning is uncertain, raising the risk of expensive new projects.

“Project 237 has the potential to become the ‘poster child’ for overbuilding new transmission infrastructure and failure to solve reliability needs with potentially less expensive generation options, storage, demand response and other innovative proposals,” the OCA said.

Previous transmission expansion plans by PJM have sparked conflict. The Maryland Office of People’s Counsel, for example, in 2024 challenged the cost allocation for PJM’s $5.1-billion 2022 Regional Transmission Expansion Plan Window 3.

In part, that plan was driven by data center development in northern Virginia. Under a cost allocation proposal approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, ratepayers in Virginia will pay about $2.5 billion, leaving utility customers in Maryland to pay $551 million and other PJM transmission owners paying about $2.1 billion, according to the Maryland OPC.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/7JyyXul1IiKyPW_LFURxDWO1etS86Q7c53S_dQMAhic/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTkxMDE2MTc3LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2026-01-23 01:37:52.487956

Joesting explained how building developments over marshes result in “coastal squeeze,” which refers to the loss of coastal wetlands as a result of rising sea levels and man-made barriers.","In November 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency announced a proposed rule that would leave millions of acres of the nation’s wetlands without federal protection. The EPA’s proposal spares roughly 80% of the nation’s protected wetlands for development, potentially putting water quality, coastal flood drainage and wildlife habitats at risk.

“Waters of the United States” Proposed Rule

“Waters of the United States” refers to the federal government’s jurisdiction over the nation’s waterways as outlined in the Clean Water Act (1972). The Clean Water Act grants the EPA and the United States Department of the Army the authority to define what “waters of the United States” are via regulation. The Clean Water Act also manages the amount of pollutants released into the United States’ waters and enforces quality standards for surface water. Under the Clean Water Act, industries must obtain a permit from the EPA before contaminating federal waterways.

The goals of the Clean Water Act were to eliminate the discharge of pollutants into the United States’ navigable waters by 1985 and to provide a level of water quality suitable for protecting marine life and wildlife by July 1, 1983.

Under the Trump administration, however, the goalpost has shifted to favor the interests of businesses, developers and farmers who have lobbied against the Clean Water Act’s regulations.

“No longer should America’s landowners be forced to spend precious money hiring an attorney or consultant just to tell them whether the Water of the United States is on their property. EPA is delivering on President Trump’s promise to finalize a revised definition for WOTUS that protects the nation’s navigable waters from pollution, advances cooperative federalism by empowering states, and will result in economic growth across the country,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

Wetlands are areas where water covers the land year-round or for a portion of the year. The new definition, as laid out by the EPA, would exclude streams that only flow for certain parts of the year, typically during “wet season.” It would also strip protection for rain-dependent or ephemeral streams, which flow after precipitation – especially following long periods of rain or hurricanes.

The rule was opened for a 45-day public comment period that ended on Jan. 5, 2026, and a final decision on whether or not to adopt the new proposed definition is expected this year.

Why are Wetlands Important to Coastal Georgia?

Heather Joesting, Ph.D, is a coastal plant ecologist and a professor at Georgia Southern University’s Armstrong Campus, who specializes in ecology and the nursery production of marsh grass.

Joesting emphasises the role of coastal Georgia’s wetlands in pollution attenuation, flood mitigation, juvenile fish habitats, carbon sequestration and biodiversity.

Joesting explained how building developments over marshes result in “coastal squeeze,” which refers to the loss of coastal wetlands as a result of rising sea levels and man-made barriers.

“When you put property in the marsh, the marsh has nowhere to go,” said Joesting. “That can impact the persistence of the marsh and sea level rise.”

“We also often change the hydrology of things when we build, so you change the way creeks divert, or you add more water in. A lot of the water from Savannah kind of drains down into the marsh. So just having coastal communities near the marsh will contribute to pollution,” said Joesting.

Industries and construction create disruption to fragile ecosystems in coastal Georgia, resulting in flooding in residential areas and home damage. According to a recent study published in Nature Communications, extreme coastal flooding is projected to more than double by 2050 due to greenhouse gas production and contamination. Socially marginalised groups of people are likely to be impacted the most.

The Solution: Advocate for Coastal Communities

Because of the drastic impacts that coastal flooding and pollution have on homes and residents, it is important to recognise how environmental justice aligns with human rights.

There are a few things that can be done on a group and individual level to advocate for the protection of coastal wetlands:

Education: Many publications, such as Grist and, more locally, The Current, use science-based data to consistently report on environmental research and policy. However, simply talking to professors or establishing a general understanding of the importance of ecology will allow you to be better informed about your environment.

Support environmental protection organizations: volunteering or donating towards organizations such as 100 Miles, Friends of the Everglades or Point Blue Conservation Science is a practical way to support the cause of protecting local wetlands. Many non-profits also provide information regarding legislative action and host online petitions or on-site protests.

Be an active voter: Perhaps most importantly, vote! Research candidates who align with the values regarding the environment that you believe in and vote in your state and local elections.",https://thegeorgeanne.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC3043.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 00:37:28.641161

Since the Industrial Revolution, human activity, like urbanization and the burning of fossil fuels, has been the main driver of greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to rapid global warming.

It’s imperative to increase our understanding of climate change while creating paths to progress and hope. Achieving measurable change is dependent on students overcoming environmental pessimism. Students can be hopeful about their role in protecting Earth’s future because of environmental science education and sustainability initiatives.

A survey on climate anxiety collected the responses of 10,000 people ages 16 to 25 years old from 10 countries, including the United States. Researchers found that 75% of young respondents think the future is frightening, 59% were very or extremely worried about climate change and over 50% report feeling sad, angry and powerless.

“There’s a thought (that) the environment (is) so big, and it’s obviously so beyond us,” said Greg Anderson, assistant professor in the Department of American Studies with an expertise in urban studies and community development.

The threat of environmental degradation is overwhelming, and its emotional toll inclines young people to doubt and disengage from sustainability efforts.

“We’ve got to wake up, pay attention (and) get involved,” Anderson said.

One step towards recognizing how students can positively impact the environment is through education. Replacing pessimistic attitudes with a hopeful outlook also means being able to identify credible climate solutions.

“If there’s a critical enough mass of people (with) optimism, (then) that’s the only way that there could be a good outcome,” said Jay Banner. “The data shows (that if) we undergo a much lower trajectory for carbon emissions then we’re presently (at), the outcomes will be better.”

Banner is a professor in the Jackson School of Geosciences, director of the Environmental Science Institute and co-teaches the signature course, Sustaining a Planet. The course provides an interdisciplinary overview of environmental science while preparing students to evaluate how diverse occupations can contribute to climate mitigation.

“If you care about the future of the planet and our environment … then you could be a part of it without having it be your major or fully your career,” said Banner. “Wherever you’re headed in life, sustainability can matter to you.”

On an individual level, it has been something she’s been able to easily blend into her day-to-day life by visiting a local farm and briefly going vegetarian to reduce her carbon footprint and methane emissions.

“The class is honest. I think we have to be honest with ourselves,” Wilkey said. “Pessimism can only get us so far. If we think too much that there’s nothing we can do, then we won’t do anything,” said Wilkey.

Students may not realize the direct contributions they can make towards mending environmental issues unless they learn how these processes work and how to get involved. UT offers many environmental awareness student initiatives such as The Green Fund, a competitive grant program funded through tuition allocation, where students from any major can propose sustainability-related projects and research.

From widespread student engagement, there’s hope for a positive shift toward environmentally-conscious living. However, if we resign to environmental pessimism, we also give up on any chance of sustaining our communities and planet for future generations. Once we incorporate environmental science education and sustainability initiatives into our everyday practices, we can recognize students’ potential to overcome despair with action.",https://thedailytexan.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/11102025-AnushkaDeshmukh-Environmental-Pessimism-WEB.png,N,,2026-01-22 23:38:35.133968

North Texas is in the middle of a manufacturing comeback, and clean energy is a big reason why.

A massive solar panel factory in Wilmer is already producing 20,000 panels a day and employing more than 1,200 workers.

The company behind it, T1 Energy, is investing $1 billion in Texas as part of a broader push to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.

This isn’t just one project. Battery storage manufacturers, solar suppliers, and advanced energy companies are clustering across North Texas,

Washington, D.C. — Today, seven environmental and consumer advocacy groups filed rehearing requests after Donald Trump’s Department of Energy unlawfully invoked Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act and forced two coal power plants in Indiana to stay online after their planned retirements. The seven groups include Sierra Club, Environmental Law and Policy Center, and Earthjustice representing Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, Just Transition Northwest Indiana, Hoosier Environmental Council, and Public Citizen.

In December 2025, Donald Trump’s Department of Energy forced the last coal units at the R.M. Schahfer power plant—operating since 1976—and one of the coal units at the F.B. Culley generating station—built in 1966—to stay online days before their planned retirements. This is part of Donald Trump’s attempt to bolster the flailing coal industry at the expense of everyday customers.

The unlawful action is expected to be very expensive. For instance, operating Schahfer beyond 2025 would require more than one billion dollars in expenditures, according to a 2024 analysis from the plant owner. Culley Unit 2’s owner considers it “among the most inefficient units within the State” and among “the smallest and more expensive coal units in the MISO stack,” also figuring that an additional $70 million in expenditures are needed to keep operating.

Aside from the expenditures to rehabilitate the broken and outmoded plants, both power plants are expected to lose millions of dollars in the market, as their coal and other operating costs exceed the revenues they can earn. The plants’ owners are trying to pass down these costs to customers in Indiana and ten other states, and environmental and consumer advocacy groups are pushing back. Sierra Club’s ‘Burning Money’ tracker estimates the daily total amount that 202(c) orders are costing customers across the country. In 2025, electricity prices rose by 6.7 percent.

The Sierra Club and Earthjustice have also challenged similar orders in Washington, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Colorado’s Craig power plant also received an unlawful extension order for which challenges are due next week.

“At a time when Americans are already struggling with skyrocketing utility bills and growing grocery costs, Donald Trump and his administration are exacerbating the affordability crisis by extending the life of old, retiring coal plants, further driving up costs for everyday Americans,” said Sierra Club Senior Attorney Tony Mendoza. “We are challenging this sham ‘emergency order’ because we believe that hardworking families should not have to hand over their hard-earned money to coal executives at the order of Donald Trump. We will continue to push back against this illegal attempt to prop up these expensive, polluting coal plants.”

“American families are struggling with record high utility bills in Trump’s inflation economy, because his atrocious energy policies force working families to bail out expensive coal power plants,” said Tyson Slocum, Energy Program Director for Public Citizen. “Trump explicitly and repeatedly promised to cut Americans’ energy bills during the campaign, even writing in a Newsweek op-ed on October 1, 2024 that as President he would ‘cut energy and electricity prices in half within 12 months—not just for businesses but for all Americans and their families.’ Trump’s costly coal bailouts have ensured his campaign promise is a lie”.

“The federal government has invented a grid reliability crisis in a transparent and illegal attempt to commandeer uneconomic, dilapidated power plants, force them to operate, and stick us with the bill.” said Ben Inskeep, Program Director at Citizens Action Coalition. “We are fighting back against the federal government’s unprecedented overreach that will cause our utility bills to soar and choke Hoosier communities with more toxic pollution from coal.”

“This is a needless, last-ditch effort to resuscitate a dying industry to power the AI boom,” said Ashley Williams, Executive Director of Just Transition Northwest Indiana. “Our communities are organizing and confronting the Trump administration’s shameful actions. This order will have irreversible consequences, locking in generations more of climate-devastating pollution and toxic coal ash waste contaminating the waterways of Jasper County and beyond. It exacerbates an affordability crisis where families are sacrificing their basic needs to pay escalating utility bills, a reality Hoosiers know all too well.”

“Cleaner power sources are available and Schahfer and Culley were ready to stop burning coal, so the federal order for them to continue burning coal is an unwarranted extension of coal and coal ash pollution in Indiana,” said Indra Frank, Coal Ash Advisor at Hoosier Environmental Council.

“Once again, President Trump’s Department of Energy is attempting to force Midwest residential and business consumers to pay higher electricity bills to keep coal plants running that are no longer needed and not economically viable,” said Howard Learner, Executive Director & CEO, Environmental Law & Policy Center. “The utilities already made the right financial call to retire these plants. The Trump DOE is making a bad situation worse when it comes to energy affordability problems that hit peoples’ wallets hard, while adding more pollution that harms public health.”

“Our nation’s careful balance between the States and the federal government for regulating electricity worked here. The owners of these power plants decided years ago that the plants are too old, unreliable, dirty, and expensive to continue kicking the can down the road with more upgrades to keep them going. Instead, they resolved to replace the coal plants with resources that better meet their customers’ needs, and they followed through,” said Sameer Doshi, Senior Attorney at Earthjustice. “State regulators and the federally-regulated transmission grid operator all looked at these plans and saw no problem. The Department of Energy hasn’t remotely shown any emergency in the power system that would support upending these plans.”

The so-called ‘emergency order’ has historically only been invoked during extreme weather conditions or wartime. As a part of the rehearing request, Sierra Club, ELPC, and Earthjustice argue that the DOE failed to provide sufficient evidence of any emergency or electricity shortage in the region warranting the order to keep Schahfer and Culley open.

Customers residing in Indiana are already slated to foot the bill for the J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan, which received a similar sham ‘emergency order’ in May 2025 and has been receiving repeat orders since (now totaling three orders). The Campbell plant cost an extra $615,000 per day to remain online during the first four months of the DOE’s emergency orders.

Essentially, like a flow battery, which stores energy in liquid electrolyte tanks separate to the battery’s power stack, the Noon fuel cell battery allows for decoupling of power and energy.
This is what the company claims will make the battery suitable for multi-day applications.
Noon Energy representatives have been seen making teaser presentations and participating in panel discussions at various global trade shows, including RE+ in the US, for some time.
Although it hasn’t yet publicly disclosed specifically what materials are used to make it, besides that the storage media is carbon-based, Noon Energy claims it overall uses only around 1% of critical elements compared with lithium-ion batteries.","While it did not provide many technical details of the project in its release, such as the system’s power output capacity, the company claimed it is capable of 200 hours of discharge at maximum output.

Noon claims that its long discharge duration enables 100% reliable uninterrupted energy supply, while the company claims the battery’s compact design has between 20 and 200 times smaller footprint than other LDES technologies, citing the examples of flow batteries and pumped hydro energy storage (PHES).

The company’s website explains that three key components work together inside the battery:

A power block: based on reversible solid oxide fuel cell technology, which converts electricity into stored energy

Charge tank: this converts electricity into a carbon-based storage medium, releasing oxygen to air as it does so.

Discharge tank: this draws oxygen from air to convert stored energy back into electricity. Noon claims it does this cleanly and efficiently, and the materials used to make it are abundant.

Essentially, like a flow battery, which stores energy in liquid electrolyte tanks separate to the battery’s power stack, the Noon fuel cell battery allows for decoupling of power and energy.

This is what the company claims will make the battery suitable for multi-day applications. Power can be increased by adding more power blocks, while duration can be increased by increasing tank size.

Noon Energy representatives have been seen making teaser presentations and participating in panel discussions at various global trade shows, including RE+ in the US, for some time.

Although it has already broken out of stealth mode, this appears to be the first time it has publicly revealed details of its battery technology. Although it hasn’t yet publicly disclosed specifically what materials are used to make it, besides that the storage media is carbon-based, Noon Energy claims it overall uses only around 1% of critical elements compared with lithium-ion batteries.

Noon Energy co-founder and CEO Chris Graves said the company has built “an even larger, commercial-scale system, being commissioned soon with more details to come,” and claimed Noon’s customer pipeline includes hyperscalers and other industrial load growth, for which its technology can enable “low-cost, clean firm power.”

Noon Energy’s trajectory and addressable market targeting are somewhat comparable to those of another US startup, Form Energy, albeit Noon is still at a much earlier stage in both funding and scaling of production and deployment.

Founded by former Tesla executive Mateo Jaramillo, Form Energy has developed an iron-air battery that is also claimed to be suitable for 100-hour+ multi-day storage applications and built using abundant materials, with the first pilot underway with a utility in Minnesota and others in the works elsewhere in the US; a factory is also under construction in West Virginia.

Today, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency recommitted to a previously stated goal to end testing on dogs, rats, mice, rabbits and other mammals by 2035. This move has the potential to replace tests on tens of thousands of animals with non-animal methods that are better for both humans and animals.

Dogs, rabbits, guinea pigs, rats and other animals continue to undergo painful and outdated tests required or requested by the EPA for assessing the safety of pesticides and chemicals every year. Increasingly, these tests are being replaced by methods that are faster, more accurate and often cheaper than the animal experiments that researchers have relied on for decades. But it’s not happening fast enough, and that’s why we welcome the agency’s announcement.

The EPA first embraced the 2035 deadline in 2019, but subsequent agency leaders during the Biden administration pulled back from that promise. We are heartened that the current EPA has now set a firm goal and timeline to phase out animal testing on mammals. It means we stand on the threshold of a new era in the struggle to make this world a better one for animals.

Even as we acknowledge the agency’s promise to do more, we’re calling on the EPA to move swiftly to end animal testing for chemicals and pesticides that it regulates.

We are also urging the agency to immediately prioritize the elimination of the 90-day pesticide test on dogs which involves forcing at least 32 dogs to ingest pesticides every day for 90 days, then killing them if they have not already died from the toxic effects of the substances (this follows our work years ago to successfully eliminate the one-year pesticide test on dogs). In 2023, we published a peer-reviewed scientific paper demonstrating that, in nearly all cases, the 90-day dog test provides no added value in determining pesticide risks to humans.

Tell the EPA: End tests on dogs and other animals as quickly as possible!

At today’s event announcing the recommitment, Sara spoke about how the call to eliminate animal tests has been part of our larger call for compassion to animals since our founding, and it continues to be a priority.

Nearly 30 years ago we negotiated a critical agreement with EPA for its High Production Volume Chemical Program, which relied heavily on animal testing. In collaboration with partners in animal protection and the chemical industry, we secured a significant agency reduction in the required animal testing, commitments to new non-animal methods and the first dedicated funding for development of non-animal methods. We have worked on similar reforms for another EPA-led initiative, the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program.

In 2007, we played a vital role in shaping the conclusions and recommendations of “Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century: A Vision and a Strategy,” a National Research Council report that called for a paradigm shift in toxicology, one that moved from traditional, animal-based testing to approaches relying on human cells, high-throughput screening and computational models instead of animals.

In 2016, we helped to secure the first U.S. statutory language calling for new animal testing to be a ""last resort."" With the reauthorization of the Toxic Substances Control Act, named the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, this was a true milestone in the campaign to end animal testing.

Other U.S. government agencies are also on board with replacing animal tests with sophisticated non-animal methods. The EPA commitment comes on the heels of similar announcements from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health in 2025. With so much work on this issue taking place across the U.S. government we encourage the EPA, NIH and the FDA to join with other federal agencies in an interagency taskforce to maximize resources in a concentrated initiative to end new animal testing.

Our goal is to end animal cruelty, and to achieve this vision, we have have never shied away from the most challenging tasks. Transforming a system and a bureaucracy built on outdated animal testing methods takes persistence and collaboration. We’re eager to work with EPA officials and animal protection partners to ensure that animal tests are phased out as quickly as possible.

The cancellation of the solar projects comes a month after the administration of Puerto Rico Gov.","SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has canceled solar projects in Puerto Rico worth millions of dollars, as the island struggles with chronic power outages and a crumbling electric grid.

The projects were aimed at helping 30,000 low-income families in rural areas across the U.S. territory as part of a now-fading transition toward renewable energy.

In an email obtained by The Associated Press, the U.S. Energy Department said that a push under Puerto Rico’s former governor for a 100% renewable future threatened the reliability of its energy system.

“The Puerto Rico grid cannot afford to run on more distributed solar power,” the message states. “The rapid, widespread deployment of rooftop solar has created fluctuations in Puerto Rico’s grid, leading to unacceptable instability and fragility.”

Javier Rúa Jovet, public policy director for Puerto Rico’s Solar and Energy Storage Association, disputed that statement in a phone interview Thursday.

He said that some 200,000 families across Puerto Rico rely on solar power that generates close to 1.4 gigawatts of energy a day for the rest of the island.

“That’s helping avoid blackouts,” he said, adding that the inverters of those systems also help regulate fluctuations across the grid.

He said he was saddened by the cancellation of the solar projects. “It’s a tragedy, honestly,” he said. “These are funds for the most needy.”

Earlier this month, the Energy Department canceled three programs, including one worth $400 million, that would have seen solar and battery storage systems installed in low-income homes and those with medical needs.

In its email, the department said that on Jan. 9, it would reallocate up to $350 million from private distributed solar systems to support fixes to improve the generation of power in Puerto Rico. It wasn’t immediately clear if that funding has been allocated.

One of those programs would have financed solar projects for 150 low-income households on the tiny Puerto Rican island of Culebra.

“The people are really upset and angry,” said Dan Whittle, an associate vice president with the Environmental Defense Fund, which was overseeing that project. “They’re seeing other people keep the lights on during these power outages, and they’re not sure why they’re not included.”

He noted that a privately funded project helped install solar panels and batteries on 45 homes a week before Hurricane Fiona hit Puerto Rico in September 2022.

Whittle said he was baffled by the federal government’s decision.

“They are buying hook, line and sinker that solar is the problem. It could not be more wrong,” he said.

The solar projects were part of an initial $1 billion fund created by U.S. Congress in 2022 under former President Joe Biden to help boost energy resilience in Puerto Rico, which is still trying to recover from Hurricane Maria.

The Category 4 storm slammed into the island in September 2017, razing an electric grid already weakened by a lack of maintenance and investment. Outages have persisted since then, with massive blackouts hitting on New Year’s Eve in 2024 and during Holy Week last year.

In recent years, residents and businesses that could afford to do so have embraced solar energy on an island of 3.2 million people with a more than 40% poverty rate.

But more than 60% of energy on the island is still generated by petroleum-fired power plants, 24% by natural gas, 8% by coal and 7% by renewables, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The cancellation of the solar projects comes a month after the administration of Puerto Rico Gov. Jenniffer González sued Luma Energy, a private company overseeing the transmission and distribution of power on the island.

At the time, González said that the electrical system “has not improved with the speed, consistency or effectiveness that Puerto Rico deserves.”

The fragility of Puerto Rico’s energy system is further exacerbated by a struggle to restructure a more than $9 billion debt held by the island’s Electric Power Authority, which has failed to reach an agreement with creditors.",https://fox4kc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2020/01/favicon.png?strip=1,N,,2026-01-22 21:57:25.614639

The changes by the Office of Energy Dominance Financing, or EDF, come after a review of $104 billion in loans made during the Biden administration with the majority of that coming after the 2024 presidential election. The office was known then as the Loan Programs Office.

The Trump administration has canceled or is in the process of terminating nearly $30 billion in loan obligations, the department said. The cancellations include, for example, one from last year of $4.9 billion for the Grain Belt Express transmission project to send power from wind and solar energy projects to cities in the Midwest and East.

The Trump administration has eliminated about $9.5 billion in loans to wind and solar projects and where possible has replaced those by supporting new capacity at natural gas and nuclear power plants, the department said.

The department is also revising another $53.6 billion in loans.

The 2025 tax law provided the office with billions in new lending authorities, and the EDF is the world's largest energy lender with nearly $290 billion in available lending, according to the department.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in November the biggest use of the remaining loans will go to boost nuclear power. The department said priorities will include coal, oil, and gas, and projects on critical minerals, geothermal, the power grid and manufacturing and transportation.

Looking forward, Governor Healey is focused on strengthening Massachusetts’ foundations – research and science, defense technology, quantum and AI partnerships, climatetech.
Governor Healey also took action last year to cut 25 percent of state regulations to save businesses time and money.","Boston — In her third State of the Commonwealth address, Governor Maura Healey set a new goal of registering 100,000 new apprentices in 10 years in fields such as construction, health care, tech, advanced manufacturing and education. In just over two years, the Healey-Driscoll Administration has registered 10,000 apprentices, delivering technical and on-the-job training in key industries, opening the door to a family-sustaining career while also ensuring the state has a well-trained workforce to meet the needs of employers.

“We are opening the doors to these jobs through apprenticeships,” said Governor Healey. “This is paid, hands-on training and a direct path to a great career. Thanks, by the way, to the Labor Movement, for creating this. We’re investing in it. Over the next 10 years, we’re going to have 100,000 apprentices. They are in the Building Trades – and also in nursing, early ed, technology – wherever talent is needed. We’ll get more people into great careers – and a workforce that meets the needs of our businesses.”

The Healey-Driscoll Administration is committed to expanding apprenticeship, investing nearly $14 million since January 2023 to train and place apprentices and pre-apprentices in the construction and building trades in Massachusetts and expanded industries. Additionally, Massachusetts was awarded $6 million from US Department of Labor to support Registered Apprenticeship and early childhood educator apprenticeships.

Recently, the administration lowered the annual program fee for Registered Apprenticeship sponsors from $300 to $250 and expanded eligibility for the Registered Apprenticeship Tax Credit (RATC) to include occupations featuring AI-related credentials, defense manufacturing, and additional manufacturing occupations. The Registered Apprentice Tax Credit supports the growth of registered apprenticeships in key Massachusetts industries, offering employers a refundable tax credit of up to $4,800 per qualified apprentice. Employers use the tax credit to hire apprentices in growing industries like clean energy, health care, and education.

Major companies – like Hasbro, Lego, Transmedics, Alnylam – continue to choose Massachusetts to grow their businesses because of the state’s top-rated health care, schools and universities, the best research ecosystem in the world, and unmatched talent. Looking forward, Governor Healey is focused on strengthening Massachusetts’ foundations – research and science, defense technology, quantum and AI partnerships, climatetech. By fueling up job-creating engines like construction sites, classrooms, small businesses, everyone in Massachusetts will benefit. Governor Healey also took action last year to cut 25 percent of state regulations to save businesses time and money.

Register here.

Last year marked a widening divide in global climate action: clean energy generation soared and EVs sales broke records, while the United States backpedaled on climate action and global development aid decreased. Sharply contrasting narratives are emerging around the economic transition — between the governments, businesses and communities who view it as essential to security and prosperity, and those who fear it may hinder economic progress.

Against this backdrop, Ani will explore three common concerns at the heart of the debate:

Growth: How the transition to a clean economy can drive global competitiveness and innovation, and which countries are pulling ahead or falling behind.

Affordability: How climate impacts and policy choices will shape the price of everyday life — from energy to housing.

Jobs: How countries and companies can equip workers with the skills needed for a changing global economy.

The briefing will also touch on trade and industry, rising energy demand, and the impact of AI on jobs and skills.

Each story combines insights from WRI experts across the globe with on-the-ground videos showing people and solutions in action — from Nairobi (Kenya) to Mumbai (India), to Porto Alegre (Brasil).

The “Maui Method” safely turns dangerous, damaged lithium-ion batteries into nonhazardous waste by fully discharging them in brine, destroying their structure and eliminating safety hazards before transport or disposal.
Over approximately five weeks, crews stabilized, decommissioned, destroyed and containerized 13 tons of batteries using the “Maui Method.” Now, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recommends the “Maui Method” as the preferred approach for lithium-ion battery disposal.
“The ‘Maui Method’ shows what is possible when innovation, collaboration and expertise come together,” MEMA Administrator Amos Lonokailua-Hewett said.
The heart of the “Maui Method” is brining, or submerging batteries in a saltwater solution.","Unlike traditional methods of electric and hybrid vehicle battery disposal, which try to manage and contain energy, a new “Maui Method” developed by the County of Maui eliminates the risk altogether.

A full documentary video of the approach is now available on the Maui Emergency Management Agency’s (MEMA) YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@MauiEmergencyManagementAgency.

The “Maui Method” safely turns dangerous, damaged lithium-ion batteries into nonhazardous waste by fully discharging them in brine, destroying their structure and eliminating safety hazards before transport or disposal. The process prevents fires before they start, enables shipping, works at scale and fills a national gap.

It was tested toward the end of last year during MEMA’s Wildfire Risk Reduction project in Ukumehame. Over approximately five weeks, crews stabilized, decommissioned, destroyed and containerized 13 tons of batteries using the “Maui Method.”

Now, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recommends the “Maui Method” as the preferred approach for lithium-ion battery disposal.

“The ‘Maui Method’ shows what is possible when innovation, collaboration and expertise come together,” MEMA Administrator Amos Lonokailua-Hewett said. “Considered one of the first full-scale, nondisaster initiatives of its kind, this operation sets a national and even global precedent for safe and effective EV battery management while protecting our community and environment.”

“Up till about this point, there really hasn’t been any good way of disposing of lithium-ion batteries. A lot of them are going into people’s trash cans and ending up in landfills and causing tons of fires, burning up garbage trucks all over the place and causing millions of dollars of damage for local entities,” said Justin Marquez of EPA’s National Lithium-Ion Battery Task Force. “Our ultimate goal is for this ‘Maui Method,’ or some version of it that accomplishes the same goals, to be rolled out across the entire nation and even potentially globally.”

Lithium-ion batteries — especially from electric and hybrid vehicles — become extremely dangerous when damaged:

They can enter thermal runaway (self-heating that leads to fire or explosion)

Fires cannot be put out reliably with water or foam

They emit toxic gases

If one battery ignites, it can set off others nearby

Shipping intact, damaged batteries (especially by sea) is catastrophic if they ignite

The “Maui Method” was developed in response to the 2023 Lahaina fire, which scattered, buried or altered thousands of damaged EV batteries. The Valley Isle has no battery disposal facility, and shippers refused to transport the batteries citing safety risks. The approach was created to neutralize the batteries before transport, turning them into nonhazardous waste. Later, the method was deployed during the Los Angeles wildfires.

The heart of the “Maui Method” is brining, or submerging batteries in a saltwater solution. Saltwater is conductive, so it slowly and safely pulls remaining energy out of the battery, rather than letting it release all at once as heat or fire.

Led by the County of Maui, the Ukumehame project involving 13 tons of batteries followed strict safety protocols, including 24/7 security, continuous air monitoring and a dedicated on-site emergency response team. All work in November and December 2025 was conducted under the direct oversight of the Hawaiʻi Department of Health, with technical guidance from the EPA.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64ef8c0e63e7fc34d03ae32b/673d4053e35caa8a370eba2b_Maui%20County%20LOGO.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 18:58:30.636291

However, tens of billions of dollars in investments were blocked last year due opposition at the local level, according to Data Center Watch.","Dozens of Silicon Valley giants, utility providers and other companies stand to earn a fortune from the nation’s artificial intelligence boom.

And according to new lobbying disclosures reviewed by NOTUS, these special interests together spent big money late last year to score favorable treatment from federal lawmakers and regulators on what’s fast becoming a central issue of the 2026 midterm elections: the proliferation of data centers that undergird AI’s existence.

Energy demand from data centers has increased in recent years, leading to soaring prices and increasing threats of blackouts. Energy experts have raised doubts about whether the nation’s power grid can withstand data center demand — particularly as President Donald Trump attempts to stymie renewable energy development and generation.

Hand-wringing over the proliferation of data centers — which has played a huge role in recent U.S. economic growth — has already hit Congress. Members of both parties are now publicly weighing the economic benefits of the construction boom against the risks to the power grid and costs to energy consumers, with some on the left calling for at least temporary limits on data center construction.

Edison Electric Institute was one of the nation’s biggest lobbying spenders last quarter. The investor-owned association of electric companies poured $2.33 million into its lobbying efforts in an attempt to influence “data center issues generally,” among other issues.

“EEI engages with policymakers to advance policies that support responsible data center development, protect everyday Americans from cost shifts and strengthen the grid for American families and businesses,” Jeremy Ortiz, an Edison Electric Institute spokesperson, wrote to NOTUS.

American Electric Power, a large investor-owned utility in the Midwest, spent $360,000 during the fourth quarter of 2025 to lobby Congress, the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, partly on data center matters.

“As one of America’s largest energy companies, policymakers often ask AEP for our perspective on how large customers of all types, including data centers, impact the energy grid,” Scott Blake, a spokesperson for AEP, wrote to NOTUS in a statement.

Exelon Business Services, a subsidiary of the utility company Exelon, spent $460,000 last quarter lobbying on energy policy, including “resource adequacy, reliability, and data center load growth matters,” according to its disclosure.

A spokesperson for Exelon did not answer questions from NOTUS about those issues and whom Exelon lobbied in Congress.

“Exelon continuously advocates for solutions that will ensure reliable energy delivery for our customers while also keeping bills as low as possible,” the spokesperson said.

Utility companies from across the country — including Portland General Electric and Puget Sound Energy in the Pacific Northwest, WEC Energy Group in the Midwest, CMS Energy in Michigan, FirstEnergy in Ohio, Dominion Energy in Virginia and more — also reported lobbying specifically on data center issues.

The Data Center Coalition, which did not immediately respond for comment, spent more than $500,000 on federal-level lobbying last quarter, including $50,000 specifically on data-center-related lobbying according to federal disclosures.

The group, which represents companies leading data center expansion like Google and Microsoft, targeted Trump as well as the Department of Energy and the Office of Management and Budget, which enforces how federal agencies use artificial intelligence.

Several other organizations also lobbied the Trump administration directly.

Nebius Group, an AI infrastructure company, hired the lobbying firm BGR Group to lobby the White House on data center policy.

In response to an email from NOTUS asking how the administration’s conversations with lobbyists have influenced its thoughts and policymaking direction on data centers, White House spokesperson Liz Huston said in a statement that “President Trump makes decisions based solely on what’s best for the country, which is why America is the hottest country in the world right now.”

Other tech giants spent millions of dollars last quarter to influence Congress, where there are growing bipartisan concerns about Trump’s AI agenda.

Amazon disclosed more than $4 million in lobbying last quarter alone. The company indicated that its team of lobbyists pressed lawmakers and Trump administration officials on issues that include “data centers,” “grid modernization” and “energy production,” among other legislative and policy priorities.

Oracle, whose co-founder Larry Ellison has close ties to Trump, disclosed more than $2 million in fourth-quarter lobbying spending to in part influence policy involving “power generation for Artificial Intelligence data centers.”

OpenAI, one of the world’s leading AI labs, disclosed more than $1 million last quarter to influence policy areas such as “data centers and small business competitiveness” and “cloud computing and infrastructure,” according to lobbying disclosure forms. Sam Altman, OpenAI’s CEO, has also fostered a close relationship with the Trump administration, including donating $1 million to Trump’s inauguration.

Google is somewhat of an exception. Data centers are only mentioned once in Google Client Services’ $3.4 million lobbying disclosure filing, with a focus on “foreign data centers” specifically. The company also lobbied on electricity grid issues.

Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle and OpenAI did not comment on the record for this story.

Also driving significant lobbying activity were a handful of companies that do not power or own data centers but nevertheless stand to benefit from AI-driven data center expansion.

Ecolab, a company that offers data center cooling and other water-use-related services, spent more than $400,000 lobbying Congress and federal agencies on “discussions related to data center water efficiency and energy efficiency.”

Siemens, which offers a host of data-center-related services such as automation and fire safety, spent almost $1 million overall on federal lobbying during the fourth quarter.

Bloom Energy, which spent a total of $330,000 in the last quarter of 2025, is ascendant in the data center industry. The company sells fuel cells, a rapidly proliferating technology that converts natural gas into electricity with little to no carbon-dioxide-producing combustion. Earlier this month, grid operator AEP renewed its purchase agreement for Bloom Energy fuel cells, raising the total value of the deal to $2.65 billion.

Bloom Energy’s lobbying disclosures indicated it lobbied Congress and the Executive Office of the President late last year on “issues related to addressing energy delivery challenges associated with demand for data centers and AI Infrastructure.”Electricity prices have increased in parts of the country with growing energy demands from data centers, connecting this issue to affordability, a central talking point in the lead-up to the 2026 midterms.

The Trump administration has sought to address some of these concerns, including in a bipartisan agreement announced this month directing power grid operator PJM Interconnection to force data centers to foot their own energy costs.

Democrats, for their part, have criticized Republicans for not moving quickly enough while placating monied corporate interests. They’ve made “affordability” a watchword in their efforts to win back the House and Senate, particularly when it comes to utility prices.

As affordability remains at the forefront of voter concerns, data centers have become a target, with new candidates and longtime lawmakers from both parties raising concerns about the unrestricted growth of these facilities.

Late last year, independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, a progressive, called for a pause on all data center construction citing energy cost as one of the main reasons.

“Data centers and artificial intelligence are issues that the American people are extremely concerned about and I think are not happy with inactivity here in this Congress,” Sanders told NOTUS. “Electricity bills are soaring as a result of data centers, but on top of that, I think we are not prepared as a nation to deal with the transformational changes that AI is going to bring.” Supporters of the AI industry, such as Republican Rep. Jay Obernolte, are trying to walk the line between ensuring power for data centers while trying to protect constituents.

“We’re very concerned about the energy needs and the energy usages of data centers,” Obernolte, who sits at the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, told NOTUS. “I want to make sure they get the energy that they need. We also want to make sure that they don’t affect availability for other people or pricing, especially for consumers.”

All the while, the AI boom keeps booming, with Google, Oracle, OpenAI and Amazon pledging billions of dollars to build massive data centers necessary to develop AI models. These investments have also created a new civic and political opposition to the unregulated building of these facilities as utility costs have skyrocketed in some parts of the country.

Technology giants are projected to spend $7 trillion in new data centers by 2030 to satisfy the demand for more computer processing power. However, tens of billions of dollars in investments were blocked last year due opposition at the local level, according to Data Center Watch.",https://static.notus.org/dims4/default/8eea8ab/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3557x2001+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-aji.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb4%2F03%2F14f4a6c04619a60fb0aa325e48ec%2Fdonaldtrumpai.jpeg,N,,2026-01-22 23:57:15.948681

“The process for reviewing new chemicals – which was a significant focus of the 2016 effort – is broken. This regulatory uncertainty makes it difficult for the chemical industry to bring safer alternatives or new technology to the market in the U.S. and impacts human health and the environment by slowing the transition to safer alternatives,” said Chairman Palmer. “The bill would reauthorize the fee provision for another 10 years and require increased transparency and accountability in how fees are used by EPA.”

Watch the full hearing here.

Below are key excerpts from today’s hearing:

Congressman John Joyce, M.D. (PA-13): “Dr. White, we've had this discussion and my colleagues have opened the door, but I want to give you an opportunity to speak to how provisions in this legislative proposal today will guide EPA to focus their consideration on conditions that reasonably could be foreseen, and not just theoretical or even unlikely, because I think we're opening up potential areas that will waste time to be able to allow important chemicals to be assessed. Can you discuss that for us, please?” Dr. White: “For every single chemical that the EPA has evaluated since TSCA was modernized, they have found it to be an unreasonable risk. This has really been because of their scientific practices and principles. They have ignored submitted data. They have mischaracterized worst case exposure scenarios and not understood what exposure actually looks like when they're making decisions. And they focused on conditions of use that were not relevant or that were not really going to provide or have a specific high level of exposure. So, this has led to really flawed assessments by the agency, leading to overly conservative risk management decisions by the agency. What this new approach does is it requires the agency to focus on those conditions of use that are more likely than not to occur. So, it really helps to, again, focus the agency on looking at actual real-world scenarios for how a chemistry might be used.”

Congresswoman Mariannette Miller-Meeks (IA-01): “For states like Iowa, where agriculture, manufacturing, including chemical manufacturing, and innovation are central to our economy, we need a regulatory system that protects human health and the environment without relying on duplicative regulation or unnecessary delays. This discussion draft refocuses TSCA on real world risk, best available science, and coordination with other federal and international regulators. It encourages safer innovation, strengthens domestic supply chains, and ensures EPA is accountable for its decisions while preserving strong protections for workers, consumers, and families.”",https://d1dth6e84htgma.cloudfront.net/ENERGY_AND_COMMERCE_SQUARE_LOGO_a093c47e5f.png,N,,2026-01-22 18:57:48.937905

LITTLETON, Colorado, Jan 22 (Reuters) – Judging by state and local filings alone, the U.S.’ data center computing capacity could jump by close to 1,000% if all projects currently planned come to fruition.

That’s a big “if,” however, as it is widely known that some of the plans filed by so-called hyperscalers are more aspirational than hard commitments and will likely be withdrawn if development or grid interconnection takes too long.

Other project estimates likely deliberately inflated the computing capacity that is expected to be constructed, in the hopes that large-scale projects may be eligible for local government support and attain leverage in zoning negotiations.

That said, it is clear that a huge swell in overall data center computing heft – and power consumption – can be expected across the country, which will have sizeable repercussions for local electricity markets, utilities and other businesses.

To help assess which states face the biggest potential impact from the data center build-out, here is a breakdown of where the planned capacity additions are due to be located – and how state electricity supplies and prices have been trending.

COAST-TO-COAST

One of the standout features of the data center capacity pipeline is how widely spread the development plans are across the country.

Current & planned data center capacity across key US states

In total, plans for just over 150 gigawatts (GW) of new data center power capacity have been filed nationally, with 24 different states planning or building at least 1 GW of new capacity, according to Cleanview, an energy data portal.

Given that total current U.S. data center capacity is just under 15 GW and that only three states – Virginia, Texas and Arizona – have more than 2 GW in current operation, the planned capacity building boom is potentially transformational.

The proposed sites span from North Dakota to Alabama, but some states have chunkier development pipelines than others.

The top 30 US states for current & planned data center capacity

Virginia – already called the country’s data center alley – plans an eleven-fold rise in computing capacity, which will maintain the state’s lead in data center heft with close to 35 GW in development.

Texas ranks second with around 27 GW of capacity plans, while gas-rich Pennsylvania ranks third with a capacity pipeline of around 14 GW.

Outside of those already established hubs for energy-intensive industry, New Mexico, Indiana, Arizona and Utah also have hefty capacity plans in the works, with more than 25 GW of additional capacity planned between them.

Planned increases in data center capacity in the top 30 US states

Other notable states with plans to bring on massive new capacity include Georgia, Louisiana and Wyoming, which each plan to build more than 3 GW of new computing power.

POTENTIAL ROADBLOCKS

The mere prospect of a data center boom has already resulted in gridlock within utility planning systems and yearslong waiting lists for new power generating equipment, especially gas power turbines – before shovels have even hit the dirt.

Electricity prices – already buoyed in nearly every market as utility systems upgrade grids and transmission networks – have also risen as data center chatter intensified in key markets.

Among the top 15 states for planned new data center capacity, electricity prices for residential customers have climbed by an average of 16% since the start of 2024, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

That price gain compares to a 10% rise in national residential electricity prices over the same period and indicates that hefty data center capacity pipelines may come with a side of local rate inflation.

Retail electricity prices in key states that plan major increases in data center capacity

Thankfully for large energy consumers, utility-scale supplies of electricity have increased at an even faster rate across the country – especially in the states where large data center demand loads are set to emerge.

Total electricity output across the same 15 states with the largest data center capacity pipelines has increased by an average of 22% since the start of 2024, data from think tank Ember shows.

Utility electricity output in key states that plan major increases in data center capacity

That growth rate slightly exceeds the national electricity supply expansion of 21% over the same period and suggests that utilities in those states may be outworking their peers in an effort to make the data center capacity dreams a reality.

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.

The announcement came from the agency’s loan programs office, which played a central role in the Biden administration’s efforts to develop new technologies to fight climate change. Under President Joseph R. Biden Jr., that office finalized or issued conditional commitments for roughly $104 billion in lending for battery factories, transmission lines, hydrogen plants and many other projects.

The Trump administration has sought to reshape the agency and renamed it the Office of Energy Dominance Financing. Last year, the energy secretary, Chris Wright, announced a sweeping review of the office’s loan obligations.

The Energy Department declined to provide a full list of the affected projects, but many of the loan cancellations included in the $29.9 billion figure had been previously announced, either by the agency or the borrowers themselves.

Some projects had already withered over the past year because the outlook for renewable energy and electric vehicles had dimmed considerably under President Trump, who has disparaged those technologies as a “green scam.” In other cases, the Energy Department has canceled the financing directly.

Last May, for instance, the agency backed away from a partial loan guarantee worth $2.92 billion to Sunnova Energy, a residential solar panel installer that was experimenting with a novel way to link home solar and battery systems. Sunnova, which filed for bankruptcy the next month, had been running into trouble even before Mr. Trump’s return to office because of high interest rates and reduced state incentives for solar.

In July, the Energy Department canceled a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for the Grain Belt Express, a planned transmission line in the Midwest that would have connected wind farms in Kansas with cities in Illinois and Indiana. The project faced opposition from Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, who urged Mr. Wright to scrap the Biden-era loan guarantee.

In November, Plug Power, a company that aims to convert renewable electricity into hydrogen fuels, said it would suspend all work on activities related to a $1.66 billion federal loan guarantee that had been finalized during the Biden administration. The prospects for so-called green hydrogen have faded lately, particularly after Mr. Trump’s domestic policy bill cut tax incentives for the technology.

Other previously announced cancellations include loans or loan guarantees for KORE Power, a battery manufacturer; Redwood Materials, a battery recycling firm; and Aspen Aerogels, a company making novel insulation materials for electric vehicle batteries.

It is unclear whether any of the companies that had their financing withdrawn might try to appeal the termination of their loans. This month, a federal judge ruled that the Energy Department had illegally canceled seven energy grants that had been issued through other programs during the Biden administration.

At the same time, the Trump administration has sought to provide loans and financing for technologies it favors, like natural gas and nuclear power.

Mr. Wright has said he wants to use much of the agency’s remaining loan authority — estimated at more than $289 billion — to bankroll new nuclear plants as well as to support technologies like geothermal energy and mining for critical minerals.

Other Biden-era loans have been modified or cast in a new light to reflect the Trump administration’s priorities.

The Biden administration had issued a conditional commitment for a $1.5 billion loan guarantee to Wabash Valley Resources, which was planning to produce low-carbon fertilizer in Indiana by burying the emissions from its factory 7,000 feet underground. The Trump administration ended up finalizing the loan but sought to emphasize the project’s use of coal rather than its emissions benefits.

The Trump administration also restructured a loan to Lithium Americas, which is trying to produce lithium carbonate for batteries in Thacker Pass, Nev., so that the federal government was able to take an equity stake in the project.

In some cases, Republican lawmakers have lobbied for projects in their districts.

In Great Falls, Mont., a company called Montana Renewables had secured a $1.67 billion loan guarantee from the Biden administration to expand a plant that converted vegetable oils and fats into diesel and jet fuel. Initially, the Trump administration paused the first scheduled payment. But last February, Senator Steve Daines, Republican of Montana, said that he had prevailed on the White House to unblock the funds.

The Energy Department’s loan office was created in 2005 to help emerging energy technologies, which often have trouble getting conventional financing, become commercially viable. It gained notoriety after it lent $535 million in 2009 to Solyndra, a solar firm that went bankrupt two years later. But it also gave a crucial $465 million loan in 2010 to Tesla, which grew into an electric vehicle powerhouse.

Mr. Wright has claimed that many of the Biden administration’s loan approvals were rushed, pointing out that the majority of deals were either finalized or received conditional commitments after Mr. Trump won the 2024 election.

Former agency officials, however, have said that projects go through exhaustive vetting. And some said that attempts to go after loan agreements could deter companies from doing business with the federal government in the future.

“If we get to conditional commitment with a loan program recipient, that’s the government’s credibility,” David Turk, the deputy secretary of energy during the Biden administration, said last year. “That’s the American people’s credibility on the line to follow through and make sure that we are providing that certainty for investment.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/22/multimedia/22cli-energyloans-hzkl/22cli-energyloans-hzkl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 18:58:35.145284

This report examines the low-carbon development of industrial parks under China’s new zero-carbon park initiative.","Industrial parks are the backbone of major economies and major energy users, making them central to any green transition. In China, more than 15,000 industrial parks host 80 percent of industrial enterprises, account for over half of national industrial output, and consume roughly one-third of national energy. This scale gives parks enormous potential to drive the energy transition by absorbing large volumes of renewable energy through local consumption, piloting high-renewables power systems, fostering low-carbon industries and supply chains, and serving as engines of new green economic growth.

Zero-carbon industrial parks are emerging as a key opportunity for this transformation. China has introduced stringent criteria for its national zero-carbon park initiative. If backed by robust and innovative implementation, these “near-zero emissions” requirements can significantly accelerate clean-energy deployment and systemic energy transitions across parks nationwide. By enabling advanced clean technologies, building green supply chains, and supporting low-carbon product manufacturing, zero-carbon parks can generate both domestic and global benefits for industrial upgrading and sustainable development.

China also continues to develop industrial parks around the world, developing more than 159 overseas industrial parks across Asia and Africa. These parks are shifting from traditional manufacturing hubs toward innovation-driven, research and development-oriented platforms with greater emphasis on local needs and sustainability. Overseas parks have become important vehicles for China’s international cooperation — connecting with local green industries, deploying low-carbon technologies, and promoting investment and trade in emerging sectors. Green and low-carbon parks are now an indispensable part of China’s regional cooperation on sustainable development.

This report examines the low-carbon development of industrial parks under China’s new zero-carbon park initiative. It explores the technical, business, and institutional innovations that enable parks to advance national climate goals. The report proposes a systematic and differentiated approach to zero-carbon park development and identifies key challenges and opportunities — including integrated energy solutions, zero-carbon material-flow and carbon management, financing and business models, and traceable, verifiable carbon accounting systems. It concludes that by building scalable, replicable pathways and strengthening regional collaboration, zero-carbon parks can power high-quality economic growth and provide benefits to the local communities.",https://rmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/industrial-facility-china.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 21:40:02.208641

EV tax credit elimination forced a strategic reset Without incentives, EV economics weakened, pushing Detroit toward hybrids and delayed timelines.

And Canada’s opening to Chinese EV imports underscores how quickly policy decisions can reshape competitive dynamics.","DETROIT – Michigan’s auto industry is navigating one of its most complex transitions in decades — and recent policy shifts on both sides of the border are accelerating the pressure.

As Canada moves to sharply reduce tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, Detroit’s legacy automakers are slowing EV expansion, pivoting toward hybrids, and reassessing long-term capital plans following the elimination of key U.S. EV tax credits that once underpinned consumer demand.

The result is a widening strategic divide across North America — one that lands squarely on Michigan’s manufacturing base.

EV Tax Credits Disappear — and So Does Demand Momentum

For much of the past decade, federal EV tax credits of up to $7,500 per vehicle played a central role in making electric vehicles financially viable for mainstream buyers.

When those credits expired or became unavailable to many models due to sourcing and eligibility rules, Detroit automakers felt the impact almost immediately.

During a recent earnings call, Jim Farley, CEO of Ford Motor Company, acknowledged that EV demand has not met earlier expectations, saying the company needed to “align production with what customers are actually willing to buy today,” particularly as affordability pressures grow.

Farley has repeatedly emphasized that price sensitivity — not technology — is now the biggest barrier to EV adoption, a reality that worsened once incentives disappeared.

Michigan automakers are not abandoning electrification — they are recalibrating it.

General Motors CEO Mary Barra has said publicly that GM remains committed to an all-electric future, but has also stressed the importance of “capital discipline” and “matching investment to demand” in the near term.

That shift has translated into:

Delayed EV plant expansions

Slower battery capacity buildouts

Greater emphasis on hybrids and plug-in hybrids

At Stellantis, CEO Carlos Tavares has been even more blunt, warning that forcing rapid electrification without affordable pricing risks “destroying demand.” Tavares has repeatedly argued that hybrids are essential to protecting margins, jobs, and consumer choice during the transition.

For Michigan suppliers, that pivot is critical. Hybrids preserve:

Internal combustion engine work

Transmissions and drivetrains

Large portions of the existing Tier-1 and Tier-2 supply chain

Canada’s China EV Deal Complicates the Picture

Against that backdrop, Canada’s decision to slash tariffs on Chinese EV imports — from roughly 100% to about 6% on a capped number of vehicles — introduces new competitive pressure.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford has sharply criticized the deal, warning it could undermine domestic auto manufacturing. In public remarks, Ford said Canada should be focused on “building cars here, not importing them from countries that don’t play by the same rules.”

That message resonates strongly in Michigan.

Even if Chinese EVs remain blocked from U.S. showrooms, pricing psychology doesn’t stop at the border. Michigan consumers, dealers, and fleet buyers closely watch Canadian pricing — particularly in border regions like Detroit–Windsor.

Labor Voices Warn of Policy Whiplash

Labor leaders argue that policy inconsistency — especially the sudden loss of EV incentives — has made long-term planning harder for manufacturers and workers alike.

UAW leadership has repeatedly warned that electrification must be paired with stable incentives and domestic investment, or risk pushing production elsewhere. While the union has supported EV manufacturing, it has also cautioned against trade policies that expose U.S. workers to state-subsidized foreign competition.

As one UAW position statement put it, the transition “must be built in North America, not outsourced through trade loopholes.”

Hybrids Buy Time — But Not Immunity

For Michigan automakers, hybrids have become the pressure valve:

They lower emissions

They reduce consumer cost shock

They preserve existing jobs and tooling

But Canada’s embrace of low-cost Chinese EVs highlights the risk of North American misalignment. If Canada accelerates EV adoption through imports while the U.S. relies on hybrids and slower domestic rollout, supply chains and investment may fragment.

Battery production, software development, and next-generation EV components could increasingly cluster where policy support is clearest — not necessarily where the auto industry was born.

What This Means for Michigan

1. EV tax credit elimination forced a strategic reset

Without incentives, EV economics weakened, pushing Detroit toward hybrids and delayed timelines.

2. Hybrids stabilize Michigan’s industrial base — for now

They protect jobs and suppliers, but don’t eliminate long-term EV competition.

3. Canada’s policy shift raises regional stakes

Different tariff strategies could redirect future investment north of the border.

4. Policy clarity now matters as much as technology

Automakers can build EVs — but they need predictable demand signals to justify scale.

Bottom Line

Michigan’s auto industry isn’t retreating — it’s adjusting to reality.

The loss of EV tax credits exposed the fragility of demand. Hybrids offer a pragmatic bridge. And Canada’s opening to Chinese EV imports underscores how quickly policy decisions can reshape competitive dynamics.

For Detroit, the challenge is no longer whether it can build the future — but whether North American policy will allow that future to be built at home",https://mitechnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Auto-industry-challenges-in-Michigan.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 18:39:34.112882

This past Tuesday — on the one-year anniversary of Donald Trump taking office and immediately declaring a national energy emergency — the new governor of New Jersey took office and immediately declared a state energy emergency. But these two approaches to executive action on energy couldn’t be more different and the results will help define the affordability debate in 2026.

During her inaugural speech, New Jersey Governor Mikie Sherrill signed two executive orders aimed at fulfilling her campaign pledge to declare a state of emergency on utility costs on day one of her administration. Executive Order No.1 delivers “immediate ratepayer relief” and freezes rate hikes for New Jersey families. “I want you to know that I will be fighting for you and I hope, New Jersey, you’ll remember me when you open up your electric bill and it hasn’t gone up by 20%,” Sherrill said. Executive Order No. 2 takes action to “massively expand in-state power generation” – including solar and battery storage in the short-term, and nuclear power in the long-term, to lower electric bills. Her order will also identify permit reforms so projects can be created faster “to take on the affordability crisis,” Sherrill said.

Paying people to offset bill hikes is relatively quick while investing in energy supply takes time. Matthew Zeitlin at Heatmap News described this combination as “throwing every broadly left-of-center idea around energy at the wall and seeing what sticks.” Policymakers in other states will be watching what happens in New Jersey.

Now, I usually avoid the slow, boring, devil’s advocate centrism of Matt Yglesias, but his op-ed last month arguing that “liberals should support America’s oil and gas industry” to win back power has been inescapable, and applies here. “Responsible environmental policy is inseparable from sustainable political strategy” he writes, and so Dems should bring back the “all of the above” strategy of the Obama era. This argument largely ignores the dramatic drop in prices for renewable energy and the urgency of rising temperatures since, you know, 2009.

The new governor of New Jersey railed against the “affordability crisis” and high energy prices without showing any support for the oil industry or even mentioning gas prices. But she didn’t mention “climate change” either while talking about modernizing our energy. Not surprising. There is a pervasive exhaustion with the word “climate” as the right frame for taking action on climate change, Robinson Meyer writes at Heatmap News, which does an annual survey of industry thinkers. “Climate change, unfortunately, has become too politicized, one lobbyist is quoted as saying. “I’d rather talk about decarbonization than climate change.”

So-called “climate hushing” rests on a fundamental flaw, Covering Climate Now writes, “It focuses on only one form of climate realism, the political, while ignoring a more important one, the scientific.” Surveys show 74% of Americans want political leaders to take more climate action, according to CCN.

Meanwhile, democrats in nearby Massachusetts are jockeying with one another for how to tackle the affordability crisis. The governor and legislature have competing energy-affordability bills, Sarah Shemkus reports at Canary Media.

And in a rare show of bipartisan agreement, the Democratic governors of Pennsylvania and Maryland joined Trump officials this month in calling on the PJM Interconnection grid operator, the nation’s largest regional electric grid operator, to bring down electric prices and force data centers to pay more for new generation than residential customers by allocating costs to data centers that have not added new power onto the grid themselves.

My UCLA Emmett Institute colleague William Boyd has a timely new analysis of why this initiative urging PJM to adopt a one-off “emergency auction” will do very little to fix these longstanding problems with the markets themselves. It’s especially rich when Trump is also trying to strangle offshore wind projects that are supposed to supply significant electricity into… the PJM grid. “As the price of electricity rises to the top of the political agenda for the first time in at least a generation,” Boyd writes, “it is time to recognize that the 40-year experiment with neoliberal electricity has failed.”

So, buckle up for a surge of energy affordability in American politics and prepare to hear a lot about both real and fake emergencies.

Good news! Metro’s board of directors voted today to approve the Sepulveda Transit Corridor project to connect the Westside to the San Fernando Valley in less than 20 minutes. The underground heavy-rail option would go from Van Nuys to Sherman Oaks, pass under the mountains and Bel Air, stop here at UCLA (yay!) and ultimately end at the E Line/Expo Sepulveda station, reports Colleen Shalby for LAT. Joe Linton live skeeted the board meeting and reports that all 35 public comments were in favor of the project.

On Friday, Southern California Edison filed two lawsuits against Los Angeles County and several other agencies over their alleged roles in the Eaton Fire, LAist reports. In one interesting suit, Edison alleges Southern California Gas delayed shutting off gas in the burn area for several days after the fire, making the blaze far worse. “SoCalGas’ design and actions caused gas leaks, gas fires, reignition of fires, gas explosions and secondary ignitions during the critical early stages of the Eaton Fire,” the suit reads.

California is (very very slowly) drafting the toughest statewide rules in the country for vegetation, known as Zone Zero rules, which would require at-risk homeowners to clear some or all of the plants within five feet of their house, depending on what regulators decide.

Davos and Beyond

At the World Economic Forum in Davos, China is pushing itself as a leader on climate action and celebrating its domination of wind, solar, and battery power, Inside Climate News reports.

Meanwhile, Trump is yelling at windmills.

Six years ago, ESG was all the rage at Davos, but now many Wall Street institutions have walked back or abandoned their commitments, David Gelles reports for NYT. “The alliances — like the Net-Zero Banking Alliance and the Net-Zero Asset Managers initiative — that were meant to steer investments toward clean energy and away from fossil fuels have largely fallen apart.”

Former Vice President Al Gore said this week that the world is in a “climate policy recession” because governments are beholden to the non-renewable-energy industry during a World Economic Forum roundtable dubbed “How Can We Avert a Climate Recession.” “Policy is controlled by governments, and too many governments are now unfortunately controlled by special interest,” Gore said

7147, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2026(link is external) Background: Passage of these bills marks the final steps in completing all 12 FY26 appropriations bills.","Washington, D.C. – Today, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 7148, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, (link is external)2026(link is external), with a vote of 341 to 88, and H.R. 7147, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2026(link is external), with a vote of 220 to 207.

This package of appropriations bills – like the eight already passed through this chamber – was negotiated, finalized, and delivered through a member-driven, bicameral process. Together, these measures lock in decisive FY26 investments that strengthen America’s military, secure the border, enhance emergency preparedness, reinforce education and health systems, and modernize transportation safety and infrastructure nationwide.

With the passage of this final package, the House of Representatives has completed its constitutional duty and passed all twelve appropriations measures for Fiscal Year 2026. Congress is replacing Biden-era spending with disciplined, Republican-led funding that puts America First. These bills advance President Trump’s agenda, empower his Cabinet to govern effectively, and codify DOGE-backed reforms to eliminate waste, duplication, and unchecked federal spending.

This is a clean break from the dysfunction of the past. No bloated Christmas omnibuses. No unreviewable backroom bill dumps. And no more leverage of a partisan government shutdown for the rest of the fiscal year. Republicans are restoring regular order, enforcing fiscal accountability, and proving that Congress can work – on results and on principle. That is the leadership the American people expect, and that is exactly what this moment delivers.

Chairman Tom Cole (R-OK) said, ""There were bets against us. Many said it was impossible. Yet, in this moment, the U.S. House of Representatives has delivered on its Article I responsibility. Here is what we’ve proven – commentary and headlines don’t dictate facts, difficulty doesn’t excuse inaction, and duty to the nation requires results. This package reflects what governing with purpose looks like. Instead of last-minute omnibuses or runaway spending, these FY26 bills deliver responsible full-year funding and represent critical progress in completing the appropriations process. Today, we’ve invested in strengthening our national defense, making our homeland safer, supporting education and health systems, and modernizing our transportation and infrastructure. Republicans set clear goals at the outset: reduce spending, lock in DOGE-driven cuts and reforms, and replace Biden-era provisions with policies that put America First. These bills do exactly that. They invest in readiness and security, demand accountability, and focus federal dollars on core responsibilities – not bureaucratic excess. Subcommittee Chairmen Robert Aderholt, Ken Calvert, Steve Womack, and Mark Amodei did the hard work – and the American people are better off because of it. Congress is closing out Fiscal Year 2026 through discipline and critical progress on regular order. This member-driven, intentional process is how governing is supposed to work – and how Republicans are turning President Trump’s vision into law.""

Chairman Cole’s floor remarks on H.R. 7148 are available here, and on H.R. 7147 are available here.

Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Chairman Robert Aderholt (R-AL) said, ""Passage of the final FY26 appropriations package balances the need for responsible fiscal stewardship while maintaining key investments in biomedical research, classrooms and education, and rural health and primary care. Thanks to negotiations on a bicameral, bipartisan level, funding decisions have moved through a member-driven process that emphasizes transparency and accountability. Labor–HHS priorities support the American people by demanding greater accountability while focusing resources where they matter most. As Chairman of the Labor-HHS Subcommittee, I was honored to lead the effort to rein in spending and secure an America First future, while also ensuring these bills provide funding for critical projects that support jobs and growth in our districts.""

Subcommittee Chairman Aderholt's remarks are available here.

Defense Subcommittee Chairman Ken Calvert (R-CA) said, ""Keeping America safe is our top priority in Congress and the defense appropriations bill passed today will help achieve that fundamental objective. The bill advances my strategic goals as Chairman of the Defense Subcommittee which align with the Trump Administration’s America First’ agenda. By establishing a new Civil Reserve Manufacturing Network and advancing programs that leverage American innovation, we are strengthening our military superiority and ability to build weapons at scale. We also continue to target international drug cartels and narco-terrorists – who are responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans – by investing in National Guard counter-drug programs. Our servicemembers are the most essential component of our national security strategy and this bill invests in these heroes with a 3.8% pay raise and continues pay increases for junior enlisted servicemembers.""

Subcommittee Chairman Calvert's remarks are available here.

Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee Chairman Steve Womack (R-AR) said, ""I am extremely proud of the passage of today’s funding bills. My Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development division reflects a deliberate shift away from bloated bureaucracy and refocuses taxpayer dollars on priorities that matter to the American people—safety, mobility, economic growth, and housing affordability. Among its many provisions, we delivered a long-overdue infusion of resources to modernize our national airspace and strengthen our air traffic control system. We also provided states with the funding they need to build safer, more reliable roads and bridges while addressing long-standing safety challenges, including truck parking. At the same time, we preserved housing assistance for the most vulnerable while promoting affordability through flexible, locally driven programs that allow communities to expand housing supply without federal micromanagement. For the Third District of Arkansas, I secured more than $97 million for eleven community projects—ranging from the construction of the Springdale Northern Bypass, which will support regional economic growth, to critical funding for the City of Mulberry’s Community Food Pantry, ensuring families have access to the food they need. Today’s package also strategically increases funding for our defense apparatus, strengthening national security and ensuring we are ready and able to respond to emerging threats and win the next conflict. While we are close to completing our appropriations work, we are not done yet. Let’s finish the job, prevent another long-term continuing resolution, and deliver real results for taxpayers in Arkansas’s Third District and across the nation.""

Subcommittee Chairman Womack's remarks are available here.

Homeland Security Subcommittee Chairman Mark Amodei (R-NV) said, ""When we look back to a year ago and the disaster at the border the Trump Administration inherited, it’s clear the voices of the American people were taken seriously when they went to the ballot box with the hope of more secure borders, streets free of drugs and violent criminals, and the peace of mind that comes with safer communities. This funding addresses every aspect of our national security where the United States could be vulnerable. It strengthens protections across air, land, maritime, and emerging cyber domains, while supporting innovation, training, and modern technologies needed to stay ahead of bad actors and adversaries. It’s also fiscally responsible, saving taxpayer dollars by cutting programs and offices that pursue missions unrelated to security of the homeland and refocusing resources on initiatives that truly keeps Americans safe. The road to restoring regular order was not an easy one, but Chairman Cole’s leadership and commitment to the process brought us to this point. I want to thank my colleagues on the committee and the subcommittee staff for their partnership and hard work in getting this across the finish line.""

Subcommittee Chairman Amodei's remarks are available here.

H.R. 7148, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2026(link is external), and H.R. 7147, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2026(link is external)

Background:

Passage of these bills marks the final steps in completing all 12 FY26 appropriations bills.

Gone are the days of rushed, Christmas omnibuses. Thanks to Republican governance, funding decisions will move through a deliberate, member-driven process that emphasizes transparency, accountability, and timely consideration.

The measures were negotiated between House and Senate Subcommittee leadership, which included Republican Reps. Robert Aderholt, Ken Calvert, Steve Womack, and Mark Amodei and Senators Mitch McConnell, Shelley Moore Capito, Cindy Hyde-Smith, and Katie Britt.

Defense measures champion America’s military superiority, ensuring our troops can deter, fight, and win. Strategic investments restore military strength, accelerate innovation, and reinforce President Trump’s peace through strength agenda. The bill also bolsters U.S. industrial supply chains, delivers next-generation weapons and assets, and includes a well-earned pay raise for our troops.

Homeland measures end the weak, Biden-era posture that fueled the worst border crisis in history by implementing policies that keep Americans and our homeland safe. We advance the America First promise of empowering our frontline agents to uphold our laws, deport criminal aliens, confront bad actors, and protect our country. From our borders and ports to aviation and cyber, we deliver the personnel, training, and technology to reinforce our security at every level.

LHHS measures demonstrate the will of the American people who mandated new priorities and accountability in government, including priorities to “Make America Healthy Again” and “Make America Skilled Again.” Investments are directed to where they matter most: into lifesaving biomedical research and resilient medical supply chains, classrooms and training that prepare the next generation for success, and rural hospitals and primary care to end the chronic disease epidemic.

THUD measures allow the nation to build stronger, travel safer, and support growth. Reflecting key pieces of the America First agenda, it enhances resources for FAA facilities and equipment to modernize air traffic control, hire needed controllers, and accelerate the deployment of new technologies. From our roads and bridges to our ports and skies, it supports the safety and security of vital transit systems. It also empowers local communities through economic development priorities and resources to help vulnerable Americans.

No poison pills are included.

Legacy riders protecting the lives of unborn children, supporting livestock haulers from burdensome requirements, and prohibiting illegal aliens from receiving housing assistance are maintained.

These measures are part of an agreement that keeps total FY26 spending below the level projected under the current continuing resolution, delivering real savings for American taxpayers.

Enactment of full-year appropriations is vital to implementing Republican priorities aligned with the Trump Administration and America First agenda.

WASHINGTON—The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced today it is prepared to take emergency action to prevent blackouts during winter storm Fern. In a letter today, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright asked the nation’s grid operators to maintain communication with DOE during the storm and be prepared to make backup generation resources at data centers and other major facilities available as needed. DOE estimates more than 35 GW of unused backup generation remains available nationwide. These actions could mitigate blackouts and reduce costs for potentially hundreds of millions of Americans during the winter storm.

“The Trump administration will not stand by and allow the previous administration’s reckless energy subtraction policies and bureaucratic red tape put American lives at risk,” said Secretary Wright. “We have identified more than 35 GW of unused backup generation that exists across the country and are taking action to ensure that if the nation needs it, the generation will be made available. Rest assured, President Trump and the Energy Department remain committed to doing everything in our power to mitigate blackouts and lower energy costs for the American people.”

On day one, President Trump declared a national energy emergency(link is external) after the Biden administration’s energy subtraction agenda left behind a grid increasingly vulnerable to blackouts. According to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)(link is external), “Winter electricity demand is rising at the fastest rate in recent years,” while the premature forced closure of reliable generation such as coal and natural gas plants leaves American families vulnerable to power outages. The NERC 2025 – 2026 Winter Reliability Assessment(link is external) further warns that areas across the continental United States have an elevated risk of blackouts during extreme weather conditions.

Power outages cost the American people $44 billion per year, according to data(link is external) from DOE’s National Laboratories. The Secretary’s draft order will help mitigate power outages in the winter months and highlights the commonsense policies of the Trump Administration to ensure an affordable and reliable energy system.

Tesla Inc. squandered by far the biggest share of new-car sales in California last year, as the electric-vehicle maker lost ground in one of the world’s largest EV markets.

The company accounted for 9.9% of all vehicles registered in the state last year, down from 11.6% in 2024, according to Experian data published by the California New Car Dealers Association. The market share decline was more than three times that of Stellantis NV’s Dodge, dropping Tesla to the No. 3 auto brand in the state in 2025, after trailing only Toyota Motor Corp.’s namesake a year earlier.

RELATED: California hits milestone in electric vehicle sales

The downturn echoes Tesla’s struggles in other markets around the world. The company’s aging lineup and slow-selling Cybertruck faces growing competition from fresher EVs offered by mainstream carmakers, while the loss of federal tax credits for EV purchasers in the US has put more pressure on demand that already was faltering. Tesla has also contended with a consumer backlash to Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk’s political activities.

Tesla registered fewer than 180,000 vehicles in California last year, down from almost 203,000 in 2024. The decline contributed to the state’s overall EV market retreat, with total zero-emission vehicle registrations falling by about 7,300 cars to a little more than 378,000.

Still, Tesla’s most-popular models remained among the state’s top-selling vehicles. The Model Y SUV remained the best-selling EV in the state and was the No. 1 light truck of any type. Tesla’s Model 3 sedan was the state’s second-best selling passenger car, trailing the Toyota Camry.

See Also: Trump Wants Venezuela’s Oil.","There is an ongoing battle in a Delaware federal court over control of Citgo Petroleum, the Houston-based refiner widely regarded as the crown jewel of Venezuela’s foreign assets. In late November, Amber Energy, an affiliate of Paul Singer’s hedge fund Elliott Management, won a court-supervised auction for Citgo’s parent company, PDV Holding. However, Gold Reserve, the losing bidder, has filed a bombshell appeal that will blow the case apart and the process will likely start over with a new judge.

Here Lies Irony

Singer is no stranger to Latin America. His firm has built a reputation on long, patient bets on distressed sovereign assets, often backed by aggressive litigation strategies, in some cases taking countries to court, as Disruption Banking wrote about here.

Citgo, with refineries across Texas, Louisiana, and Illinois, is not just another industrial asset: it is one of the largest refiners in the U.S. market and a strategic piece of energy infrastructure. Control over Citgo is therefore about more than creditor recovery; it is about who ultimately governs a critical node in the American energy system.

The auction itself unfolded as a pitched battle among global oil traders, U.S. energy firms, and distressed-debt specialists. But this financial contest did not occur in a vacuum. It played out against the backdrop of Donald Trump’s intervention in Venezuela’s political crisis, his administration’s seizure and resale of Venezuelan oil shipments, and the broader paradox of U.S. power projecting itself as both liberator and liquidator of a foreign state’s assets.

Trump’s installation of himself at the top of the socialist Chavista political party is a supreme irony in an age of ironic Orwellian contradictions, where war is peace, secrecy is transparency, and self-dealing is America First.

Citgo, Venezuela & The Maduro Question

The legal drama surrounding Citgo is inseparable from Venezuela’s political collapse. Citgo is ultimately owned by Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), the country’s state oil company. When Venezuela defaulted on its debt in the late 2010s, Citgo became the most valuable reachable asset for creditors seeking compensation.

In early January, the appeals court invited the federal government to submit comments on whether Trump’s abduction of former Venezuelan President Maduro would affect the litigation, but none were forthcoming by the deadline of January 8.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) must approve the sale within six months for the deal to close. Without OFAC approval within six months, the Amber Energy deal cannot close. At the same time, Venezuela has asked the appellate court to vacate the sale order entirely, a request that remains unresolved.

The bondholders and their opponents have refocused their attention on Washington, lobbying privately, to sway the matter to their advantage.

It’s not clear how “the boss” (as Trump is known within the administration) feels about the auction. Sources told Reuters that the issue is “not a priority,” but that “Washington” (the boss?) would prefer Citgo to be run by an American company.

This ambiguity underscores a deeper tension: Citgo sits at the intersection of sanctions policy, creditor rights, and U.S. energy security.

Oil Sales, Sanctions, and Strategic Contradictions

The Citgo dispute is unfolding alongside another remarkable development: the U.S. government has begun selling Venezuelan crude oil under its own supervision. Along with Marathon Petroleum Corp, Citgo is preparing to bid on the first $2 billion worth of Venezuelan crude oil, consisting of about 30 million to 50 million barrels.

This creates a surreal feedback loop. On one hand, U.S. courts are overseeing the forced sale of Venezuela’s most important foreign refinery to satisfy creditor claims. On the other, the U.S. government is monetizing Venezuelan oil exports, with proceeds held in controlled accounts abroad. Venezuela’s oil is flowing, but under conditions dictated entirely by Washington.

These parallel processes together illustrate how Venezuelan sovereignty over its energy sector has been hollowed out. It’s the new-fangled Donroe Doctrine at work, and as confusing as it all seems, the MAGA faithful never tire of repeating, “Let the man cook,” eliding the question of who or what is being cooked.

Bondholders and the $19 Billion Question

The roots of the Citgo fight stretch back decades. Back in the glorious mid-1980s, the PDVSA acquired 50% of the firm and then bought out the rest by 1990, securing a foothold in the U.S. refining market. However, almost three decades later in the 2010s, PDVSA issued bonds using the Citgo stock equity as collateral.

The buyers of these bonds were foreign companies, retail investors, and various creditors of the Venezuelan government and the PDVSA. Next, in 2019, PDVSA defaulted on the bonds, paving the way for creditors to seize the refiner. Since then, bondholders have been fighting arbitration cases in District Courts in Delaware and New York City against the PDVSA and later a supervisory board controlled by Venezuela’s political opposition, which attempted to sandbag the creditors’ litigation, arguing the bonds were not issued according to Venezuelan law.

The court rejected that argument. In 2020, the bonds were upheld as valid, and that ruling was reaffirmed in September 2025 after appellate review. By then, creditor claims tied to defaults and expropriations had swollen to as much as $19 billion.

Against that backdrop, Delaware Judge Leonard Stark approved the $5.9 billion bid for Citgo’s parent, including a $2.1 billion pact for bondholders. That can’t be welcome news for the bondholders because they are collectively seeking up to $19 billion in total, but it seems that Citgo doesn’t yet command the type of coin to cover all the claims.

The question, then, is not whether creditors lose, but which creditors are paid, and why.

Gold Reserve’s Bombshell: Conflicts of Interest Alleged

That question lies at the heart of the most explosive and least reported part of the case, for some unknown reason. Venezuelan parties have filed a motion to disqualify Amber’s bid due to a conflict of interest, seeking to void the sale and disqualify the judge.

The Toronto-listed miner, one of 15 creditors vying for proceeds from the sale, Gold Reserve court brief exposed a bombshell allegation that the advisers hired by the court, Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP (Weil) and Evercore, Inc. (acting as arms of the court) had extensive undisclosed relationships with Elloitt and the winning bondholders.

A Weil partner intervened internally, warning colleagues not to alienate Elliott as a client. The advisers discussed with Elliott how to avoid commitment fees, skip the topping round, and submit a post-recommendation “unsolicited” bid instead.

According to an internal email, Elliott would, “submit something not fully committed… then wait to see what our recommendation is and try to beat that with an unsolicited offer.”

It is certainly odd that the court chose Amber Energy’s bid when Gold Reserve’s bid was $2.1 billion higher than Amber’s, a decision that is not only odd and suspicious on its face but also against the black letter language of the Delaware Code, which states that a sale of attached shares must be “public” and “to the highest bidder,” (Del. Code tit. 8, § 324(a) (emphasis added)).

Unsurprisingly, the judge dismissed the motion seeking his disqualification, but the allegations remain part of the appellate record and almost completely absent from mainstream coverage, including, suspiciously, Reuters, which has reported on every single twist and turn of the case.

Trump, Defacto Leader of Chavismo

The legal and financial threads converge in a broader political paradox.

Marcus Gak, an Argentinian journalist, captured it well on Instagram, “The ties between the Chavista political leadership in Caracas and Donald Trump’s White House continue to strengthen. The CIA director was in Caracas this past weekend, meeting with President Delcy Rodríguez. Meanwhile, the United States has begun selling Venezuelan oil. Currently, Donald Trump is the leader of Chavismo.”

The remark is intentionally provocative, but it points to a deeper irony. While Chavismo once defined itself in opposition to U.S. capitalism, Venezuela’s energy assets are now being sold, managed, and redistributed under American legal and financial authority. Citgo’s fate will be decided not in Caracas, but in Delaware courtrooms and Washington offices.

Whether Amber Energy ultimately takes control or whether the sale is unwound on appeal, the Citgo case reveals how sovereignty can be dismantled through contracts, sanctions, and court orders.

“TSCA can and should protect health and the environment while also supporting innovation, supply chain resilience, and U.S. competitiveness.
Significant, long-term TSCA improvements require congressional leadership to provide the statutory clarity, accountability, and structural changes necessary to get TSCA working efficiently and predictably.","WASHINGTON (Jan. 22, 2026) – The American Chemistry Council (ACC) testified at today’s U.S. House Energy and Commerce Environment Subcommittee hearing on legislation to modernize the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and address persistent challenges in EPA’s chemical review programs and strengthen domestic manufacturing.

ACC Vice President of Regulatory and Scientific Affairs Dr. Kimberly Wise White, Ph.D. underscored the urgent need to restore predictability, scientific rigor, and efficiency to TSCA implementation. Today’s hearing follows the Committee’s release of draft TSCA legislation to reauthorize a key funding program designed to support and enhance EPA’s ongoing implementation of the 2016 TSCA amendments.

“Congress rightly envisioned a risk-based, science-driven system under TSCA, not the speculative, opaque system we have now,” Dr. White stated in her testimony. “Over ninety percent of active new chemical reviews already exceed their ninety-day statutory deadline and over sixty percent remain pending for more than a year.

“Additionally, EPA’s use of overly cautious assumptions and unlikely exposure scenarios has led to flawed and inflated risk estimates of existing chemicals, resulting in every evaluated chemical being labeled an unreasonable risk since 2016. These delays and scientific inconsistencies discourage investment in new technologies and materials in the United States,” Dr. White said.

Dr. White called for timely, transparent reviews of both new and existing chemicals, grounded in real-world exposures and the best available science. A recent ACC survey found that 70% of chemical companies have decided to bring products to market outside the U.S. because of such delays, an ominous signal that American competitiveness is at risk.

“We appreciate Chairmen Guthrie and Palmer and committee members for convening this important hearing and for their leadership on strengthening America’s chemical safety framework,” said Dr. White. “TSCA can and should protect health and the environment while also supporting innovation, supply chain resilience, and U.S. competitiveness. By pairing TSCA fee reauthorization with targeted common-sense actions to address persistent implementation challenges, Congress can drive accountability and reaffirm the statute’s bipartisan intent.”

ACC President and CEO Chris Jahn echoed Dr. White’s concerns and stressed that EPA’s tackling TSCA new chemicals review backlog is essential to America’s economic and manufacturing leadership.

“When new chemical reviews routinely miss statutory deadlines, it undermines U.S. competitiveness and delays the materials needed for advanced manufacturing, semiconductors, and emerging technologies,” Jahn said. “Getting TSCA back on track is critical to ensuring the next generation of innovation is developed and manufactured here in the United States.”

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and his team have taken constructive steps to stabilize the TSCA program. But administrative actions can only go so far. Durable, long-term reform requires congressional action. Significant, long-term TSCA improvements require congressional leadership to provide the statutory clarity, accountability, and structural changes necessary to get TSCA working efficiently and predictably.

ACC is committed to working with Congress, EPA Administrator Zeldin and his staff, and the White House to fix TSCA so that U.S. chemical manufacturers can continue driving a healthier, more innovative and more competitive America.",https://www.americanchemistry.com/var/site/storage/images/8/7/9/2/2978-2-eng-US/Government-Capitol-Dome-Sunset.png,N,,2026-01-22 16:58:06.176421

The issue is all about China and includes stories about robots, AI boyfriends, a Chinese town that became the crystal capital of the world, and a Chinese DNA database built for family reunions. Like this newsletter, the issue is our attempt to document how deeply Chinese technology now shapes everyday life—no matter where you live in the world.

As part of the issue, I reported a story on how Chinese lithium battery companies like CATL, BYD, and Gotion are now building factories on nearly every continent. The trend challenges traditional narratives about “Made in China,” which often center on cheap labor, heavy pollution, and government subsidies. Instead, I set out to track every battery factory outside China owned by a Chinese company. With help from the New York–based think tank Rhodium Group, we identified 68 facilities that have been built or announced over the past decade.

Entering a New Phase

The worldwide expansion of Chinese battery factories signifies the country is entering a new phase of manufacturing. Chinese companies have become so efficient and technologically advanced that they can now relocate their factories anywhere and still find ways to be more competitive than local players. In WIRED’s China issue, we charted that unprecedented growth in a series of maps and graphs. You can check them all out here.

The world is still grappling with what this paradigm shift will mean for the future of energy and geopolitics. But the batteries produced by these factories are already reshaping the transition to clean energy. The experts I spoke with said the growing presence of Chinese batteries—and the overseas factories that make them—could transform everything from local labor relations to how technology is transferred across borders.

When a Chinese Factory Comes to Town

Hungary is one of the most striking examples of what happens when Chinese battery companies expand abroad. The country is home to at least four plants already under construction, including possibly the biggest overseas factory ever planned by a Chinese battery company that’s worth approximately $8.5 billion. Hungary has become a gateway for Chinese firms to sell their products to the European market. As a result, it also provides an early blueprint for how communities will react when a Chinese battery factory opens up shop in their backyard.

Many people in Hungary are skeptical about whether Chinese companies will prioritize hiring locals or bring in cheaper workers from elsewhere instead. They arrived in the country at a time when local labor supply was low because many Hungarians moved to other parts of Europe in recent years in search of work, says András Bartók, an assistant professor at the Ludovika University of Public Service who has studied Hungary’s relationship with Japan and China. The companies have worked with the Hungarian government to bring in migrant labor from Central Asia and Southeast Asia, but that has prompted backlash from local residents. When CATL, the world’s largest lithium battery maker, laid off more than 100 employees at its planned Hungarian factory site last summer, the local municipality launched an investigation into whether the firm had kept its stated promise to hire locally.

CATL is also facing local protests in Hungary over its water use and environmental footprint, criticisms that it inherited from Japanese and Korean battery companies that built factories there over the last two decades. “Way before these Chinese [investments] were announced, there were national-level protests with how groundwater is polluted during battery manufacturing,” says Bartók. A Hungarian court also ordered a Samsung battery plant to suspend production in October because of pollution concerns. Because the Chinese companies announced their investments in drought-prone regions, they were immediately swept into already heated media debates about the limited availability of natural resources.

At the end of the day, local residents may feel disconnected from these batteries, and from the green energy transition they enable, because Hungarians are not the target consumers. Most lithium batteries produced in Hungary are destined for Western European car markets, where consumers are wealthier and already sold on the need to shift to clean energy. “The average Hungarian has the money to buy a 10-year-old used car from Germany, usually powered by diesel or gas. They don't have the money to buy electric vehicles,” says Bartók.

Sluggish Demand

It’s worth keeping in mind that not all of the international deals announced by Chinese battery makers have panned out. Among the 68 factory investments we found, at least five of them have been paused or officially canceled, in some cases even after they had already begun construction. Part of that is because consumer adoption of EVs in these markets has proved to be a much more gradual process than in China.

Chinese battery makers planned aggressive global expansions at a time when governments were giving generous subsidies to factory projects and tax credits to consumers who bought electric cars, and they now have to recalibrate as that enthusiasm wanes. In the US, the Inflation Reduction Act passed under Joe Biden incentivized both Chinese and American companies to build factories, but then the EV subsidies outlined in the legislation were canceled under President Donald Trump. Even Europe, which previously set a goal to cease gas car production entirely by 2035, is now having second thoughts.

“Battery manufacturers, of course, would be less incentivized to make a big investment if they are not sure what the policy direction is,” says Alexander Brown, a senior analyst studying industrial policy at the Mercator Institute for China Studies.

What if the world doesn’t want EVs? Some battery companies are already deploying a backup plan: pivot to energy storage. Ford, which is building a massive battery plant in Michigan using CATL’s manufacturing technology, announced in December that it would shift from making EV batteries to producing those for energy storage. Envision AESC, another major Chinese battery company whose plans to expand in the US were on pause for most of last year, also recently announced its existing plant in Tennessee will shift from making EV batteries to storage batteries.

While some parts of the traditional car industry might be lobbying against EVs, everyone seems happy about having more batteries in grids and homes that can prevent power outages and even allow consumers to sell electricity back to the grid. (Well, at least almost everyone. The Pakistani national utility operator and the Chinese banks that lend money to it are not so happy about the rise of Chinese storage batteries, as another piece in our package expertly discussed.)

The good news at least is that energy storage technology has seldom been politicized. In the US, both deeply Democratic California and Republican Texas have become heavy adopters of grid-level battery storage, so Chinese ambitions for building more factories will likely not go completely to waste.

Reverse Technology Transfer

For the partner companies and governments working with Chinese battery makers to bring factories to their countries, the goal has always been clear: exchange market access and subsidies for the promise that these firms will eventually train local workers to produce state-of-the-art batteries on their own.

The irony here should not be lost on anyone who is paying attention to the global automotive industry. Over the last three decades, American, European, Japanese, and Korean automakers were happy to exchange their technological know-how for access to the Chinese auto market. But today, that relationship has been reversed.

Ford CEO Jim Farley laid out this dynamic clearly in an interview with New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman last year: “The way we compete with them is to get access to their IP, just the way they needed ours 20 years ago, and then use our innovative ecosystem and American ingenuity and our great scale and our intimacy with the customer to beat them globally,” he explained.

French President Emmanuel Macron doubled down on the same idea at the World Economic Forum this week, saying China is welcome to invest in Europe if it can “contribute to our growth, to transfer some technologies, and not just to export towards Europe.”

This is the right approach, says Brian Engle, chairman of NAATBatt International, a US trade association for the battery industry. Engle used to be a gas car engineer, but he has now transitioned to researching battery safety. Just like the European countries, he predicts, the US is going to learn to “bring that revenue home, we're gonna enable these new technologies, we're gonna grow our economy.” At the moment, “the only long game we keep betting on is petroleum which, frankly, shows zero vision. This is a technology evolution that's not reversing,” Engle says.

Beginning Friday, an extreme weather pattern of Arctic cold is expected to evolve and bring extremely low temperatures and heavy snow and ice, with the potential to create significant challenges for the electric grid through next week. That was the assessment given on Thursday by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, the top regulator for power reliability in the United States.

The Reuters Power Up newsletter provides everything you need to know about the global energy industry. Sign up here.

Cold weather has already started to reduce gas supplies by freezing oil and gas wells and pipes in several Midwest and Great Plains states .

As a result, U.S. natural gas futures soared by a record 63% over the past three days to a six-week high on Thursday on forecasts of extreme cold over the next two weeks.

Demand next week is expected to approach last winter's record as homes and businesses crank up their heaters to escape a brutal cold snap, according to power grid operators, analysts and data from financial firm LSEG.

Meanwhile, winter electricity demand on the largest U.S. power grid - the PJM Interconnection - is expected to set an all-time record next week.

""Peak demand has the potential to exceed 130,000 MW for seven straight days next week, a winter streak that PJM has never experienced,"" the grid operator said on Thursday in a cautionary alert.

""Depending on temperatures, PJM could set a new all-time winter peak load on Jan. 27. And that cold could extend into early February, so PJM is taking additional precautions with its generation and transmission owners to prepare.""

PJM serves 67 million people in 13 states and Washington, D.C. It has been struggling to keep up with booming demand from the proliferation of Big Tech's power-hungry data centers needed for the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence.

In recent years, regional grids, including PJM, have been caught flat-footed by extreme weather.

The worst episode happened in Texas in early 2021 when more than 200 people died as the state's main grid lost nearly 50% of its generation capacity. Millions of Texans were left without power, including the family of an 11-year-old boy who froze to death while sleeping in his bed.

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the state's main grid operator, was criticized in after-action reports for not making sure the system was properly winterized.

Since then, stricter state and federal rules have been implemented to require better winter readiness by utilities and grid operators. ERCOT, for example, plans to complete a minimum of 450 inspections this winter season (December–February). As of January 18, 240 inspections had been completed, ERCOT said.

But the gap between winter and summer peaks is narrowing, caused by rapid data center growth, said Philip Krein, a grid expert at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

That means utilities have less time to take power plants offline, for example, to perform maintenance.

""That makes the grid more vulnerable,"" Krein said. ""The maintenance season is being squeezed like never before.""

ERCOT and PJM both said they expected they will have enough generation to meet demand this winter.

However, ERCOT has forecast there's a slight chance - 1.18% - of a small, controlled blackout on the morning of January 31.

ERCOT CEO Pablo Vegas said on Thursday he was confident the Texas grid will be able to handle the demands of cold weather.

The ‌move was the latest by President Donald Trump's administration to favor fossil fuels and ‌nuclear energy while eliminating subsidies for alternative energy like wind and solar.

The changes by the Office of Energy Dominance Financing, or EDF, come after a review of $104 billion in loans made during the Biden administration with ⁠the majority of that coming ‌after the 2024 presidential election. The office was known then as the Loan Programs Office.

The Trump administration has ‍canceled or is in the process of terminating nearly $30 billion in loan obligations, the department said. The cancellations include, for example, one from last year of $4.9 ​billion for the Grain Belt Express transmission project to send power ‌from wind and solar energy projects to cities in the Midwest and East.

The Trump administration has eliminated about $9.5 billion in loans to wind and solar projects and where possible has replaced those by supporting new capacity at natural gas and nuclear power plants, the department said.

President Biden issued Executive Order 14008 shortly after taking office, directing the Department of the Interior (DOI) to pause new oil and gas leasing on public lands and offshore waters pending a comprehensive review. This leasing moratorium quickly met legal resistance. In Louisiana v. Biden, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana held that the pause violated OCSLA’s mandate for regular lease sales under the existing five-year program. The court enjoined DOI from implementing the pause, emphasizing that executive discretion under OCSLA does not permit indefinite suspension of congressionally mandated leasing.

In response to litigation, Congress included offshore leasing mandates in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). The IRA required DOI to reinstate Lease Sale 257 and to hold additional lease sales, including Lease Sales 258, 259, and 261, by specific deadlines.

Presidential Authority and Offshore Energy Policy Shifts

While fossil leasing slowed under the Biden administration, offshore wind (OSW) development accelerated, with a national goal of deploying 30 GW of OSW capacity by 2030. Record-breaking lease sales occurred in the New York Bight and California, and new wind energy areas were identified off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.

Presidential control over offshore energy development extends beyond leasing decisions to withdrawal authority. OCSLA section 12(a) authorizes the president to “withdraw from disposition any of the unleased lands of the outer Continental Shelf.” President Obama used this authority to withdraw large portions of the Arctic and Atlantic OCS from future leasing.

President Trump attempted to revoke these withdrawals via executive order, but in League of Conservation Voters v. Trump, a federal court ruled that OCSLA does not permit a president to unilaterally reverse a predecessor’s withdrawal; only Congress may do so.

This legal framework became directly relevant with the January 2025 change in administration. On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued a presidential memorandum under OCSLA section 12(a), withdrawing all areas of the Outer Continental Shelf from new offshore wind leasing and directing a comprehensive review of the federal permitting process for wind projects. While existing leases remain in force, no new or renewed wind lease approvals may be issued during the review period.

Simultaneously, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum directed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) to halt construction and permitting activities on previously approved offshore wind projects—including Empire Wind I and RWE’s U.S. developments—pending new environmental reviews. These administrative reversals introduced significant uncertainty into the OSW sector, reversing much of the prior administration’s policy trajectory.

Despite this shift, offshore oil and gas leasing has continued to progress. In April 2025, DOI initiated the development of the 11th National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program by publishing a request for information (RFI) covering all 27 planning areas, including the newly defined High Arctic offshore Alaska area. The RFI comment period closed on June 16, 2025. Separately, on June 25, 2025, BOEM issued a Proposed Notice of Sale for Lease Sale 262, expected to be held in December 2025 and to include approximately 15,000 blocks across the Gulf. These developments underscore a renewed push for oil and gas leasing under the combined influence of statutory and administrative planning.

Decommissioning Challenges and Legislative Solutions

Beyond leasing, decommissioning of aging offshore infrastructure presents growing legal and fiscal challenges. The Government Accountability Office reported that over 2,700 wells and 500 platforms in the Gulf were overdue for decommissioning as of 2023.

To address this, the BOEM finalized a rule in 2024 updating financial assurance requirements for offshore operators. The rule requires operators lacking sufficient financial strength to post supplemental bonds or other security to ensure decommissioning obligations are met.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB) enacted in 2025 further reshapes this landscape. OBBB directly addresses uncertainties in OCSLA section 18’s requirements that leases must be for areas included in approved leasing programs and contain provisions consistent with those programs. Section 50102 of the OBBB provides that “notwithstanding” the Biden administration’s 2024–2029 program—the smallest leasing program in history, offering only one sale every two years in the Gulf with no sales elsewhere—the secretary must hold at least 30 “region-wide” sales in the Gulf through 2040.

The statute establishes specific timing requirements including the secretary must hold at least one sale no later than December 15, 2025, followed by at least two sales annually from 2026 through 2039, and at least one additional sale by March 15, 2040. The OBBB also mandates six Cook Inlet sales between 2026 and 2032, expanding the footprint of offshore activity.

Under section 50102, the secretary is directed to offer tracts under the same terms as the 2020 proposed Lease Sale 254, which included 10 lease stipulations. Six of these stipulations must be included in future sales without modification, while the remaining four may be modified “to reflect current conditions.” The OBBB includes override language ensuring it prevails over any subsequent leasing program not consistent with the law’s requirements.

The legislation restores federal offshore royalty rates to a 12.5 percent minimum, caps them at 16.67 percent, and increases revenue sharing for Gulf states under the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, providing additional funding that could indirectly support coastal restoration and decommissioning oversight. OBBB also directs BSEE to approve commingling of production across leases unless safety or production would be reduced, a measure likely to affect infrastructure planning and eventual decommissioning liability.

These statutory changes will increase the scale and importance of decommissioning oversight. Combined with BOEM’s strengthened financial assurance requirements, they signal a clear shift toward ensuring that operators, not taxpayers, bear the cost of dismantling aging offshore infrastructure.

Offshore energy policy has entered a new era defined by rapid regulatory shifts, enhanced congressional oversight, and evolving interpretations of executive authority under OCSLA. The current administration’s reversal of offshore wind priorities while accelerating fossil fuel leasing demonstrates the continued volatility in federal energy policy and law. As OCSLA continues to develop, practitioners must navigate not only changing political winds but also an increasingly structured legal framework that limits executive discretion while ensuring long-term environmental and fiscal accountability.",https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/aba-stock/16x9/16x9-oil-rig-1757271699.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 17:57:46.300846

In 2026, the renewable energy industry is facing considerable headwinds from Trump administration policies.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act set a new July 4 deadline for wind and solar projects to start construction to qualify for the Inflation Reduction Act’s production and investment tax credits, most notably. It also set new, strict foreign entity of concern rules for which the Treasury Department has yet to issue final guidance.

The OBBBA was “definitely a bad outcome for the industry, worse than most people expected,” said Dan Smith, vice president of markets at DSD Renewables, a provider of distributed renewable energy resources.

“I think we all expected something to happen, but this was a little more draconian than we and most people we know were hoping for,” he added.

“Now is the time to be disciplined and focused and be realistic about what projects we’re going to be able to complete under the ITC and which ones are just likely not going to benefit.”

The administration is also dragging out the timeline for approving projects in federal lands and waters. The Department of the Interior has been issuing stop-work orders to offshore wind projects and revoking their permits, and it cancelled its environmental review for the 6.2-GW Esmeralda 7 solar project on federal land in Nevada, saying it would instead review each of the seven project components individually.

Renewables poised to meet rising demand

Despite these setbacks, some industry sectors still see considerable opportunity for renewables in the U.S., as renewable energy generation can often come online more quickly and cheaply than a fossil fuel plant.

Analysts continue to forecast staggering load growth over the next five years, and supply chain bottlenecks are resulting in five- to eight-year estimates for the deployment of new gas generation. The newest nuclear reactors took about 15 years to complete.

New utility-scale solar and wind generation, in contrast, can deploy in as little as a year and now account for most new generating capacity.

Solar alone provided 58% of new generating capacity in 2024 and 72% of new capacity through the first 10 months of 2025. Wind and solar together accounted for 87% of new capacity added from January to October last year and make up 83% of “high probability” additions over the next three years, according to the latest federal data.

Of total installed generating capacity in the U.S., natural gas leads with 42%, but solar and wind account for nearly 12% each.

“While certain parts of the industry, like the residential side, have been hit pretty hard, the interesting thing is that, for a lot of the rest of us, it’s business as usual,” said Robb Jetty, CEO of REC Solar, which develops on-site and community solar and storage. “And the forecast that’s playing out with regards to increasing electricity costs and availability of power solutions — the future actually looks just as bright as it has previously. So it’s not quite the doom-and-gloom scenario that I think many thought it would be.”

The OBBBA sunsetted the Inflation Reduction Act’s residential solar credit at the end of 2025; commercial projects that commence construction by July 4 this year can still qualify for production and investment tax credits as long as they’re placed in service by Dec. 31, 2030. Projects that don’t commence construction by July 4 can still qualify if they’re placed in service by Dec. 31, 2027. Tax credits benefitting energy storage were largely left intact.

“We see the opportunity for renewables, and renewables-plus-storage in particular, to be really quite in focus to meet those demands over the near term,” said Keith Adams, Deloitte’s U.S. renewable energy leader. “Because the reality is that a solar-plus-storage or even a wind-plus-storage project can likely be implemented before you can see other technologies, like gas and nuclear, actually serve those loads in the long term.”

Adams noted that as data center deployment soars, storage offers the ability to “serve a 24-by-7 load — what a lot of these data centers really need.” However, the pressure from shifting federal policy is affecting how developers approach the load growth opportunity, he said.

“It’s impacting how folks prioritize their portfolio,” he said. “It’s impacting how folks are impacted by project costs, component costs for the projects, as well as the tariffs that are, in some cases, new for the components of those projects. It’s reshaping technology choices and really forcing people to make decisions to prioritize their efforts on putting assets in the ground quickly.”

One year into Trump’s second term and six months since the OBBBA’s shearing of the IRA, Smith said the industry is “clearly” going to be contracting — in response to the curtailment of the investment tax credit in particular.

“We’re taking a look and focusing on the most actionable projects, the most profitable projects,” Smith said. “Now is the time to be disciplined and focused and be realistic about what projects we’re going to be able to complete under the ITC, and which ones are just likely not going to benefit [from it]. And then we’re looking forward to the post-ITC world, and starting to plan for what that looks like.”

Harry Godfrey, a managing director at Advanced Energy United who leads their federal priorities team, said the U.S. saw a “significant pull forward” of renewable energy projects in the third quarter of 2025. He expects fourth-quarter data to show the same, but was less certain about the picture for 2026.

“I’ll be really interested to see whether or not that is sustained in the face of growing headwinds,” he said. “Because we enter this period where you have that FEOC compliance obligation, and at least as of this moment, we don’t know what that looks like in detail.”

“The forecast that’s playing out with regards to increasing electricity costs and availability of power solutions — the future actually looks just as bright as it has previously. So it’s not quite the doom-and-gloom scenario that I think many thought it would be.”

Robb Jetty

CEO of REC Solar

Jetty noted that the industry is accustomed to a certain level of instability.

“While this year was, arguably, as tumultuous as we’ve ever seen it,” he said, “if there’s anything consistent, it’s that federal policies and implications for our industry are constantly changing.”

New strategies and new horizons

Smith said two major concerns are the current lack of clarity on FEOC compliance and the Treasury Department’s elimination of the 5% safe harbor test to qualify projects over 1.5 MW as having begun construction.

Now he’s looking at projects as existing within three categories: mature projects, for which he has high confidence they can be placed in service by the end of 2027; less mature projects, for which he has high confidence they can commence construction by July 4; and projects at risk of not meeting either of those marks.

“We don’t feel very good about projects that don’t fit one of those categories, and that means those projects — we have canceled some of them, or reduced some of them to below 1.5 MW,” Smith said. “But that’s the decision everyone is facing … It’s all part of facing reality and being disciplined to make the right calls here.”

DSD Renewables is monitoring whether or not states are tracking the ITC deadlines, Smith said, and “whether they will implement changes to make sure utilities are meeting the interconnection timelines, getting projects interconnected efficiently, and allow us to meet the deadline of the end of 2027.”

“There are going to be deadlines every Dec. 31 for the next few years, even beyond 2027, so we’re going to need to be able to hold utilities accountable,” he said.

Godfrey said he’s focused on how state leadership will continue to navigate the current complexities around energy deployment.

States should “find every way possible to expedite and ease the development and construction and interconnection of a host of advanced energy projects, which obviously includes renewables, but we can look to transmission and a host of transmission-related pieces in there too,” Godfrey said.

As an example of this, he cited the October passage of the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act in Illinois, which expanded on the state’s 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. CRGA directs Illinois utilities to install 3 GW of grid-scale energy storage by 2030, lifts a moratorium on new nuclear plants in the state and introduces an integrated resource planning process.

It also strengthens the state’s Renewable Energy Access Plan, one of the goals of which is to reform transmission interconnection and unlock clean energy currently waiting in interconnection queues. Throughout the U.S., solar wind and battery projects make up as much as 95% of the capacity in these queues.

Kasparas Spokas, director of the electricity program at the Clean Air Task Force, said he anticipates both opportunities and challenges to accelerating renewable deployment at the state and regional levels.

He noted “positive signs from unexpected regions,” such as the Electric Reliability Council of Texas’s recent approvals of significant transmission upgrades, “which should result at least in some new wind developments being built.”

Nicole Pavia, CATF’s director for clean energy infrastructure, noted that California recently passed SB-254, which created a transmission investment accelerator that will facilitate public-private financing for transmission in California.

“So we are seeing increasing interest at the state level to be more creative about financing,” Pavia said. She pointed to increased attention to solutions like grid-enhancing technologies, advanced transmission technologies and reconductoring — “things that we can do and technologies we can implement to make the best use of the lines that we have available, and increase their capacity where possible.”

“How do you get a project funded, and how do you build it? How do you interconnect it onto the transmission network? And then, how might you participate in markets – how do you get compensated, and how do you make sure the rules don’t change once you’re in it?”

Sam Uyeno

Partner at West Monroe

Godfrey also noted that solutions that maximize existing resources will better match the speed with which demand is coming online in the near term.

“You can definitely get a solar farm online in 18 to 24 months if you have the permits in place, if you move up the interconnection queue,” he said. “But you can stand up a [distributed energy resource] program in weeks, if not months. You can stand up an aggregated DER program in a few months to maybe a year. You can reconductor a line in a year or less.”

Financial and other headwinds

Because of the new FEOC rules and the Trump administration’s new tariffs, developers are “spending a lot more time on their supply chain,” Adams said, and they are “really focused on making sure they both know where capacity can come from and know that they can be compliant with requirements.”

Developers also are focused on efficient operations in response to the tightening of credit windows, Adams said. They are seeking “consistency of design and execution of construction, and consistency in the operations of those assets when they are in service, so they can make sure they optimize run time and optimize the way they can serve the [power purchase agreements] that they’re a part of, or serve the markets that they’re in.”

Smith described uneasiness around the lack of final guidance on the FEOC rule, which went into effect Dec. 31, 2025.

“A requirement is in place, but there’s not full transparency or full clarity on how to comply with it,” he said. “So what we’re going to have to do is be conservative.”

A lack of certainty or predictability has always been a problem for the renewable energy industry, said Sam Uyeno, a partner at West Monroe. Prior to the IRA, clean energy tax credits were offered with much shorter timelines. But the current environment is particularly difficult, he said, with shifting sands at both the federal and state level.

“I think we all would have liked to have more options readily available for us today, and that we would have commercialized some of these options in the past. So let’s not make the same mistake twice.”

Kasparas Spokas

Director of the electricity program at Clean Air Task Force

“How do you get a project funded, and how do you build it? How do you interconnect it onto the transmission network? And then, how might you participate in markets — how do you get compensated, and how do you make sure the rules don’t change once you’re in it?” Uyeno said.

Bottlenecks exist at various junctures of the value chain, he said, “and we come up with permitting strategies and different policies, and then suddenly the bottleneck switches to another place in the value chain.”

The transmission and interconnection timelines for renewable projects are “really challenging,” Uyeno said. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s Order 2023, which requires a first-ready, first-served cluster study approach for grid interconnection, is starting to be put into practice, but “how it actually gets implemented and everybody’s ability to execute on it still has yet to be seen,” he said. “We’re starting to see some of it in the Pacific Gas & Electric territory here in California because they’re doing cluster studies more specifically for larger data center interconnections.”

While courts continue to strike down the Trump administration’s various stop-work orders against the five offshore wind projects currently under construction, those decisions often take days or weeks to come down, costing developers millions as they wait. In general, this leads to a great deal of uncertainty for the entire industry, Pavia said.

Dominion Energy, the utility developing the 2.6 GW Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project, said in a complaint against a December stop work order that CVOW will “provide electricity to serve the world’s largest concentration of data centers,” that wind development is necessary to meet growing demand, and that the administration’s actions are driven by “systematic and unfounded animus against wind energy.”

The U.S. offshore wind industry is currently facing strong headwinds and “a bleak outlook,” said Kevin Beicke, a vice president at Morningstar DBRS. “Not only for 2026, but the next three years, through 2028.”

“I think the Trump administration is trying to signal to the offshore wind industry that the U.S. is not open for business for future development,” Beicke said. “Any other potential developer of offshore wind projects would be seeing this and would view it unfavorably for their development of potential future projects over the next three years of the Trump administration.”

The cumulative impact of these delays is worth noting, Godfrey said, “not just on renewables in general, but on the energy industry as a whole. I suspect that this will be something that we see being part of the conversation in 2026, is how uncertainty in a specific segment of the industry can spread and contaminate the larger industry as a whole.”

The investment community financing offshore wind projects and hydrogen pipelines is the same one that’s considering investments in next-generation nuclear or new natural gas pipelines, Godfrey said. Thus, the stop-work orders could potentially result in a larger chilling effect if energy investments are seen as unstable, he added.

Spokas noted that there is a “lot of uncertainty” in current load growth forecasts, and it is a “core challenge to manage that uncertainty over time, given you need long lead times for infrastructure planning and procurement.”

Regardless, he said, “we should expect higher load growth to persist, to fuel various types of new electrified loads as the economy decarbonizes,” which provides “an opportunity to advance new solutions, or solutions that haven’t been deployed in the past.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/8GwWkpBl6aY9tdzSz-EN3NaoRNKoP-R6Fu7uAuJGz-M/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9taXN0X2FuZF93aW5kLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2026-01-22 19:38:39.387184

Subcommittee Chairman Palmer’s opening statement as prepared for delivery:

“Good afternoon and welcome to Ranking Members Pallone, Tonko, my colleagues, and to our witnesses for this hearing of the Subcommittee on the Environment.

“Today we will be examining a legislative proposal to modernize the Toxic Substances Control Act – or TSCA.

“First enacted into law in 1976 with broad bipartisan support, TSCA provides the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with broad authority to regulate chemicals that pose an unreasonable risk to human health and the environment.

“Forty years later, Congress made several improvements to TSCA with passage of the bipartisan Lautenberg Amendments in 2016.

“As we heard at our hearing last January, chemicals are central to many aspects of modern life, and a strong, U.S. chemical industry is key to our economic prosperity and national security.

“The 2016 law authorized EPA to collect user fees to help provide resources and funding but in the decade since the Lautenberg Amendments were passed, it has become clear that this important law is still not working as Congress intended and that further changes are needed to ensure chemicals are reviewed in a predictable and efficient process without undermining safety.

“The process for reviewing new chemicals – which was a significant focus of the 2016 effort – is broken. As we heard in January and will again hear from witnesses today, EPA does not meet the 90-day review deadline for the vast majority of all new chemicals submitted for EPA review. This regulatory uncertainty makes it difficult for the chemical industry to bring safer alternatives or new technology to the market in the U.S. and impacts human health and the environment by slowing the transition to safer alternatives.

“To be clear: The draft would not scrap the safety protections enacted in the 2016 Amendments and is not reopening up TSCA as a whole.

“The bill would reauthorize the fee provision for another 10 years and require increased transparency and accountability in how fees are used by EPA.

“The draft also makes targeted changes to modernize section 5 and section 6 concerning the review and regulations of new and existing chemicals, including requiring increased coordination between EPA and other agencies and prioritizing chemicals that are essential to critical manufacturing supply chains.

“Our witnesses today are: Dimitri Karakitsos, a partner at the law firm Holland & Knight who worked on the 2016 Amendments as a Senate staffer; Dr. Kimberly Wise White of the American Chemistry Council, John Carey of DSM-Firmenich, an international chemical manufacturer with significant operations in the U.S., and Professor Tracey Woodruff of the University of California, San Francisco.

“The legislation we are considering today is a discussion draft. It reflects input the Subcommittee received at our January hearing and in the months since.

“Majority staff also met with their counterparts on the minority staff half a dozen times to discuss ideas and language for this proposal, and several changes were made to the text based on input from minority staff.

“We look forward to getting additional feedback in the weeks after this hearing and hope to continue discussions with the minority on areas for bipartisan cooperation as we work on an updated draft, prepare legislation for introduction, and plan for a future markup to advance this important legislation.”

The Supreme Court appeal is “a last-ditch push by gas utilities to keep the least efficient furnace types going into homes, locking families into higher bills,” said Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project.","Gas industry trade groups on Tuesday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review an appeals court decision upholding Biden-era energy efficiency rules that they say ban the sale of non-condensing natural gas furnaces and other products.

The U.S. Department of Energy in 2023 and 2024 finalized stricter standards for consumer furnaces and commercial water heaters. But the tighter efficiency requirements would essentially block non-condensing versions of the products from the market, the gas groups say.

Traditional non-condensing water heaters and furnaces can reach efficiency rates of about 80%, while condensing appliances are typically 90% efficient or greater, according to DOE. Most of the greater efficiency comes from their conversion of excess heat to vapor that’s used for additional heating.

But non-condensing natural gas furnaces make up more than half of the U.S. market and cannot be replaced by other furnace types, the American Gas Association, American Public Gas Association and National Propane Gas Association said in a statement. “Their removal from the market would saddle families with costly renovations or eliminate gas as a home heating option all together,” the groups said.

The groups previously challenged the new rules, arguing that they violated the Energy Policy and Conservation Act by resulting in the removal of a product type or a class of performance characteristics. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit sided with DOE, concluding that the way heat is vented does not qualify as a performance characteristic of an appliance.

In its Supreme Court petition, the gas groups said the appeals court decision “reflects not only legal error but also practical folly.”

“These regulations eliminate non-condensing gas furnaces and commercial water heaters, which work with the chimneys and natural-draft venting already in millions of American homes and businesses,” the groups said. “The only alternative is abandoning gas appliances and switching to electric ones.”

This scenario “is why the law does not allow the government to use efficiency rulemakings to eliminate products that consumers need to be able to access,” AGA President and CEO Karen Harbert said in a statement. The Supreme Court “must take up this case and protect the American people from this unlawful regulation that would increase costs ... and ban an entire product class of appliances.”

Advocates for the stricter efficiency rules say furnace technology has advanced beyond existing standards, and the new rules can be met with proven energy-saving technologies.

“I’ll be really interested to see whether or not that is sustained in the face of growing headwinds,” he said. “Because we enter this period where you have that FEOC compliance obligation, and at least as of this moment, we don’t know what that looks like in detail.”

“The forecast that’s playing out with regards to increasing electricity costs and availability of power solutions — the future actually looks just as bright as it has previously. So it’s not quite the doom-and-gloom scenario that I think many thought it would be.”

CEO of REC Solar

Jetty noted that the industry is accustomed to a certain level of instability.

“While this year was, arguably, as tumultuous as we’ve ever seen it,” he said, “if there’s anything consistent, it’s that federal policies and implications for our industry are constantly changing.”

New strategies and new horizons

Smith said two major concerns are the current lack of clarity on FEOC compliance and the Treasury Department’s elimination of the 5% safe harbor test to qualify projects over 1.5 MW as having begun construction.

Now he’s looking at projects as existing within three categories: mature projects, for which he has high confidence they can be placed in service by the end of 2027; less mature projects, for which he has high confidence they can commence construction by July 4; and projects at risk of not meeting either of those marks.

“We don’t feel very good about projects that don’t fit one of those categories, and that means those projects — we have canceled some of them, or reduced some of them to below 1.5 MW,” Smith said. “But that’s the decision everyone is facing … It’s all part of facing reality and being disciplined to make the right calls here.”

DSD Renewables is monitoring whether or not states are tracking the ITC deadlines, Smith said, and “whether they will implement changes to make sure utilities are meeting the interconnection timelines, getting projects interconnected efficiently, and allow us to meet the deadline of the end of 2027.”

“There are going to be deadlines every Dec. 31 for the next few years, even beyond 2027, so we’re going to need to be able to hold utilities accountable,” he said.

Godfrey said he’s focused on how state leadership will continue to navigate the current complexities around energy deployment.

States should “find every way possible to expedite and ease the development and construction and interconnection of a host of advanced energy projects, which obviously includes renewables, but we can look to transmission and a host of transmission-related pieces in there too,” Godfrey said.

As an example of this, he cited the October passage of the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act in Illinois, which expanded on the state’s 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. CRGA directs Illinois utilities to install 3 GW of grid-scale energy storage by 2030, lifts a moratorium on new nuclear plants in the state and introduces an integrated resource planning process.

It also strengthens the state’s Renewable Energy Access Plan, one of the goals of which is to reform transmission interconnection and unlock clean energy currently waiting in interconnection queues. Throughout the U.S., solar wind and battery projects make up as much as 95% of the capacity in these queues.

Kasparas Spokas, director of the electricity program at the Clean Air Task Force, said he anticipates both opportunities and challenges to accelerating renewable deployment at the state and regional levels.

He noted “positive signs from unexpected regions,” such as the Electric Reliability Council of Texas’s recent approvals of significant transmission upgrades, “which should result at least in some new wind developments being built.”

Nicole Pavia, CATF’s director for clean energy infrastructure, noted that California recently passed SB-254, which created a transmission investment accelerator that will facilitate public-private financing for transmission in California.

“So we are seeing increasing interest at the state level to be more creative about financing,” Pavia said. She pointed to increased attention to solutions like grid-enhancing technologies, advanced transmission technologies and reconductoring — “things that we can do and technologies we can implement to make the best use of the lines that we have available, and increase their capacity where possible.”

“How do you get a project funded, and how do you build it? How do you interconnect it onto the transmission network? And then, how might you participate in markets – how do you get compensated, and how do you make sure the rules don’t change once you’re in it?”

Sam Uyeno

Partner at West Monroe

Godfrey also noted that solutions that maximize existing resources will better match the speed with which demand is coming online in the near term.

“You can definitely get a solar farm online in 18 to 24 months if you have the permits in place, if you move up the interconnection queue,” he said. “But you can stand up a [distributed energy resource] program in weeks, if not months. You can stand up an aggregated DER program in a few months to maybe a year. You can reconductor a line in a year or less.”

Financial and other headwinds

Because of the new FEOC rules and the Trump administration’s new tariffs, developers are “spending a lot more time on their supply chain,” Adams said, and they are “really focused on making sure they both know where capacity can come from and know that they can be compliant with requirements.”

Developers also are focused on efficient operations in response to the tightening of credit windows, Adams said. They are seeking “consistency of design and execution of construction, and consistency in the operations of those assets when they are in service, so they can make sure they optimize run time and optimize the way they can serve the [power purchase agreements] that they’re a part of, or serve the markets that they’re in.”

Smith described uneasiness around the lack of final guidance on the FEOC rule, which went into effect Dec. 31, 2025.

“A requirement is in place, but there’s not full transparency or full clarity on how to comply with it,” he said. “So what we’re going to have to do is be conservative.”

A lack of certainty or predictability has always been a problem for the renewable energy industry, said Sam Uyeno, a partner at West Monroe. Prior to the IRA, clean energy tax credits were offered with much shorter timelines. But the current environment is particularly difficult, he said, with shifting sands at both the federal and state level.

“I think we all would have liked to have more options readily available for us today, and that we would have commercialized some of these options in the past. So let’s not make the same mistake twice.”

Kasparas Spokas

Director of the electricity program at Clean Air Task Force

“How do you get a project funded, and how do you build it? How do you interconnect it onto the transmission network? And then, how might you participate in markets — how do you get compensated, and how do you make sure the rules don’t change once you’re in it?” Uyeno said.

Bottlenecks exist at various junctures of the value chain, he said, “and we come up with permitting strategies and different policies, and then suddenly the bottleneck switches to another place in the value chain.”

The transmission and interconnection timelines for renewable projects are “really challenging,” Uyeno said. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s Order 2023, which requires a first-ready, first-served cluster study approach for grid interconnection, is starting to be put into practice, but “how it actually gets implemented and everybody’s ability to execute on it still has yet to be seen,” he said. “We’re starting to see some of it in the Pacific Gas & Electric territory here in California because they’re doing cluster studies more specifically for larger data center interconnections.”

While courts continue to strike down the Trump administration’s various stop-work orders against the five offshore wind projects currently under construction, those decisions often take days or weeks to come down, costing developers millions as they wait. In general, this leads to a great deal of uncertainty for the entire industry, Pavia said.

Dominion Energy, the utility developing the 2.6 GW Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project, said in a complaint against a December stop work order that CVOW will “provide electricity to serve the world’s largest concentration of data centers,” that wind development is necessary to meet growing demand, and that the administration’s actions are driven by “systematic and unfounded animus against wind energy.”

The U.S. offshore wind industry is currently facing strong headwinds and “a bleak outlook,” said Kevin Beicke, a vice president at Morningstar DBRS. “Not only for 2026, but the next three years, through 2028.”

“I think the Trump administration is trying to signal to the offshore wind industry that the U.S. is not open for business for future development,” Beicke said. “Any other potential developer of offshore wind projects would be seeing this and would view it unfavorably for their development of potential future projects over the next three years of the Trump administration.”

The cumulative impact of these delays is worth noting, Godfrey said, “not just on renewables in general, but on the energy industry as a whole. I suspect that this will be something that we see being part of the conversation in 2026, is how uncertainty in a specific segment of the industry can spread and contaminate the larger industry as a whole.”

The investment community financing offshore wind projects and hydrogen pipelines is the same one that’s considering investments in next-generation nuclear or new natural gas pipelines, Godfrey said. Thus, the stop-work orders could potentially result in a larger chilling effect if energy investments are seen as unstable, he added.

Spokas noted that there is a “lot of uncertainty” in current load growth forecasts, and it is a “core challenge to manage that uncertainty over time, given you need long lead times for infrastructure planning and procurement.”

Regardless, he said, “we should expect higher load growth to persist, to fuel various types of new electrified loads as the economy decarbonizes,” which provides “an opportunity to advance new solutions, or solutions that haven’t been deployed in the past.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/8GwWkpBl6aY9tdzSz-EN3NaoRNKoP-R6Fu7uAuJGz-M/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9taXN0X2FuZF93aW5kLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2026-01-22 16:40:59.657901

(WOOD) — The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy on Wednesday released its annual MI Healthy Climate Plan Report, touting notable gains toward a more sustainable future.

According to EGLE, Michigan made measurable gains in cutting greenhouse gas emissions and expanded clean energy and other equitable climate solutions.

One of the biggest highlights is the notable decline in Michigan’s greenhouse gas inventory. According the data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Michigan’s carbon dioxide emissions have declined by 20% from 2005 to 2021. EGLE noted that data confidentiality and modeling limitations force the EPA’s “State Inventory Tool” to run “2-3 years behind.”

Transportation and the state’s electric power grid are the two biggest carbon dioxide offenders, according to EPA data. The power grid comprises 29.43% of all CO2 emissions. Transportation makes 26.03%. The state is seeing progress in both.

At the end of 2025, Michigan had an estimated 8,300 megawatts of electricity generated by renewable resources. That’s up from approximately 7,600 megawatts in 2024 and 1,900 megawatts in 2018. That figure is expected to reach 17,800 megawatts by 2030.

The bulk of recent gains have come from expansion in solar energy. Approximately 4,500 megawatts of electricity now come from solar energy. That’s up from essentially 0 in 2018. Wind energy has stayed relatively static since plateauing around 3,000 megawatts in 2021.

EGLE also sees changes coming from the transportation sector. The number of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles has more than doubled over the last two years from approximately 53,000 to 121,000.

The state is also working to add to the infrastructure needed to support electric vehicles. The state has added 654 more high-speed charging stations across Michigan in 2025, up to 1,427 total.

“The rapid deployment of (DC Fast Chargers) is particularly significant for enabling long-distance travel and reducing range anxiety, with the 2025 DCFC network now nearly six times larger than it was just five years ago,” the report says.

Even more charging ports are coming because of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program. NEVI was established by the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

Michigan now has three NEVI charger sites up and running across the state. Seven more are under production and another 21 in the design phase. Another 51 sites have already been selected to house charging stations.

One of the operational NEVI stations is in Grand Rapids on Alpine Avenue south of I-96. Construction is underway for another at the Noonday Market off of US-131 in Shelbyville. Five more stations are in the design stage across West Michigan: Battle Creek, Holland, Muskegon, Portage and a second station off of Michigan Street in Grand Rapids. Another 17 have been selected as future sites.

EGLE Director Phil Roos said the report is the culmination of hard work and organization across state government and the result of the state’s commitment to protecting the environment.

“This report reminds us of the importance of our work as Michiganders to avert the worst impacts of climate change and to become more resilient,” Roos said in a statement. “Our investments and initiatives for a clean, sustainable, energy-efficient future will continue to pay real-world dividends — better air quality, affordable utility bills, good jobs, and more — for ourselves and future generations.”",https://www.woodtv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2026/01/consumers-energy-muskegon-solar-energy-center-3.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-22 15:57:48.084247

Data centers, domestic manufacturing, and other drivers of economic growth are generating significant new demand for electricity across the country. Grid operators are working to ensure that new generation capacity keeps pace. In PJM Interconnection—the nation’s largest grid operator—the December 2025 capacity auction fell 5.2% short of reliability requirements for the 2027-2028 delivery year, the first time PJM has experienced such a shortfall. Capacity auctions are a mechanism used in some regions for ensuring enough generation exists to meet projected demand. PJM’s shortfall has prompted two new proposals for how to accelerate new generation.

On January 16, 2026, the federal government and PJM each offered proposals to address this challenge. The Trump administration released a joint Statement of Principles with all 13 PJM state governors—a rare bipartisan coalition—calling for emergency market reforms. The same day, PJM’s Board of Managers released its own proposal, outlining a different path forward.

These proposals reflect a question facing grid operators nationwide: how can we most efficiently and effectively build out generation capacity to meet growing demand from data centers and other large loads? Both proposals attempt to answer that question—through different mechanisms and with different allocations of cost and risk.

Generator retirements have contributed to the capacity challenge. PJM explicitly cited “decreased supply offers into the auction due mainly to generator retirements” as a key factor. The numbers underscore the scale: approximately 54.2 GW of thermal capacity retired across PJM from 2011 to 2023, with an additional 24 to 58 GW—up to 30% of installed capacity—at risk of retirement by 2030 without identified replacement sources. Coal retirements have been significant, with 34 GW retired since 2013 and another 13,250 MW announced for retirement between 2024 and 2028. Critically, the resources in PJM’s interconnection queue cannot provide equivalent capacity value—PJM’s own analysis shows replacing 1 MW of thermal generation requires approximately 5.2 MW of solar or 14 MW of onshore wind.

The Statement of Principles

The White House National Energy Dominance Council and all 13 PJM state governors are calling for PJM to hold an emergency capacity auction by September 2026—a departure from normal market operations designed to accelerate new generation.

Core elements

15-year power purchase agreements. Tech companies would bid on long-term contracts with new generators, providing revenue certainty to support construction financing.

“Take or pay” structure. Data center operators would pay for contracted power whether they use it or not, transferring demand risk from ratepayers to the companies driving load growth.

$15 billion commitment. The administration announced that leading tech companies have agreed to fund this level of new generation, though specific participants were not named and no binding agreements exist.

Cost allocation to data centers. Generation costs would be allocated to data center customers that have not either self-procured capacity or agreed to curtailment during emergencies.

Price cap extension. A two-year extension of the price collar PJM implemented in 2025 to limit capacity cost increases.

Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro delivered pointed remarks, suggesting that Pennsylvania could pursue alternatives if reforms are not adopted: “Make no mistake, if PJM, this sort of faceless bureaucratic organization that is driving prices up on the American people, does not change and does not reflect what we are putting forth here today, Pennsylvania will be forced to act and forced to go it alone.”

PJM’s Response

PJM’s Board of Managers offered a different approach, emphasizing operational solutions and working within existing market frameworks.

Key components

“Connect and manage” with curtailment. Data centers can connect to the grid without bringing their own generation, but would be subject to earlier curtailment during system stress—among the first customers to have load reduced during reliability emergencies.

Bring Your Own Generation (BYOG). Large load customers can avoid curtailment requirements by self-supplying with dedicated generation.

Expedited interconnection track. A fast-track process for state-sponsored generation projects, targeted for implementation by August 2026.

Backstop procurement. Immediate initiation of a backstop generation procurement process to address short-term reliability needs through existing tariff mechanisms.

PJM Board Chair David Mills framed the plan as operational rather than political: “This is not a yes/no to data centers. This is ‘How can we do this while keeping the lights on and recognizing the impact on consumers?’”

Implications for Texas

Data centers represent a significant economic opportunity for Texas, and ERCOT faces similar challenges as PJM: how to harness that opportunity within its market framework while maintaining grid reliability.

PJM’s market structure differs from ERCOT’s—PJM operates a mandatory capacity market, spans 13 states with FERC jurisdiction, and has different interconnection frameworks. The specific proposals under debate would not translate directly to Texas.

But the underlying questions are similar to issues Texas began to address in Senate Bill 6, which established curtailment protocols and transmission cost allocation review for large loads interconnecting to ERCOT after December 2025. The PJM debate now puts those same questions—how to allocate infrastructure costs, whether curtailment should be part of the framework, how quickly regulators can move—in front of a national audience.

How PJM resolves these questions—through emergency procurement, curtailment requirements, market reforms, or some combination—will provide a reference point for other regions navigating the same opportunities.

What’s Next

The Statement of Principles carries political weight but no legal force—any emergency auction requires PJM to file tariff changes and FERC to approve them. PJM has not agreed to the governors’ framework; its own proposal suggests the grid operator prefers a different path. Key filings are due to FERC in the coming weeks. With the reliability gap arriving summer 2027, the question is whether political pressure can accelerate a regulatory process that typically moves in months, not weeks.

""Enforcing the Clean Air Act means going after violators within the oil, gas, petrochemical, coal, and motor vehicle industries that account for most air pollution,"" reads the report.
""But these White House favorites will be shielded from any serious enforcement, at least, while Lee Zeldin remains EPA’s administrator.""
Nearly 900 pollution sources reported to the EPA that they exceeded their wastewater discharge limits at least 50 times in the past two years.
The agency has also repealed its rules limiting carbon pollution from gas-powered cars, arguing that the EPA lacks the authority to regulate carbon.","The Trump administration settled just 15 of the illegal pollution cases referred by the US Environmental Protection Agency in the first year of President Donald Trump's second term in the White House, according to data compiled by a government watchdog—the latest evidence that Trump officials are placing corporate profits above the EPA's mission to ""protect human health and the environment.""

In the report, The Collapse of Environmental Enforcement Under Trump's EPA, Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) noted Thursday that in the first year of former President Joe Biden's administration, 71 cases referred by the EPA were prosecuted by the US Department of Justice (DOJ).

“Under [EPA Administrator] Lee Zeldin, anti-pollution enforcement is dying a quick death,” said Tim Whitehouse, executive director of PEER and a former enforcement attorney at EPA.

The DOJ lodged just one environmental consent decree in a case regarding a statutory violation of the Clean Air Act from the day Trump was inaugurated just over a year ago until now—signaling that the agency ""virtually stopped enforcing"" the landmark law that regulates air pollution.

""Enforcing the Clean Air Act means going after violators within the oil, gas, petrochemical, coal, and motor vehicle industries that account for most air pollution,"" reads the report. ""But these White House favorites will be shielded from any serious enforcement, at least, while Lee Zeldin remains EPA’s administrator.""

“For the sake of our health and the environment, Congress and the American people need to push back against Lee Zeldin’s dismantling of EPA’s environmental enforcement program.”

In the first year of his first term, Trump's DOJ settled 26 Clean Air Act cases, even more than the 22 the department prosecuted in Biden's first year.

The report warns that plummeting enforcement actions are likely to contribute to health harms in vulnerable communities located near waterways that are filled with ""algae blooms, bacteria, or toxic chemicals"" and near energy and chemical industry infrastructure, where people are more likely to suffer asthma attacks and heart disease caused by smog and soot.

“Enforcing environmental laws ensures that polluters are held accountable and prevented from dumping their pollution on others for profit,” said Joanna Citron Day, general counsel for PEER and a former senior counsel at DOJ’s Environmental Enforcement Section. “For the sake of our health and the environment, Congress and the American people need to push back against Lee Zeldin’s dismantling of EPA’s environmental enforcement program.”

EPA's own enforcement and compliance database identifies 2,374 major air pollution sources that have not had a full compliance evaluation in at least five years, and shows that no enforcement action has been taken at more than 400 sources that are marked as a ""high priority.""

Nearly 900 pollution sources reported to the EPA that they exceeded their wastewater discharge limits at least 50 times in the past two years.

The agency has also repealed its rules limiting carbon pollution from gas-powered cars, arguing that the EPA lacks the authority to regulate carbon.

As public health risks mount, PEER noted, Zeldin is moving forward with plans to stop calculating the health benefits of rules aimed at reducing air pollution, and issued a memo last month detailing a ""compliance first"" policy emphasizing a ""cooperative, industry-friendly approach"" to environmental regulation.

“Administrator Zeldin is removing all incentives for big polluters to follow the law,"" said Whitehouse, ""and turning a blind eye to those who suffer from the impacts of pollution.”",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=63081753&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C416%2C0%2C417,N,,2026-01-22 20:38:01.596494

The seven groups include Sierra Club, Environmental Law and Policy Center, and Earthjustice representing Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, Just Transition Northwest Indiana, Hoosier Environmental Council, and Public Citizen.

In December 2025, Donald Trump’s Department of Energy forced the last coal units at the R.M. Schahfer power plant—operating since 1976—and one of the coal units at the F.B. Culley generating station—built in 1966—to stay online days before their planned retirements. This is part of Donald Trump’s attempt to bolster the flailing coal industry at the expense of everyday customers.

The unlawful action is expected to be very expensive. For instance, operating Schahfer beyond 2025 would require more than one billion dollars in expenditures, according to a 2024 analysis from the plant owner. Culley Unit 2’s owner considers it “among the most inefficient units within the State” and among “the smallest and more expensive coal units in the MISO stack,” also figuring that an additional $70 million in expenditures are needed to keep operating.

Aside from the expenditures to rehabilitate the broken and outmoded plants, both power plants are expected to lose millions of dollars in the market, as their coal and other operating costs exceed the revenues they can earn. The plants’ owners are trying to pass down these costs to customers in Indiana and ten other states, and environmental and consumer advocacy groups are pushing back. Sierra Club’s ‘Burning Money’ tracker estimates the daily total amount that 202(c) orders are costing customers across the country. In 2025, electricity prices rose by 6.7 percent.

The Sierra Club and Earthjustice have also challenged similar orders in Washington, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Colorado’s Craig power plant also received an unlawful extension order for which challenges are due next week.

“At a time when Americans are already struggling with skyrocketing utility bills and growing grocery costs, Donald Trump and his administration are exacerbating the affordability crisis by extending the life of old, retiring coal plants, further driving up costs for everyday Americans,” said Sierra Club Senior Attorney Tony Mendoza. “We are challenging this sham ‘emergency order’ because we believe that hardworking families should not have to hand over their hard-earned money to coal executives at the order of Donald Trump. We will continue to push back against this illegal attempt to prop up these expensive, polluting coal plants.”

""American families are struggling with record high utility bills in Trump's inflation economy, because his atrocious energy policies force working families to bail out expensive coal power plants,"" said Tyson Slocum, Energy Program Director for Public Citizen. ""Trump explicitly and repeatedly promised to cut Americans' energy bills during the campaign, even writing in a Newsweek op-ed on October 1, 2024 that as President he would 'cut energy and electricity prices in half within 12 months—not just for businesses but for all Americans and their families.' Trump's costly coal bailouts have ensured his campaign promise is a lie"".

""The federal government has invented a grid reliability crisis in a transparent and illegal attempt to commandeer uneconomic, dilapidated power plants, force them to operate, and stick us with the bill."" said Ben Inskeep, Program Director at Citizens Action Coalition. ""We are fighting back against the federal government's unprecedented overreach that will cause our utility bills to soar and choke Hoosier communities with more toxic pollution from coal.""

“This is a needless, last-ditch effort to resuscitate a dying industry to power the AI boom,” said Ashley Williams, Executive Director of Just Transition Northwest Indiana. “Our communities are organizing and confronting the Trump administration’s shameful actions. This order will have irreversible consequences, locking in generations more of climate-devastating pollution and toxic coal ash waste contaminating the waterways of Jasper County and beyond. It exacerbates an affordability crisis where families are sacrificing their basic needs to pay escalating utility bills, a reality Hoosiers know all too well.”

“Cleaner power sources are available and Schahfer and Culley were ready to stop burning coal, so the federal order for them to continue burning coal is an unwarranted extension of coal and coal ash pollution in Indiana,” said Indra Frank, Coal Ash Advisor at Hoosier Environmental Council.

“Once again, President Trump’s Department of Energy is attempting to force Midwest residential and business consumers to pay higher electricity bills to keep coal plants running that are no longer needed and not economically viable,” said Howard Learner, Executive Director & CEO, Environmental Law & Policy Center. “The utilities already made the right financial call to retire these plants. The Trump DOE is making a bad situation worse when it comes to energy affordability problems that hit peoples’ wallets hard, while adding more pollution that harms public health.”

“Our nation’s careful balance between the States and the federal government for regulating electricity worked here. The owners of these power plants decided years ago that the plants are too old, unreliable, dirty, and expensive to continue kicking the can down the road with more upgrades to keep them going. Instead, they resolved to replace the coal plants with resources that better meet their customers’ needs, and they followed through,” said Sameer Doshi, Senior Attorney at Earthjustice. “State regulators and the federally-regulated transmission grid operator all looked at these plans and saw no problem. The Department of Energy hasn’t remotely shown any emergency in the power system that would support upending these plans.”

The so-called ‘emergency order’ has historically only been invoked during extreme weather conditions or wartime. As a part of the rehearing request, Sierra Club, ELPC, and Earthjustice argue that the DOE failed to provide sufficient evidence of any emergency or electricity shortage in the region warranting the order to keep Schahfer and Culley open.

Geothermal startups had a big day on Wednesday. Zanskar, a company that’s using artificial intelligence to find untapped conventional geothermal resources, raised $115 million in a Series C round. The Salt Lake City-based company — which experts in Heatmap's Insider Survey identified as one of the most promising climate tech startups operating today — is looking to build its first power plants. “With this funding, we have a six power plant execution plan ahead of us in the next three, four years,” Diego D’Sola, Zanskar’s head of finance, told Heatmap’s Katie Brigham. This, he estimates, will generate over $100 million of revenue by the end of the decade, and “unlock a multi-gigawatt pipeline behind that.”

Later on Tuesday, Sage Geosystems, a next-generation geothermal startup using fracking technology to harness the Earth’s heat for energy in places that don’t have conventional resources, announced it had raised $97 million in a Series B. The financing rounds highlight the growing excitement over geothermal energy. If you want a refresher on how it works, Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin has a sharp explainer here.

3. Europe’s flagship green steel project inks a major deal

Stegra, the Swedish startup racing to build the world’s first large green steel mill near the Arctic Circle, has recently faced troubles as project costs and delays forced the company to raise over $1 billion in new financing. But last week, Stegra landed a major new customer, marking what Canary Media called “a step forward for the beleaguered project.” A subsidiary of the German industrial giant Thyssenkrupp agreed to buy a certain type of steel from Stegra’s plant, which is set to start operations next year. Thyssenkrupp Materials Services said it would buy tonnages in the “high-six-digit range” of “non-prime” steel, a version of the metal that doesn’t meet the high standards for certain uses but remains strong and durable enough for other industrial applications.

4. Tesla updates its mission statement

For years, Tesla’s mission statement has captured its focus on building electric vehicles, solar panels, and batteries: “Accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy.” Now, however, billionaire Elon Musk’s manufacturing giant has broadened its pitch. The company’s new mission statement, announced on X, reads: “Building a world of amazing abundance.” The change reflects a wider shift in the cultural discourse around the transition to new energy and transportation technologies. Even experts polled in our Insiders Survey want to ditch “climate change” as a term. The fatigue was striking coming from the very scientists, policymakers, and activists working to defend against the effects of human-caused temperature rise and decarbonize the global economy.That dynamic has fueled the push to refocus rhetoric on the promise of cheaper, more efficient, and more abundant technological luxuries — a concept Tesla appears to be tapping into now. It may be time for a change. As Matthew wrote in September, Tesla’s market share hit an all-time low last year.

5. The world’s biggest nuclear plant comes back online

In yesterday’s newsletter, I told you that the Tokyo Electric Power Company had delayed the restart of the Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear power station in western Japan over an alarm malfunction. It wasn’t immediately clear how quickly Japan’s state-owned utility would clear up the issue. It turns out, pretty quickly. The pause lasted just 24 hours before Tepco brought Unit 6 of the seven-reactor facility back online, NucNet reported.

THE KICKER

Things are getting steamy in the frigid waters of Alaska’s Bristol Bay. New research from Florida Atlantic University’s Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute found that a small population of beluga whales survive the long haul by mating with multiple partners over several years. It’s not just the males finding multiple female partners, as is the case with some other mammals. The study found that both males and females mated with multiple partners over several years. “What makes this study so thrilling is that it upends our long-standing assumptions about this Arctic species,” Greg O’Corry-Crowe, the research professor who authored the study, said in a press release. “It’s a striking reminder that female choice can be just as influential in shaping reproductive success as the often-highlighted battles of male-male competition. Such strategies highlight the subtle, yet powerful ways in which females exert control over the next generation, shaping the evolutionary trajectory of the species.”

But far less has been said about what a more extreme climate would mean for Venezuelans. That’s at least partially because we don’t fully know.

“Venezuela often appears in global climate assessments as a blank spot or an unknown, despite being ecologically significant and highly vulnerable,” Liliana Rivas, a freelance environmental and investigative reporter working in the country, told me.

Neglect isn’t a problem unique to Caracas. The international climate science community has long struggled to accurately represent the developing world in its research, though it has made improvements in recent years. Over a third of the contributors to the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report were from institutions based in the Global South — in parts of Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean — up from 10% in the report’s first year.

Still, “the IPCC is doing a systematic literature review, and they rely on what scientific literature is available,” Paulina Jaramillo, a professor of engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, told me. Jaramillo — who is from Medellín, Colombia, and whose father comes from a border town with Venezuela — added that “the common language you see in the reports from Africa and South America is that the peer-reviewed literature is much more limited in those countries.”

Part of that is due to modest funding opportunities for researchers. (Jaramillo said “everyone thought I was crazy” when she decided almost 30 years ago to study environmental engineering in Colombia.) But the absence of long-term datasets makes quality climate research difficult, too. It takes “at least 30 years of continuous observations … to define a climatic period and allow for robust conclusions,” Nature noted in a recent editorial. Climate researchers who want to study Venezuela are, for the most part, restricted to data gathered since the satellite era, post-1980s, which was never designed to offer a detailed local picture.

Understanding the climate picture in Venezuela is critical, though. Out of 188 nations in the world, Venezuela ranks 181st in climate vulnerability. The nation faces a laundry list of worsening environmental crises, including extreme flooding, droughts, landslides, heat waves, rising sea levels, deforestation, oil spills, contamination and pollution, and illegal mining. An extreme rainfall event over the Andes and Venezuela Llanos last summer displaced thousands of people, observers estimated, cutting off nearly 10,000 families in the mountainous western state of Mérida from food, water, health care, and adequate sanitation services. By some measurements, Venezuela was also the first nation in the world to lose all of its glaciers.

“What happens [in Venezuela] affects the rest of the world,” Jaramillo told me. Between 2014 and late 2025, almost 8 million people were estimated to have left the country, straining public services in neighboring nations. “Climate change is a threat multiplier,” Jaramillo went on. “We can’t just think, ‘Oh, those are problems in those countries.’ They have global geopolitical implications, in addition to the humanitarian aspect.”

An incomplete picture not only heightens Venezuela’s vulnerability to extreme weather impacts, it also renders the country all but incapable of adapting to them. After all, how can you develop effective strategies without data to inform the designs and operations? Partially because of this, Venezuela has been ranked 142nd out of 192 countries by Notre Dame in terms of its adaptation capabilities. “It’s the worst prepared country in South America” when it comes to climate change, Jaramillo said.

The country’s weather-monitoring infrastructure — which is accessible to researchers — is poorly maintained. A “significant” number of weather stations across Venezuela are inoperable, “limiting the ability to track rainfall, temperature, and extremes with confidence at local scale,” Robert Muggah, the co-founder of the Igarapé Institute, a Brazil-based security and development think tank, told me by email from Davos. “More recently, reporting from the Venezuelan Amazon has described weather stations being looted or relocated for security, leaving major river basins with long gaps in routine measurements.”

Mariam Zachariah, a research associate at London’s Imperial College, told me her team at World Weather Attribution ran into this problem when it tried to investigate whether anthropogenic climate change fueled the catastrophic flooding in the country last year. “You might have 10 weather stations in the region, but when you try to look at them, five will not have data,” she said. “So you can’t really use that. You don’t actually get a good representation of the trend in that region.” The complex natural topography of Venezuela also renders large-scale climate models unreliable, making conclusions drawn from them even less certain.

Following the collapse of Venezuela’s oil production in the mid-2010s, recently removed President Nicolás Maduro’s government also began censoring the country’s environmental statistics. “There is very little transparency and public access to environmental data,” Rivas, the investigative journalist, said.

Reporters working within Venezuela face dangers, too. Joshua De Freitas Hernández, an independent journalist, told me he estimates there are fewer than 20 reporters in his country focused on environmental issues, and none of them are on the climate change beat, specifically. Emiliano Teran Mantovani, a Venezuelan sociologist and political activist, also told me there has been a “decrease in the reports of oil spills and the reports of ecological degradation in the national parks because people do not want to talk.” The government repression is “really, really scary,” he added.

Local reporters who forge ahead find themselves contending with many of the same problems as international researchers: “limited access to official data, restricted access to certain territories, and security risk scenarios affected by mining or extractive activity,” Rivas told me.

The environmental situation is so bad, in fact, that some hope the U.S. takeover of the nation’s oil industry will actually improve it. “Much of the [fossil fuel industry] pollution happening today is the result of abandonment, lack of maintenance, and total absence of environmental oversight,” Rivas said. “I think that in that context, some people, including also environmental observers, cautiously argue that the return of international companies could, under the right conditions, introduce environmental controls, monitoring standards, and technologies that currently do not exist.”

Mantovani, the activist, pushed back on that line of thinking. “The environmental issue is not a priority either for the government or the opposition, or for Donald Trump or Chinese capitalists,” he said. “No one is talking about the environmental issues or climate issues.”

The Trump administration has argued that the U.S. takeover of the oil industry will benefit the Venezuelan people. But while “extreme weather in Venezuela will not suddenly shift because of a single military operation,” as Muggah of the Igarapé Institute put it to me, fossil fuel-related pollution could have immediate public health impacts on local and Indigenous communities. (Illegal mining, while not as directly linked to climate change as oil production, is another extractive industry compounding the twinned environmental and humanitarian crises in the country.)

In the short term, “When security operations and political upheaval intensify, the institutions that keep people safe during heat waves, floods, and disease outbreaks often get weaker,” Muggah added. Worse yet, due to the many ongoing uncertainties about Venezuela’s future climate and Caracas’ limited ability to identify those risks or adapt, there will almost certainly be extreme-weather refugees in the country in the future.

International research institutions say, “Well, we don’t know what is happening in Venezuela or if this extreme weather is related to climate change, because there is no data,” De Freitas Hernández, the independent Venezuelan journalist, told me. “That’s the first thing all institutions have to say: ‘We don’t have the data.’ We need the data.”

One of the final tasks the company was working on was replacing faulty blades on nearly two dozen turbine towers. In July 2024, one of the installed blades snapped in two, sending fiberglass and other debris crashing into the sea and eventually onto the beaches of Nantucket. The incident revealed a manufacturing defect at the Canadian factory where the blades were made. After multiple investigations into the incident, the company reached an agreement with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement to replace the defective equipment with blades produced at a different factory in France.

Trump’s construction freeze contained an exception for activities “necessary to respond to emergency situations and/or to prevent impacts to health, safety, and the environment.” So after the order came down on December 22, Vineyard Wind reached out to the relevant regulators and asked permission to continue its blade replacement process on safety grounds, the company explained in court filings. BSEE responded that the company could remove the faulty blades on the 10 remaining towers, but could not replace them.

The decision highlights an apparent double standard in the administration’s considerations of public safety. The stop work order itself was intended to “protect the American people,” according to Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. Yet the agency has refused to let construction move forward to mitigate risks created by the stoppage.

Testimony submitted by Steven Simkins, Vineyard Wind’s Wind turbine team lead, describes the dangers of leaving the towers bladeless for an extended period of time — a risk compounded by the ticking clock on the company’s construction boat contract. “The wind turbine was designed to be constructed completely and only be in a hammerhead state, without blades, for a brief amount of time during installation,” Simkins wrote.

He warned of three main liabilities. First, the towers are equipped with a lightning protection system, but the system’s receptors and conductors extend along the blades. Without the blades, the towers are essentially lightning rods, at risk of igniting an electrical fire, Simkins explained.

The three giant holes where the blades would be installed are also sitting open, with tarps covering them as temporary protection. That means that water, ice, and humidity could get into the nacelle, the top part of the tower that houses all of the electrical and mechanical systems, which are not designed to weather this kind of exposure. “Not only will this lead to prolonged offshore work replacing damaged equipment but it also puts the safety of the workers at risk,” Simkins wrote. “Electrical cabinets that have experienced some level of corrosion become less safe and increase the risk of an arc flash event.”

Lastly, the 500-foot towers are being roiled by winter wind and waves, which causes them to sway. The blades are designed to capture that wind, reducing its force on the towers. Without them, the “fatigue” on the towers will be exacerbated, “and the design has accounted for a limited amount of such fatigue over the total life of the structure.”

Court documents show that Vineyard Wind — the last of five affected companies to file for an injunction against Trump’s stop work order — held off on litigation as it made multiple attempts to convince the administration that completing blade installation was necessary to mitigate safety risks.

Vineyard Wind also sent BSEE verification of its safety claims by DNV Energy Systems, a Danish company it was required to retain to “ensure that the Project is installed in accordance with accepted engineering practices and, when necessary, to provide reports to BSEE regarding incidents affecting Critical Safety Systems.” But BSEE disagreed and denied Vineyard Wind’s request.

The Trump administration filed a response in the case on Tuesday, with BSEE’s Principal Deputy Director Kenneth Stevens testifying that the bureau’s technical personnel had “determined that there should be no structural issues associated with the tower and nacelle-only configuration if they were installed correctly.” He noted that the towers had been “routinely left in this configuration repeatedly” while the project was under construction over the past year and a half “with no reported adverse impacts to safety.”

Vineyard Wind did not respond to a request for comment on that assertion. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Friday. Three separate district judges have already granted injunctions to offshore projects affected by the stop work order: Revolution Wind, Empire Wind, and Dominion Energy’s Coastal Virginia offshore wind project. Each judge found that the companies were “likely” to succeed in showing that the stop work order violated the Administrative Procedures Act, and allowing them to continue construction.

Today, seven environmental and consumer advocacy groups filed rehearing requests after Donald Trump’s Department of Energy unlawfully invoked Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act and forced two coal power plants in Indiana to stay online after their planned retirements. The seven groups include Sierra Club, Environmental Law and Policy Center, and Earthjustice representing Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, Just Transition Northwest Indiana, Hoosier Environmental Council, and Public Citizen.

In December 2025, Donald Trump’s Department of Energy forced the last coal units at the R.M. Schahfer power plant—operating since 1976—and one of the coal units at the F.B. Culley generating station—built in 1966—to stay online days before their planned retirements. This is part of Donald Trump’s attempt to bolster the flailing coal industry at the expense of everyday customers.

The unlawful action is expected to be very expensive. For instance, operating Schahfer beyond 2025 would require more than one billion dollars in expenditures, according to a 2024 analysis from the plant owner. Culley’s Unit 2’s owner considers it “among the most inefficient units within the State” and among “the smallest and more expensive coal units in the MISO stack,” also figuring that an additional $70 million in expenditures are needed to keep operating.

Aside from the expenditures to rehabilitate the broken and outmoded plants, both power plants are expected to lose millions of dollars in the market, as their coal and other operating costs exceed the revenues they can earn. The plants’ owners are trying to pass down these costs to customers in Indiana and ten other states, and environmental and consumer advocacy groups are pushing back. Sierra Club’s ‘Burning Money’ tracker estimates the daily total amount that 202(c) orders are costing customers across the country. In 2025, electricity prices rose by 6.7 percent.

The Sierra Club and Earthjustice have also challenged similar orders in Washington, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Colorado’s Craig power plant also received an unlawful extension order for which challenges are due next week.

“At a time when Americans are already struggling with skyrocketing utility bills and growing grocery costs, Donald Trump and his administration are exacerbating the affordability crisis by extending the life of old, retiring coal plants, further driving up costs for everyday Americans,” said Sierra Club Senior Attorney Tony Mendoza. “We are challenging this sham ‘emergency order’ because we believe that hardworking families should not have to hand over their hard-earned money to coal executives at the order of Donald Trump. We will continue to push back against this illegal attempt to prop up these expensive, polluting coal plants.”

“American families are struggling with record high utility bills in Trump’s inflation economy, because his atrocious energy policies force working families to bail out expensive coal power plants,” said Tyson Slocum, Energy Program Director for Public Citizen. “Trump explicitly and repeatedly promised to cut Americans’ energy bills during the campaign, even writing in a Newsweek op-ed on October 1, 2024 that as President he would ‘cut energy and electricity prices in half within 12 months—not just for businesses but for all Americans and their families.’ Trump’s costly coal bailouts have ensured his campaign promise is a lie”.

“The federal government has invented a grid reliability crisis in a transparent and illegal attempt to commandeer uneconomic, dilapidated power plants, force them to operate, and stick us with the bill.” said Ben Inskeep, Program Director at Citizens Action Coalition. “We are fighting back against the federal government’s unprecedented overreach that will cause our utility bills to soar and choke Hoosier communities with more toxic pollution from coal.”

“This is a needless, last-ditch effort to resuscitate a dying industry to power the AI boom,” said Ashley Williams, Executive Director of Just Transition Northwest Indiana. “Our communities are organizing and confronting the Trump administration’s shameful actions. This order will have irreversible consequences, locking in generations more of climate-devastating pollution and toxic coal ash waste contaminating the waterways of Jasper County and beyond. It exacerbates an affordability crisis where families are sacrificing their basic needs to pay escalating utility bills, a reality Hoosiers know all too well.”

“Cleaner power sources are available and Schahfer and Culley were ready to stop burning coal, so the federal order for them to continue burning coal is an unwarranted extension of coal and coal ash pollution in Indiana,” said Indra Frank, Coal Ash Advisor at Hoosier Environmental Council.

“Once again, President Trump’s Department of Energy is attempting to force Midwest residential and business consumers to pay higher electricity bills to keep coal plants running that are no longer needed and not economically viable,” said Howard Learner, Executive Director & CEO, Environmental Law & Policy Center. “The utilities already made the right financial call to retire these plants. The Trump DOE is making a bad situation worse when it comes to energy affordability problems that hit peoples’ wallets hard, while adding more pollution that harms public health.”

“Our nation’s careful balance between the States and the federal government for regulating electricity worked here. The owners of these power plants decided years ago that the plants are too old, unreliable, dirty, and expensive to continue kicking the can down the road with more upgrades to keep them going. Instead, they resolved to replace the coal plants with resources that better meet their customers’ needs, and they followed through,” said Sameer Doshi, Senior Attorney at Earthjustice. “State regulators and the federally-regulated transmission grid operator all looked at these plans and saw no problem. The Department of Energy hasn’t remotely shown any emergency in the power system that would support upending these plans.”

Representatives from across the NDA group engaged with MPs and industry figures at the annual event, organised by the Nuclear Industry Association, to highlight progress on key programmes including taking on more sites from EDF for decommissioning, immobilising the UK’s plutonium stockpile and how it’s ensuring it has the skills needed for the future.

The NDA group is tasked with safely, securely and sustainably decommissioning the UK’s earliest nuclear sites, and supporting the communities that host them, building public confidence that the UK nuclear industry is safe, secure, and that waste can be managed responsibly and cost-effectively.

In April 2026 that mission is set to expand, with the milestone transfer of Hunterston B from EDF. The former nuclear power station in North Ayrshire, Scotland, will be the first of seven AGR sites to join the NDA estate over the next two decades.

David Peattie, NDA Group CEO said:

The transfer of AGR stations is the largest expansion of the NDA’s remit since its creation and a clear example of government policy in action and the strength of national collaboration, government and industry working hand in hand.

It demonstrates why, under the NDA’s strategic leadership, Sellafield, Nuclear Waste Services (NWS), Nuclear Restoration Services (NRS), and Nuclear Transport Solutions (NTS) are trusted to take on more responsibility.

Our unique capabilities go beyond our core mission. We are advancing UK Government ambitions and creating a lasting positive legacy for the nation.

The event was also an opportunity to showcase progress towards the safe immobilisation of the UK’s plutonium inventory. In December 2025, the first can of plutonium residue was processed into a form suitable for disposal, delivering on government policy and making the nation safer.

The programme will also create thousands of skilled jobs – with growth of the UK’s decommissioning sector creating enormous social and economic opportunity, which the NDA group is well-placed to unlock. As its role expands, the NDA group now spends £1.9bn a year across its supply chain, indirectly supporting 40,000 jobs and sustaining employment opportunities in former centres of industry.

The NDA was also proud to support the NWiP Skills and Apprenticeship Fair, hosted by Lizzi Collinge MP. It gave NDA group apprentices and graduates the opportunity to speak to MPs and industry stakeholders, sharing how they contribute to the UK’s decommissioning sector, and how their organisations are investing in a new generation of talent to support a growing nuclear industry.

Keely Salter, National Skills Academy for Nuclear (NSAN) Apprentice of the Year and NRS Production Technician who spoke at the event, said:

Hands-on learning as part of my apprenticeship was brilliant for me, and has helped me advance my skills, learning from experienced members of my team.

Since joining the nuclear industry, I have had so many amazing opportunities, helping me progress in my career and giving me the chance to speak to other apprentices and the local community about who we are and what we do.

Building a base of decommissioning skills is vitally important for sustaining the NDA’s mission, which will last for over a century, and for delivering the nation’s green energy ambitions.

Currently, over 1,100 apprentices and graduates are on NDA early careers schemes, with £55 million invested into early careers schemes annually, often developing talent in some of the UK’s most remote communities.

Minister for Skills, Baroness Jacqui Smith, said:

Nuclear decommissioning is creating exactly the kind of skilled, well-paid careers we need more of in this country – and these jobs are being built in communities that have long been the backbone of British industry.

This government is investing in the workforce of the future to give employers greater flexibility to train the next generation.

By supporting high-quality apprenticeships and skills programmes, we are helping people into good jobs while strengthening the industries our economy depends on.

MPs attending NWiP also heard about the NDA’s commitment to supporting the communities that host its sites, investing £60 million in projects over the last 5 years delivering permanent and sustainable change, and attracting an additional £200 million in funding.

This includes work underway to release land from the NDA estate, for reuse that benefits local communities and clean energy development.

Tesla already offers its own insurance plan with a monthly discount of up to 10% for drivers who use FSD for more than 50% of the miles.

AUTONOMOUS CAR INSURANCE

Lemonade's new offering - called Autonomous Car insurance - comes as traditional insurers grapple with how to price coverage for the use of various levels of self-driving features that automakers are racing to deploy.

Commercializing autonomous vehicles has been harder and far costlier than expected. Most automakers offer Level 2 autonomy on personal vehicles for highway operation that requires the driver to pay constant attention to the road and remain in charge.

Tesla's FSD is categorized as Level 2 and is capable of driving on city streets as well as highways.

But Tesla's technology - which mainly uses cameras and artificial intelligence rather than redundant sensors that most others bank on - has sparked worries about its limitations, especially during inclement weather.

The U.S. auto safety regulator has investigated multiple crashes involving Tesla's FSD and is examining claims that vehicles using the technology have committed traffic violations.

""These things are not fully autonomous yet and they require a certain intervention level, a skill level from the driver,"" Wininger said. ""So 50% off, based on the data that we have, is what we believe the improvement is of you as a driver using this technology, but not that technology driving by itself.""

The new product will roll out in Arizona on January 26 and in Oregon in February, Lemonade said.

Wininger said the company would reduce rates further as Tesla releases FSD software updates that improve safety.

""Traditional insurers treat a Tesla like any other car, and AI like any other driver,"" Wininger said. ""But a driver who can see 360 degrees, never gets drowsy, and reacts in milliseconds isn't like any other driver.""

Industry leaders warn the China deal could further weaken the continent’s integrated supply chain - even as Trump moves away from that model.
“If there’s anyone that understands the auto sector, it’s Jamieson and I agree with him.
It’s harmful to the North American auto market no matter if it’s Canada, the US or Mexico,” Ford said.
We want to make sure we produce Canadian cars by Canadians,” Ford said.","Ontario Premier Doug Ford and automotive industry leaders doubled down on their opposition to Canada’s trade truce with China, warning that opening the door to Chinese electric vehicles and auto investment risks gutting the Canadian sector.

Ford, flanked by representatives of automakers and factory workers, urged Canadians not to buy cars from China - even if they’re cheaper than domestically made ones - because they come at the cost of local jobs.

“Boycott the Chinese EV vehicles,” he said Wednesday. “Support companies that are building vehicles here. It’s as simple as that.”

Prime Minister Mark Carney’s surprise detente with Beijing has shaken the Canadian auto sector, already bruised by factory losses and job cuts tied to President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Industry leaders warn the China deal could further weaken the continent’s integrated supply chain - even as Trump moves away from that model.

Under the deal, Canada will allow 49,000 Chinese EV imports under a tariff of about 6% instead of more than 100%, in exchange for China easing levies on canola. The plan would also enable Chinese companies to assemble vehicles in Canada for the first time, but under restrictions that may include using Canadian software and creating joint ventures with domestic firms.

US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said earlier Wednesday that it’s “overblown” to suggest it signals a wider shift by Canada away from the US.

“I am focused on the suggestion about Chinese investment into Canada and that kind of thing,” he told Bloomberg Television on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “I’m not sure that’s healthy for the North American relationship. So we’ll be looking at that.”

Ford told reporters in Toronto that he agrees.

“If there’s anyone that understands the auto sector, it’s Jamieson and I agree with him. It’s harmful to the North American auto market no matter if it’s Canada, the US or Mexico,” Ford said. Most of the cars made in Canada are destined for the US.

The Canadian government is drafting a new automotive strategy that will give better market access to companies that build vehicles in the country, expected to be unveiled in February.

Ford argued that permitting Chinese automakers to build in Canada would create inadequate economic benefits.

“Even if they do start assembling, how about the supply chain? They come and they assemble, but they bring all Chinese parts in. That means nothing. We want to make sure we produce Canadian cars by Canadians,” Ford said.

Brian Kingston, chief executive officer of the Canadian Vehicle Manufacturers’ Association, told reporters that Chinese cars made in Canada would include “mass subsidization coming from the Chinese central government,” which “presents real risks for our ongoing relationship with the United States.”

Kingston added that Canada instead should focus on supporting the five manufacturers already in the country: General Motors Co., Stellantis NV, Ford Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. The CVMA represents the interests of the first three of those companies.

In the past year, GM has shut down one plant in Ontario and threatened to cut production at another, while Stellantis canceled plans to build Jeep vehicles at a factory near Toronto to make them in Illinois instead.

These are only some of the serious concerns I have with the discussion draft.
Undermining health protections from toxic chemicals and leaving Americans exposed to harm – as the discussion draft proposes – would do nothing to address EPA’s TSCA implementation challenges.
The discussion draft proposes to make foundational changes to the law that deserve feedback and scrutiny from stakeholders across sectors.
And we fought hard to make meaningful improvements to a broken law with the Lautenberg Act ten years ago.","Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ) had the following opening remarks, as prepared for delivery, at today's Environment Subcommittee legislative hearing on Republicans' draft bill to weaken the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA):

Today Committee Republicans continue their assault on the health and well-being of the American people. We will be discussing a Republican discussion draft that would significantly weaken our nation’s chemical safety law, and leave families, children, and workers exposed to toxic chemicals.

The Toxic Substances Control Act gives the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the authority and responsibility to examine and restrict chemicals that pose an unreasonable risk to human health and the environment. The original law, however, fell far short of that goal. For far too long, too many communities have carried the burden of toxic exposures. That was made clear during our December PFAS hearing, when Emily Donovan delivered the stories of friends and loved ones lost too soon because of the unchecked actions of chemical companies.

That is why – after years of tough negotiations – Congress passed the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act in 2016 with strong bipartisan support. The bill was named after New Jersey’s late Senator Lautenberg – a longtime friend of mine and a lifetime environmental champion.

The Lautenberg Act updated and modernized TSCA for the first time in 40 years, finally providing EPA the tools to safeguard Americans by addressing harmful substances. Since its passage, I have worked to ensure it lives up to its namesake’s commitment to protect Americans, particularly children, pregnant women, workers, and frontline communities.

So it is shocking to me that this draft is before us today because this has always been a bipartisan effort. But the draft before us today does not live up to the Lautenberg legacy. It fundamentally alters the TSCA program to appease industry stakeholders at the expense of public health and safety. The discussion draft would prevent EPA from meaningfully reviewing new and existing chemicals in order to protect workers, families, and children from unreasonable risks. It would hamper EPA’s ability to require chemical testing, leaving regulators in the dark about the harms posed by chemical substances and exposing Americans to toxic chemicals in their homes and workplaces. These are only some of the serious concerns I have with the discussion draft.

My Republican colleagues will claim this draft modernizes TSCA and promotes innovation, but in reality, it decimates critical protections and signals to communities – like Emily Donovan’s – that it's acceptable for them to face the threats of cancer, infertility, neurological harm, and other serious risks, so long as industry gets their chemicals to market.

I fully acknowledge that EPA’s TSCA Office has faced its fair share of implementation challenges. One complaint we’ve heard is that new chemical reviews are facing delays. But we cannot ignore the fact that the chemical industry has a hand in these delays.. It is clear to me that the first step to addressing TSCA delays is to ensure the office has the adequate resources to fulfill its mission. Undermining health protections from toxic chemicals and leaving Americans exposed to harm – as the discussion draft proposes – would do nothing to address EPA’s TSCA implementation challenges.

My Republican colleagues will also claim these changes are targeted, but I fundamentally disagree. The discussion draft proposes to make foundational changes to the law that deserve feedback and scrutiny from stakeholders across sectors. EPA should be called to provide testimony on these amendments as well. Changes of this magnitude to TSCA deserve more than just one hearing so members can scrutinize the language and its impacts.

Time and again, we see how vulnerable communities bear the brunt of weak chemical safety protections. We’ve heard the tragic stories of Americans gone too soon because of lax – or nonexistent – chemical regulations. And we fought hard to make meaningful improvements to a broken law with the Lautenberg Act ten years ago. We cannot afford to go back.

In fact, we should be working to strengthen TSCA to ensure we protect the health of all Americans – especially our most vulnerable – while at the same time fostering innovation. This discussion draft, unfortunately, is heading in the wrong direction.

Thank you, and I yield back the balance of my time.

Recently, however, the focus on climate change and stopping biodiversity loss has taken a back seat to issues like cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence and geopolitics.
Instead, talk about sustainability efforts and climate action is now largely relegated to the scientists and activists.
Climate change is no longer center stage in Davos because, in large measure, corporations have gone quiet on the issue.
“The Davos programming is a reflection of what chief executives want to talk about, ultimately,” said Sebastian Buckup, who runs the World Economic Forum’s center for nature and climate.","All week at the World Economic Forum’s annual gathering in Davos, Switzerland, talk about climate change and renewable power has been relegated to the sidelines.

That changed on Wednesday, when President Trump used his speech at this gathering of the world’s top business leaders and policymakers to attack clean energy.

“There are windmills all over Europe,” he said. “There are windmills all over the place and they are losers.”

That was just one snippet from a speech in which Trump assailed the “green new scam,” promoted fossil fuels and made inaccurate statements about China’s use of coal.

Trump’s assault on renewable energy struck a discordant note at an event that was once a center for the corporate climate movement. But since Trump’s re-election Davos has strained to retain an idealistic, optimistic spirit.

For years, Davos was where chief executives and heads of state came to make high-minded pledges about how they would use their power to transform the world for the better and reduce dangerous planet-warming emissions.

Recently, however, the focus on climate change and stopping biodiversity loss has taken a back seat to issues like cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence and geopolitics. Instead, talk about sustainability efforts and climate action is now largely relegated to the scientists and activists.

Jennifer Morris, chief executive of The Nature Conservancy, told me that the dialogue in Davos had some glaring blind spots. “We’re not talking enough about oceans here,” she said, citing one example.

“Water is not woke,” she added.

Corporations are suddenly silent

The explanation for Davos’s pivot is simple. Climate change is no longer center stage in Davos because, in large measure, corporations have gone quiet on the issue.

“The Davos programming is a reflection of what chief executives want to talk about, ultimately,” said Sebastian Buckup, who runs the World Economic Forum’s center for nature and climate.

And what C.E.O.s want to talk about has changed.

Six years ago, Larry Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, used his time in Davos to rally Wall Street to combat climate change, promising to “transform finance.”

In an article I published last week, I explained how Fink sparked a movement that came to encompass most of the major banks, asset managers and asset owners in the world, which pledged to use their trillions of dollars to try and blunt global warming.

But in the face of pushback from Republicans, the fallout from the war in Ukraine and the return of President Trump to the White House, Wall Street has largely abandoned its climate pledges. Many of the alliances designed to make finance more sustainable have fallen apart. Investors have withdrawn tens of billions of dollars each quarter from E.S.G. funds.

Even though Fink is now co-chair of the World Economic Forum and took a strong hand in shaping this year’s program, which features hundreds of panels and speakers scattered across giant convention halls and small meeting rooms, discussion of climate change was largely missing from the most prominent programs — with the exception of Trump’s remarks.

Warnings from scientists

On the rare occasions when there was frank talk about the dangers posed by our rapidly warming world, the warnings were more stark than ever.

Johan Rockström, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, delivered a presentation on Tuesday in which he showed dozens of ways in which the planet’s natural systems are under severe strain.

“The human pressure on the planet has now reached a crisis point,” he said. “The era where we can continue with economic growth without putting the stability of planet at risk has come to an end.”

Rockström added that “these pressures on the planet are now at risk of causing irreversible, potentially catastrophic tipping points.”

On Wednesday, I moderated a panel about why it was in companies’ own interest to protect nature.

“If you don’t have good land and good soil, you can’t have sustainable supply chains,” Kirsten Schuijt, director general of WWF International, told me.

Schuijt said that more corporations were working to address these threats, but not fast enough. “It’s moving way too slow, because we’re losing biodiversity in basically every place we care about,” she said.

Then on Thursday, I hosted a discussion about how much economic activity was tied to the oceans, which are warming rapidly regardless of whether you think talking about it is “woke.”

For much of the conversation, the speakers put forward a rosy vision of continued economic growth that somehow didn’t pollute the planet. Then, during a remarkably candid moment, an executive acknowledged a notion that until recently had been gospel at Davos.

“The biggest adversary to nature might be humans,” said Boudewijn Siemons, chief executive of the Port of Rotterdam, the largest harbor in Europe. “The problem is us.”

Climate policy

Trump’s E.P.A. has put a value on human life: zero dollars

Government officials have long grappled with a question that seems like the purview of philosophers: What is the value of a human life?

Under both Democratic and Republican administrations, the answer has been in the millions of dollars. The higher the value, the more the government has required businesses to spend on their operations to prevent a single death.

But for the first time, at the Environmental Protection Agency, the answer is effectively zero dollars.

Last week, the E.P.A. stopped estimating the monetary value of lives saved when setting limits on two of the most widespread deadly air pollutants, fine particulate matter and ozone. Instead, the agency is calculating only the costs to companies of complying with pollution regulations.

It’s a drastic change to the way the government weighs the costs of curbing air pollution against the benefits to public health and the environment.

Renewable energy

A breakthrough year for wind and solar in Europe

Last year, wind and solar power produced more electricity than fossil fuels for the first time, according to a new report from Ember, an energy think tank.

The report comes a day after President Trump attacked wind power at Davos, issuing several statements that were not grounded in reality.

Solar was Europe’s fastest-growing power source and has expanded by an average of 21 percent annually over the last five years.

The report also found some early evidence that batteries are increasingly supplementing solar power when the sun isn’t shining — and even eating into fossil fuel demand during the evenings, when gas power tends to peak. In Italy, for example, batteries met about 3 percent of early evening demand last year.

That’s still a small share of Europe’s energy mix, but given the number of battery projects in development it could climb rapidly in the coming years. The report likens Italy’s potential to what has happened in California since 2021: As capacity soared, batteries grew from 3 percent to meet 22 percent of evening demand. — Claire Brown",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/22/multimedia/22cli-newsletter-Davos-qjbh/22cli-newsletter-Davos-qjbh-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 15:58:07.978190

Combining all estimated renewable energy capacity, utility scale renewables could exceed 38%.","Solar accounted for 72% of new electrical generating capacity on the U.S. grid for the first 10 months of 2025, according to a review of FERC data by the SUN DAY Campaign. Solar PV has held this position for 26 months in a row and has now edged out wind power as the largest source of renewable energy capacity on the U.S. grid.

In October alone, solar was 60% of new generating capacity and FERC expects another 90 GW of solar to be deployed over the next three years, eclipsing new nuclear power and coal deployment. In FERC’s latest monthly “Energy Infrastructure Update” report (with data through October 31, 2025), 1.082 GW of solar was placed into service in October, accounting for 59.8% of all new generating capacity added during the month. Compare that to natural gas with 727 MW and oil with 1 MW.

The utility-scale solar added during the first 10 months of 2025 is just 161 MW less than what was installed in the first 10 months of 2024. From September 2023 to October 2025, solar has been the largest source of new generating capacity, growing from 91.82-GW to 160.56-GW. Wind expanded by 12.39-GW while natural gas’ net increase was just 6.55-GW, with a total capacity of 160.09 GW.

Solar, wind, hydropower and biomass accounted for 87.2% of all new generating capacity while natural gas added 12.4%, with the remainder being oil and waste heat. Taken together, wind and solar constitute nearly one-fourth (23.79%) of the United States’ total available installed utility-scale generating capacity. More than 25% of U.S. solar capacity is in the form of small-scale (rooftop) systems that are not reflected in FERC’s data. Including that additional solar capacity would bring the share provided by solar + wind to more than a quarter of the nation’s total, according to the SUN DAY Campaign.

All renewable energy capacity currently claim a 32.72% share of total U.S. utility-scale generating capacity. If small-scale solar capacity is included, renewables are now more than one-third of total U.S. generating capacity.

Solar is on track to become the second largest source of U.S. generating capacity

Based on FERC estimations, utility-scale solar is slated to account for 17.3% of installed U.S. generating capacity alone in three years, placing it in second place behind natural gas with an estimated 40.1% capacity. Combining all estimated renewable energy capacity, utility scale renewables could exceed 38%.

“It has now been a full year since Trump launched his assault on renewable energy with a string of anti-solar and anti-wind executive orders,” said Ken Bossong, the SUN DAY Campaign’s executive director. “And while they may have slowed progress, the economic and environmental benefits of renewable energy sources continue to drive their dramatic growth.”

This demonstrates why New Mexico needs stronger independent monitoring of its oil and gas companies, as well as stronger monitoring of their lobbyists.","Imagine there’s a lobbyist dedicated to helping New Mexicans get better access to cancer care, except this lobbyist also works for an oil and gas company whose drill sites are exposing people to carcinogens.

Imagine there’s a lobbyist for a ski resort that is running out of snow, and even running out of water used to make artificial snow, and yet this ski resort’s own lobbyist also works for an oil and gas trade association whose products are making global warming worse, and ski seasons shorter.

And imagine a university where heroic researchers are documenting the impacts of fossil fuels, chemicals and microplastics on human health…except the university’s lobbying firm also works for the mother of all climate denialists, ExxonMobil.

These three examples may sound like a parody of the obscene power that fossil fuel lobbyists enjoy in New Mexico. Something like WildEarth Guardians’ Exxtreme Energy campaign, which last October mocked climate denialism by almost holding (they were kicked out before they could) a wine-style tasting of pretend produced water at the Albuquerque Balloon Festival.

But these are real examples of New Mexico lobbyists who are effectively playing both sides of the climate crisis. They get paid to further the state’s dependence on fossil fuels, and they also get paid to help people and businesses cope with the impacts of the crisis.

Example number one is the firm Alarid Consulting, whose clients include Chevron and The US Oncology Network. Number two is lobbyist Lawrence Horan, whose clients include the New Mexico Oil & Gas Association and Taos Ski Valley, which is owned by billionaire conservationist Louis Bacon.

And number three is a doozy. In 2024, researchers at the University of New Mexico found trace amounts of plastics in 100% of the human placentas they studied. The vast majority of plastics, a product of the petrochemical industry, end up in landfills where, the UNM researchers explained, they degrade and re-enter the environment and can enter our food. Previous studies of microplastics’ effects on human health have found connections between the pollutant and cardiovascular disease, cancer, metabolic disorders, and fertility complications.

And yet UNM uses the Weaks Law Firm as one of its lobbying arms — as does ExxonMobil, one of the largest producers of the chemicals used to make single-use plastics. In September 2024, California sued ExxonMobil for decades of lying to the public about the recyclability of plastics. The company also produces more than 270,000 barrels of crude oil per day in New Mexico.

What is the Weaks Firm lobbying on for ExxonMobil? Their disclosure for 2025 is the vague and meaningless, “All matters of interest to the employer.” For Alarid Consulting and their work for Chevron, there isn’t even this much, just a blank space where the disclosure should be.

How much are these climate double-agents paid by their fossil fuel clients versus their other clients? Wouldn’t it be nice to know. New Mexico has one of the weakest lobbyist disclosure systems in the country, according to a 50-state report card from F Minus. Lobbyists do not have to disclose compensation received from their clients, or the numbers of bills lobbied upon or positions taken on these bills.

Like their lobbyists, oil and gas companies are given ludicrous leeway to self-report and police themselves when it comes to compliance with state regulations. In February 2023, satellite images showed a major methane leak from one of ExxonMobil’s Eddy County facilities. The company did not admit to this leak until confronted with these images. This demonstrates why New Mexico needs stronger independent monitoring of its oil and gas companies, as well as stronger monitoring of their lobbyists.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-93/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/img_1032-e1759359429280-1024x7211769110144.jpg?h=9e5702ad&itok=xCLus_0B,N,,2026-01-22 15:40:00.602096

To address this, Plug’n Drive and Call2Recycle Canada have partnered to expand the EV Awareness Student Learning Program to include EV battery recycling education. Supported by the Skills Council of Canada, this initiative tackles the environmental challenges of EV adoption, prepares a future-ready workforce, and highlights the power of collaboration among key stakeholders.

Addressing a growing need in EV adoption

The rise in EV adoption brings significant environmental benefits, such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions, but it also underscores the importance of responsible battery management. EV batteries, which contain valuable materials like lithium, cobalt, and nickel, must be recycled or repurposed to minimize waste and reduce their environmental impact. By incorporating EV battery recycling education into its curriculum, Plug’n Drive ensures students understand the full lifecycle of EV batteries, from responsible use to safe end-of-life management.

“Providing Canadians, particularly youth, with trusted, science-based information on battery recycling is fundamental to advancing a circular energy future – especially within the growing and evolving EV landscape,” stated Joe Zenobio, President and CEO of Call2Recycle Canada. “By partnering with Plug’n Drive, we are empowering the next generation of leaders with the knowledge, skills, and understanding needed to make environmentally responsible choices and champion sustainability for years to come.”

Preparing a future-ready workforce

The clean transportation transition is creating new opportunities in clean technology, sustainable energy, and skilled trades. However, Canada needs a workforce equipped with the knowledge and skills to support the EV sector. The expanded EV Awareness Student Learning Program addresses this by providing students in grades 7-12 with hands-on, curriculum-aligned learning experiences.

Through presentations, demonstrations, and digital learning modules, students gain a deeper understanding of EV technology and the environmental responsibility behind it. This prepares them for emerging careers in clean technology and positions them to lead in the transition to a low-carbon economy. By focusing on youth, the program ensures Canada’s future workforce is ready to meet the challenges of the clean energy transition.

Collaboration between key stakeholders

This initiative’s success stems from the collaboration between Plug’n Drive, Call2Recycle Canada, and the Skills Council of Canada.

The latest report from E2 shows that in 2025, companies canceled over $32 billion worth of clean energy manufacturing projects due to reduced government incentives and funding cuts, as well as tariff policies.

But, at the same time, some industry giants have significantly increased investment in the U.S. Last year, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. announced a $100 billion investment with three new fabs, two advanced packaging facilities and an R&D center. Midyear, Micron revealed plans for a $200 billion investment in Idaho, New York, and Virginia with semiconductor manufacturing plants and an R&D center.

These investments partly stem from the new federal policies that aim to incentivize domestic production by making imports and hiring foreign workers more expensive. Other factors include funding from the CHIPS Act as well as state or local tax credits for job creation.

The announcements are a combination of building new facilities and expanding existing plants. Here are some of the biggest projects set to break ground or begin operations in 2026.

Micron

Product: Memory chips

Overall investment: $200 billion

Locations: Idaho, New York and Virginia

Timeline: Construction of the New York fab began in January

Micron’s memory manufacturing facility in New York broke ground earlier this month, and production at its Idaho site is expected to begin next year.

The company is investing $200 billion across multiple facilities, with plans to spend $150 billion on fabs and $50 billion on R&D. The project includes two fabs in Idaho, four fabs in New York and the expansion of its existing manufacturing fab in Virginia.

The project, which aims to produce 40% of the company’s dynamic random access memory in the U.S., is estimated to create 90,000 direct and indirect jobs.

The announcement was made in partnership with the U.S. Department of Commerce with $6.4 billion in funding through the CHIPS and Science Act.

Samsung Electronics

Product: Semiconductors

Investment: $17 billion

Location: Texas

Timeline: Expected to be operational in 2026

Samsung’s “initial minimum investment” for a semiconductor manufacturing plant in Taylor, Texas, is said to be the largest foreign investment in the state.

Construction was halted last year due to reduced demand and resumed in mid-2025. The factory is expected to be operational in 2026, and the company estimates the project will create 1,800 jobs within a decade.

Earlier, Samsung had planned $44 billion worth of investment in Texas, for which it was granted $6.4 billion in funding under the CHIPS Act. As the company reduced the investment to $37 billion, funding was cut to $4.7 billion.

The project is a part of a broader multibillion-dollar expansion in the region, where the company said it has invested over $47 billion since the 1970s.

Stellantis

Product: Vehicles

Investment: $13 billion

Locations: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio

Timeline: Indiana facility begins production in 2026, others by the end of the decade

Stellantis is investing $13 billion across the U.S. to expand production by 50% over the next four years.

In Indiana, the company will produce a new four-cylinder engine beginning in 2026. In Illinois, there are plans to reopen a facility and begin production of two new Jeep vehicles in 2027.

In Michigan, the project will retool the Warren Truck Assembly Plant for a new range-extended electric vehicle and large SUV expected to be ready by 2028. The Detroit Assembly Complex will see production of the next-gen Dodge Durango by 2029.

This is the company’s biggest investment in the U.S. and is expected to create over 5,000 jobs.

Lilly

Product: Drugs

Investment: $27 billion

Locations: Alabama, Texas and Virginia

Timeline: Alabama facility breaks ground in 2026

Lilly is set to begin construction on its $6 billion active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing facility in Huntsville, Alabama, this year. The plant is part of the company’s $27 billion investment to build four new pharmaceutical production facilities across the U.S.

One of the confirmed sites includes a $6.5 billion plant in Houston. This facility is expected to be operational within roughly five years after construction begins. The second site is a $5 billion cancer drug facility in Richmond, Virginia, also expected to be completed in five years.

Together, the projects fall under the company’s broader plan to invest $50 billion in expanding production in the country, which it describes as the largest pharmaceutical investment in U.S. history.

Texas Instruments

Product: Semiconductors

Investment: $11 billion

Location: Utah

Timeline: Construction previously projected to begin in 2026

Texas Instruments is investing $11 billion to expand its semiconductor manufacturing with a new 300-millimeter fab in Lehi, Utah.

The new facility will be located next to the company’s existing fab, which it acquired from Micron in 2021.

Production is targeted to begin in 2026. It is expected to create about 800 direct jobs and thousands of indirect jobs in the coming years.

Rivian

Product: Electric vehicles

Investment: $5 billion

Location: Georgia

Timeline: Construction begins in 2026

Despite the Trump administration rolling back certain incentives, EV maker Rivian has started working on a long-delayed $5 billion facility in Stanton Springs, Georgia.

Construction is expected to ramp up in 2026, and the 9-million-square-foot site is scheduled to produce 400,000 vehicles annually by 2028.

The company is slated to receive $1.5 billion of incentives through the state if it creates 7,500 jobs paying at least $56,000 a year on average.

Matthew Boms: We’re coming up on the five-year anniversary of Winter Storm Uri, and a lot has changed since then.
That’s relatively new since Winter Storm Uri.
The idea is to prevent the cascading failures that we saw during Winter Storm Uri.","Trust in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the operator of the state’s predominant power grid, was shaken greatly by the devastating February 2021 winter storm that resulted in widespread, days-long blackouts. Temperatures plummeted into the single digits and resulted in the deaths of more than two hundred Texans from hypothermia, carbon monoxide poisoning, and other causes directly tied to power loss.

As this weekend’s forecast calls for precipitously low temperatures and wintry precipitation, some Texans are understandably concerned about the possibility of another catastrophic grid failure. Texas Monthly spoke to Matthew Boms, executive director of the Texas Advanced Energy Business Alliance, an industry group that advocates for companies offering wind-, solar-, hydroelectric-, and battery-powered technologies. Texans should be prepared, he says, but a few critical changes in state regulatory policy have outfitted the power-supply chain to withstand the coming chill.

Texas Monthly: Do you think the Texas energy grid is better prepared for this weekend’s winter storm than it was in 2021?

Matthew Boms: We’re coming up on the five-year anniversary of Winter Storm Uri, and a lot has changed since then. To start, we have adopted new weather-emergency standards for power plants and critical equipment. That means better winterization and more inspections, which has helped a lot with preparing us for winter storms.

Over at the Railroad Commission, there are winter inspections of natural gas infrastructure, and that’s a really important improvement, because a lot of the grid failures that we saw during Uri were not only tied to power plants, but also to fuel-supply disruptions. Winterization guidelines were in place, but they were voluntary. There was really no enforcement mechanism and no penalties for failing to do so.

TM: What does winterization and weatherization entail at a power plant?

MB: We’re really talking about making sure that this equipment can operate in freezing conditions, instead of assuming that Texas weather will stay mild. Because, as we’re seeing, these winter storms are increasing in their frequency and in their intensity. So, for power plants, that means insulating the pipes, the valves, the instrumentation, so they don’t freeze. It means protecting the sensors and control systems from ice and moisture. It means heat tracing on critical components, weatherproofing the cooling systems and fuel-handling equipment. For natural gas, it’s just as important, because gas is the fuel for most of our grid. So that means insulating and heating well heads and valves, protecting compressors and processing equipment from freezing, and weatherizing the dehydration units that prevent the water from freezing inside of pipelines.

TM: Are there any backup power sources that can be activated in the event the gas supply runs short or the grid is overwhelmed?

MB: At the grid level, ERCOT doesn’t have a big backup generator that it could turn on. Reliability means having enough generation and transmission and fuel supply all working at the same time. However, there are layers of backup that matter. For power plants and gas facilities, many of them do have on-site backup generators to keep their controls, their pumps, and their compressors running if they lose power. That’s relatively new since Winter Storm Uri. They’re not meant to power cities, but they could keep the facility itself operating so it could keep producing electricity or gas. That was really one of the major lessons from Uri: The gas infrastructure lost power and couldn’t supply fuel to the power plants. So there’s no single emergency generator that could replace the grid during the winter storm, but the reliability comes from thousands of power plants staying online together.

TM: Are you confident in the grid’s ability to perform after the implemented winterization?

MB: I think it’s less vulnerable than it was in 2021, but it’s not immune. These are mechanical systems that operate outdoors, so freezing temperatures will always be a risk if the equipment isn’t properly protected, right? The changes that have been made since Uri do make a significant difference, and I think they reduce the risk of a repeat of what we saw during Winter Storm Uri, but gas is still the most weather-sensitive part of the system. Water can freeze in the equipment, any power loss to the compressors means you don’t have any flow of fuel, and then extremely cold or prolonged events like single-digit temperatures could overwhelm those protections. So there are still weak points that exist.

TM: Is there a threshold ERCOT has for implementing rolling blackouts like we saw in 2021?

MB: Blackouts are supposed to be the last tool. The first is forecasting and market signals. ERCOT monitors weather and demand days in advance. If they see a tight situation, then they’ll issue a grid-condition notice, similar to a Weather Watch, called an Energy Emergency Alert. As prices rise, that encourages more generation to come online, and power plants need to confirm their availability days in advance.

If we are in really bad shape, that’s where outages become unavoidable. Then ERCOT prioritizes emergency services like hospitals, gas facilities, and water systems. The idea is to prevent the cascading failures that we saw during Winter Storm Uri. For this storm, I would think that, looking at the grid now, we have plenty of generation to meet the demand that’s coming over the weekend.

TM: What role do wind and solar power play when we’re dealing with a winter storm?

MB: They play an enormous role. In my mind, they are the number one reason that our grid is more reliable than it was five years ago. Ninety percent of new generation in Texas since Uri has been in solar, wind, and batteries, and that matters more for winter reliability than most people realize.

With solar energy, we have the strongest output in the middle of the day, and that helps meet peak demand and reduces the strain on gas plants. The modern wind turbines today are much better cold-weather-rated than older models, and wind doesn’t depend on fuel delivery or pipelines or compressors. They really operate independently. And then batteries are the real game changer. Batteries can respond instantly if a plant trips offline, so they help stabilize the grid. They buy time for other generators to ramp up, and Texas now has more battery capacity than any other state in the country.

It means we’re not depending on any single fuel source. We’re more diversified than any other point in our history. More wind, solar, and batteries means fewer single points of failure.

TM: If demand overwhelms the grid, will big industrial consumers like data centers be required to shut down?

MB: Generally speaking, they’re not automatically required to shut down, but many of them participate in programs where they agree in advance to reduce load when the grid is under stress. Many of these big customers sign contracts with ERCOT or with their retail provider to curtail their usage when they’re called upon. Also, a lot of them have their own on-site generators that they can switch to while reducing their nonessential operations. In exchange, they get lower power prices, direct payments, or reliability guarantees. So when demand gets tight, the first step is to activate these programs, and that frees up thousands of megawatts if things do get extreme. The Public Utility Commission is working on rules now that will clarify exactly what are the rules around data centers shutting down or using their own backup generation in case of a grid-emergency event.

TM: Can individual households do anything to prepare for a potential grid outage?

MB: There’s a huge piece of the equation that is being overlooked, and that’s distributed energy resources, which means any technology that is local and on the distributed grid. Think of a residential battery or rooftop solar or a backup generator in the garage. They all help reduce demand locally. If you’re able to power your own home or business through a winter storm, you are playing a huge part in keeping the grid stable.

Also, there is a new technology called a virtual power plant, which means that ERCOT and the utilities can potentially dispatch thousands of small distributed technologies, like batteries, to work in homes and businesses. Those could all behave like a fast, flexible power plant. I think in the future, that’s going to be a huge part of the conversation as we bring in more data centers and more load into ERCOT. Customers will be a part of the reliability solution, a small power source that reduces stress, provides backup power, and helps stabilize the system during emergencies.

Extreme cold is expected in the coming days across much of the northern and eastern U.S. The multi-wave Arctic outbreak is likely to sustain below-normal temperatures across the Central and Eastern U.S., driving up demand for natural gas and electricity. Dr. Ryan Maue of Weather Trader reported that “potentially catastrophic winter weather” could affect much of the eastern U.S. into the weekend, with Saturday temperatures near and below minus 20°F expected across the Midwest and Great Lakes. Looking at market conditions, natural gas supplies this week appear robust, with production up year over year and storage inventories above both year-ago levels and the five-year average. Canadian imports are rising ahead of the cold, even as the Arctic cold arrives first in the north. The Market Indicators team is monitoring these developments closely and will provide updates as conditions evolve and material market impacts emerge.

In the 500th edition of the Natural Gas Market Indicators (NGMI), the Market Indicators team looked back at how the natural gas market has changed over the last twenty years. With the 501st, we look forward: where might the market be headed as it considers issues of reliability, demand growth, LNG markets, energy security, new infrastructure requirements, and more?

This edition relies on two main sources for near-term projections: the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) and Rystad Energy. Annual projections are presented as ranges and midpoints to reflect prevailing expectations. Select monthly charts provide additional detail on near-term projections. As with any projection, these outlooks are subject to change. Unforeseen changes and new information may alter outcomes over time. Nevertheless, today’s expectations offer valuable insight into near-term market sentiment and potential system dynamics.

Transforming a system and a bureaucracy built on outdated animal testing methods takes persistence and collaboration.","The EPA first embraced the 2035 deadline in 2019, but subsequent agency leaders during the Biden administration pulled back from that promise. We are heartened that the current EPA has now set a firm goal and timeline to phase out animal testing on mammals. It means we stand on the threshold of a new era in the struggle to make this world a better one for animals.

Even as we acknowledge the agency’s promise to do more, we’re calling on the EPA to move swiftly to end animal testing for chemicals and pesticides that it regulates.

We are also urging the agency to immediately prioritize the elimination of the 90-day pesticide test on dogs which involves forcing at least 32 dogs to ingest pesticides every day for 90 days, then killing them if they have not already died from the toxic effects of the substances (this follows our work years ago to successfully eliminate the one-year pesticide test on dogs). In 2023, we published a peer-reviewed scientific paper demonstrating that, in nearly all cases, the 90-day dog test provides no added value in determining pesticide risks to humans.

At today’s event announcing the recommitment, Sara spoke about how the call to eliminate animal tests has been part of our larger call for compassion to animals since our founding, and it continues to be a priority.

Nearly 30 years ago we negotiated a critical agreement with EPA for its High Production Volume Chemical Program, which relied heavily on animal testing. In collaboration with partners in animal protection and the chemical industry, we secured a significant agency reduction in the required animal testing, commitments to new non-animal methods and the first dedicated funding for development of non-animal methods. We have worked on similar reforms for another EPA-led initiative, the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program.

In 2007, we played a vital role in shaping the conclusions and recommendations of “Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century: A Vision and a Strategy,” a National Research Council report that called for a paradigm shift in toxicology, one that moved from traditional, animal-based testing to approaches relying on human cells, high-throughput screening and computational models instead of animals.

In 2016, we helped to secure the first U.S. statutory language calling for new animal testing to be a ""last resort."" With the reauthorization of the Toxic Substances Control Act, named the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, this was a true milestone in the campaign to end animal testing.

Other U.S. government agencies are also on board with replacing animal tests with sophisticated non-animal methods. The EPA commitment comes on the heels of similar announcements from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health in 2025. With so much work on this issue taking place across the U.S. government we encourage the EPA, NIH and the FDA to join with other federal agencies in an interagency taskforce to maximize resources in a concentrated initiative to end new animal testing.

Our goal is to end animal cruelty, and to achieve this vision, we have have never shied away from the most challenging tasks. Transforming a system and a bureaucracy built on outdated animal testing methods takes persistence and collaboration. We’re eager to work with EPA officials and animal protection partners to ensure that animal tests are phased out as quickly as possible.

During an interview this past week at the Detroit Auto Show, the Stellantis CEO made it clear that the automaker is rethinking how it prices vehicles—and what kinds of vehicles it brings to market.

U.S. sales fell by about 3% in 2025, though executives say momentum improved in the second half of the year.","Affordability has become one of the biggest pressure points in the American auto market, and Antonio Filosa knows it. During an interview this past week at the Detroit Auto Show, the Stellantis CEO made it clear that the automaker is rethinking how it prices vehicles—and what kinds of vehicles it brings to market.

Speaking with Luke Ramseth of The Detroit News, Filosa said Stellantis is actively exploring ways to bring more affordable products back into its U.S. lineup, including the possibility of models priced under $30,000.

“A combination of value proposition with being competitive in the price offer, this is one way” to address affordability, Filosa said. “The other way is the product lineup.”

That comment neatly sums up the two-pronged approach Stellantis is now taking. On one side, the company has already started adjusting pricing and trim structures across several brands. On the other side, the company is reworking its future product mix to better align with what American buyers can realistically afford.

In his interview, Filosa made it clear that more changes are coming. Additional smaller and cheaper vehicles are on the table, even if nothing is officially locked in yet. According to the CEO, Stellantis will add more models under $40,000 and “will investigate” options under the $30,000 level.

Right now, Stellantis’ least expensive vehicle in the U.S. is the Jeep® Compass (MP), which for the 2026 model year comes in at a starting price of $30,990 when you include destination. Beyond that, many Stellantis products quickly climb into price ranges that are out of reach for a growing number of buyers.

For example, the most affordable Chrysler and Dodge models currently start at $42,890 and $40,990, respectively, including destination charges.

That reality matters more than ever. Average new-vehicle prices in the U.S. are hovering around $50,000—roughly $15,000 higher than they were just ten years ago—and face even more upward pressure from tariffs tied to the Trump administration. Against that backdrop, Stellantis’ renewed focus on affordability represents a noticeable change in direction.

It also marks a philosophical shift from the previous era under former CEO Carlos Tavares, when prices climbed sharply across the lineup and profits followed.

At Stellantis’ Investor Day event in 2024, Filosa, who was the Jeep® CEO at the time, unveiled plans for the return of the Renegade nameplate to the North American market. This time, the Renegade will make its comeback as an all-electric vehicle (BEV) with a starting price just under $25,000. However, Filosa now suggest that the thinking has evolved since then.

“Now, multi-energy is more important that mono-energy, right?” Filosa told Ramseth. “We are looking more deeply into the possibility to (have) a range of offers in that space of price — for Jeep, and not only for Jeep.”

Filosa took them helm of the company official in “Six months gave me enough time to understand all the changes that we need to make,” he said.

The stakes are high. Stellantis is working to pull itself out of a sales and profit slump in its most important market. U.S. sales fell by about 3% in 2025, though executives say momentum improved in the second half of the year.

Beyond products and pricing, Filosa has focused on repairing relationships that had become strained. “I believe that we have been able, not (just) myself, but the team overall, has been able to readdress some past conflict and make a relationship with unions, with dealers and with suppliers, day by day, better and better,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/moparinsiders.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Stellantis-CEO-Antonio-Filosa-at-the-2026-Detroit-Auto-Show.-MoparInsiders.-1.jpeg?fit=2203%2C1239&ssl=1,N,,2026-01-22 14:57:59.650961

In an email obtained by The Associated Press, the U.S. Energy Department said that a push under Puerto Rico’s former governor for a 100% renewable future threatened the reliability of its energy system.

“The Puerto Rico grid cannot afford to run on more distributed solar power,” the message states. “The rapid, widespread deployment of rooftop solar has created fluctuations in Puerto Rico’s grid, leading to unacceptable instability and fragility.”

Javier Rúa Jovet, public policy director for Puerto Rico’s Solar and Energy Storage Association, disputed that statement in a phone interview Thursday.

He said that some 200,000 families across Puerto Rico rely on solar power that generates close to 1.4 gigawatts of energy a day for the rest of the island.

“That’s helping avoid blackouts,” he said, adding that the inverters of those systems also help regulate fluctuations across the grid.

He said he was saddened by the cancellation of the solar projects. “It’s a tragedy, honestly,” he said. “These are funds for the most needy.”

Earlier this month, the Energy Department canceled three programs, including one worth $400 million, that would have seen solar and battery storage systems installed in low-income homes and those with medical needs.

In its email, the department said that on Jan. 9, it would reallocate up to $350 million from private distributed solar systems to support fixes to improve the generation of power in Puerto Rico. It wasn’t immediately clear if that funding has been allocated.

One of those programs would have financed solar projects for 150 low-income households on the tiny Puerto Rican island of Culebra.

“The people are really upset and angry,” said Dan Whittle, an associate vice president with the Environmental Defense Fund, which was overseeing that project. “They’re seeing other people keep the lights on during these power outages, and they’re not sure why they’re not included.”

He noted that a privately funded project helped install solar panels and batteries on 45 homes a week before Hurricane Fiona hit Puerto Rico in September 2022.

Whittle said he was baffled by the federal government’s decision.

“They are buying hook, line and sinker that solar is the problem. It could not be more wrong,” he said.

The solar projects were part of an initial $1 billion fund created by U.S. Congress in 2022 under former President Joe Biden to help boost energy resilience in Puerto Rico, which is still trying to recover from Hurricane Maria.

The Category 4 storm slammed into the island in September 2017, razing an electric grid already weakened by a lack of maintenance and investment. Outages have persisted since then, with massive blackouts hitting on New Year’s Eve in 2024 and during Holy Week last year.

In recent years, residents and businesses that could afford to do so have embraced solar energy on an island of 3.2 million people with a more than 40% poverty rate.

But more than 60% of energy on the island is still generated by petroleum-fired power plants, 24% by natural gas, 8% by coal and 7% by renewables, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The cancellation of the solar projects comes a month after the administration of Puerto Rico Gov. Jenniffer González sued Luma Energy, a private company overseeing the transmission and distribution of power on the island.

At the time, González said that the electrical system “has not improved with the speed, consistency or effectiveness that Puerto Rico deserves.”",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ricardo-gomez-angel-MagdWoazARo-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 15:39:04.574087

BATON ROUGE, La. — Jeff Landry today announced the launch of Louisiana’s Whole-of-Louisiana Energy Strategy, a comprehensive statewide framework designed to align state agencies, regional and local partners, regulators, utilities, and private industry around a shared mission: positioning Louisiana as a national and global leader in energy production, investment, and innovation.

The strategy brings coordination and clarity to Louisiana’s expansive energy assets, reinforcing the state’s role at the center of America’s energy future while accelerating high-wage job creation, infrastructure development, and long-term economic growth.

“Energy has always shaped Louisiana’s economy, and under President Trump’s leadership, it is once again driving America’s future,” said Governor Landry. “With record investment and high-wage job creation, energy is at the center of Louisiana’s economic momentum. The Whole-of-Louisiana Energy Strategy aligns our assets, sharpens our execution, and reinforces our shared commitment to American energy dominance and long-term opportunity for our citizens.”

Eight Statewide Priorities to Accelerate Growth

The strategy builds on Louisiana’s recent economic development momentum and establishes eight statewide priorities aimed at accelerating investment, expanding industrial capacity, and positioning communities for sustained growth:

Expand Louisiana’s industrial base and domestic energy production

Compete globally to win investment that strengthens local communities

Accelerate market-driven infrastructure development

Deliver strategic, reliable energy solutions

Align state services with the speed of business

Strengthen community confidence in major projects

Unleash energy-driven innovation

Establish Louisiana as the nation’s industrial power leader

These priorities are supported by Regional Opportunity Frameworks that identify how region-specific infrastructure, workforce assets, natural resources, and institutions align with market demand and long-term growth trends. The frameworks provide investors and regional partners with a clearer pathway to streamline permitting, site development, and project execution across Louisiana.

“Our strongest year of economic development results confirmed what happens when vision is matched with disciplined execution,” said Susan Bourgeois, Secretary of Louisiana Economic Development (LED). “This strategy builds directly on that momentum by aligning regional strengths within a clear, statewide framework for energy investment, innovation, and high-wage job creation. Through a Whole-of-Louisiana approach, we are positioning the state to lead globally while delivering real opportunity for Louisiana workers and communities.”

Coordinated Government, Faster Execution

The Whole-of-Louisiana Energy Strategy builds on ongoing efforts to streamline and align state government around shared economic development priorities. LED’s 2025 Strategic Plan and 9×90 Workplan, combined with the Department of Conservation and Energy’s (C&E) new organizational model and strategic framework, establish a foundation for coordinated action across agencies.

These efforts are reinforced by an interagency agreement between LED and Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy, as well as Governor Landry’s Louisiana Lightning Speed Executive Order, which formalizes a whole-of-government approach to move projects forward with greater speed, predictability, and coordination.

“This strategy allows state partners to provide clearer guidance on permitting processes and greater certainty for companies investing in Louisiana,” said Dustin Davidson, Secretary of the Department of Conservation and Energy. “By safeguarding the resources and communities that make growth possible, we are strengthening Louisiana’s energy leadership while protecting our shared environment.”

Positioning Louisiana for Global Energy Leadership

State leaders view the strategy as a critical step in ensuring Louisiana capitalizes on its industrial depth, infrastructure, workforce, and execution capability—while reducing foreign energy dependence and advancing U.S. energy leadership on a global scale.

Together, the strategy positions Louisiana as a location of choice for energy production, industrial expansion, and innovation-driven investment.

In 2021, frigid temperatures brought down power plants and plunged millions of Texans into darkness.

But ERCOT said that scenario isn't likely this time around.

Daniel Cohan, an environmental engineering professor at Rice University, said power plants made significant upgrades following the 2021 storm.

""They made sure that their water intakes were able to take water, that the water supply wouldn't freeze up,"" Cohan said. ""They made sure that equipment was ready to handle temperatures well below freezing.""

While census estimates show Texas has added well over a million people since 2021, suggesting greater demand for electricity, Cohan said supply has more than kept up.

""We've seen a tremendous boom in solar farms and battery storage projects being built, and solar and batteries are being built even faster than demand is growing,"" he said.

But all the electricity in the world means nothing if you're unable to receive it.

Ice build-up on power lines and tree branches remains a real threat, which CenterPoint says it's sought to mitigate.

""We're installing stronger poles, right, upgrading equipment. That can be wire, also connection points associated with our system,"" John Cornelius, vice president of distribution operations for CenterPoint, said.

CenterPoint said it was also inspecting and testing 270 substations, installing heaters to prevent ice build-up, and repairing thermal insulation.

This means production in China may continue for sales to other, non-U.S. markets.

General Motors plans to shift production of the next-generation Buick Envision, which it makes in China, to the U.S. in 2028, the company’s latest reconsolidation of vehicle assembly under the auto import tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump.

The Detroit automaker confirmed Jan. 22 that it plans to onshore manufacturing of the compact SUV to Fairfax Assembly in Kansas City, Kansas. GM has made the Buick Envision in China for the North American market since 2017.

Fairfax Assembly currently produces the all-electric Chevrolet Bolt, but will do so for a limited run. The plant is slated to begin production of the gas-powered Chevrolet Equinox in 2027. When the Envision is added, it will be on a shared platform with the Equinox.

“This decision further strengthens GM’s domestic manufacturing footprint and supports U.S. jobs, building on $5.5 billion in new investments announced across our U.S. manufacturing sites in the last year,” GM spokesman Kevin Kelly said in an emailed statement.

GM intends to sell the Buick Envision vehicles assembled at Fairfax to the North American market, the company confirmed. This means production in China may continue for sales to other, non-U.S. markets.

This is the latest change for GM after regulatory shifts and slower-than-expected consumer demand of electric vehicles roiled its production plans during President Trump's second term.

In the meantime, production of the Buick Envision in China has not been disrupted, and GM will continue to ship the Envision to the U.S. from China. GM said additional product and timing details of the new Buick will be shared closer to launch. GM sold 41,924 Buick Envisions in 2025.

The move follows Trump’s tour of a Ford factory in Michigan earlier this month, when he was caught speaking about Farley on a live microphone.

But the company – and Farley – has also pushed against climate rules.","As the Trump administration prepares to overturn the rule underpinning virtually all US climate regulations, a Senate committee is investigating whether the US’s second-largest automaker lobbied for the rollback.

In September, the Senate environment and public works committee launched investigations into two dozen oil companies, thinktanks, law firms and trade associations, focused on how the companies may have persuaded the White House to initiate the repeal of the 2009 endangerment finding. Now, the committee, chaired by the Rhode Island senator Sheldon Whitehouse, is expanding the investigation to include Ford Motor Company.

“I write to seek clarification about comments that President Donald Trump made suggesting that Ford Motor Company – and you, specifically – have played a significant role in advocating for the repeal of long-settled rules and regulations meant to protect human health and the environment,” Whitehouse wrote in the letter to Ford’s CEO, Jim Farley, sent on Thursday morning.

The move follows Trump’s tour of a Ford factory in Michigan earlier this month, when he was caught speaking about Farley on a live microphone. There, the president said that Farley often urged him to change green regulations. Gesturing at the CEO, Trump said: “He calls me all the time: ‘Can we get rid of this environmental piece of garbage?’” He did not name specific rules that Farley pushed him to rescind.

“Straight from Trump’s own mouth, we hear him boasting about working hand in glove with industry to unleash unchecked pollution on our communities,” Whitehouse told the Guardian.

The Guardian has contacted Ford Motor Company for comment.

The endangerment finding states that the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere endangers public health and welfare, allowing the EPA to limit heat-trapping pollution from vehicles, power plants and other industrial sources. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under Lee Zeldin said it would rescind the bedrock determination in July, sparking alarm from scientists, environmental advocates and public health experts.

“The only interests that will benefit from such a corrupt rollback of the endangerment finding, upheld twice by the supreme court, are polluters and their enablers,” said Whitehouse. “American families will pay the price with dirtier air, higher health costs, and a climate-change-fueled economic collapse.”

Ford has voiced its support for some emissions-cutting measures, pledging to zero out its own planet-heating pollution and publicly backing the Paris climate agreement. But the company – and Farley – has also pushed against climate rules.

When the Trump administration rolled back fuel economy standards last month, for instance, Farley praised the move, saying: “President Trump’s leadership in aligning fuel economy standards with market realities.” Ford has also remained a member of trade groups like the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers as it has opposed EPA rules.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d9e1dc1ed5391015ff5ca83a81e4a05c419a9cc/213_0_2129_1703/master/2129.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=82f409d455e60dbf9261954514ba6db4",N,,2026-01-22 13:57:32.345946

Emerald Battery Labs, a startup working out of the University of Washington, recently raised just under $1.1 million in a pre-seed round to continue scaling its sodium-ion battery technology.

The burgeoning energy storage option avoids the use of lithium, which is highly sought, difficult to extract and has limited U.S. production. Sodium, by comparison, is much cheaper and comes from the same element that’s in table salt. The sodium-ion batteries also last longer and present fewer fire concerns.

Battery demand is rising rapidly as these systems pair with renewable, intermittent sources like sun and wind; enhance hydro dam capacity; provide backup power for data centers; power drones and defense devices; and work with EV charging stations to reduce grid strain during peak demand.

“As battery chemistries evolve, as technology evolves, people are going to find new ways to use energy storage technology,” said David Bell, Emerald’s co-founder and chief product officer.

Growing interest

A recent Sightline Climate survey of investors and entrepreneurs in climate tech selected sodium-ion batteries as a top-pick for a 2026 breakthrough technology, coming in just behind the use of AI for clean tech materials discovery.

But there’s already a clear leader in the space.

“China, with its powerful EV industry, has led the early push” into sodium-powered batteries, according to MIT Technology Review.

Chinese auto and battery makers Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd., or CATL, and BYD are in hot pursuit of the technology, MIT reports. CATL claims to have a sodium-ion battery line operating at scale, while BYD is building its own massive production facility.

U.S. competitors include Peak Energy, Nanode Battery Technologies and Unigrid.

While this alternative chemistry offers numerous benefits, there’s an important trade off: it’s less energy dense — meaning sodium-ion batteries need to be larger than competing technologies to deliver the same amount of power.

Emerald’s path forward

Emerald is operating out of the UW’s CoMotion Labs and using the university’s Clean Energy Testbeds for fabrication work. The startup is scaling production and looking for partners to pilot test its products.

It plans to hire additional employees in the coming year. Emerald’s investors include Seattle-based E8, a network of angel investors that backs clean-tech companies; E8 members who directly invested; and an undisclosed family venture office.

Albermarle rose 3.84% to $186.97 at midday after jumping 27.3% year to date through yesterday. The stock set a 52-week high.

Efforts by CEO Kent Masters to reduce capital spending, cut costs and sell assets are paying off, helping increase Albemarle’s free cash flow, as rising lithium prices “should be helpful in contract negotiations when they are due for a rollover in the next 18-24 months,’’ HSBC said earlier this week.

HSBC upgraded Albemarle to “buy’’ from “hold’’ and raised its price target to $200 from $117. Truist also raised its outlook to “buy’’ from “hold’’ and lifted the target price to $205 from $125.

The moves follow recent stock upgrades and higher price targets by several other analysts.

Ormat joins Sage’s series B financing round as Co-Lead

Ormat Technologies has announced an equity investment of $25 million in Sage Geosystems’ Series B financing round. The round totals more than $97 million and is co-led by Ormat and Carbon Direct Capital.

The funding is intended to further develop Sage’s geothermal power generation and energy storage solutions and to realize the first next-generation commercial geothermal plant.

Ormat emphasizes that the investment is part of its strategy to expand its portfolio in the field of Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS). Ormat CEO Doron Blachar commented on the investment: “Our investment in Sage is a natural extension of our strategic collaboration and underscores our confidence in Sage’s Pressure Geothermal technology. As a long-established leader in the geothermal industry, this investment aligns with Ormat’s strategy to advance geothermal innovation, accelerate time to market and expand geothermal energy deployment within the global energy landscape.”

Pilot project in Ormat power plant and pressure geothermal technology

Sage plans to pilot its pressure-geothermal technology at an existing Ormat power plant. The goal is to extract geothermal heat from hot, dry rock while simultaneously building hydraulic pressure as storage, which can later be used to generate electricity. Upon successful completion of the pilot project, Ormat will have the right to develop, build, own, and operate geothermal power plants and energy storage projects that use Sage’s technology.

Sage’s pressure-geothermal technology represents an advancement of hot-dry-rock (HDR) technology. While HDR relies on extracting heat from hot, dry rock by creating artificial fractures, pressure geothermal expands this principle by adding a hydraulic pressure storage system. Controlled, relatively smaller fractures are created in the rock to enable efficient heat transfer while also allowing the buildup and storage of hydraulic pressure. This pressure can be used, similar to a pumped-storage power plant, to drive water through turbines when needed and generate electricity flexibly.

Sage describes the technology as “safe, scalable and cost-effective.” It is intended to not only provide continuous renewable energy but also enable flexible energy storage.

Ormat stock continues to climb

The stock of Ormat, listed on the renewable energy index RENIXX World, is currently trading at €106.15, continuing its growth trend today. In 2025, the Ormat share has risen by a total of 47 percent.

“What EV charging needs is a competitive and lucrative marketplace where folks can actually make money selling EV charging,” he said.
For some retailers, chargers are a loss leader meant to pull customers into stores, said Karl Doenges of the National Association of Convenience Stores.","By Benton Graham, Grist.

Phillip Stafford has been converted. After two years driving a Tesla, he says there’s no going back to gasoline — the money he saves on fuel alone makes that clear. And since his work as a crisis counselor takes him all over Richmond, Virginia, he charges often.

That’s made him picky about where he buys electrons. On a crisp fall afternoon last month, Stafford had his Model 3 plugged in at a Sheetz. A red and white Wawa sandwich wrapper on the seat hinted at where his heart lies in that convenience store rivalry. Still, brand loyalty only goes so far when the battery is running low. Given a choice between the two, Sheetz wins. “It has more watts, so it charges a little faster,” he said.

The seemingly small question of where to spend 20 or so minutes topping off a battery reveals the transformation taking hold among fuel retailers. For more than 50 years, chains like Wawa, Sheetz, and Love’s Travel Stops have defined when and where people refuel. As EVs reshape mobility, they are among the retailers embracing charging.

Their challenge goes beyond providing power to turning the time drivers spend plugged in into profitable foot traffic. Selling electricity alone won’t pay the bills; the real money lies in selling snacks. Making that work requires reimagining what a pit stop looks and feels like, even as costly infrastructure upgrades and shifting federal policies complicate the transition.

Wawa and Sheetz are among the furthest along. The Pennsylvania-based companies have built out hundreds of chargers and enjoy fervent fanbases that make them two of the most popular convenience stores in the country. Their made-to-order sandwiches, vast array of snacks, and clean restrooms have made them regular stops for road trippers and commuters alike — and now, for EV drivers looking to recharge their cars and, often, themselves.

They offer a glimpse of the road ahead. As electric vehicles move ever further from niche toward norm, the focus for retailers like these could shift from who offers the cheapest fuel to who can make waiting for the car to fill up the best experience.

“The problem with a lot of current gas stations is [they’re] not that nice of a place to spend 15, 20, or 30 minutes,” said Scott Hardman of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis. “Hopefully in the future, we’ll see more of them turn into coffee shops, cafes — places you actually want to be.”

That future is slowly coming into focus. Retailers like Wawa and Sheetz have spent the past few years exploring what the transition from selling gasoline to selling electricity might look like. Even with the headwinds EVs face, at least 26 percent of cars on U.S. roads could be electric by 2035, and some projections suggest they could account for 65 percent of all sales by 2050.

The two chains offer a place to plug in at roughly 10 percent of their locations. Wawa has installed more than 210 chargers, while Sheetz provides more than 650 at 95 locations that have logged more than 2 million sessions. Clean amenities and expansive menus with offerings like Wawa’s turkey-stuffed Gobbler and Sheetz’s deep-fried Big Mozz have placed them near the top of convenience store satisfaction rankings.

Both say embracing cars with cords builds on what already attracts customers. Wawa frames it as an extension of its “one-stop” model for food and fuel. Its competitor calls charging “a seamless extension of the Sheetz experience.” The language differs, but the message is the same: Selling electricity works if it brings people like John Baiano inside.

The New York resident owns two Tesla Model Ys and travels throughout the northeast for his two businesses, a Bitcoin consultancy and a horse racing operation. He plugs in at Wawa because the stores are clean, offer plenty of amenities, and provide a comfortable place to check in with clients. “I use the bathroom, maybe get a snack,” he said. (He prefers the turkey pinwheel.) “I was a little nervous about the charging aspect of things. Once I started experiencing this, it was seamless.”

At the moment, most public quick chargers are tucked away in the far corners of shopping centers, inside parking garages, and other functional but hardly inviting places to spend 20 minutes. They’re fine when you’re out and about running errands, but not terribly appealing at night and not particularly conducive to a road trip.

Tesla dominates the space with its Supercharger network, which provides over half the country’s quick chargers, with Electrify America, EVGo, and ChargePoint together accounting for another 25 to 30 percent. Retailers like Love’s Travel Stops, Pilot Flying J, and Buc-ee’s are joining Sheetz and Wawa in working with those networks and others to add chargers alongside gas pumps. Their efforts signal how a system built for gasoline is starting to evolve for electricity.

Everything Stafford and Baiano like about plugging in at a convenience store reflects an Electric Vehicle Council study that ranked security, lighting, and 24/7 access as three things drivers most want in a charging station. Another survey found that 80 percent of them will go out of their way to get it. Reliability is another concern — and a frequent complaint with the nation’s current charging infrastructure. As EVs become more common, drivers are going to be less willing to put up with malfunctioning or broken chargers than the early adopters were.

Ryan McKinnon of the Charge Ahead Partnership, which pushes for a comprehensive charging network, sees fuel retailers as a logical place to build out such a system because they already have the right locations and amenities. “What EV charging needs is a competitive and lucrative marketplace where folks can actually make money selling EV charging,” he said.

Therein lies the challenge. Buying and installing a quick charger can cost more than $100,000. Beyond that lie fluctuating prices from utility companies, which one leading charging provider said is a key factor in deciding where to locate the devices. Retailers won’t recover that by selling electrons alone, given that the machines might generate just $10,000 in revenue each year, Hardman said. EVGo noted in its second quarter earnings report that it earned just under $12,000 per stall.

Making this work for retailers requires getting people out of their cars and into the stores. Just as gas retailers earn two-thirds of their profit selling sandwiches, snacks, and sodas, those selling electricity can expect to do the same. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that installing an EV charger increased spending by 1 percent, which would cover 11 percent of the cost of installing the charger. (Other studies have found similar benefits for surrounding businesses; Tesla Superchargers can boost revenue by 4 percent.)

For some retailers, chargers are a loss leader meant to pull customers into stores, said Karl Doenges of the National Association of Convenience Stores. Others see them as a way to secure increasingly scarce electrical capacity while it’s available. Some are moving “forward on a charging station, even though they don’t think [the market is] 100 percent ready,” he said.

Even the strongest business cases for installing the devices depended on Washington’s help to pencil out. Incentives the Biden administration created through the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided billions in grants, tax credits, and matching funds to help expand the fueling infrastructure of tomorrow, particularly in rural and low-income communities that a free market might overlook.

When Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election, there was little doubt federal support for this ambitious effort would change. Yet the upheaval was more dramatic than expected. In February, the Trump administration paused the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure, or NEVI, program, the backbone of Washington’s effort to build a nationwide charging network. Fuel retailers, which have been some of the effort’s biggest beneficiaries, expressed concern.

The administration reluctantly reinstated NEVI, which had installed just 126 charging ports by the time Trump won his second term, in August. “If Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let’s cut the waste and do it right,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at the time. But with most of the funding allocated, the program will likely expire in 2026.

When it revived NEVI, the Trump administration updated recommendations for states, which administer the funds, in a way that seems to favor a national network run by big chains with highway operations. The Federal Highway Administration’s guidance explicitly recommended building charging infrastructure near fuel retailers.

Nonetheless, at least some of those companies see this as a difficult moment for EV charging. Joe Sheetz, executive vice chairman of the family-owned company, has said momentum is slowing because much of the funding has come from the government and big players like Tesla. Some smaller chains are backing away, but Sheetz said his company will keep at it.

Even as EV adoption grows, most people will continue to plug in largely at home. About 80 percent of charging occurs there, and some providers, like It’s Electric, are skipping partnerships with fuel retailers, focusing instead on slower and cheaper level 2 chargers that are convenient for apartments or homes without garages and do the job in four to 10 hours.

Charles Gerena, a lead organizer of the advocacy organization Drive Electric RVA, rarely visits a public charger in his Chevy Bolt. But on longer trips, he’s noticed more opportunities to plug in, especially in rural areas where fast charging was once scarce. On a recent road trip to Virginia Beach in his wife’s Ford Mustang Mach-E, he took advantage of the car’s ability to tap the Tesla Supercharger network and used the PlugShare app to find a reliable station — at a Wawa.

“I like Wawa’s food better than Sheetz,” he said. “I think I’m in the minority. My daughter actually likes Sheetz better.” Still, for Gerena, reliability trumps loyalty. “If it gets a lousy rating, I’d be wary of going to it, regardless of which gas station it was.”

Despite customer loyalty that can sometimes divide households, retailers are learning that sandwiches and snacks aren’t enough. Success will depend on providing plenty of opportunities to plug in, and making sure the hardware works when drivers need it.",https://www.newhopefreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Electric-Vehicle-Charging-Station.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 13:39:46.522372

Renewable downturn 2025 has been a mixed bag for the renewable energy sector.","Surveying a year of energy and sustainability developments in the data center sector reveals several clear trends. Chief among them is the renewed emphasis on power availability, driven primarily by the growth of AI-related demand.

A September report from Goldman Sachs Research projected that global power demand from the data center sector could rise by 50 percent by 2027. This, in turn, is reflected in the pipelines of major utilities worldwide. For example, the UK's National Grid reported that it expects to connect up to 19GW of new capacity by 2031, half from data centers. In the US, a recent Wood Mackenzie report showed that US utilities had committed to connect more than 160GW of new large-load demand. In the PJM Interconnection market alone, 55GW of new demand is expected to come online by 2030, with 100GW by 2037. As a result, S&P Global has reported that data centers across the US will require nearly three times as much grid-based power by 2030 as they did last year.

In response, power providers in the US and further afield have reconsidered fossil-fuel generation, with support for traditional renewables softening. At the same time, there has been growing interest in alternative low-carbon energy sources, most notably nuclear, geothermal, and hydrogen fuel cells, which have seen increased uptake across the sector.

The result has been an increasingly diverse mix of power strategies across the sector, reflecting an “all of the above” approach touted by most utilities in meeting unfettered demand from the data center market.

Nuclear Renaissance

One of the biggest stories in the data center sector this year has been the proliferation of deals with nuclear energy producers. These have ranged from Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) between hyperscalers and large-scale nuclear plants to long-term bets on advanced nuclear technologies.

For the hyperscalers, the focus in the US has been primarily on securing power from operational or recently shuttered nuclear plants. Spurred on by Microsoft’s Three Mile Island deal, signed last year, Meta, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google have all signed long-term PPAs to offtake power from nuclear plants.

​AWS signed a PPA with Talen Energy to receive up to 1.92GW of generation from the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station in Pennsylvania through to 2042. The signing of the PPA brought to a close almost a year of dispute over the initial behind-the-meter agreement signed between the two companies, which was rejected by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Meanwhile, Meta signed a 20-year deal with Constellation Energy to offtake around 1.1GW from the Clinton Clean Energy Center starting in 2027. Most recently, Google partnered with NextEra Energy to restart the shuttered Duane Arnold Energy Center via a 25-year PPA that will supply around 615MW to power its Iowa-based cloud and AI infrastructure once the plant returns online, expected sometime in 2029.

The year also saw the emergence of Fermi America and its planned 11GW energy and data center campus in Amarillo, Texas. The company is planning to develop a hybridized off-grid energy park, comprising natural gas, renewables, and four AP1000 nuclear reactors. The project has faced criticism over its viability, and suffered a blow in December when its first tenant, due to cover $150 million of the campus construction bill, pulled out. Fermi insists talks with the company concerned are ongoing.

While the hyperscalers have snapped up all available capacity from traditional plants, other players have taken a longer-term bet on small modular reactors (SMRs) - miniaturized fission reactors, with capacities ranging from one to 500MW.

Since the turn of the year, numerous data center operators have committed to (mostly non-binding) offtakes with SMR developers, including Data4, Endeavour, and Equinix. The Equinix deal was particularly notable, not only due to its size, totaling more than 750MW of power, but also because it was with three separate SMR developers, all with considerable variations in capacity and technology. The colo provider signed deals with Stellaria and ULC Energy in Europe, and Radiant, a 1MW microreactor developer in the US. DCD did a deep dive into the deal in our latest magazine.

Finally, we saw a renewed interest in fusion power, driven yet again by the hyperscalers. In July, Google signed a 200MW PPA with Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), a nuclear fusion firm, for power from its inaugural ARC plant. The plant has a planned capacity of 400MW, and is projected to deliver its first power to the Virginia grid in the early 2030s. Google also has the option to offtake additional power from future ARC plants.

The major caveat for both the SMR and especially the fusion sector is the question of commercialization, with SMRs only expected to come online in the mid-2030s, and fusion even later (if ever). Data center operators have argued, however, that by backing the technology now, they are providing it the support it needs to reach commercialization, with the offtakes acting as a form of annuity.

Renewable downturn

2025 has been a mixed bag for the renewable energy sector.

Outside the US market, the sector has continued to flourish, with data centers retaining their position as the world's largest offtakers of low-carbon power. This was especially apparent in Europe, where sustained demand driven by AI saw companies across the continent sign several deals via long-term PPAs, especially in Spain, Italy, and the FLAPD data center markets.

Notable deals include a 138MW PPA signed by Apple Italy, Google's 35MW wind PPA with Exus in Spain, and Amazon's 472MW PPA with OX2 in Finland.

There was also an uptick across the Asia Pacific market, especially in Japan. Microsoft signed its second PPA in the market, inking a 100MW solar PPA with Shizen Energy. Google also signed its second PPA in Japan, inking a 15MW deal with Jera. Finally, Equinix got in on the act, signing its first PPA in the country, agreeing to a 20-year deal for 30MW of power.

In the US market, however, the sector has been rocked by the Trump administration, which has removed many of the incentives brought in as part of the previous administration's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This culminated in the passing of “The One Big Beautiful Bill,” which stripped most tax credits for the sector. The bill imposed a 50 percent tax on wind projects and a 30 percent tax on solar projects completed after December 2027, if they cannot prove they haven’t used Chinese components. For other projects seeking to claim clean electricity tax credits, the phase-out of the credits would begin for construction after 2032, regardless of the IRA's emission reduction targets.

Despite the less-than-supportive administration, data center firms in the US continued to sign renewable power agreements, with the hyperscalers again leading the way. For example, in December, Meta signed 2.5GW worth of PPAs with NextEra Energy to support its US operations, to go with several other PPAs it signed across the country. Google inked several PPAs in the US, including a 15-year PPA with TotalEnergies in Ohio, and AWS continued with its aggressive clean power strategy in an effort to maintain its top spot as the largest corporate buyer of renewables.

Fossil power

The Trump administration’s anti-renewable stance has fed into its open and enthusiastic support of the fossil fuel industry. Since his inauguration, President Trump has signed off on a series of measures to support the fossil fuel sector, with coal in particular receiving notable support, through several executive orders. As a result, in September, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the administration now expects most of the country’s coal-fired power plants to delay retirement to help meet energy demand from the AI data center sector.

Support for coal stands in stark contrast to the fuel's steady decline over the past quarter-century. The fuel share in the US energy mix has fallen to around 15 percent, compared with 2001 levels, when it accounted for 51 percent of the US’ energy.

​While coal has dominated the headlines, natural gas has emerged as the go-to option for many data center developers looking to expedite their route to power.

NRG’s 5.4GW agreement with GE Vernova was the year’s biggest move, proposing four new gas-fired projects designed to serve fast-growing data center clusters. In Texas, CloudBurst signed a ten-year supply deal with Energy Transfer, securing up to 450,000 MMBtu per day of gas for its San Marcos campus.",https://media.datacenterdynamics.com/media/images/GettyImages-1372200846.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 14:39:51.000850

Marysville officials, after paying to demolish the historic Hotel Marysville and bury its remains in concrete spray, want help with the anticipated multimillion-dollar cost to rid downtown of it.

Next week officials plan to apply for nearly $4 million from the Environmental Protection Agency to remove the mound known locally as “Mount Marysville,” and rehabilitate the corner lot where a hotel bearing the city’s namesake once stood.

Mount Marysville, encapsulating most of the debris created by the demolition of the fire-ravaged hotel, contains materials with lead and asbestos that may complicate its removal. The full extent of toxins at the site is unknown, as surveyors were unable to measure all the environmental effects as the mound blocks access to the hotel basement, soil and groundwater.

Jeramy Chapdelaine, Marysville public works director, told city council members Tuesday that the grant application has another round of edits before being sent to the EPA next week. The deadline is next Wednesday, according to the EPA.

“Cross the ‘T’s, dot the ‘I’s, cross your fingers and hope it works,” said Mayor Chris Branscum.

EPA program helps communities clear hazardous materials

The federal grants administered through the EPA Brownfields Program range from $500,000 to $4 million, with the city’s ask for more than $3.9 million hitting the high end of that range. The program helps communities clear land that could be developed of hazardous substances and pollutants.

The city missed its opportunity to receive a grant from the same grant program last year, and have worked to meet the requirements for what they hope to be a multimillion-dollar lifeline.

Jim Schaad, Marysville city manager, said that the EPA selections are expected around June, and that awards would likely follow in September or October. Based on that timeline, if awarded, the city would target early to mid-2027 for removing the pile of rubble.

“It’s a very competitive grant,” he said.

The city took ownership of the property while the hollowed-out brick landmark remained upright, following a legal battle with the property’s owners in the months after a fire tore through the building in June 2024. That December the city, with money received in the legal settlement, paid to demolish the hotel, a centerpiece of downtown Marysville in its day that had gone unoccupied for more than 40 years.

But the city’s funds fell short of the steep cost to remove the pile of rubble, which has remained covered in a concrete spray called gunite in the heart of downtown for more than a year.

Environmental concerns

Environmental analysis after the fire determined that asbestos inside the building was likely released into the surrounding area due to the fire that destroyed the building. Surveyors also noted the potential for petroleum to enter soil and groundwater from a boiler and oil tank historically used in the hotel basement, according to the grant application.

“Children, seniors, and individuals with respiratory conditions are particularly at risk from airborne contaminants and accidental exposures,” the city wrote. “EPA Cleanup Grant funding is essential to eliminate these threats, safeguarding the most vulnerable community members.”

The hotel basement and foundation remain beneath the mound of debris. Testing done last month was limited due to the nature of the concrete pile, and the basement could not be reached for sampling.

The company that tested the mound found that its presence was not an “immediate threat,” according to the application, but recommended more testing once the mound is removed to assess the soil and groundwater beneath the pile.

Of the clean-up options detailed in its application, the city prefers a plan that removes the pile and basement foundation, then samples the soil and groundwater to find out whether further work is needed to mitigate toxins.

The city estimated the cost of removing the debris and further testing of the site at more than $3.9 million.

Marysville officials have also worked with the late U.S. Rep. Doug LaMalfa’s office on a $3.5 million federal grant, subject to congressional approval, to pay for the project if the EPA denies the city’s application, Schaad said.

What happens next?

City officials, per requirements of the federal grant they seek, have tried pulling the public into the decision-making process behind what to do with the city-owned lot once cleared.

The city has plans for housing and commercial space at the property to revitalize the hard-hit downtown area burdened first by the abandoned hotel then the pile of debris.

“The site’s position along the Highway 70 gateway amplifies its visual and psychological impact, reinforcing perceptions of decline and deterring business activity in the city’s historic core,” the city wrote in its application.

Representatives from Habitat for Humanity, Yuba Water Agency and Adventist Health have talked with city officials about the property’s future, according to the grant application.

No one from the public spoke before city council members at the meeting Tuesday. Chapdelaine said that the city would include additional public comments received before submitting the application next week.",https://www.sacbee.com/public/latest-news/mti7ba/picture296940114/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/3946_HA_241211_HotelMarysville.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 12:57:55.361037

“Congress picked foreign refiners over American farmers and drivers today. What a travesty,” said Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor. “E15 delivers cost savings for consumers and generates long-term demand for American agriculture. These have been the facts during the twelve-year-long debate over the simple act of allowing consumers the choice to buy a better value fuel year-round. Failure to act will now lead to farmers missing out on a critical market during the worst farm crisis in 40 years. Consumers will also miss out on access to more affordable fuel choices. Instead of supporting farmers and affordability, Congress appears to have prioritized the demands of a few well-capitalized foreign refiners that plead poverty with lawmakers while boasting financial success with investors.

As in other multinational industries, plant offshoring is a means of chasing higher profit margins. These batteries aren't only powering EVs, but also serving as energy stores supporting alternative energy infrastructure.

The international effort didn't come without cause. The Chinese government hinted last year that it would end subsidies for the country's EV industry, which is now considered mature enough to support itself financially. It's a viewpoint that feels very conservative, considering that over 80% of the world's battery cells are produced in China. Wired looked into the global spread of Chinese battery production and noted a 29% profit margin on overseas-built batteries, compared with 23% for domestically produced batteries. Armand Meyer, a senior research analyst at Rhodium Group, said:

""They are ready to leave the domestic market, and they are as competitive as traditional Western players, or even more competitive. We think it's just the beginning.""

The Rhodium Group found that BYD, CATL, Gotion High–Tech and Envision constructed at least 68 battery factories abroad. A $45 billion investment is nothing to scoff at. The upside for the companies is impossible to ignore, as logistical costs are significantly lowered by slashing shipping distances. On the opposite, tension over a CATL plant in Hungary shows that host countries may not be fully aware of the implications. The factory in question laid off over 100 local employees and is being scrutinized for its environmental footprint.

Those profit margins are only set to grow in the coming years as trade barriers are removed. The European Union is currently negotiating with China to completely eliminate tariffs that can be as high as 35%. The policy shift comes as the European auto industry successfully lobbied the EU to drop the bloc-wide ban on new ICE car sales, essentially yielding the continent's EV market to Chinese automakers.

The newly adopted 2025 State Energy Plan outlines a statewide strategy focused on delivering abundant, reliable, affordable, and clean energy while supporting economic development and equity. These goals align with the vision behind Broome Tech Park: a development‑ready site designed to attract forward‑thinking companies and strengthen the region’s economic competitiveness.

Delivering Abundant, Reliable, and Clean Energy

The State Energy Plan emphasizes the need for an energy system that is resilient, reliable, and clean. Broome Tech Park’s infrastructure and location make it well‑suited for companies that prioritize sustainability and energy efficiency, offering a foundation that aligns with New York’s long‑term clean energy goals.

New York maintains one of the most reliable electric grids in the nation, with the average customer experiencing fewer than one outage per year. This reliability is supported by strong planning, diverse energy resources, and major infrastructure investments such as the Champlain Hudson Power Express transmission line.

The State also prioritizes cross‑sector energy security and emergency preparedness, recognizing that electricity, natural gas, and petroleum systems are critical infrastructure. A diverse fuel mix helps protect New Yorkers from supply disruptions and price shocks — a stability that can benefit businesses considering Broome Tech Park as a future location.

Supporting Innovation and Economic Growth

Innovation is a central theme of the 2025 Energy Plan, and Broome Tech Park is positioned to support companies working in next‑generation manufacturing, clean‑tech development, and other emerging industries. The Plan calls for advancing new technologies, strengthening the grid, and fostering economic competitiveness — all areas where the Park could serve as a strategic location for future investment.

New York’s energy system is broad and dynamic: as of 2023, the electric power and transportation sectors each consumed about one‑third of the state’s primary energy, while residential and commercial buildings together accounted for 57% of total energy use when electricity is included. This diverse demand profile underscores the need for innovation across multiple sectors, creating opportunities for companies that may choose to locate at Broome Tech Park.

Fueling Job Growth and Workforce Opportunity

New York’s transition to cleaner energy is projected to add more than 80,000 net jobs between 2025 and 2040 — a 17% increase across the electricity, buildings, transportation, and fuels sectors.

The electricity and buildings sectors are expected to see the strongest growth, driven by investments in clean generation and building decarbonization. Construction is projected to add 58,000 jobs, while manufacturing grows by 25%. Even in sectors with declining demand, such as fuels and traditional transportation, the State plans to support workers through retraining and pathways into high‑quality clean energy jobs.

This statewide job growth complements Broome Tech Park’s potential to attract employers who contribute to long‑term regional workforce development.

Promoting Affordability and Equity

A major focus of the State Energy Plan is ensuring that energy remains affordable and equitable for all New Yorkers. Broome Tech Park could support this mission by offering development opportunities that can expand the local tax base and strengthen the economic health of Broome County.

The Energy Affordability Analysis shows that efficient equipment and electrification can reduce household energy spending by $100–$300 per month by 2031. New Yorkers already spend $700 less per year on energy than the national average, and the State has the second‑lowest per‑capita energy expenditures in the country. These savings are driven by proactive policies that promote efficiency, clean energy, and lower‑cost technologies.

Affordability challenges persist — especially for low‑ and moderate‑income households — making local economic development and energy‑efficient infrastructure increasingly important.

Advancing a Clean Energy Economy

New York’s long‑term outlook through 2040 includes aggressive decarbonization targets and a commitment to transitioning toward a clean energy economy. Broome Tech Park is well‑positioned to attract companies that may be part of this shift, including renewable energy suppliers, green manufacturers, and sustainable logistics operations.

Nearly half of New York’s in‑state electricity generation already comes from zero‑emission sources, including renewables and nuclear. Looking ahead, in‑state renewable generation could increase by nearly 90% between 2025 and 2035. Major projects — including South Fork Wind, Empire Wind 1, Sunrise Wind, and the Champlain Hudson Power Express — are reshaping the State’s clean energy landscape.

By 2040, a significant share of vehicles and homes could transition to efficient or electrified technologies, creating new markets and supply chains that companies at Broome Tech Park may be able to serve.

Prepared for a Changing Energy Landscape

The 2025 Energy Plan acknowledges that the energy sector faces significant uncertainty — from evolving technologies to shifting market demands. Broome Tech Park offers the flexibility and readiness needed for companies navigating this landscape. With shovel‑ready sites, adaptable planning, and access to regional partners, the Park provides a strong foundation for businesses considering long‑term investment in a rapidly changing energy environment.

New York’s diverse fuel mix — still roughly 75% fossil fuels today — and the fact that 63% of primary energy is lost during conversion highlight the scale of the transition ahead. Reducing these losses through electrification, efficiency, and innovation will require new technologies, new businesses, and new infrastructure. Broome Tech Park is positioned to support companies working on these solutions.

,Louisiana American Energy ,2026-01-22 17:14:12+00:00,Los Angeles Times,Natural gas prices soar as Arctic cold grips the U.S. - Los Angeles Times,"Sing Yee Ong, Elena Mazneva, Julian Hast",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2026-01-22/natural-gas-prices-soar-as-arctic-cold-grips-u-s,"“We would have to go back to 2022, then 2018, to see this kind of volatility” in U.S. gas futures, said Dennis Kissler, senior vice president for trading at BOK Financial Securities Inc.
Soaring gas prices are bad news for U.S. consumers grappling with rising energy bills, which have become a liability for politicians, including President Trump.
U.S. gas inventories probably fell 98 billion cubic feet last week to 3.087 trillion cubic feet, based on median analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Polar cold has also lifted gas prices in Asia and Europe this week.
While European gas prices slipped, the continent is getting ready for another deep freeze in the next few days.","Natural gas futures surged about 75% in three days, rocketing to the highest price since 2022, as frigid weather sweeps across major markets for the heating fuel and forces traders to cover bearish positions.

More than 175 million people across the country will face snow, rain, sleet and ice through the weekend as record-breaking cold across the central and eastern regions fuels the season’s largest winter storm. Low temperatures could freeze water inside pipelines, disrupting gas production and exports. Consumption is expected to rise as households crank up their heaters, potentially draining inventories.

“This is a textbook winter-driven squeeze: fast, violent, and sentiment-shifting,” Ole Hvalbye, an analyst at SEB AB, wrote in a note to clients.

The shift in US weather forecasts came days after hedge funds turned more bearish on gas at the end of last week, leaving the market poised for a rally as traders rushed to close out those wagers. On Thursday, overnight weather models turned even colder in the central and southern US for Jan. 27 through Jan. 31, according to commercial forecaster Atmospheric G2.

“We would have to go back to 2022, then 2018, to see this kind of volatility” in U.S. gas futures, said Dennis Kissler, senior vice president for trading at BOK Financial Securities Inc.

Soaring gas prices are bad news for U.S. consumers grappling with rising energy bills, which have become a liability for politicians, including President Trump. But they stand to benefit US gas producers, especially those that have not locked in prices for a large share of their planned output through financial hedges.

“A major correction is due, but it will likely take a change in the weather forecast to trip it,” Kissler said.

Contracts for nearer-term delivery also soared. Cash prices for the Henry Hub trading point in Louisiana — the benchmark for US futures — for the balance of January surged to nearly $13 per million British thermal units Thursday morning from around $7 on Tuesday and under $4 at the end of last week, according to traders. Cash prices in the pipeline-constrained Northeast, meanwhile, were trading around $30 per mmbtu, traders said.

U.S. gas inventories probably fell 98 billion cubic feet last week to 3.087 trillion cubic feet, based on median analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That’s bearish relative to the five-year-average withdrawal of 191 bcf.

A drawdown in line with forecasts would put stockpiles above the five-year average, providing a cushion of inventories as demand climbs.

Still, analysts at BloombergNEF expect that the bearish storage report, scheduled to be released by the US Energy Information Administration at 10:30, will be followed next week by the second-largest withdrawal ever as this weekend’s frigid weather triggers higher demand.

Polar cold has also lifted gas prices in Asia and Europe this week. While European gas prices slipped, the continent is getting ready for another deep freeze in the next few days. It relies on the US for liquefied natural gas imports ever since it lost most Russian supplies during the 2022 energy crisis. The US is the world’s biggest exporter of LNG, and supplies to export terminals now account for about 17% of the nation’s gas production.

Asia’s gas benchmark also jumped this week to the highest level since late-November, according to traders, as temperatures in the region dropped, lifting demand. While Asia has ample inventories — unlike Europe — a prolonged cold snap could raise global competition for the fuel.

The rallies this week across global gas markets come after a period of relative calm, as new LNG projects slated to start up in 2026 and later this decade raised expectations of a looming glut that could dampen gas prices for years to come. SEB’s Hvalbye said the immediate trigger has been the weather, rather than any structural shock or change in long-term fundamentals.

Still, he said the price reactions underline a shift that has taken place in the gas market, particularly in Europe.

“Gas has become a far more global and flexible commodity, where traditional European seasonal logic matters less than before,” Hvalbye said. “That also means that when weather or global flows shift, price reactions can be faster and sharper, exactly what we are now seeing play out.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a11398b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+142/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F66%2F0e%2F01c1b2e950dc9c75d85d23129984%2F1x-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 12:58:15.127682

“Energy has always shaped Louisiana’s economy, and under President Trump’s leadership, it is once again driving America’s future,” Governor Jeff Landry said. “With record investment and the creation of high-wage jobs, energy is at the center of Louisiana’s economic momentum. This Whole-of-Louisiana Energy Strategy brings clarity and coordination to the assets that make our state exceptional, while reinforcing our shared commitment with the President to American global energy dominance and long-term opportunity for our citizens.”

The strategy builds on the unprecedented economic growth under the leadership of Governor Landry and focuses on eight statewide priorities intended to accelerate investment and innovation, position communities for long-term growth, and unleash Louisiana’s full energy potential:

Expand Louisiana’s industrial base and drill, baby, drill

Win global investments to grow local communities

Accelerate market-driven infrastructure development

Deliver strategic energy solutions

Align state services with the speed of business

Strengthen community confidence in major investments

Unleash energy innovation

Establish Louisiana as the nation’s industrial power leader

Statewide priorities are supported by Regional Opportunity Frameworks that identify how region-specific infrastructure, workforce, natural resources, and institutions align with market demand and long-term growth trends. The frameworks are designed to help prospective investors, regional partners, and local stakeholders understand how to streamline pathways for energy, industrial, and innovation-driven growth opportunities.

“Our strongest year of economic development results confirmed what happens when vision is matched with disciplined execution,” said LED Secretary Susan Bourgeois. “This strategy builds directly on that momentum by aligning regional strengths within a clear, statewide framework for energy investment, innovation, and high-wage job creation. Through a Whole-of-Louisiana approach, LED and our partners are positioning the state to lead globally while delivering real opportunity for Louisiana workers and communities.”

The Whole-of-Louisiana Energy Strategy builds on ongoing efforts to streamline and align state government around shared priorities. LED’s 2025 Strategic Plan and 9×90 Workplan, alongside the Department of Conservation and Energy’s (C&E) new organizational model and strategic framework, provide a clear foundation for coordinated action. These efforts are strengthened by an interagency agreement between LED and C&E on state energy development and planning, and accelerated by Governor Landry’s Louisiana Lightning Speed Executive Order, which formalizes a whole-of-government approach to move projects forward with greater speed, certainty, and coordination.

“This strategy allows LED and other state partners seeking to build the state’s energy economy to provide clear guidance on permitting processes and greater predictability for companies investing here,” Department of Conservation and Energy Secretary Dustin Davidson said. “By safeguarding the resources and communities that make growth possible, we are strengthening Louisiana’s energy leadership and future while protecting our shared environment.”

The strategy reflects a coordinated effort to ensure Louisiana capitalizes on its momentum, assets, and proven execution capability to remain a location of choice for energy production, investment, and innovation, reducing foreign energy dependence and advancing U.S. energy dominance across the world.

Because of growth in data centers, manufacturing, and electrification, electricity demand has surged, but PJM hasn't built enough generation to keep pace.
Can Clean Energy Help Reduce Costs?
Despite high-profile attacks on renewables, clean energy buildout is actually central to future energy affordability in New Jersey.
By increasing the share of clean energy on the grid, New Jersey can ultimately reduce the dominant influence of natural gas on wholesale electricity prices and ensure greater price stability moving forward.","High utility bills would be bad enough – but that’s on top of New Jersey’s comparatively high cost of living: the state has the country’s third-highest regional price parity rating, which measures the differences in price levels across states.

On the 2024 census, 28% of New Jerseyans said they’d been unable to pay at least one energy bill in full in the prior year, compared with 23% nationwide.

Across the Garden State, families are struggling to manage rising electricity costs and are badly in need of relief. Public opinion research shows little consensus on who to blame, what to do, or when to expect relief. To identify solutions that could make power more affordable, it’s important to understand how New Jersey keeps the lights on.

Power Sources: What Technologies Keep the Lights on in New Jersey?

New Jersey, like many states, participates in a regional grid and competitive wholesale power market managed by the PJM Interconnection (PJM). That system allows communities to share power resources and reduce the overall cost of new infrastructure. But being part of a competitive wholesale market means New Jersey’s power prices are affected by decisions made not just in New Jersey but also in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and 10 other Mid-Atlantic states. Policies and investments across PJM set the electricity mix New Jersey has access to, and, by extension, contribute to the wholesale cost of power, which shapes the retail rate consumers pay.

Natural gas accounts for the majority of electricity production in the region, and its share has increased substantially in recent years. Gas now accounts for roughly half of all electricity generation, with coal and nuclear power supplying the next-largest shares, respectively. Solar and wind have increased steadily, but still make up less than 5% of the electricity mix.

Why Are Prices Rising?

PJM Capacity Market: PJM runs a forward capacity market to ensure sufficient future supply to meet peak demand, essentially paying power plants to commit to being available in the future. Because of growth in data centers, manufacturing, and electrification, electricity demand has surged, but PJM hasn't built enough generation to keep pace. Recent capacity auctions have cleared at historically high prices as the market attempts to attract more generators. These higher costs are passed to customers through state-approved retail rates.

Slow Interconnection Process: PJM's inability to meet rising demand stems from its slow, cumbersome interconnection process, which has experienced significant delays, resulting in a large backlog of projects awaiting grid connection. These delays limit the entry of new resources that could help reduce prices and have contributed to tighter capacity conditions. It’s not that developers don’t want to build – PJM has over 200,ooo MW of new generation in queue, about the same as their total installed capacity – it’s that projects cannot connect to the grid and, by extension, consumers cannot get access to new power sources.

Natural Gas Demand: Natural gas generation has an outsized influence on wholesale power prices in New Jersey because it accounts for a significant share of PJM generation. As a result, when natural gas prices rise–whether because of supply constraints, pipeline and storage infrastructure capacity limitations, cold weather-related demand for heating, or global market conditions–wholesale electricity prices increase significantly. These prices are then passed on to retail customers.

Can Clean Energy Help Reduce Costs?

Despite high-profile attacks on renewables, clean energy buildout is actually central to future energy affordability in New Jersey. Expanding in-state renewable generation adds new capacity to the state’s grid without the fuel price volatility associated with natural gas.

By increasing the share of clean energy on the grid, New Jersey can ultimately reduce the dominant influence of natural gas on wholesale electricity prices and ensure greater price stability moving forward.

Accelerating clean energy deployment and interconnection can also ease pressure in PJM’s capacity market by increasing future supply, helping to lower the high capacity auction prices currently being passed on to ratepayers.

When paired with grid modernization and battery storage, clean energy can also help New Jersey flexibly manage real-time growing demand from large data centers more affordably. Energy efficiency, demand response, and distributed clean resources reduce peak demand – the times during the day when electricity use is at its highest. Because we need the lights to stay on at all times of the day, these short peak periods become a key driver of capacity costs. Clean energy solutions can lower or shift demand during these peaks, avoiding costly new infrastructure and keeping electricity bills lower for families and businesses in the state.

The cost benefits could be significant: a 2025 Synapse Energy Economics study found that faster clean energy deployment and grid improvements could save New Jersey households around $467 a year on electricity bills and, when combined with commercial customer savings, total $14.3 billion statewide.

At the federal level, the Trump administration has slowed or reversed investments in low-cost clean energy and related infrastructure, both in New Jersey and nationwide. The administration has taken direct actions to delay or undermine clean energy projects currently under construction, including issuing a stop-work order for the Empire Wind offshore wind project and withdrawing a $716 million federal loan guarantee for transmission upgrades needed to support new generation in the state.

Analysis from Energy Innovation shows that President Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" would significantly increase the state's reliance on natural gas, driving wholesale electricity prices in New Jersey up by 35 percent by 2035 and increasing annual household energy bills by $220. At the same time, these decisions constrain new clean energy supply, worsen capacity shortages, and push the state deeper into volatile fossil fuel markets, all of which make electricity more expensive for New Jersey families and businesses.","https://uploads.thirdway.org/cdn-cgi/image/format=baseline-jpeg,quality=90,width=1200,height=630,fit=cover,gravity=auto/https://uploads.thirdway.org/products/NJ-RECORD-HG_2026-01-21-202329_uplc.jpg",N,,2026-01-22 14:39:43.779641

And there are dozens more of the giant computing warehouses on the way, according to Aterio, which tracks data center development.

Rural Texas is a popular spot for data centers because of relatively cheap, available land. The state also offers a friendly regulatory environment. Many people who live nearby are concerned about the centers’ effects on energy costs and water availability.

Nicol Turner Lee, director of the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution, spoke to the Texas Standard about how communities can prepare for potential impacts from data centers. Listen to the interview above or read the transcript below.

This transcript has been edited lightly for clarity:

Texas Standard: You recently co-authored a big report taking a look at data centers and their path forward in the United States. These facilities are being built at a pretty blistering pace. Is there any slowing them down?

Nicol Turner Lee: I don’t think so. I think that the cat is out the bag and we’re gonna continue to see more and more data centers just arise around the country.

I think Texas is probably the next big state that is gonna have data center density and a lot of that has to do with the fact that artificial intelligence and the driving demand for things like generative AI or using AI for healthcare or science discovery is just going to continue to grow.

Well, I mentioned concerns over electricity use. I’ve heard that defended in a way as when there’s a major need for electricity, such as an event where the power grid is at risk of failure, they’ll supply it back.

Have we seen that actually play out or are they just consuming at this point?

I think at this point, we’re seeing a lot more consumption. I think that there has been somewhat of both a community shock as well as sticker shock, right?

When it comes to the energy conversation, for the most part, many of the communities that are adjacent to data centers are finding that their electricity costs may go up a bit. And that has a lot to do with the fact that the data center itself is sort of putting more strain on the existing electrical grid.

We’re beginning to see some of the technology companies and the AI developers respond to this community resistance by having more conversations with electricity providers or energy providers, seeking out other sources of energy, like nuclear or renewable.

But definitely, energy is a critical component of data centers. Energy and water, if you don’t know that already, you’re going to learn that in this show.

» GET MORE NEWS FROM AROUND THE STATE: Sign up for Texas Standard’s weekly newsletters

When it comes to water, sometimes that gets people’s attention even more because Texas is so prone to drought. What do we need to know about the water consumption?

Yeah, water consumption is a huge need because it provides the appropriate cooling.

These data centers essentially run 24-7. A typical data center, just imagine this, uses about 300,000 gallons of water each day. That’s about equivalent to 1,000 households. This data comes from my colleague at Brookings, Joe Kane.

And large data centers can do an estimated five millions gallons of water each day, so we’re not talking about small-scale watering to your point.

Where there are communities where they’re more prone to drought, or there’s water sources that are being used for the data centers that are also consumed as drinking water, concerns do arise in communities.

And that is an area which we need much more conversation on. How are we going to use water more efficiently and effectively? How can AI even be used as a way to monitor and bring oversight for communities in terms of daily water consumption, and are there alternative sources of cooling – which is essentially what this is being used for – that we can actually explore.

Well, you brought up great questions there. And I wonder how might states or federal governments… Do they have regulatory options to help rein in some of those impacts?

You know, it’s so interesting. I think under the current administration, the reason why data centers are a big deal is because companies have been basically given permission to build them and to build them quickly.

In some instances, it is non-negotiable. There will be a data center somewhere in somebody’s community simply because the compute is the essential ingredient to make all of these applications work more efficiently.

With regards to state and local leaders, it’s essential that they begin to think about their role in these negotiations. And in particular, I’m of the opinion that state and global leaders should be devising what I consider to be community benefit agreements. And those community benefit agreements would include air and water quality reports before the data center comes in and throughout the life of the data center. They would be considering the amount of jobs that are created, the revenue that’s coming into the community.

And many state and local leaders right now are essentially giving so many tax incentives and abatements, but these revenues that they’re actually going to be getting aren’t gonna be available to them until the data center is actually open.

And so again, I think state and local leaders along with community residents need to have a plan in place as to how they’re going to identify and mitigate some of these real concerns before a shovel goes into the ground for a data center, because it may be too late afterwards.

Let me ask you about one thing our state agriculture commissioner here in Texas has put forth: This idea of creating tax incentives for data centers built on land communities identify as unfit for most other purposes.

How does that idea strike you, as a way to protect farmland and other valuable property?

You know, I think that’s actually a really great idea. I mean, some of the concerns that some communities across the country are having are whether or not, you know, if there were to be an AI bubble, that there would be idle data centers or deserted assets that taxpayers are contributing to that may never amount to a community center or a new fire station in a rural community, just simply because the building was not retrofitted for that purpose.

The idea that these should be built in areas that are unfit for any type of development, I think is spot on. I mean, we’re not necessarily thinking of data centers when it comes to rural communities as an agricultural outlet. If anything, it’s just gonna power our ability to have farmers be much more high tech in the work that they do, or it’s going to enable storage of really good scientific data that will help us to continue to re-engineer at the pace at which we do agriculture more broadly.

So I do think that is a great proposal and it’s one that should be considered. I always mention to people, you know, where we have seen a plethora of logistical manufacturing outlet – pretty much in industrial corridors and other areas – that’s a great place for a potential data center. It does not get too close to someone’s backyard, hypothetically, right? But it also allows for the entirety of the land’s use to be fruitful and viable for community.",https://www.texasstandard.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20250530_AIDataCenter-33-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 12:39:25.589030

Mikie Sherrill was sworn into office Tuesday, she signed two executive orders declaring a state of emergency to “freeze” utility costs and rapidly ramp up power generation.

The goal is to combat soaring electricity prices in the Garden State, which spiked as much as 20% for some residents over the summer, and quickly emerged as a potent issue in the 2025 campaign.

The Democrat’s first executive order authorizes the state Board of Public Utilities to take actions to stop increases, largely by tapping into state funds to give New Jerseyans credits for electricity increases. Former Gov. Phil Murphy, another Democrat, took similar action last year.

The other component of that order is calling on the BPU to pause or modify proceedings when utility companies pursue price increases.

“It’s probably the most disastrous energy policy I’ve seen a politician suggest in my lifetime,” Alex Stevens, manager of Policy and Communications Institute for Energy Research, a right-leaning group initially backed by billionaire Charles Koch, told The Post.

“Prices are the sharpest signal that markets send, and it’s really the only way that so many people engaging in an economy can coordinate supply and demand,” he continued. “If you impose price controls or ceilings, you basically blind everybody from the information about where supply needs to increase.”

Brendan Pierpont, director of electricity modeling at Energy Innovation, differs with Stevens on the potential repercussions of the freeze on utility costs and contends that the notion that it will lead to shortages of electricity is “sort of a misunderstanding.”

“Electricity doesn’t function the way in a lot of other markets function because the prices are determined through a regulatory apparatus; they’re determined through these complex market mechanisms like those that the PJM market operates,” he told The Post.

The second executive order declares a state of emergency, orders state agencies to make reforms to streamline approvals of new energy products, sets up a “Nuclear Power Task Force” to explore those options, and accelerates solar and battery storage generation projects.

Sherrill is aiming to roll back red tape, expedite the permitting process and combat any collusion between energy firms.

Stevens acknowledged the potential benefits of Sherrill’s push to quickly expand electric generation in the Garden State, though he disagrees with her focus on clean energy.

The newly sworn-in governor has declared that she is willing to fight her own party if necessary to bring down electricity prices for New Jerseyans by ramping up power generation.

“There’s households that are really under affordability pressure right now across a number of different fronts,” Pierpont. “One of the places where state policy can control things is in regulated electricity and natural gas rates.”

One of his gripes is with PJM, the power grid operator that services New Jersey and 12 other states.

Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst at the New Jersey Policy Perspective think tank, argues the problem is the backlog PJM has with its interconnection queue, which has hampered new green energy projects. In July, for instance, PJM claimed to have 63,000 MW of projects in its transition queue.

“The lack of supply is because PJM is really delaying the building of new energy sources,” she argued.

“Their interconnection queue, which is the line that developers wait in to build energy, has projects that have been waiting for five years just to get approved, even before they start building and get to plug into the grid. And uncertainty is a project-killer.”

Data suggest that old power plants on the PJM grid system that covers New Jersey are being retired at a similar rate as new plants coming online. New Jersey shut down its last coal plant in 2022.

While residential electricity costs in New Jersey shot up over 33% between June 2023 and June 2025, PJM’s capacity prices rocketed over 800% in 2024, Sherrill’s executive order noted.

New Jersey isn’t alone in this phenomenon. Electricity prices have been on the rise nationwide, soaring by roughly 5.5% last year, which outpaced the rate of inflation, thanks in part to the boom of artificial intelligence.

But experts believe the issue is particularly acute in NJ because in-state power consumption lags behind creation, leaving the Garden State at the mercy of its neighbors.

New Jersey has the 12th-highest residential electricity costs in the country, according to the latest available statistics.

“They don’t have enough generation in the state of New Jersey to meet their existing needs, so they’re having to import it from Pennsylvania and from other states that are producing more than they need,” explained Jason Isaac, founder of the American Energy Institute, which represents clients in the fossil fuel industry.

The Times Picayune | Baton Rouge Advocate’s Emily Woodruff sat through Health Secretary Bruce Greenstein’s “shareholder’s meeting.”:

It included some elements of federal health policy, which has shifted under U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. toward wellness and nutrition under the banner of Make America Healthy Again, or MAHA. … Greenstein said the department’s major goals include improving health outcomes, tightening oversight of public spending and modernizing how LDH operates, from aging data systems to how programs work across agency lines.

Louisiana’s new surgeon general gave her first public comments:

Dr. Evelyn Griffin outlined an agenda looking at “root causes” of health issues, and a push for stronger data systems to identify gaps in care. “We need to return the focus back to foundational elements of health, such as nutrition with whole foods, daily movement, quality, sleep and stress management,” Griffin said, adding that they should be integrated with conventional medicine and evidence-based practices.

Data center backlash

The rapid expansion of data centers is causing heartburn for communities across the country. Omari Ho-Sang, founder of All Streets, All People, in a letter to the Times-Picayune | Baton Rouge Advocate, explains her opposition to a proposed data center in Shreveport:

The questions raised about water use, electrical strain, tax incentives, environmental risk and long-term accountability were never fully answered. … Fence-line communities in the southern part of the state were promised jobs and progress. What followed was pollution, illness and abandonment. Those communities now serve as warnings — not models. North Louisiana should not repeat that history.

Opposition to data centers in Georgia has spurred bipartisan bills aimed at reigning in these facilities. Stateline’s Alander Rocha explains the serious fiscal consequences data centers pose for state budgets:

A December audit by the Carl Vinson Institute of Government at the University of Georgia examined the state’s sales and use tax exemption for data centers and concluded that the policy has cost the state at least $1.5 billion in lost revenue since its inception, including nearly $500 million in fiscal year 2025 alone. The audit found that about 70% of data center investment in Georgia would likely have occurred regardless of the tax break because of the state’s existing fiber infrastructure, low risk of natural disasters and utility reliability.

President Donald Trump and a group of northeast governors are working to shield utility customers from increased electricity costs caused by data centers.

States scramble to deploy rural health funds

The Trump administration announced last month how much each state would get from a $50 billion fund to address rural health issues, which was included in the federal budget and tax megabill. KFF’s team explains the tight timeline states must meet in order to secure future funding:

Now, the clock is ticking. Within eight months, states must submit revised budgets, begin spending, and show the money is going to good use. Federal officials will begin reviewing state progress in late summer and announce 2027 funding levels by the end of October.

While states must show they will use 2026 rural health dollars effectively, those funds have not yet been distributed:

CMS followed standard grant procedures and is requiring each state to submit revised budgets before they can draw down money, Krepich said. States have until Jan. 30 to resubmit their budgets, and CMS then has 30 days to respond, according to the standard Notice of Award. Under that timing, some states may not have cash in hand until March.

Louisiana will receive $208 million in 2026 from the Rural Health Transformation Program.

Farmers face skyrocketing health insurance costs

Agricultural workers rely on individual marketplace coverage at much higher rates (27%) than the total U.S. population (6%). More than 90% of people with this type of insurance receive coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Sarah Boden and Drew Hawkins of Gulf States Newsroom explain how the expiration of federal subsidies that kept ACA marketplace coverage affordable is impacting farmers:

James Davis, 55, who grows cotton, soybeans, and corn in northern Louisiana, said he didn’t know how he and his wife would afford coverage. Their share of their insurance premium quadrupled for 2026, jumping to about $2,700 a month. “You can’t afford it,” Davis said. “Bottom line. There’s nothing to discuss. You can’t afford it without the subsidies.”

Access to affordable health insurance is crucial for farmers:

A study from the University of Nebraska Medical Center found that the average cost of a farming injury was $10,878 in medical care and $4,735 in lost work. … In a 2022 study, [Pennsylvania State University professor Florence] Becot found that more than 20% of U.S. farm households had medical debt exceeding $1,000 and that more than half were not confident they could cover the costs of a major illness or injury.

Businesses are ready to invest, but they need a stable environment in which they feel secure enough to do so.

Investment zones and freeports were designed to help build that environment. Backed by successive administrations, they focus on revitalising regions affected by industrial decline and creating the conditions and incentives sought by businesses to invest with confidence.

But delivering value to both investors and the location requires closing the gap between business ambitions and the reality on the ground.

Location risks

One of the biggest challenges presented by investment zones and freeports is that many have been selected for their regeneration potential, rather than how well they meet modern business demands. This mismatch can become a serious hindrance when speed to market is critical.

Modern manufacturing and tech projects consume significant amounts of energy. They also require strong digital infrastructure and land that is ready to build on, not sites shaped around the needs of past industries. Grid constraints, patchy transport connectivity and a lack of suitable premises can create investment barriers.

Freeports, for example, offer attractive incentives such as tax savings on plant and machinery, lower land costs and reduced employment taxes. Yet derelict land can require heavy remediation, while grid connection delays can add months, or even years, to project timelines. For advanced manufacturing, clean energy and data-heavy sectors, these restrictions can cap a project’s scale from day one.

Businesses considering a zone should assess grid access, digital capability and the availability of suitable premises early in the process, before key design and investment decisions are locked in.

Gaps in expectations

Early-stage discussions around incentives often present the most friction when investing in zones. Regional authorities and zone operators typically ask for detailed cost projections, delivery timelines and job creation estimates. These demands are reasonable, but difficult to answer before a specific site has been fully assessed.

Energy requirements, subcontractor costs and labour availability can differ significantly between locations. Without clarity on these fundamentals, foreign investors could be providing forecasts that are little more than provisional assumptions.

Timelines are also vulnerable to factors beyond the investor’s control. As recently as 2025, a client experienced significant delays in its environmental planning process, attributed to a backlog of applications that had accumulated during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Some zone operators require businesses to engage with local subcontractors within proximity to the site. However, this is not always possible for large and complex investments and may conflict with businesses standard procurement processes.

EU investors are often well-versed in complex, multi-tiered incentive regimes and have teams dedicated to navigating them. While this can give these new entrants an edge when competing in the UK, they can underestimate the administrative burden of liaising with local authorities, combined authorities, investment zones and freeports.

Making the model succeed

There are good examples of what zones can achieve when they have a clear sense of purpose. South Yorkshire Investment Zone, for example, has built its strategy around advanced manufacturing, supported by ecosystems like the Advanced Manufacturing Innovation District.

In the West Midlands Investment Zone, business activity is shifting towards the automotive sector’s transition, making it a natural fit for clean mobility firms, while zones in Flintshire and Wrexham (in north Wales) and south-west Wales are making progress in boosting advanced manufacturing innovation and local industry.

Yet the overall feeling is that investment zones and freeports are falling short of expectations in securing investments and jobs. Some argue these challenges are simply teething problems that will ease over time. However, zones will only develop if investors want to locate their operations in these areas in the first place, and they can’t afford to wait years for supporting infrastructure to mature.

Investors can minimise risks by taking several key steps. First, early testing of infrastructure helps identify potential issues with facilities and services. Second, engaging with local partners and clearly communicating their operational needs before committing to a site.

Projects that succeed are those grounded in realism and which understand both the advantages and the limits of each zone. When expectations are clear on both sides, incentives can support long-term growth rather than short-term wins.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/9749d299-3ab0-4cba-a2e7-72fb65076dc0.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 13:39:50.582711

The measures drew opposition from Rhode Island Energy, and failed to advance out of either chamber.
Michael Dalo, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Energy, pledged to review McKee’s rate cut changes in full detail.","Gov. Dan McKee framed his proposed rollbacks of green energy incentives around affordability — saving Rhode Island ratepayers $1 billion in their energy bills over the next five years, according to analysis by the state budget office.

Tina Munter, Rhode Island policy advocate for Green Energy Consumers Alliance, offered a different summation of the governor’s fiscal 2027 budget proposal on energy bill charges.

“It’s mind-boggling,” Munter said in a recent interview. “Rhode Island’s reliance on natural gas for heating and electricity is what keeps the region in flux with energy prices. The longer we rely on natural gas, the longer we’re stuck in a cycle of seeing [energy] bills spike, seeing ratepayers be confused and shocked and surprised, versus having more stability.”

This logic persuaded lawmakers in 2022 to enact the most ambitious renewable electricity timeline of any state in the nation. The Renewable Energy Standard law, heralded by McKee at the time of its passage, required Rhode Island to gradually transition to entirely renewable energy sources for its electricity needs, reaching 100% by 2033.

Now, McKee wants to push the deadline to 2050, which is the same deadline for the state to achieve net-zero emissions overall under the separate Act on Climate law. The proposed 17-year postponement, with immediate relaxation of existing incremental benchmarks, accounts for more than half of the $1 billion projected savings to Rhode Island ratepayers, cutting nearly $64 million from bills in 2027, and $572 million over the next five years, according to the state Office of Management and Budget.

McKee’s environmental and energy administrators defended the rollback, which mirrors policies set by neighboring states and reflects the hostile energy environment under President Donald Trump.

“At a time when utility bills are already at historic highs and affordability is top concern for Rhode Islanders, President Trump’s actions are raising costs and undermining clean energy production,” Chris Kearns, acting state energy commissioner, said during a Jan. 15 briefing with reporters about McKee’s budget.

Changing winds in Washington have hit Rhode Island hard under the first year of Trump’s second term. Twice, the Trump administration has suspended work on its signature offshore wind project, Revolution Wind; the second federal suspension was lifted by court order on Jan. 12. Repeals of federal electric vehicle tax credits cut $900 million in incentives for Rhode Island motorists, while other key policies governing power emissions and vehicle efficiency standards have been rolled back.

A $49 million state grant under the Biden administration to help low and moderate-income homeowners and renters afford solar panels remains frozen, tied up in litigation. A separate $30 million federal award for home energy efficiency rebates, announced in 2024, is still awaiting final approval from federal regulators to launch, Kearns said.

The cost of going green

Even before the state’s climate change plan was cast into doubt by a Trump presidency, its ambitious “greening” of the local electricity grid was growing pricier.

In 2023, the most recent year available, electricity suppliers, including Rhode Island Energy, spent nearly $60 million to meet the 23% renewable electricity requirement for the year, according to a November 2025 report submitted to state regulators. The cost includes purchasing credits from regional solar, wind and other clean energy projects, which can be substituted for new renewable energy production to meet the mandates. Five years prior, when electricity suppliers only had to meet a 13% clean electricity standard, total program spending was less than $8 million.

The spending is passed on to ratepayers, reflected on the “delivery details” portion of Rhode Island Energy’s monthly billing along with other state mandated fees and energy program costs.

State mandates, fees and policies drive about 25% of monthly energy bills. There are also usage costs, set by third-party suppliers with no room to renegotiate by state administrators nor the utility provider. A separate set of distribution charges is imposed by Rhode Island Energy to help pay for customer service, infrastructure and technology upgrades and emergency outage responses, among other investments. McKee’s appointed, three-member Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over the company’s distribution charges, but the governor himself does not.

Hence, why McKee’s energy affordability plan only touches on the portions of customers’ bills under his control. In addition to revising the renewable energy standard, McKee has proposed a suite of other changes. They include:

Limiting credits to customers who return renewable energy to the grid through direct or virtual projects (mostly solar) and adding a “grid access fee” for large-scale solar fields to cover the costs associated with development, connection and operations. This change would cut ratepayers’ costs by $35 million a year.

Capping utility spending (based on ratepayer charges) for energy efficiency rebates and incentives to home and business owners at $75 million a year. There is no cap currently. This would save an estimated $21 million for ratepayers each year.

Revitalizing a longstanding practice, ended by state utility regulators in 2024, that lets Rhode Island Energy spread out the cost for road repaving over a longer period rather than accounting for the expense in its annual operating budget. This would save $16 million in ratepayer charges each year initially, although it compounds repayment over a longer time period.

Axing a state performance incentive to Rhode Island Energy meant to encourage long-term renewable energy contracts, saving ratepayers $2.5 million a year.

The collective changes, most of which would take effect in January 2027 if approved by the Rhode Island General Assembly, would save the average residential customer $180 a year, or $15 a month, over the next five years, according to the state budget office.

A short-term fix?

Short-term savings come with long-term consequences, including higher costs, Munter warned.

For example, rolling back the state Renewable Energy Standard will prolong the state’s reliance on a limited, unreliable and expensive natural gas supply. Dethroning Rhode Island as a state leader in climate incentives also means sacrificing its edge in the renewable electricity credit marketplace. Electricity suppliers can purchase credits from renewable energy projects anywhere, and Rhode Island’s ambitious incentives for clean energy production draw buyers from other states, fueling the state economy with money and jobs.

And then there are the unquantifiable health and safety benefits from a shift away from fossil fuels.

“The savings won’t show up on your utility bill, but Rhode Islanders will see environmental and health consequences in their life if, for example, air quality worsens,” Munter said.

Especially with less money available to make the switch to clean energy in their own homes and workplaces under McKee’s proposed cap on state energy efficiency funding.

“It’s a serious concern of mine to cap energy efficiency, and to imply that cutting energy efficiency spending will benefit Rhode Islanders,” said Emily Koo, senior policy advocate and Rhode Island program director for the Acadia Center.

Rhode Island Energy’s $95 million energy efficiency budget for 2026 is already 18% less than the $117 million budget for 2025, and nearly one-third below the annual amount that Rhode Island Energy pledged to spend in a three-year plan submitted in 2023.

Limiting state funding also fails to recognize the long-term savings for ratepayers who winterize windows and doors, upgrade furnaces and thermostats or even switch to high-efficiency electric heat pumps, Koo said. And in her view, the drought of federal funding for energy efficiency investments makes preserving, and boosting, Rhode Island’s rebate program even more important.

Koo also serves as a member of the advisory board to the Rhode Island Executive Climate Change Coordinating Council, a consortium of state agencies charged with developing a plan to meet Rhode Island’s decarbonization mandates under the Act on Climate law. The council’s first comprehensive review of state progress and future projections, unveiled in November, warned the 2050 net-zero emissions mandate is out of reach without “additional ambition” to incentivize a clean energy transition. Its analysis assumed the existing incentives and funding McKee now wants to roll back.

“From my point of view, it would appear that elements of the governor’s budget are inconsistent with the Act on Climate,” said Sen. Sam Zurier, a Providence Democrat and chair of a legislative panel created in 2025 to monitor implementation of the Act on Climate law.

However, Zurier said he wanted to keep an open mind, awaiting more detail on McKee’s budget proposal when the five-member Senate panel meets on Wednesday, Jan. 28. Its agenda includes a presentation from Terry Gray, Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management director and head of the Executive Climate Change Coordinating Council.

Gray reiterated McKee’s rationale on the energy bill cuts.

“If customers aren’t comfortable with their electric bills, and they’re not comfortable with the stability in their electric bills, they’re not going to transition over to the appliances we need to meet our mandates,” Gray said in an interview directly after the Jan. 15 budget briefing with reporters.

Eye on 2050

Gray said the state’s 2050 decarbonization deadline was “still achievable,” while noting the need for more frequent tweaks to the state’s plan especially under Trump.

“There are so many things up in the air right now, it’s crazy,” Gray said. “In our climate planning over the next three years, we’re going to have to read and react.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO and co-chair of Climate Jobs Rhode Island, suggested it was premature to upend Rhode Island’s clean energy path.

“I think we should give ourselves one more year,” Crowley said. “Hopefully, things will change in Congress and we can get back on track. My concern is that we are going to drop our focus on what we need to do.”

Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, did not directly address these suggestions or critics when asked for comment.

“The Trump Administration has drastically changed the energy landscape, by taking steps to limit or eliminate available sources of clean energy—thereby driving up costs that are passed onto ratepayers and casting uncertainty on our ability to meet our aggressive climate goals,” DaRocha said in an emailed response Wednesday. “Meanwhile, rising energy costs are driving family budgets to the breaking point; Rhode Islanders need relief now, not later. We remain committed to an affordable energy strategy that still provides a pathway to decarbonization and leverages lower cost, zero-emission resources.”

The blame game

While McKee pointed the finger at Trump, local advocates and lawmakers focused their ire on Rhode Island Energy and its parent company, PPL Corp., contrasting the public company’s multimillion-dollar profits and C-suite executive salaries with ratepayers who struggle to keep the lights on.

A bevy of bills floated in the 2025 legislative session sought customer affordability by capping company profit margins, or creating competition in the form of a state-owned public utility. The measures drew opposition from Rhode Island Energy, and failed to advance out of either chamber.

Sen. Alana DiMario, a Narragansett Democrat, thinks the policy might be worth a fresh look, especially as Rhode Island Energy seeks to raise service charges on gas and electric customers. The company’s application, submitted to state utility regulators a day before Thanksgiving, proposes a two-year set of bill hikes starting in September 2026, adding more than $9 per month to the average residential customer’s electricity bill and more than $440 to annual, average gas bills.

In unveiling the proposed distribution rate hikes, Rhode Island Energy defended the need for $230 million operating revenue to cover inflationary costs and supply chain expenses. The company has been unable to seek a distribution rate increase to offset its service expenses since taking over the state’s gas and electric operations in 2022 as part of the sale agreement with state utility regulators. The moratorium ended in May 2025.

Regulators also required the company to refund customers for deferred income tax hikes associated with the 2022 acquisition. Rhode Island Energy, working with McKee, initially pitched a $149 million, two-year discount plan to honor its 2022 refund commitment, but withdrew the proposal in the fall amid scrutiny over the calculations. The company said previously it plans to file an alternative payout plan this year, but has not submitted anything as of Wednesday.

Michael Dalo, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Energy, pledged to review McKee’s rate cut changes in full detail.

“We remain committed to providing safe, reliable, and affordable energy for our customers, and will be actively engaged in the upcoming discussions to help shape solutions that benefit Rhode Islanders,” Dalo said in an emailed response on Jan. 15.

“China has put in place the world’s largest renewable energy system and the most complete new-energy industrial chain,” He said.
“China will pursue green development and share with the world the opportunities from green and low-carbon transition,” He said at Davos.
These and other steps position China to fill voids in energy transition leadership left by the U.S. and other Western countries.
“They are taking these measures that have real climate importance, even if the drivers of those measures aren’t always primarily climate change.”","As the United States retreats from climate policy, China signaled its rising intent to lead a transition away from fossil fuels and toward Chinese-made renewable energy technologies in remarks to world leaders on Tuesday.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng cast China as a beacon of stability as he touted the economic potential of wind, solar and battery power.

“China has put in place the world’s largest renewable energy system and the most complete new-energy industrial chain,” He said. “We invite entreprises from all over the world to embrace the opportunities from the green and low-carbon transition, and work closely with China.”

For China, which emits more greenhouse gases, burns more coal and imports more oil than any country in the world, this energy transition isn’t all about climate. A global shift to low-carbon power also poses substantial economic benefits to China, the world’s top manufacturer of batteries, solar panels and electric cars.

As energy appetites grow quickly across developing countries, China hopes to move them onto its new systems of solar, wind and battery power rather than fossil fuel technologies and markets still dominated by the U.S.

“They see oil and gas as far too dependent on foreign powers,” said Steven Lewis, C.V. Starr transnational China fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy in Houston. “They are building a fleet of electric vehicles and they’ve already made a big dent in their oil imports for that reason alone.”

China’s state-backed overseas investment program has also poured hundreds of billions of dollars into energy projects in developing countries around the world. Its investments in renewable energy sources overtook fossil fuels around 2023 for the first time since the program began in the early 2000s, according to reporting from Inside Climate News.

“China will pursue green development and share with the world the opportunities from green and low-carbon transition,” He said at Davos.

These sorts of economic forces are increasingly shaping the politics of the energy transition, rather than diplomatic discourse at international forums, said Li Shuo, China Climate Hub director at the Asia Society Policy Institute.

“It is becoming less about what governments say and more about which companies are putting EVs on the road and solar panels on rooftops,” he said. “On that front, China’s lead is not only intact, but widening.”

China, home to 1.4 billion people, accounted for about a third of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2024. Its emissions plateaued in 2025, suggesting a possible peak after decades of steep growth. Last September, at a U.N. summit on climate change, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced plans to begin reducing overall emissions by 2030.

These and other steps position China to fill voids in energy transition leadership left by the U.S. and other Western countries.

Last year, U.S. president Donald Trump told the U.N. general assembly, “If you don’t get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail.”

Trump has also withdrawn the U.S. from the 2015 Paris Accords and from the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, two global agreements to reduce carbon emissions.

China will work with all parties to “fully and effectively implement” those agreements, He said at Davos.

“They have the ability to use opportunities like the U.S. retreat in these sectors and these diplomatic arenas to their own advantage,” said Jackson Ewing, director of energy and climate policy at Duke University’s Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment & Sustainability. “They are taking these measures that have real climate importance, even if the drivers of those measures aren’t always primarily climate change.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Chinaspeech-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 14:40:39.496243

In the 'baby phase', the focus is on learning from pilot projects – testing out carbon capture in blue hydrogen, running green hydrogen electrolysers flexibly with renewables, exploring nuclear-powered electrolysers (pink hydrogen), and extracting white hydrogen from underground.

It erased uncertainty around the 45V tax credit but moved the start-of-construction deadline forward to end-2027, squeezing green hydrogen developers.
This compounds imbalances in the market: most proposed clean hydrogen suppliers have yet to find a buyer.","Last year, we expected the hydrogen industry to move beyond hype and into meaningful execution. While the initial excitement has certainly faded, 2025 turned out to be a challenging year for actual project implementation. Around 50 projects have been publicly cancelled, but the real number is higher as many cancellations happen silently. Unexpectedly, cancellations were not limited to paper-only projects. One developer, for example, actually dismantled two hydrogen plants – one in Australia and another in the United States – and returned millions of dollars in government grants, effectively turning the financial support into a liability.

So what will 2026 look like? Here are our top 3 calls.

The hydrogen industry’s journey mirrors the stages of childhood. In the 'baby phase', the focus is on learning from pilot projects – testing out carbon capture in blue hydrogen, running green hydrogen electrolysers flexibly with renewables, exploring nuclear-powered electrolysers (pink hydrogen), and extracting white hydrogen from underground. It’s also about building electrolysers that use fewer rare metals. The goal at this stage is to figure out what works technically.

Next comes the ‘toddler phase,’ where hydrogen must prove itself as a viable business, requiring solid financial returns for first commercial-scale plants, often with substantial financial support. However, the volume of low-carbon hydrogen produced remains small – insufficient to replace current usage of grey hydrogen.

With established technology and economics, hydrogen enters the ‘teenager phase,’ scaling up production and building infrastructure to reach more industries and regions. Only then can hydrogen start to substitute fossil fuels, potentially facing pushback from fossil fuel interests.

Finally, in the ‘mature phase,’– if cost problems and anti-lobbying forces are overcome, hydrogen could become mainstream, supported by robust regulations and infrastructure. The focus shifts to phasing out old fossil fuel practices, managing workforce transitions, and supporting affected communities.

Although many hydrogen advocates thought the industry was advancing commercially, it has largely reverted to the pilot phase, especially for green hydrogen. There are about 1,700 clean hydrogen projects on the drawing boards globally, and moving these towards final investment decisions (FID) should be the focus for 2026 and beyond. Grants and subsidies are crucial for both innovative and large-scale projects, as is strong demand for low-carbon hydrogen. Streamlined permitting and planning are essential, and overly strict regulations on early projects – for example on the carbon intensity of low carbon hydrogen - should be avoided, as higher standards are more appropriate when the sector matures. To use the earlier analogy: expecting a baby to clean up its own mess is unrealistic; that will come in the ‘toddler and teenage phases’. Finally, it is also crucial to shield the emerging industry from unfair foreign competition – just as we ensure our children’s safety in nursery.

The clean hydrogen sector remains subdued in 2026. While global production is expected to double to 1.8 million tons per annum (mtpa) due to projects under construction coming online, this volume is less than 2% of current global (non-clean) hydrogen use. Production is expected to rise to 5.5 mtpa by 2030, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, significantly short of the 25 mtpa combined targets from national governments across the globe. These targets are ripe for a reset based on market realism, but they might remain in place in 2026 as it is still a long way from 2030, at least in political terms.

Executives in the industry rank costs and weak demand as the main bottlenecks for viable business cases. Costs for green hydrogen production have been revised upward, notably due to higher energy, labour, material and trade costs and don’t make up for the oversupply in the Chinese equipment market.

Due to persistent high costs, the industry requires vast amounts of government support throughout the full supply chain; from hydrogen production, transportation to hydrogen use; every link requires assistance. Governments across the globe allocated $222 billion for blue and green H₂ in 2025, which was down 20% mostly due to cuts in the US.

The EU and its members offer the most support – $123 billion across EU pots such as the EU Innovation Fund and Next Generation EU Funds, and state support via programmes such as the Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI).

In the US, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) reshaped the industry. It erased uncertainty around the 45V tax credit but moved the start-of-construction deadline forward to end-2027, squeezing green hydrogen developers. Some will speed up to meet the deadline, while others are likely to give up. Large scale electrolyser projects are particularly at risk as they struggle to secure big off-take agreements faster. Meanwhile, the 45Q credit for CO₂ capture has strengthened the business case for blue hydrogen, allowing it to take the lead. By 2030, over 90% of clean hydrogen is expected to be blue. Overall, funding for clean hydrogen was reduced from $90 billion to $28 billion.

Demand remains severely underfunded - just 3% of the total support available is directed towards creating hydrogen demand. This compounds imbalances in the market: most proposed clean hydrogen suppliers have yet to find a buyer. Incentives to raise demand such as the Renewable Energy Directive (RED III quotas in Europe) have been watered down and regulation to green global shipping has been postponed (the proposals from the International Marine Organisation). Most binding off-take contracts so far have been driven by voluntary corporate decarbonisation goals in niche markets where few clients are willing to bridge the price gap by paying a green premium.

The National Energy Administration in China has outlined four foundational pillars for this effort: robust policy support, technological innovation, enhanced project governance, and expanded international trade. On the policy front, a new capex subsidy scheme now covers up to 20% of project investment for green hydrogen, e-fuels, CCUS, and related infrastructure. This measure is intended to reduce renewable power curtailment and help China achieve its emissions targets.

Regional governments have interpreted these national signals as a call to action. Provinces like Inner Mongolia, Hebei, and Shandong are accelerating large-scale electrolyser deployments and hydrogen pipeline construction, leveraging their abundant renewable resources and proximity to major industrial hubs.

Ultimately, China intends to transform hydrogen into a major new industry, potentially demonstrating a scalable blueprint for the rest of the world. Nonetheless, the sector will likely face familiar hurdles, including the gap between manufacturing capacity and end-use demand, as well as infrastructure challenges connecting supply and demand regions. It will be fascinating to observe how China addresses these challenges and what valuable lessons Europe and the US can glean from China as they work to develop a comprehensive hydrogen supply chain—including production, transportation, and utilisation in hard-to-abate industries.

Despite the tough environment for the industry overall, 2026 promises to be a dynamic year, with significant trends to watch.",https://think.ing.com/uploads/hero/_w800h450/Hydrogen_-_for_Outlook_1.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 12:38:54.470585

Davos, Switzerland: Andhra Pradesh Minister for IT, Electronics, Education and Skill Development Nara Lokesh held a series of high-level meetings with global energy and infrastructure leaders on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting 2026, pitching the state as a competitive destination for clean-energy manufacturing, green fuels and port-led industrial development.

Lokesh met senior executives from Vestas, the world’s largest wind-turbine manufacturer; India’s RPSG Group; and Japan’s largest power producer JERA, as part of Andhra Pradesh’s global investment outreach aimed at attracting large-scale clean-energy and advanced manufacturing investments.

In discussions with Morten Høy Dyhrholm, Senior Vice-President of Vestas, Lokesh invited the company to explore establishing wind turbine blade and nacelle manufacturing facilities near Andhra Pradesh’s ports.

He highlighted the State’s port-led industrial clusters, export-oriented logistics and emerging wind-manufacturing ecosystem, along with plans to set up a dedicated Centre for Wind Energy in partnership with academic and technical institutions to ensure a steady pipeline of skilled manpower.

“Vestas is the world’s largest wind-turbine manufacturer with annual revenues of Euro 17.3 billion and an order book of Euro 68.4 billion,” he said in a post on X. “I invited Vestas to explore setting up large-scale wind turbine blade and nacelle manufacturing units near our ports in Andhra Pradesh. With strong port-led logistics, an emerging wind manufacturing ecosystem, and our commitment to skill development – including a proposed Centre for Wind Energy with leading institutions – AP is ready to partner for global-scale growth.”

Lokesh also met Shashwat Goenka, Vice-Chairman of the RPSG Group, to review progress on the Group’s 349.8 MW wind power project in the State and explore hybrid renewable solutions combining wind, solar and storage to supply green power to industrial clusters and ports.

The discussions extended to potential investments in organic food processing, clean-label packaging, seafood value addition and ready-to-eat food manufacturing, leveraging Andhra Pradesh’s agricultural base, coastline, workforce and port infrastructure.

The two sides also discussed the use of RPSG’s sports franchises, including Lucknow Super Giants and Mohun Bagan Super Giants, to support grassroots sports development in the State.

“We discussed fast-tracking RPSG’s 349.8 MW wind project in AP, exploring hybrid renewables (wind-solar-storage), and powering our industrial clusters & ports with reliable green energy,” Lokesh said in a separate post.

Also explored leveraging RPSG’s sports franchises, Lucknow Super Giants & Mohun Bagan Super Giants, to nurture grassroots sports talent in Andhra Pradesh. “I invited the RPSG Group to invest in organic food processing, clean-label packaging, seafood value-addition, and ready-to-eat foods by leveraging AP’s strong agri base, long coastline, skilled workforce, and port-led logistics,” he said.

In a separate meeting, Lokesh held talks with Yukio Kani, Global CEO and Chair of JERA, on long-term clean-energy collaboration between Andhra Pradesh and Japan. He invited JERA to invest in green ammonia production facilities near the State’s port-led industrial clusters, positioning Andhra Pradesh as an export hub for Japanese and wider Asian markets. Discussions also covered solar-wind hybrid projects in Rayalaseema, integrated clean-energy platforms for anchor industries, and pilot initiatives on ammonia co-firing with APGENCO and NTPC to cut emissions from existing thermal assets.

“I invited JERA to invest in green ammonia production near AP’s port-led industrial clusters to serve Japan and Asian markets,” Lokesh said in a separate post. “We also discussed solar-wind hybrid projects in Rayalaseema, integrated clean energy platforms for anchor industries, and pilots on ammonia co-firing with APGENCO & NTPC to cut emissions while ensuring grid reliability.”

According to the notification, 100 employees will be affected, and the site closure will be effective March 15. The company still has RPET production at its Indiana plant. The Reading plant is the former site of CarbonLite operations.

Last June, Alpek announced it was closing its plant in North Carolina, which included both virgin and RPET production. Alpek is the largest PET producer globally, listing on its site 15 manufacturing locations in nine countries, including the US, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, UK, Canada, United Arab Emirates, Oman and Saudi Arabia.

Steve Alexander, CEO of the Association of Plastic Recyclers, told Plastics Recycling News the closure was “yet another unfortunate result” of factors including global overproduction of virgin plastic, imports of inexpensive recycled resin, and the lack of support for the domestic plastics recycling industry, including brands that have backed away from PCR content commitments.

APR owns Resource Recycling, Inc., publisher of Plastics Recycling News.

“You know, we hear a lot about infrastructure, and we have a recycling industry which can produce both volume and quality of material that the market wants, but because there are cheaper alternatives, people are going to go to that,” he said. “And the fact of the matter is that no recycler is going to continue to invest in this without a market.”

He added that the facilities that have closed, including rPlanet Earth and Natura PCR, were all built within the last 15 years. “It’s not like it’s an aging infrastructure or an aging industry.”

At the heart of the recent failures is that the US has provided incentives for renewable energy, such as purchases of electric vehicles and for providing infrastructure to charge them. “And yet, we have a material that reduces the use of fossil fuels, takes less energy to produce, reduces carbon footprint, as well as someone’s global greenhouse gas emissions by using recycled material, and we don’t incentivize the utilization of that.”

As such, Alexander emphasized the need for stakeholders to work together to advance policy initiatives to support the domestic plastics recycling industry, “or there won’t be any.”",https://resource-recycling.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/pet-bottles-Turian-shutterstock_2033292926.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 11:58:11.699943

Taken together, the findings point to a workforce that believes in the mission of the energy transition, but increasingly wants clearer signals from employers about stability, pay, and professional growth.

Confidence Remains High, Even As Mobility Increases

According to the report, 67 percent of respondents say they feel optimistic about their long-term careers in renewables, while just six percent describe themselves as pessimistic. That optimism persists despite a more challenging market environment marked by permitting delays, tax-credit uncertainty, and uneven capital deployment.

At the same time, 39 percent of respondents say they considered leaving the industry within the past year, and many report requiring double-digit salary increases to justify a job move. The data suggests a sector where commitment runs deep, but patience is thinning.

This pattern mirrors broader labor dynamics across the energy transition economy. The most recent U.S. Energy & Employment Report shows clean energy jobs continuing to grow as a share of overall energy employment, even as employers struggle with retention and skills alignment. The U.S. Department of Energy has echoed this concern, noting that clean energy workforce demand is rising faster than the supply of trained, experienced workers, particularly in grid modernization, transmission, and project delivery roles.

Compensation Growth Moderates, Expectations Rise

The report finds that median salaries across most clean energy roles have stabilized, with compensation growth continuing but at a slower pace than in prior years. Eighty-four percent of respondents report receiving a bonus, typically linked to individual or company performance.

Stability does not necessarily translate to satisfaction. Many professionals say they are more selective about career moves, prioritizing role clarity, development pathways, and organizational credibility over lateral salary gains alone.

This aligns with broader market analyses showing renewable salary increases clustering in the low single digits in 2025, a sign that the sector is maturing out of its rapid expansion phase. From a workforce-planning perspective, this moderation places greater pressure on non-compensation factors such as development, transparency, and long-term security, especially as project timelines lengthen and funding cycles become less predictable.

Clean Energy Jobs Grow, While Development Challenges Persist

One of the most persistent findings in the report concerns professional development. While men and women report similar levels of career confidence, women are significantly less likely to have formal development plans.

That gap has implications beyond individual careers. Research from the International Renewable Energy Agency shows women continue to hold only about one-third of renewable energy jobs globally, with particularly slow progress at senior and technical levels. Workforce analyses from the World Resources Institute reinforce this concern. WRI notes that the clean energy sector’s ability to scale depends not only on job creation but on sustained investments in training, advancement, and retention, particularly for historically underrepresented groups. Without stronger development pathways, the sector risks losing experienced mid-career professionals precisely when infrastructure delivery requires continuity and institutional knowledge.

Transparency Becomes A Competitive Advantage

A central theme running through the report is transparency. Professionals increasingly expect clarity around compensation benchmarks, promotion criteria, and long-term opportunity. Employers, in turn, are seeking reliable data to inform hiring and workforce planning during a more cautious investment cycle. “Transparency isn’t a nice-to-have anymore, it’s essential,” the report notes, reflecting feedback from both sides of the labor market.

This shift mirrors broader leadership trends already underway. Regulatory compliance, workforce resilience, and long-term operational stability now rank among the top C-Suite priorities. Other reports indicate that executives are increasingly treating workforce stability, data credibility, and execution risk as central to enterprise strategy.

What This Means For The Energy Transition

The findings point to a critical inflection point. Capital and policy still dominate conversations about the energy transition, but human capital is increasingly a binding constraint. Slower project timelines, delayed guidance, and evolving regulatory frameworks mean companies can no longer rely on rapid growth alone to retain talent. Instead, retention, development, and trust become strategic levers that directly influence delivery timelines.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/69690e54ae3a0bd9de8d35df/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2026-01-22 11:39:56.050809

Looking ahead:

By the end of 2026, which investment themes in Asia are most likely to gain traction—and which may lose momentum?

Max Han, CEO, Managing Director, Sopoong Ventures

By the end of 2026, the Asian investment landscape will pivot from “Mitigation Hype” to “Execution and Resilience.”

Themes Gaining Traction (The Winners):

Grid Flexibility and ESS (Energy Storage Systems): As renewable penetration hits critical levels, the problem isn’t “generating” power, but “managing” it. Technologies solving the “duck curve” and grid instability—such as Long-Duration Energy Storage (LDES) and VPPs (Virtual Power Plants)—will see peak demand.

Local Energy Sovereignty (Decentralized Power): Inspired by the “Sunlight Income Village” models in Korea, we expect a surge in Community-based Distributed Energy. This theme gains traction as large-scale grid construction faces increasing local opposition and cost overruns.

Climate Adaptation Tech: With 2025 being one of the hottest years on record, “Adaptation” is no longer a secondary concern. Investment will flow into water scarcity solutions, resilient agritech, and AI-driven disaster prediction systems designed for Asia’s unique geography.

Themes Losing Momentum (The Laggards):

Subsidy-Dependent Models: In the wake of shifting global trade policies (e.g., “Trump 2.0” ripples and IRA uncertainty), climate startups that rely solely on government subsidies rather than Grid Parity or operational efficiency will lose investor confidence.

Pure “Carbon Accounting” SaaS: The market is now exhausted by software that only “measures” problems. By late 2026, companies that provide measurement without Direct Reduction Technology (deep-tech) will struggle to differentiate themselves as the focus shifts to tangible decarbonization results.

I believe 2026 is the year of “Climate Realism.” The winners will be those who can navigate the tension between “pure green” ideals and the “gritty transition” required by our heavy industries. We are moving beyond the hype of digital dashboards toward the hard-tech reality of energy sovereignty and industrial transformation.

I like the “climate realism” lens here—less mitigation hype, more execution.

On grid flexibility: I think LDES will be deployed first where grids are most stressed, and that’s very clearly in Asia, especially in China, India, and parts of Southeast Asia, where demand growth, renewable intermittency, and reliability pressures are converging. We’re already seeing more of this “must-have” demand signal coming out of Asia than almost anywhere else.

I agree on carbon accounting SaaS: measurement alone is getting too crowded—what stands out now is connecting MRV to operational outcomes and execution results that actually move emissions down.

Lastly, I couldn’t agree more on adaptation tech—this is quickly becoming an infrastructure discussion across Asia, especially when 95% of the people affected by weather-related flooding globally live in Asia.

By the end of 2026, Southeast Asia’s cleantech narrative is likely to be defined less by moonshot industrial decarbonization and more by bankable energy transition and waste-to-value opportunities. The center of gravity is shifting toward themes that match three constraints: grid stress, policy urgency, and the region’s bias toward capex-light, near-term cash flows.

On the upside, distributed and utility-scale renewables, grid-connected BESS, and flexible gas or LNG “bridge” assets that enable coal-to-clean switches will keep gaining traction, helped by tightening power reliability concerns in Indonesia, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Expect more creative project finance and blended capital stacks as local banks grow comfortable with merchant risk, and as corporates chase RE100-style commitments via DPPAs and cross-border power trade. In parallel, waste-to-value in the forms of biomass, biogas, RDF, and circular plastics will benefit from import substitution logic (displacing fuel and feedstock imports) and the political optics of solving landfill, air quality, and flooding problems in one shot.

Conversely, big-ticket industrial decarbonization in the form of green hydrogen and carbon capture is likely to lose momentum in Southeast Asia’s private markets, barring a handful of policy-backed flagship projects. The region lacks both consistently high carbon prices and deep public support schemes, so many hydrogen and CCS proposals will struggle to clear investment committees once concessional or strategic capital steps back. Investors will still talk about hydrogen hubs and CCS corridors, but capital is more likely to flow into the enabling infrastructure, reliable power, grids, and waste systems, that will be needed long before gigawatt-scale electrolyzers and regional CO₂ pipelines.

This feels very APAC-practical—anchored in bankability, grid reliability, and near-term cashflow realities, which is exactly what shapes deal flow across the region. On Southeast Asia specifically, I agree green hydrogen and CCS are likely to attract less private-market attention near-term—partly because green hydrogen is still high-cost, but also because SEA’s current generation mix and relatively lower renewable penetration make it harder to deliver truly “green” molecules or bankable CCS economics without heavy policy support.

The waste-to-value angle is definitely interesting—politically and strategically—but I’d flag that scaling is still the big question mark. Feedstock consistency, project execution, and bankability vary hugely by market, so the winners will likely be the platforms that can prove repeatable unit economics and reliable offtake, not just a strong circular narrative.

Andrew Wong, Director, TRIREC

By the end of 2026, bio-based alternatives in Asia are likely to gain traction where they fit into existing industrial systems. Adoption is strongest when bio-based inputs can be blended, substituted, or procured without changing how products are made, distributed, or sold. This is why momentum in Asia is most visible in mandated biofuels, where policy support and incumbent infrastructure translate directly into scale.

This dynamic is clear in biofuels, where success depends on alignment with existing agricultural and refining ecosystems. In India, sugarcane-based ethanol scales because it plugs into a mature sugar industry, allowing higher blending mandates to be met using established mills, logistics, and farmer networks. In Indonesia, palm oil-based biodiesel has expanded for similar reasons: abundant domestic feedstock, integrated refining capacity, and a policy framework that redirects existing production into fuel use. In both cases, scale comes from system fit rather than technological novelty.

What differentiates the current wave from earlier waves is how these pathways are being industrialized and financed. Instead of building capital-intensive greenfield plants to compete in commodity markets, companies are increasingly scaling through co-location with existing assets, contract manufacturing, or modular deployment. This reduces upfront risk and allows businesses to secure offtake before committing heavy capital.

Overall, the bio-based companies most likely to succeed in Asia by the end of 2026 will be those that supply practical inputs to existing industries, creatively scale through capital-light and partnership-driven models, and are anchored in close proximity to abundant feedstock—rather than standalone climate projects that sit outside incumbent industrial value chains.

This complements Andrew’s waste-to-value point nicely. The bio-based winners will be the ones that fit into existing industrial systems rather than trying to rebuild value chains from scratch.

The India and Indonesia examples are a great reminder that in Asia, scale often comes from incumbent alignment—feedstock proximity, established logistics, and policy-backed demand—more than pure technological novelty.

The financing angle is critical as well: co-location, modular deployment, and contract manufacturing are increasingly the scaling playbook for bio-based solutions that want to grow without taking on full greenfield capex risk.

With the upcoming release of China’s 15th Five Year Plan, AI will be a central factor for the nation’s future economic growth. As AI reasoning expands, compute demand is growing at an unprecedented rate, triggering investment into data centers, network, connectivity, and power infrastructure. With China’s 2030 peak emissions target, the government is encouraging investment in ultra-energy-efficient technologies to reduce energy consumption. Investors have also recognized the potential of physical AI for China’s manufacturing and data center ecosystems, with focus shifting to proprietary models and digital twins software that optimize energy usage within manufacturing and AI infrastructure itself.

In contrast, CCUS is facing a reality check globally. In the case of China, the key CCUS technology stakeholders are primarily state-owned enterprises capable of supporting large-scale, integrated demonstration projects. Whereas the cost of CCUS implementation for startups is a pure expense. Carbon prices are insufficient to cover capture costs, while utilization remains unscalable and storage generates no direct revenue. While some large-scale projects can produce returns, most applications rely heavily on subsidies to succeed. Therefore, startups are searching for niche, high-value entry points such as CO₂ conversion into chemicals or CO₂ combined with industrial waste for construction materials. However, most approaches have not been validated at scale.

Additionally, opportunities in China-dominated supply chains such as EVs, solar, and Li-ion batteries are slowing. As these sectors have matured and overcapacity has taken hold, government support and VC funding have dried up. With a significant industry consolidation expected on the horizon, VCs are opting for fresh, early-stage deals, particularly in AI startups.

Summer’s take: China’s AI push is no longer a software story—it’s an infrastructure and efficiency story. As the 15th Five-Year Plan takes shape, capital is shifting toward system-level optimization, while CCUS remains largely a state-led play. For start-ups, scale comes later; efficiency and niche value come first.

For 2026, we expect thematic investments into AI and its enabling stack, including data centers, advanced semiconductors, and quantum computing, as focus shifts from experimentation to scaled deployment. Renewables and mobility would also remain as durable investment themes driven by energy-security priorities and continuing shift towards EVs and AVs. In contrast, whilst hydrogen remains as a strategic and important theme towards decarbonization, we think near term momentum may soften due to cost, infrastructure, and maturity hurdles.

AI in Southeast Asia is moving from experimentation to deployment. The opportunity isn’t hype—it’s in the enabling stack: power, infrastructure, and integration. Clean energy and mobility remain durable, while hydrogen stays strategic but commercially constrained in the near term.

While 2025 was the year of AI optimism, 2026 will be the year of AI realism.

In Malaysia, AI is already projected to account for 70-90% of new energy demand growth through 2030. The strain is so acute that the state of Johor has already halted approvals for new water-intensive data centers. The system simply cannot support the demand.

Consequently, the winners in 2026 won’t be those driving more consumption, but those alleviating the pain. We expect capital to flow into technologies that improve energy intensity, grid stability, and power quality, specifically solutions that can be deployed immediately to unlock capacity.

Crucially, this will not always be clean. A utility executive recently confided that he is actively seeking solutions to reactivate decommissioned coal plants. These plants are labor-intensive to run, so to make them economical, he plans to use AI to operate them. It is almost poetic: using AI to burn coal to power the AI.

I think in general, infrastructure investment will become more holistic. For example, merging power generation directly with compute. The era of the “simple” data center build-out is over; the market is slowing down to digest the complexity of powering it.

2026 is the year AI meets physical limits. I mean actual limit. Power, water, and grid constraints are now shaping investment decisions. The winners won’t be those driving more demand, but those easing system stress—even when the solutions are pragmatic rather than perfectly clean.",https://cleantech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/clay-banks-U0-r0JMypE0-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 13:39:55.494757

But accommodating new large electric loads is a challenge for power grid operator PJM. Now, the White House, along with politicians on both sides of the aisle, is looking for a fix that will keep consumer prices down.

“Skyrocketing power bills have become a huge political issue, and rightly or wrongly, there’s a lot of people in the public who blame data centers,” said Mark Christie, who previously served as chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and is currently the founding director of the Center for Energy Law and Policy at William & Mary Law School.

Last Friday, governors of all 13 states that include part of the PJM grid joined Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in signing a letter to guide future operations. This included a flagship request for an emergency auction in which data center developers would bid on 15-year contracts from power-generating companies — a move intended to ensure data centers’ energy needs are paid for by Big Tech rather than existing ratepayers.

Senate Democrats also filed a bill on Friday that they say will ensure data center companies pay their fair share, but it would first have to overcome stiff Republican control of Congress and the presidency.

Also on Friday, PJM released its own long-awaited plan after the grid operator could not reach its benchmark to secure enough electricity to meet projected future demand. The PJM plan did not endorse the exact measures outlined by the White House.

What’s at stake is the ability of the PJM electric grid to keep the lights on for 67 million Americans while also accommodating growth in the AI revolution and keeping rates under control.

In interviews with Straight Arrow News, energy experts said the White House proposal lacks sufficient detail and may not address the root issues at PJM. Moreover, new policies cannot simply be dictated by cabinet members or state governors; FERC and various state legislatures would need to take action.

‘The Devils in the Details’

“One of the fundamental problems at PJM is political, not economic, not the physics of the grid,” Christie told SAN.

The political problem, Christie said, is that each of the 13 states has diverging energy policies that dictate how easy it is to build new resources and what is prioritized.

The White House document envisions a special auction to establish 15-year contracts between power companies and Big Tech. But Christie said it’s unclear whether such an auction, if conducted, would guarantee that homes and small businesses do not see increased prices, because state policy decides how electric grid costs are allocated.

“I strongly support the principle that the cost causer, if it’s the data centers, should pay their costs,” Christie told SAN. But that outcome is ”very much undetermined.”

Jon Gordon, policy director at Advanced Energy United, agreed that the plan to “isolate the data center cost from the typical ratepayer” is a good thing, but, he said, “the devil’s in the details.”

What are the economics of PJM’s capacity market?

PJM’s job is to balance electricity supply and demand in its territory to maintain a safe, reliable grid. That includes overseeing the market where electricity is bought and sold between companies that generate power and retail suppliers that sell electricity to homes and businesses.

As part of its role as a grid operator, PJM runs a capacity market for electricity sales three years in the future. This is intended to secure enough electricity supply for projected future demand and incentivize power companies to make longer-term investments.

The projected future demand on the grid has increased dramatically as a large number of data centers have announced plans to locate in PJM states like Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio. In the last three capacity auctions, data centers accounted for $21.3 billion, or about 45%, of future electric supply contracts, according to a market monitor’s report.

To protect consumers from increasing costs, the capacity market has a price cap. The White House calls for the price cap to continue for at least the next two auctions — an action that would require FERC approval.

In its plan, PJM does not commit to keeping the price cap; instead the board asked stakeholders for more input.

“A price collar may obscure the market’s underlying clearing price and, as a result, could dampen signals needed to support the entry of new supply,” PJM said.

Where will PJM make up the electricity shortage?

In a press release, the Trump administration blamed the problems in PJM on Biden administration policies that it said forced power plants to shut down.

Wright described the actions as a call on PJM “to allow America to build big, reliable power plants again.”

Advocates for renewable energy, on the other hand, say PJM’s process for integrating new resources onto the grid is too slow.

To connect to the grid, new resources need a complex engineering study, which can take one to two years; some projects have waited more than five years before their study even starts, Gordon told SAN.

The White House also advocated for shortening the study periods to 150 days, a push that Gordon called “magical thinking.” He told SAN he worries that new power plants could be permitted to skip to the front of the interconnection queue, ahead of renewable projects that have waited for years.

Overall, Gordon said he sees the principles as “Band-Aid remedies.”

Christie said the notion that PJM’s management of interconnection is to blame for power shortages is “inaccurate” and “misplaced.”

He told SAN that in many cases, PJM completes the interconnection study, but a lack of financing and local siting issues prevent renewable energy development.

Instead, Christie said the states in PJM should look inward at their own laws that are the “real barrier to getting new generation built.”",https://san.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2219719521_Getty_Images_clean.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 14:40:28.360922

Handling nuclear waste is a politically and environmentally sensitive issue, and the U.S. may have much more of that in the coming years as it the Trump Administration plans to facilitate the expansion of U.S. nuclear energy capacity from about 100 gigawatts (GW) in 2024 to 400 GW by 2050.

The U.S. Administration has bet big on nuclear power, alongside gas, to meet the expected surge in America’s electricity demand driven by AI, data centers, and the onshoring of manufacturing.

New nuclear plants could be ready to provide baseload capacity from 2030 or even 2035 onwards, due to long lead times to permit and construction, according to Goldman Sachs.

The Administration is laying the foundations for a nuclear renaissance.

Earlier this month, the Energy Department announced a $2.7 billion investment to strengthen domestic enrichment, in support of President Trump’s commitment to expand U.S. capacity for low-enriched uranium (LEU) and jumpstart new supply chains and innovations for high-assay low-enriched uranium.

Last month, the Energy Department awarded $800 million to TVA and Holtec to advance the deployment of U.S. small modular reactors.

In November, DOE extended a $1-billion loan to help Constellation Energy restart the Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear reactor to add baseload power to the grid and help the AI advancement in the United States.

Big Tech As The ‘Solution’

Speaking on Fox Business, Wright defended a new Donald Trump administration plan to ensure companies like Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc.‘s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google shoulder the costs of new power generation.

Wright directly addressed critics who blame the energy appetite of artificial intelligence (AI) for soaring costs. “The Democrats and others are saying data centers are the cause of rising electricity prices… They’re not,” Wright stated.

Instead, he positioned tech firms as a “key part of the solution.”

Wright emphasized that while these centers need “a tremendous amount of power,” the companies “very much want” to pay for necessary infrastructure upgrades themselves, rather than having those costs “socialized onto the backs of ordinary American ratepayers.”

The ‘Electricity Auction’ Plan

Wright's comments align with reports of a new administration directive involving PJM Interconnection, the largest U.S. grid operator.

The plan would establish an emergency auction requiring hyperscalers to bid on long-term contracts to fund billions in new power plants.

Wright referenced this directly, noting President Trump proposed an “electricity auction in which tech companies will be forced to cover the costs of new power plants.”

This mechanism aims to secure the reliable power Big Tech needs without punishing households.

Blaming Coal Closures, Not AI

The Secretary argued that current price hikes stem not from new AI demand, but from previous policies that constrained supply.

“The states that have rushed to close their coal plants have also had rapidly escalating electricity prices,” he said, labeling the focus on data centers a way for critics to “escape blame” for anti-fossil fuel policies.

To meet future demand, Wright also pointed to a rapid expansion of nuclear energy, promising that new small modular reactors would be operational by July 4.

Mintz’s recent 2025 Annual Energy Transition Summit highlighted the impact of this bill and other major policy changes on the availability of capital and investments into the sector. Tailored structured finance and credit market strategies are essential to ensure that cutting-edge projects continue to thrive at this critical juncture in the energy transition.

Federal Support Rollbacks and Tax Credit Challenges

Rollbacks of federal support for clean energy are well underway. In addition to direct funding cuts, such as the termination of over $7.5 billion in Department of Energy (DOE) financial awards announced this past September, the OBBBA significantly narrowed the tax credit base for clean energy projects. After the bill’s passage, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued parallel guidance that creates further challenges for borrowers seeking capital for wind and solar projects. To qualify for the production tax credit (PTC) and investment tax credit (ITC) under the updated requirements, these projects must begin construction by July 4, 2026 or be placed in service by December 31, 2027. The new guidance specifies that developers need to demonstrate substantial physical work or meet the 5% safe harbor for small facilities, while preliminary activities like permitting and financing no longer count as construction start. These requirements, coupled with continuous construction obligations and strict documentation standards, increase upfront capital needs for wind and solar facilities.

Increased Reliance on Structured Finance

With the sharp decline in federal funding for clean energy, structured finance, credit facilities, and institutional lending are now lifelines for companies in the industry. With limited non-dilutive funding available, many companies have turned to more dilutive options, such as convertible instruments (e.g., convertible notes and SAFEs) and preferred equity financings.

Common investor-friendly provisions that grew more prevalent throughout 2025 include:

Higher discount rates and lower valuation caps

Cramdowns and recapitalizations

Reductions in valuation

Warrant kickers

Tranched (milestone-based) investments

Reverse vesting of founders’ shares

Pre-NTP Funding and Lender Expectations

At the same time, lenders are scrutinizing clean energy and digital infrastructure projects more closely. Driven by the new eligibility requirements for wind and solar tax credits, pre-notice-to-proceed (pre-NTP) funding surged past $7 billion in the first half of 2025 as developers raced to secure capital for equipment purchases and meet tightened construction timelines. Given the inherent risk in this type of financing, deal structure is an increasingly critical differentiator for borrowers. In the first half of 2025, developers seeking pre-NTP capital that offered diversified portfolios and robust collateral packages, including revenue-generating assets and parent guarantees, were particularly attractive to lenders. Through these forms of strategic structuring, wind and solar projects can maintain their ITC and PTC eligibility in the face of policy changes.

Securitization and Syndication as Long‑Term Tools

Heightened regulatory complexity also means that securitization and syndication strategies are emerging as key enablers of long-term investment. Bespoke credit facilities offer tailored structures that align with unique project timelines and cash-flow profiles, ensuring flexibility in a context of shifting tax credit rules and foreign entity restrictions. These financing mechanisms help borrowers navigate policy uncertainty, secure competitive pricing, and maintain momentum toward energy transition goals.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.13290_5342.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 10:40:11.163916

China 'won the race' in Argentina BYD and similar Chinese cars have already taken the streets of Latin America by storm, drawing controversy and backlash from Mexico City to Rio de Janeiro.
But Argentina is still far behind its neighbors in developing its EV industry, said Pablo Naya, the creator of Sero Electric, Argentina's only domestic electric car manufacturer.
The country's aging power grid is nowhere near ready for a wave of electric cars to strain it en masse, he said.
But if or when Argentine infrastructure and consumer aspirations catch up to Chinese supply, it will be a different story.","ZÁRATE, Argentina (AP) — The vast field of over 5,800 electric and hybrid vehicles gleamed on the cargo deck of the BYD Changzhou, an Chinese container vessel unloading Wednesday at a river port in eastern Argentina.

In other places, such a scene would not be noteworthy. Chinese automaker BYD has sped up its exports and undercut rivals the world over, alarming Washington, upsetting Western and Japanese auto giants and unnerving local industries across Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America.

But the sight of so many new Chinese EVs gliding onto a muddy river bank in Buenos Aires province was unprecedented for Argentina, its crisis-stricken economy dominated for years by a left-wing populist movement that protected local industry with stiff tariffs and import restrictions.

""For decades people in Argentina had this vision that everything here must be manufactured here,"" said Claudio Damiano, a professor in the Institute of Transportation at Argentina's National University of San Martin. ""The boat has a symbolic value as the first step for BYD. Everyone's wondering how far it will go.""

The shipment also came in stark contrast to the news in Brussels, where on Wednesday European Union lawmakers voted to delay ratification of a landmark free trade deal with the Mercosur group of South American countries, including Argentina, which promises to tear down trade barriers for European industrial imports and supercharge consumption of German EVs.

""For the Europeans, there's just no possibility of competing with the Chinese,"" Damiano said.

The ship shocks a long-closed economy

Argentina became one of the region's most closed economies under Kirchnerism — the movement formed by ex-President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and her late husband, former President Néstor Kirchner, which championed the rights of the downtrodden, defaulted on sovereign debt and disdained global trade as a destructive force.

A chronically depreciating peso and sky-high taxes constrained consumer choice, compelling well-heeled Argentines to smuggle iPhones and Zara hauls into the country when returning from vacations abroad.

Fed up with cycles of economic crisis, Argentines vaulted radical libertarian President Javier Milei to power in 2023. He railed against Kirchnerism, vowed to destroy the state and praised U.S. President Donald Trump as an ideological soulmate.

Argentina transforms with an influx of imports

For the last two years, Milei has has done the exact opposite of his most powerful ally in Washington.

While Trump has waged trade wars, Milei has flung open Argentina's doors to imports, slashed trade barriers, unwound customs red tape and shored up the local currency to make foreign goods more affordable.

Last year Argentina logged a record 30% increase in imports compared to the year before — much of it in the form of $3 milk frothers and $10 dresses piling up on Argentines' doorsteps from Asian online retailers such as Temu and Shein.

Now Chinese automakers — once choked by 35% levies on imports — are seizing on a new measure to allow 50,000 electric and hybrid cars into the country this year tariff-free. The first shipment arrived Monday at Zárate Port after a 23-day voyage from Singapore.

Telling business and political leaders Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos that that his drastic deregulation measures ""allow us to have a more dynamically efficient economy,"" Milei declared: ""This is MAGA, 'Make Argentina Great Again.

Trump and Milei bond despite differences

Milei and Trump share a contempt for perceived ""wokeness,"" a resentment of multilateral institutions like the United Nations, a denial of climate change and a zeal for massive budget cuts.

The ideological bond has paid dividends for Milei: Argentina is a rare place in the region where Trump has wielded the might of the U.S. to help an ally rather than enforce demands with military threats, as he has in Colombia and Mexico. Last year he offered Milei a $20 billion credit swap to boost his friend's chances in a crucial midterm election.

Yet at Davos, the leaders' differences were on display. Milei delivered his anti-interventionist, libertarian interpretation of MAGA shortly after Trump laid out his own vision for making America great: demanding control of Greenland and threatening allies with tariffs and other consequences if they don't fall in line.

For all of Trump's support, China has perhaps benefited most from Milei's free-market drive.

Chinese imports to Argentina surged over 57% last year compared to the year before. Chinese investment poured into Argentina's energy and mining sectors.

""Argentina has rejoined the world,"" government spokesperson Javier Lanari said of Monday's Chinese car shipment. ""Very soon, the Cuban-made vehicles left to us by Kirchnerism will be part of a sad and dark past.""

China 'won the race' in Argentina

BYD and similar Chinese cars have already taken the streets of Latin America by storm, drawing controversy and backlash from Mexico City to Rio de Janeiro.

Now the brands are best positioned to reap the rewards of Milei's zero-tariff quota for EVs, which applies only to cars under $16,000, experts say.

""Chinese manufacturers have the technology and the ability to meet the price limits set by the government,"" said Andrés Civetta, an economist specializing in the auto sector at the Argentine consulting firm Abeceb. ""China has won the race.""

Western car manufacturers in Argentina have raised alarms about unfair competition, and opposition lawmakers have criticized officials on the Chinese EV tariff exemption, with the comptroller general posting on social media, ""Trump is right: China must be stopped.""

But Argentina is still far behind its neighbors in developing its EV industry, said Pablo Naya, the creator of Sero Electric, Argentina's only domestic electric car manufacturer.

The country's aging power grid is nowhere near ready for a wave of electric cars to strain it en masse, he said. And if something goes wrong with a Chinese EV on the road, there are currently no dealers' service centers able to undertake internal repairs.

""Honestly, we're not worried,"" Naya said.

But if or when Argentine infrastructure and consumer aspirations catch up to Chinese supply, it will be a different story.

""Then that would get complicated for us,"" he said from the Sero Electric factory in the Buenos Aires suburb of Castelar. ""We'd have a problem.""",https://img.manufacturing.net/mindful/im/workspaces/default/uploads/2026/01/bydevs.vxQXs6zBqh.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&crop=focalpoint&fit=max&fp-x=0.46&fp-y=0.48&q=70&w=1200,N,,2026-01-22 10:59:03.143856

Tens of millions of taxpayers are expected to receive larger refunds due to the 2025 One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which increased the standard deduction and the Child Tax Credit (CTC). Millions more can claim new deductions for tips, overtime income, and auto loan interest, while Americans 65 and older can claim a $6,000 seniors deduction. Taxpayers itemizing their deductions may benefit from a higher cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions than the $10,000 cap that was in place from 2018-2024.

The IRS, the agency responsible for answering taxpayers’ questions, processing tax returns, and issuing tax refunds, has faced changes in leadership, staffing levels, and available resources. The agency will also face pressure from policymakers in Washington to deliver refunds efficiently and quickly, while preventing fraud and improper payments and juggling the dozens of changes contained in OBBB.

We will update some metrics on a weekly basis once the filing season begins; see “Weekly Filing Statistics, in Charts.” We will update how tax refunds are affecting the federal budget every weekday; see: “How Do Tax Refunds Affect the Federal Budget?”

Key Issues and Trends for the 2026 Tax Filing Season

OBBB Changes

The defining feature of the 2026 tax filing season is the many tax changes implemented in OBBB. Even though President Donald Trump signed OBBB into law on July 4, 2025, several of its changes were retroactively effective from January 1, 2025, meaning that taxpayers can claim new deductions or credit dollars when they file their tax returns in early 2026.

The following table summarizes the major retroactive tax provisions in OBBB:

With several retroactive tax cuts in OBBB, it will be worth monitoring how large tax refunds are (more on that below). It will also be worth tracking how many people claim newly available deductions and how easy it is for taxpayers to understand and access these tax benefits.

One complicating factor is that the IRS is still finalizing the specific rules for several of these new policies, such as the tips and overtime deductions. Another is that employers haven’t necessarily updated their reporting systems and structures to provide workers with the information they need to confidently claim the new deductions. For the 2026 filing season, the IRS has offered subregulatory guidance to taxpayers claiming the tips and overtime deductions. The IRS has also provided transitional relief for employers reporting on tips and overtime earned and for businesses reporting auto loan interest paid by consumers.

Still, several questions remain:

Do taxpayers reporting tips and overtime receive complete and accurate information from their employers that makes it easy to claim the deductions?

If information is incomplete (e.g., an employer reports on all overtime pay, not just the “half” in “time-and-a-half” pay eligible for the deduction), can taxpayers confidently calculate their own earnings and accurately claim deductions?

How will the IRS assess the accuracy of deduction claims if the information they receive from taxpayers or employers is incomplete?

Are taxpayers aware of the law’s limitations on the new deductions, such as maximum amounts, income limits, and occupational limits?

In contrast, many changes in OBBB are relatively straightforward: The larger standard deduction is simple and will be claimed by tens of millions of taxpayers. The larger CTC will also benefit tens of millions of families, although new restrictions on some families may complicate tax filing and credit claiming. The new deduction for seniors will cut taxes for millions and is easily verified by the taxpayer’s age.

IRS Resources Constraints

In 2022, the IRS initiated an ambitious modernization plan backed by $79 billion in supplemental funding passed into law under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The agency began staffing up, particularly to enhance its taxpayer service and enforcement activities. Starting in 2023, however, Congress began rescinding the IRA funding. Three laws—one each in 2023, 2024, and 2025—collectively removed $42 billion provided to the agency, or more than 50% of the original funding. The agency had also spent $16 billion through September 2025, meaning that only $21 billion remained from what the IRS expected to be $79 billion in funding just three years ago.

Compounding those challenges, policymakers are asking the IRS to do more with less. Although Congress has not yet approved full-year appropriations for the current fiscal year (FY2026) and the IRS is operating on a continuing resolution for FY2025, a bipartisan, bicameral agreement released in January 2026 would cut FY2026 IRS funding by 9% ($1.1 billion) relative to FY2025 levels.

The U.S. Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), the agency’s watchdog, reported in October 2025 that “[c]ompleting IT modernization projects, providing quality service to taxpayers, and enforcing tax laws with a reduced workforce and budget will be challenging for the IRS.”

IRS Leadership and Staffing Changes

The IRS was already resource- and staff-constrained before Congress passed OBBB into law; now the agency has to administer the nation’s tax code and implement several new provisions in the middle of a filing season with less funding than anticipated. The IRS has also faced major personnel changes in the months leading up to the 2026 filing season.

At the top of the organization, the IRS had more people serve as commissioner in 2025 than during any other year in its 164-year history. Seven people had stints as the IRS leader, five as acting commissioners (i.e., not Senate-confirmed). Since August 2025, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been serving as acting IRS commissioner, with Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano serving as IRS CEO—a new position created by the Trump administration.

Commissioners set organizational tone and strategy for the IRS, and the lack of stable leadership could impact both operations and project prioritization. This situation could make for a particularly challenging 2026 tax filing season.

The leadership challenges have coincided with major reductions in staffing levels. The IRS lost 25% of its workforce from January through May 2025. TIGTA reported that this was mostly due to “the federal government’s Deferred Resignation Program, which allowed federal employees to resign immediately with continued pay through September 30, 2025.” Consequently, the agency is working to implement the new law and prepare for the 2026 filing season with a significantly reduced staff.

All of the funding and personnel constraints at the IRS will be exacerbated if the government shuts down again in February 2026. Although the agency historically has furloughed fewer staffers during filing season (compared with nonfiling season), a government shutdown might still affect customer service, enforcement, and a variety of other IRS operations.

Measurements of Success for the IRS

Executive branch officials, lawmakers, government and nongovernment watchdogs, and the IRS itself assess the agency’s performance during filing season. A few key measurements and metrics for success are described below.

Processing Refunds

As the IRS receives returns, how quickly does it process them? This is important for delivering tax refunds in a speedy and efficient manner and avoiding backlogs.

If returns contain errors, how frequently and quickly is the IRS catching them?

What kind of errors are automated systems and technology tools catching? What kind of errors are human agents catching?

Is the agency catching both large- and small-dollar errors?

Are there particular categories of errors the IRS is missing on a systemic basis?

Clearing Returns Backlogs

When taxpayers file amended returns or resolve errors with the IRS, is the agency processing that inventory in a speedy and efficient manner?

Is the IRS meeting its goals for processing amended returns (e.g., IRS Accounts Management has a goal of processing them within 45 days)?

If a taxpayer is waiting on the IRS to process a return, do they have readily available and accurate estimates for how long it will take the agency to process the return?

Serving Taxpayers

How many people are visiting the IRS.gov website during filing season?

Are taxpayers satisfied with the information they can find on IRS.gov? Are there particular topics where taxpayers feel they don’t have the information they need from the IRS, or find themselves frustrated or confused by the information provided?

How many taxpayers have created accounts with the IRS? Do they find these accounts useful for filing returns or viewing the status of their return/refund?

When taxpayers call the IRS, how long does it take them to receive an answer to their question? Are taxpayers satisfied with the service they receive on the phone?

Is the IRS leveraging AI to provide taxpayers with answers to their questions? Are those answers accurate, complete, and helpful to taxpayers?

TIGTA will assess many of these metrics and measurements in its annual report on IRS filing season performance. Fortunately, some of these metrics are also published on a weekly basis during the filing season (see “Weekly Filing Statistics, in Charts”). The IRS has several other measures of success over a longer time period—such as audit rates and the size of the tax gap—that agency officials, policymakers, and watchdogs must also monitor over time.

How Large Will Refunds Be?

The size of tax refunds is always a major topic during filing season, but it will draw even more attention in 2026, given the major retroactive tax changes enacted in OBBB.

So how large will refunds be?

We will likely start to receive data on the aggregate amount of refunds and the average refund per taxpayer in early February. It is important to note that early data can be deceiving—in recent filing seasons, average refunds have been smaller at the start of the filing season, risen sharply in mid-February once the IRS is legally allowed to issue Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and refundable CTC refunds, and then declined slightly from a February peak through Tax Day.

The chart below shows how the average refund changed from the first update of the filing season through the 13th and final update (early February through April) for the 2022-2025 filing seasons. The average refund in 2025 was $2,939, about 2% higher than the 2024 average for the same period. Refunds were higher in 2022 in significant part due to larger tax credits from the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act.

Refunds are likely to be higher in 2026 because of OBBB’s tax cuts. Don Schneider, deputy head of U.S. policy at Piper Sandler, estimates that OBBB will deliver $91 billion in retroactive tax relief in 2026, with $60 billion being issued in refunds and $30 billion reducing tax liabilities. (Tax cuts can reduce the amount that a taxpayer would otherwise owe when filing, turn a tax liability into a tax refund, or make a tax refund larger than it would otherwise be.)

This change will consist of smaller tax cuts (in the hundreds of dollars) going to tens of millions of taxpayers and larger tax cuts (in the thousands of dollars) going to millions of taxpayers.

The following provisions from OBBB will drive higher refunds:

The larger standard deduction will cut taxes by between $75 and $278 for single taxpayers (depending on their tax bracket) and between $150 and $555 for married taxpayers. In the 2023 filing season, 143 million tax returns claimed the standard deduction.

The larger CTC will cut taxes by up to $200 per child for taxpayers with children. The Tax Policy Center estimates that 46 million tax units claimed the CTC in 2022.

The senior deduction will cut taxes by anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars for individuals ages 65 and older. The Tax Policy Center estimates that in 2026, 24 million taxpayers will claim the senior deduction, with an average tax cut of around $1,000.

The overtime deduction will cut taxes by anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars for eligible taxpayers. The Tax Policy Center estimates that in 2026, 17 million taxpayers will claim the overtime deduction, with an average tax cut of around $1,400.

The higher SALT cap will cut taxes by anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars for taxpayers who itemize their deductions. In the 2023 filing season, 15 million tax returns claimed the SALT deduction.

The tips deduction will cut taxes by anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars for eligible taxpayers. The Tax Policy Center estimates that in 2026, 5 million taxpayers will claim the tips deduction, with an average tax cut of around $1,400. The Treasury Department, in contrast, projects that 10 million tax returns will claim the tips deduction.

The auto loan interest deduction and newly refundable portion of the adoption credit might also lead to larger refunds for individuals and families during the 2026 filing season.

How Do Larger Tax Refunds Affect the Federal Budget?

Tax refunds to individual taxpayers don’t occur in a vacuum; taken together, they also affect the federal budget. The larger refunds anticipated in the upcoming filing season reflect policy changes that will mean fewer dollars left for the federal government to cover its spending obligations, and higher borrowing needs.

The federal deficit is projected to top $2 trillion in FY2026—nearly $500 billion of it due to the effects of OBBB. Because tens of millions of taxpayers owe the IRS at tax time, the federal government will likely collect more in deposits during the 2026 tax filing season than it pays out in refunds. Still, refunds are likely to be much larger in 2026 than in 2025. BPC will track these numbers each weekday, compared with 2025.

Weekly Filing Statistics, in Charts

BPC will track several filing season metrics on a weekly basis based on IRS data, with comparisons to other recent filing seasons:

number of returns filed by taxpayers;

total refund amounts, in billions of dollars;

average refund amount, in dollars;

IRS.gov visits by taxpayers.

Key Dates to Watch

These are the key dates to watch throughout the 2026 tax filing season.

State-by-State Impacts

Although most of the metrics below are national averages, filing season results vary by state. Below, BPC shares 50-state results for three different metrics:

average federal tax refund, in dollars;

share of federal returns that owed taxes at filing;

share of federal returns that were owed a refund at filing, a category that includes taxpayers who took their refund right away and those who applied the refund to the next tax year.

State-by-state results are for the 2022 tax year (i.e., 2023 filing season), the most recent year data are available.",https://bipartisanpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_788249959_tax_cuts_economy-scaled-1.jpeg,N,,2026-01-22 10:40:16.159945

⚠️ You shouldn’t have to worry that your shampoo, cookware, or drinking water might harm your health. ☣️

That’s why we were so concerned when the chemical industry started pressuring Congress to roll back protections on the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) — a bedrock chemical safety law which empowers the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to stop companies from putting dangerous chemicals into everyday products.

A hearing has been scheduled in the House today to discuss gutting this vital chemical safety law at the expense of our safety. If this bill is successful, it would become much harder — and in some instances impossible — for EPA to require that chemicals are tested for safety.

That’s why we must show Congress how important it is to keep these protections intact!

Emitters are increasingly focusing on operating their own capture facilities, while specialised operators handle the transport and storage of CO2. This model is taking shape across regions, though the policy frameworks that support it vary significantly. In the UK, regulated revenue contracts are in place to shield transport and storage operators from under‑utilisation risk. Norway’s Northern Lights operates on a pay-per-use basis, while the Dutch Porthos project uses fixed capacity agreements with some flexibility.

While these approaches help clarify the local business case, investors require a thorough understanding of each region’s specific policies and risk structures. As we approach 2026, business models will continue to be refined, with risk-return profiles evolving to reflect the preferences of different actors within the CCS supply chain.

Policy uncertainty in the US

The US picture has been complicated by US President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which has left its mark on the CCS sector (although less so compared to offshore wind or hydrogen). The Department of Energy's cancellation of $3 billion in industrial demonstration grants (including $1.2 billion for CCUS) and the potential loss of $7.5 billion in awards have disrupted capture projects and threatened the carbon credit market. Transport and storage progress is mixed: the EPA has sped up Class VI permit approvals, and Texas can issue new permits, but states like Louisiana have enacted moratoriums. Major pipeline projects, such as Summit Carbon Solutions, face ongoing legal and logistical hurdles.

A key growth opportunity is supplying low-carbon power to hyperscale data centres run by Google, Microsoft, Meta, and AWS, which still intend to meet net-zero targets by 2030. The 45Q tax credit requires at least 75% CO2 capture and high plant use. With current gas plant utilisation at only 56% on average, long-term power purchase agreements with must-run data centres are needed to ensure sufficient run times. These are now entering the market. Google, for example, agreed to purchase power from a gas plant with CCS in a first-of-a-kind deal last October. More recently, NextEra and ExxonMobil revealed plans for a 1.2 GW natural-gas plant with CCS designed specifically to serve data centres.

Increased support in Europe

Europe, meanwhile, is advancing its CCS agenda. The EU’s Net Zero Industry Act requires major oil and gas companies to achieve 50 Mtpa of CO2 injection by 2030, but this goal faces enforcement and planning challenges. Progress is most notable in the North Sea countries.

Norway leads the way with 13 storage licences on its continental shelf and open facilities for international emitters, supporting cross-border supply chains. In 2025, Germany passed a revised Carbon Dioxide Storage and Transport Act, enabling commercial-scale CCS and pipelines, including offshore storage and state opt-in for onshore. Germany also launched a €6 billion Carbon Contract for Difference auction for 2026, which will include CCS for sectors like (m)ethanol, steel and cement.

The UK is also moving forward, with projects like HyNet and Teesside now under construction. The UK government has allocated £21.7 billion ($28 billion) for CCUS; the distribution is still to be clarified. The UK’s approach aims to improve infrastructure utilisation and reduce costs, with a goal of storing 20-30 Mtpa of CO2 by 2035.

Overall, ongoing policy support and projects under development are expected to move the market forward in 2026, but costs remain a challenge.

Current costs are substantial, and opportunities for rapid cost reductions remain constrained

High costs present a greater obstacle to widespread CCS adoption than technical challenges. Many projects currently fall within the $100 to $250 cost range, with ethanol and ammonia at the lower end and cement and steel at the higher end. This makes CCS heavily dependent on government support such as subsidies, carbon pricing, or tax incentives. In turn, lowering costs is critical for creating sustainable business models and ensuring the sector’s long-term viability.

According to DNV, an international technical advisor and assurance provider across the entire CCS value chain, average CCS capex costs could drop by 14% by 2030. By 2050, costs could fall by as much as 40%, mainly due to economies of scale, standardised design, and technological improvements in CO2 capture. Operating costs could also decline gradually as CCS scales, but these advancements are partially offset by rising material and labour costs. However, these benefits mostly apply to new CCS facilities. Retrofitting older plants is more difficult, especially if their remaining operational life is short, limiting the time to recover costs.

Lowering costs comes with political trade-offs

Implementing a cluster-based approach that leverages scale and proximity is key to rapidly reducing CCS costs, as increasing the number of users within each cluster helps prevent underutilised CO2 infrastructure. However, this strategy presents important trade-offs for policymakers.

First, focusing on cost reductions in existing clusters before expanding to new ones may be efficient, but it can slow progress in other regions that also need to cut emissions. The UK illustrates this dilemma; prioritising the rapid expansion of track-1 sites (HyNet and Teesside/Humber) can maximise economies of scale and lower costs, but may delay development in track-2 sites such as Scotland’s Acorn and Northeast England’s Net Zero project.

Second, the direction of industrial policy is crucial, as high energy prices threaten deindustrialisation and can impede CCS uptake, especially in Europe. This risk is heightened for globally competitive sectors like ammonia production (fertilisers) and refineries (fuels and chemical feedstocks), where CCS capture costs are relatively low due to concentrated CO2 streams. Involving more regionally focused industries, such as cement production and waste incineration, could reduce the risk of deindustrialisation, but may lead to higher overall CCS costs.

In 2026, policymakers will need to make more explicit decisions regarding these trade-offs. Without clear guidance, market participants are likely to factor these risks into the pricing of CCS across different clusters and projects.",https://think.ing.com/uploads/hero/_w800h450/shutterstock_2434269893.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 11:40:16.643479

“When Cortés disembarked, he got on his horse and an Official of Magic told him the name of which to recall this place to make it safe. He recommended that he never unmount before renaming places. From then on, each conquered site was quickly renamed with a key-spell coded after a Christian name; an operation that annulled the opposing energy and imprisoned the protective numen of the place between the letters. In this way, they advanced safely through territories incapable of defending themselves. The rite of conquest spread like an infection.”

—Jorge Baradit (2003), “La Conquista Mágica de América” (translated by the authors)

There is great power in how words make worlds. In the magic realism story quoted above, the Spanish conqueror Hernán Cortés appoints the lands of the “New World” with Christian names. Erasing Indigenous names with colonized names is a way of denying the cultures and knowledges of the local inhabitants; it is an act of epistemic violence. In the words of philosopher of colonial art Daniela Bleichma, “The standard European approach of replacing indigenous names [is] a symbolic way of taking possession.”

Renaming geographies and species is a type of colonialism that very often goes unseen. Names do not merely describe territory; they reorganize it. Colonialism does not end with independence, but survives through institutions, development narratives, and scientific language. This occurs specially through acts of naming and classification that erase Indigenous ways of knowing and turn living relationships into colonial categories.

The Scientific Language of Colonialism

The word ‘colonial’ is derived from the Latin “colere,” meaning “to cultivate land.” The word itself thus invokes the idea that non-Western areas and people must be civilized and cultivated.

Language plays an important role. Names create a narrative, a set of “truths” that become the basis of science. For example, many American plants were assigned scientific names based on the European plants they resemble. This was integral to the European domination of global knowledge systems. What we call and know about these plants today is the result.

In the context of colonial conquest, naturalists classified and sorted the natures of colonized territories. Species were stripped from their relations, removed from their soils, climates, and stories, and placed into a “universal” system that claimed neutrality while enforcing hierarchy.

One of the most influential expressions of this impulse was Systema Naturae (1735) by Carl Linnaeus: an attempt to order all known life according to a rationality shaped by White, cis-male, Western epistemologies.

In the dawn of ecology as a field of study, local ecological knowledges from non-Western communities were either dismissed or selectively extracted, recoded, and assimilated into European systems without care for or recognition of their Indigenous origins. Throughout this time, Indigenous ritual practices involving plants were also being censored. Recognizing this history allows us to trace how Eurocentric research has marginalized species, communities, traditional ecological knowledges, and the diversity of ways of knowing and living with the world, what some thinkers call the pluriverse.

Mapunche Kimün (The Knowledge of the People of the Earth)

In the extreme tip of America, our home territory, south of the Biobio River, scattered across vast surfaces of dried land destined for modern agriculture and pines monocultures, you can meet some survivors of the old times: chaotic and colorful patches of native forests that represent a symbol of resistance to Western epistemic colonization. This place is the Wallmapu, where the Mapuche people (“the people of the earth”) have lived since the old times.

The Mapuche word for wood/forest is “mawiza.” Mawiza, though, not only refers to forest. According to anthropologist Wladimir Riquelme Maulén, the word also conceives the integration between trees, soil, air, water, plants, and animals, what is to be considered as the “itrofillmongen,” “the seen and unseen relations between everything that lives” (Manuel Maribur, Indigenous tourism leader, in conversation with the authors).

For the Mapuche, the forest is an essential actor that provides and enables all forms of life. Yet, for decades the Chilean government has been funding the cutting of the forest and the monoplantation of two types of trees: pines and eucalyptus.

The Chilean government values monoculture plantations (uniformly planted, enslaved cellulose bodies—all individuals of the same age and clones of the same tree) above the forest (a multiage, diverse, and resilient community of more-than-humanbeings). This economic vision is a legacy of the European colonial enterprise. Instead of taking the forest as a model for society, as many ancestral cultures have, the factory is taken as a model for the forest. This model is characteristic of the Plantationocene, wherein extractivism restructures life itself into a system of multispecies forced labor.

The Fake Beech

At the heart of the mawiza, ancient woody ancestors grow in silence: Nothofagus. Enduring snow and drought, wind, fire, and heavy rains, they form one of the dominant arboreal presences of the southern tip of the Americas. Their rugged bark, varied leaf forms, and seasonal transformations mark them as a diverse and resilient collective, shaped by deep histories of climate, movement, and relation. Like many more-than-human beings of Chile’s native forests, Nothofagus have endured the brutal processes of ecological, territorial colonization and epistemic violence.

In Chile, these trees are commonly known by many names—roble, ruil, coihue, lenga, ñirre, raulí, hualo, each a different specie. Scientifically, these trees are all subsumed under a single genus: Nothofagus. Coined by Carl Ludwig Blume in 1850, Nothofagus roughly translates to “fake beech” (“nothus” meaning false and “fagus” meaning beech). As Skewes and Guerra describe, “What the Conqueror sees reminds him of the beech (Fagus sylvatica), the true fagus, if you will. What he has before his eyes can only aspire to be a nothofagus, a false beech as denoted by the Latin prefix. It is an image constructed from the outside and by negation.”

Thus Nothofagus were scientifically defined not by what they are (a diverse family of trees native to the Southern Hemisphere), but by what they are not (the beeches of the Northern Hemisphere). The beech of Europe remained the original, the reference point, the “true” form. What stood before the colonizer could only be a negation, a resemblance that failed.

And yet, traditional knowledge persists. Names in the Mapuche language for these trees still move through the southern forests, spoken and remembered. They carry traces of long-standing relationships between humans and trees, relationships that resist taxonomic absence and colonial negation.

Plants from an Indigenous Perspective

Local names do not simply describe plants; they narrate relationships. They encode time, place, and transformation. Nothofagus obliqua, for example, is known among the Mapuche as “koyam.” The tree is called “hualle” when young, its wood yellowish, and “pellín” when mature, its wood red. Here, the stages of a tree’s life matter, just as languages distinguish between children and adults.

The names that local people give to nature are even more interesting when we look at their complex semantics. Nothofagus dombeyi is known as “coigüe.” This word is formed from “ko,” meaning water, and “we,” meaning place. In this case, the name gives information about the place where this tree grows, usually near water.

There are countless other examples. Where Indigenous names reflect local culture and ecology, colonial names are often abstract metaphors or comparisons. The Araucaria araucana, for example, was coined the “monkey puzzle tree” by British observers who remarked that “it would puzzle a monkey to climb it.” In contrast, the Mapuche name, pewen, refers to the tree’s edible seed and to the Pewenche, the people whose livelihoods depend on it.

These so-called “native names” are not neutral descriptors. The category “native” itself belongs to a European tradition of distinguishing local knowledges from “universal” science. Through this distinction, European botanists positioned Indigenous language and classifications as secondary, contextual, or folkloric and its own naming systems as objective and authoritative.

By the late eighteenth century, botanists were using the term “native” as a catch-all category for what they understood as uncultivated or undomesticated life. This usage, of course, was not limited to plants. Indigenous people and cultures were subjected to the same hierarchical classification. Natural history Colonial “encounters”—with both humans and more-than-humans—were not defined simply by the distinction between Old World and New World, but by the geographies of imperial power.

Practicing Decolonial Ecology

After three decades, “colonialism” finally made its way into the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) official vernacular. The IPCC’s sixth assessment report listed colonialism not only as a driver of the climate crisis but also as an ongoing process that is exacerbating climate vulnerability in communities around the world. With the use of this term, we are witnessing scientific institutions finally acknowledging how decolonization must be central in the global response to climate disasters. If we dive deeper into decolonial perspectives, we may find tools to reclaim the ecologies we inhabit on this damaged planet.

Decolonizing the gaze involves listening to multiple forms of knowledge, especially those held by people who live in close relation with plants and other species. It calls for a shift from learning about life to learning with life, embracing the relational knowledge that emerges through thinking with it.

Recognizing the entanglement of the discipline of ecology with colonialism is just the beginning. We must also recognize our own positionality as scientists or researchers within long histories of (ongoing) occupation and colonialism.

In Mary Louise Pratt’s words, “Si estudiamos solamente lo que los europeos vieron y dijeron, no haremos más que reproducir el monopolio del conocimiento y de la interpretación que la empresa imperial pretendía tener.” (“If we study only what Europeans saw and said, we will do nothing more than reproduce the monopoly over knowledge and interpretation that the imperial project sought to impose.”)

Decolonization is not a metaphor, nor a purely theoretical gesture. It is a situated practice of listening, unlearning, and refusing the comfort of universal explanations. Tracing the violence embedded in names such as “false beech,” and re-centering Indigenous names as expressions of living ontologies, can—and must—be extended to countless plants, animals, places, and histories.

Like a forest, decolonization does not reach completion. It grows unevenly and without guarantees. There is no single path forward. Decolonization must be as diverse as the ecosystems that sustain our lives.

Each place and group of beings has a legitimate knowledge that should be considered as part of the pluriverse we inhabit. Scientific institutions homogenize to create “truth.” We firmly believe the contrary: Our approach should be to understand the complexity and diversity of knowledge systems that still exist on this earth.

A Return to the Southern Forest

Here, in Wallmapu, among fragmented patches of mawiza surrounded by monocultures, the so-called “false beeches” bear witness to another order of knowledge, one that does not separate name from body, tree from place, or life from relation. Each time we enter these forests, a deep sense of familiarity arises, an encounter with a being that is neither only a name nor merely wood. The old pellín stands enigmatically, offering its silence and its slow forms of companionship.

To decolonize ecology is not simply to replace one name with another. It is to relearn how to listen to forests that were never silent, to accept forms of knowledge that do not aspire to universality, and to carefully inhabit the discomfort of not fully understanding.

LINCOLN— Attorney General Mike Hilgers announced that Nebraska has joined a West Virginia–led amicus brief filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, supporting the Environmental Protection Agency’s decision to rescind improperly awarded grants under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. The brief urges the court to reverse a district court injunction and allow EPA to carry out its statutory and constitutional duties to ensure responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars.

“The era of federal agencies giving away massive amounts of taxpayer dollars to unvetted and unqualified grant recipients must end,” said Attorney General Hilgers. “The EPA is absolutely correct to claw back these funds, and to help stop the fraud and abuse that has become embedded in many of our federal spending programs.”

The brief explains that Congress required EPA to award Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund grants on a competitive basis and consistent with statutory objectives. According to the states, the Biden-Harris Administration departed from those requirements by funneling enormous sums to poorly vetted recipients under a structure designed to evade oversight, leaving current leadership no lawful choice but to terminate and reassess the grants.

Under EPA’s Zeldin, Pollution Enforcement Dying a Quick Death

Department of Justice Civil Pollution Settlements Plummet to Record Lows

Washington, DC — Civil prosecutions of illegal pollution plummeted to historically low levels during the first year of President Trump’s second administration, according to figures released today by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER), reflecting a sharp decline in Department of Justice (DOJ) action on cases referred by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

The data compiled by PEER shows that DOJ settled just 15 of the cases referred by EPA for civil prosecution in the year since President Trump’s second inauguration. That is far below the 71 concluded during the first full year of the Biden Administration or the 75 concluded during the first full year of President Trump’s first term.

The data also reveals:

DOJ virtually stopped enforcing the Clean Air Act, lodging just one consent decree in a relatively small case since Trump’s inauguration last year, versus 26 in the first year of Trump’s first term, and 22 after Biden’s first year.

Superfund cleanup settlements have also hit rock bottom, with only seven consent decrees lodged in the past year, about a quarter of the totals in the Trump and Biden inaugural years––2017 & 2021, respectively.

DOJ landed four Clean Water Act consent decrees in the first year, a record low under any Administration.

This collapse in enforcement comes as EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin moves forward with plans to stop calculating the public health benefits of rules aimed at reducing air pollution and to make it harder for EPA to enforce environmental laws under a new compliance first policy. Reduced civil enforcement means fewer penalties, fewer cleanups, and fewer deterrents preventing illegal pollution.

“Under Lee Zeldin, anti-pollution enforcement is dying a quick death,” remarked PEER Executive Director Tim Whitehouse, formerly an enforcement attorney at EPA. “Administrator Zeldin is removing all incentives for big polluters to follow the law and turning a blind eye to those who suffer from the impacts of pollution.”

“Enforcing environmental laws ensures that polluters are held accountable and prevented from dumping their pollution on others for profit,” said Joanna Citron Day, PEER General Counsel and a former Senior Counsel at DOJ’s Environmental Enforcement Section. “For the sake of our health and the environment, Congress and the American people need to push back against Lee Zeldin’s dismantling of EPA‘s environmental enforcement program.”

The President's forceful critique of renewable energy initiatives, as well as his departure from the climate consensus that has dominated recent forums, marked a significant shift in transatlantic energy discourse.

When addressing the WEF on 21 January, President Trump wasted no time in outlining his administration's approach to American energy infrastructure.

His announcement that the US would be opening fossil fuel energy plants rather than closing them down represents a challenge to the decarbonisation strategies pursued by many of the world's nations.

Trump framed this move as a matter of economic pragmatism, positioning traditional energy sources as essential to American competitiveness and affordability going forward.

The administration's plans extend beyond merely maintaining existing infrastructure.

The President revealed that his government would be actively removing wind turbines rather than constructing new ones, describing what he termed the ""Green New Scam"" as a misguided consensus that has led countries astray.

This characterisation of renewable energy policy as fundamentally flawed economic thinking set the tone for his broader critique of European energy strategies and aligns with much of his recent criticism of the bloc as a whole.

Trump's criticism of Europe's energy strategy

Trump reserved particular criticism for Germany's energy policies, claiming that electricity prices in Europe's largest economy have risen by 64% since 2017.

Whether these figures fully account for the complexity of European energy markets or the impact of recent geopolitical events remains debatable.

However, the President's message was clear: the pursuit of renewable energy has come at an unacceptable economic cost to consumers and industry alike.

His assessment of wind energy infrastructure across Europe was especially caustic.

Describing windmills as ""losers"", Trump argued that countries with higher concentrations of wind turbines consistently underperform economically.

""One thing I've noticed is that the more windmills a country has, the more money that country loses and the worse that country is doing,"" he said.

The EU's Climate Commissioner, Wopke Hoekstra, responded to these comments shortly after Trump's speech.

“That is unfortunately not completely new and we take indeed a fundamentally different view here,” he told CNBC.

Trump's perspective on nuclear energy

While the US President's stance on wind and solar energy remains unequivocal, his position on nuclear power suggests he is not wholly opposed to the generation of low-carbon power.

At Davos, Trump made clear his support for nuclear energy, a shift that aligns him with an emerging consensus amongst energy analysts who view advanced nuclear technology as essential to achieving reliable, carbon-free baseload power.

This embrace of nuclear power could prove significant for the global energy industry.

As an energy sector tone-setter, support from the US with regards to nuclear energy could help to accelerate investment in small modular reactors and next-generation technologies.

“We do feel that climate change has huge economic ramifications. At the same time, there is a clear opportunity in batteries, in solar, by the way also in nuclear, which is where I agree [with Trump],” Wopke explains.

What are the implications for the global energy market?

While much of President Trump's address was spent criticising the energy policies and strategies of other countries, he closed his remarks with a message of togetherness.

""We're in a position to do things that nobody else has ever even thought of before,"" he said.

""Many of the people in this room are the ones that are doing it and I want to congratulate you. I'm with you all the way – you can do things that nobody else can even think about.""

Despite these concluding statements, Trump's speech appears to set the US at odds with many of the world's countries, raising questions about the future of international climate cooperation and the economic consequences of pursuing different energy pathways.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/8cf2cfbfe08911f0b74b6369deefca6a:e7e02c55ee3f776804b6c72023390ed2/us-president-donald-trump-addressed-the-world-economic-forum-on-21-january-2026.jpg.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 10:39:59.448247

""Nobody wants that in their backyard,"" Northern Virginia is home to 668 data centers, according to the Data Center Map.

The main difference between a data center and an AI data center are the use of Graphics Processing Units, or GPUs.
Typical data centers need a computer's “brain,” the Central Processing Unit, or CPU, to operate while AI data centers need a computer’s “soul,” the GPU.","In Port Washington, Wisconsin, swaths of flat agricultural land and the Great Lakes sandwich the homes of its nearly 13,000 residents.

The historic fishing village just north of Milwaukee calls itself a small-town getaway offering “a touch of New England charm combined with Midwestern friendliness.”

Brick buildings of homes and small businesses line the wide streets that lead to the shores of Lake Michigan and a historic lighthouse.

The city celebrates the community's nautical heritage year round with events ranging from the annual Polar Bear Plunge on New Year's Day, when hundreds of people charge into Lake Michigan amid freezing temps, to the decades-old Port Fish Day, which is one of the largest community fundraisers and events of the year.

Just outside the city are parcels of dirt plots and lush, green agricultural fields growing soybeans and grains.

Roughly 2.5 million square feet, or about 43 American football fields, will soon be home to a multibillion-dollar data center “Lighthouse” campus as part of OpenAI’s Stargate project — a facility that runs artificial intelligence ChatGPT. It will join the more than 4,000 other data centers sprawled across the U.S.

The data center, already approved and expected to complete construction in 2028, caused a stir nationwide.

Charlie Berens — a comedian and influencer with a combined 10 million followers across his Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and Facebook accounts — recently began using his platform and popularity to speak out against the data centers in his backyard.

“I was pissed that people's voices were being ignored,"" he said. ""These are my neighbors. People deserve a voice.”

The Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, native made multiple videos on the topic, ranging from encouraging folks to show up to meetings about the data center to updating his audience after council passed it.

He used his Emmy-winning journalism research skills and comedic bite to deliver the hard news in videos that amassed hundreds of thousands of likes and millions of views.

“It's just a slap in the face, with all the AI stuff,” he said. “Anytime you use any kind of social media thing or any app, you're the product. So, we're like the lobster in the tank at Red Lobster.”

Other voices echo his frustration. People showed up at city meetings and events in protest. Port Washington city councils, commissions and boards unanimously approved the project despite the outcry.

In fact, so many people showed up to council meetings, the city had to move to a hotel conference center, something Mayor Ted Neitzke IV said was caused by “social media influencers mobilizing individuals from inside and outside our community.” Multiple people have been arrested during meetings as concerns continued to grow.

This isn’t something just happening in this small midwestern community. It’s happening nationwide. Take Abilene, Texas; Southaven, Mississippi; and Boardman, Oregon, for example.

Each rural area is being eyed by tech giants to build their next set of data centers.

Municipal councils like that of Port Washington argue data centers will boost the economy by increasing the tax base, increasing construction, allowing farmers to willingly sell their land and providing job and education opportunities.

But as AI and tech ambitions grow, so do concerns about their impact on the world. It leaves people asking how they’re going to make room in their established infrastructures — such as water, power, and land — for new technologies.

Residents aren’t the only ones asking questions.

In the 1970s, members of Congress established the Environmental and Energy Study Institute. The independent nonprofit was designed with a goal to provide science-based educational resources to policymakers and the public. Its founding was the result of emerging concerns about global and energy problems.

“(AI) is a topic everyone wants to talk about, but no one seems to know what exactly to talk about,” EESI President Daniel Bresette said. “It involves a little bit of innovation, a little bit of competition with China, a little bit of ‘shiny new object’ syndrome.”

He said there’s a lot of bipartisan interest on Capitol Hill because “it hits on so many different issues that you can't really find anyone who doesn't really, really want to talk about it.”

Berens said he speaks up about data centers because they aren’t just taking away community voices.

“You take our data and now you want our land, you want our water, you want our air,” he said. “None of it makes sense, and I just want people to be aware that this is happening.”

Data centers holding intangible data need a physical place to live.

A hurry to build: Data centers take up lots of land.

The haste in which data centers are developed concern people like Berens and leave them with more questions like “What's the rush? Why not wait a little bit?”

“In many ways, it’s an arms race: firms are building aggressively today to avoid being bottlenecked tomorrow as AI, cloud services, and digital workloads continue to scale at unprecedented speed,” wrote ChatGPT, the most popular free AI chatbot available, when asked Berens’ question.

OpenAI’s ChatGPT launched in 2022 and paved the way for what we see today — tech giants fighting to dominate the new field.

Hundreds of data centers have been proposed in 2025, bolstered by the Trump administration incentivizing companies to build on and invest in American property. From small communities like Port Washington to the heart of Silicon Valley in San Jose, California.

The global average size of data centers equals roughly 1.74 American football fields, including endzones. That's roughly 100,000 square feet, according to the Institutional Real Estate, Inc.

But hyperscale centers are massive.

The proposed location in San Jose plans for 1.7 million square feet of data centers across four two-story buildings. That’s the equivalent of about 30 football fields or six Costco Wholesale stores.

In Lyon Township, Michigan, citizens experienced something similar to those in Port Washington on the other side of the lake. The township's planning commission conditionally approved the planned data center consisting of six buildings on more than 1.8 million square feet in September.

Kimberly Killian, who will soon live some 300-feet away from the new building, told WXYZ she was ""extremely upset"" about the plan.

""I'm heartbroken,"" she said. ""Nobody wants that in their backyard,""

Northern Virginia is home to 668 data centers, according to the Data Center Map. It’s the largest data center hub in the U.S. and where “data center alley” sits.

Data centers aggregate here because it’s close to policy makers in Washington D.C., has tax incentives, cheap power, and because of the region’s “world class” fiber optic network, Virginia Tech associate professor Landon Marston said in a July podcast.

Dominion Energy spokesperson Aaron Ruby compared Northern Virginia and its data centers to other industry hubs like automotive in Detroit, aerospace in Texas or Silicon Valley in California.

Companies find themselves buying up industrial or agricultural zoned land to build their centers on.

Raymond Suarez, 60, lives in Florida and fears data centers will be built on land that should be preserved or used for other things like farming, according to a poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.

His concerns are already taking place. In central Ohio, 130 data centers are battling farmers for land and water.

“We are literally taking the nation’s breadbasket, where it’s most productive (and) most advantageous to farm, and turning it over for industrial use,” Bryn Bird, a Licking County resident and president of Ohio Farmers Union, which represents more than 2,500 family farms, told the Associated Press.

So, what do data centers do?

Home to the ""cloud"": Even intangible data needs a physical home.

Data centers are where “the cloud” lives.

AI and online data is no longer an abstract idea. It is ingrained into communities as a physical object and companies pour billions of dollars to expand.

Data centers are physical buildings, either a singular structure or a cluster of buildings called a campus. They house servers, networking gear, storage, power and cooling systems, and security infrastructure.

Buildings store and process data and route and deliver information. They are quite literally the backbone and brain of the internet, which is why there are such detrimental issues when they fail.

Inside data centers are “row upon row upon row of machines all working together” to provide services, an employee in a Google Workspace tour of the company's South Carolina data center said.

Data centers hold all information gathered, submitted, and created on the internet. Every ""like,"" post, password, profile picture, etc., is stored here. While they have been around since the start of the internet, AI data centers are changing the internet and landscape — literally.

Companies strategically build data centers across the world to make sure everyone can use the internet with decent speeds. Many are located in Northern Virginia, but some of the largest centers in the world are scattered throughout the U.S. in places like Sparks, Nevada; Memphis, Tennessee; and Atlanta, Georgia.

The U.S. overwhelmingly has the most data centers, with more than 4,000 on domestic soil. The United Kingdom falls in second place with 499, according to Statista.

The closer a user is to a data center, the more quickly they’re able to access the internet because distance increases latency, or delay.

The main difference between a data center and an AI data center are the use of Graphics Processing Units, or GPUs.

Typical data centers need a computer's “brain,” the Central Processing Unit, or CPU, to operate while AI data centers need a computer’s “soul,” the GPU.

CPUs can operate without GPUs, but GPUs must have CPUs to function. And they take a lot energy to run.

Energy demand and prices: Do AI data centers increase energy costs?

Alex S. uses multiple AI tools on a daily basis for work. She is among nearly 800 million others who use ChatGPT weekly, according to a National Bureau of Economic Research study.

She uses half a dozen AI tools in her work to build custom AI solutions for companies using the new technology, and ships and delivers generative AI to them. ChatGPT is the main tool she uses as a “pretty central part” of her workflow.

She estimates sending 15 to 20 or more prompts or questions a day, ranging in tasks from transcribing her out loud brainstorming sessions to summarizing her Slack threads or taking notes during meetings.

OpenAI estimated one average query, defined by ChatGPT as a user sending between five and eight messages when asked for clarification, uses roughly 0.0034 kilowatt-hours of electricity. A typical 700-watt household blender uses about the same amount of electricity to run for 15 seconds.

It may seem like a small amount, but when combined with the estimated 18 billion queries sent to ChatGPT on a weekly basis, power use grows exponentially.

Dominion Energy, an electric services company serving 20 states along the east coast and south, supplies power to roughly 450 data centers, according to Ruby. This makes Dominion the world's biggest data center-serving electric utility.

“Virginia, particularly Northern Virginia, is the largest data center market in the world and it has been for decades now,” he said. “It's the birthplace of the internet.”

Ruby said all the data centers within Dominion’s service area combined use the same amount of energy as about a million homes.

“One single data center, give or take, might use the same amount of power as 25,000 homes,” he said.

Data centers are plugged into the grid or getting their power from an energy supplier like Dominion.

It causes concern about energy consumption, but EESI worries about the already complicated transmission of energy and dated infrastructure that is rapidly being forced to accommodate data centers.

Ruby said this isn’t a concern if energy suppliers are doing their job right.

“It's our job to make sure there’s always enough reliable power to serve our customers when they want to use it,” he said.

Ruby highlighted how they also have many large customers like military bases, schools and hospitals among millions of residents and hundreds of data centers in their service territory.

Energy demand was relatively stagnant for a few decades, but is forecast to more than double by 2045.

This is due in large part to “the digitization of the economy served by data centers and electrification of energy needs,” according to Dominion Energy’s updated Integrated Resource Plan.

These are historic levels of growth and have spread across the country into states like Oregon, Iowa and Wyoming, which are seeing energy use by data centers in the double digits.

Energy costs are increasing along with this new demand. Millions of people in 41 states across the country are seeing energy costs increase, according to a Center for American Progress study.

The energy-hungry data centers aren't solely to blame. Other causes include increased use of electric vehicles and appliances and massive rollbacks of green energy tax breaks from the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act. Also to blame: price increases for natural gas, which generates more than 40% of U.S. electricity, as President Donald Trump’s tariffs make exports to international customers grow more expensive.

The changes are already impacting people across the country, like 58-year-old Kevin Halsey of Normal, Illinois.

He told the Associated Press his monthly electricity bill used to be $90 in the summer because he had solar panels. That bill has risen to roughly $300.

“I’ve got to be pessimistic,” he told AP. “I don’t see this as getting better.”

The U.S. Energy Information Administration found that the average price of electricity in America has increased 13% since 2022. The EIA said retail electricity prices have increased faster than the rate of inflation since 2022 and are expected to continue on this trajectory until 2026.

“People want a more affordable Virginia, and they have every right to demand it,"" Virginia Lt. Gov. Ghazala Hashmi said in an energy regulation meeting. ""Over the past few years, Virginians have felt the sting of rising costs everywhere.”

Studies credit the higher costs not only to increased use but also to transmission and distribution, infrastructure upgrades, and new lines to meet new demand.

A Lawrence Berkeley study found that more customers equals more people to pay for these costs, yet the need for new infrastructure and power sources to run data centers will “likely increase system costs for all customers,” according to the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission.

There’s another aspect to data centers that's been less of the focus: emissions and air-quality impacts.

Air pollution: Gas powered generators, energy dirty the air.

There are many data centers across the U.S. that are low emission and run on clean energy, but a 2024 study found roughly 56% of the electricity used to power data centers comes from fossil fuels.

Fossil fuels, oil, natural gas and coal are derived from fossilized plant and animal remnants from millions of years ago, according to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.

An EESI fact sheet says fossil fuels result in “significant climate, environmental, and health costs that are not reflected in market prices” due to their CO2e emissions. Greenhouse gases can trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere, which in turn contributes to climate change — defined by the United Nations as long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns.

They also impact local air quality and health.

University of California at Riverside and Caltech found the public health burden is a hidden toll of AI data centers.

“If you look at those sustainability reports by tech companies, they only focus on carbon emissions, and some of them include water as well, but there's absolutely no mention of unhealthful air pollutants, and these pollutants are already creating a public health burden,” Shaolei Ren, a corresponding author of the study, said in a statement.

Take xAI’s Memphis, Tennessee data center “Colossus,” for example. It’s the supercomputer that powers Elon Musk’s X, formerly Twitter, AI chatbot Grok.

The data center, which was built in just 122 days, partially uses gas-powered turbines to keep its systems operational. Gas generators are cleaner than their diesel counterparts, but because centers operate around the clock, they create mass emissions.

The Southern Environmental Law Center accuses xAI of violating the federal Clean Air Act by using unpermitted methane gas turbines without public notice, permits or pollution control.

When asked for comment about the Colossus data center and future plans, xAI responded with an automated email reading “Legacy Media Lies.”

The UC Riverside study found generating the electricity needed to train OpenAI's ChatGPT-4 model. ChatGPT is now in model GPT-5, OpenAI’s self described “smartest, fastest, most useful model yet."" It produced an air pollution equivalent of more than 10,000 round trips by car from Los Angeles to New York City.

The Memphis Community Against Pollution, an environmental justice organization based in Memphis, works to combat and prevent environmental racism.

“What’s happening in Memphis is a human rights violation,” KeShaun Pearson, executive director of the organization, told Democracy Now in April. “Elon Musk and xAI are violating our human right to clean air and a clean, healthy environment.”

Colossus isn’t the only data center using gas powered generators for their electricity. OpenAI’s Stargate project in the old railroad community of Abilene, Texas, also uses them to partially power the campus.

“We’re burning gas to run this data center,” Altman told the Associated Press in September but added he hopes it will rely on other power sources in the future.

Other campuses, like Microsoft’s $3.3 billion data center Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, get permission for backup gas-generators meant to keep the facilities, which are online 24/7, running in the case of a power outage.

Amanda Garcia, a senior attorney at SELC, said air pollution issues often go underreported because data center impacts on water and energy take more public attention. No one thinks they will run out of clean air.

“The air impacts have been less of a focus because, a lot of times, the air quality isn’t happening in the same area where the data center is,” she said. “It’s being built in a different community, but it is happening and is impacting the people living around those centers.”

The Environmental Protection Agency officially created new rules for data centers' power generators Jan. 16, 2026, specifying that they must comply with Clean Air Act regulations.

The EPA's new policies state the temporary or portable large power generators, specifically gas turbines, cannot produce air pollutant emissions exceeding the levels mandated by the federal Clean Air Act. Permitting for the turbines would also fall under federal law, rather than local or state guidelines.

Previous guidance listed these power generators exempt from Clean Air Act standards because they were generally used in short-term or emergent situations before the proliferation of AI data centers. Those large power generators will now be required to meet Clean Air Act standards, while medium and small turbines will have new exemptions.

""We expect local health leaders to take swift action to ensure they are following federal law and to better protect neighbors from harmful air pollution,"" Garcia said in an SPLC press release.

Poor air quality can also directly impact water quality. But while the quality of water isn't the focus around data centers, the sheer volume of water they use is notable.

Water use: Cooling needs and a depleting resource

There is no publicly available data measuring how much water ChatGPT uses on a daily basis because OpenAI does not release the information.

Some research estimates the AI “chugs a bottle of water” for each search. OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman said a query uses roughly one-fifteenth of a teaspoon of water.

Why does this matter?

Electronic devices can overheat, which can cause problems, so they need to stay cool to work properly.

Think of when your phone heats up and slows down when it’s charging and you’re watching a video, your gaming console getting slower when you run graphics too high, or your laptop not working as well when you use it on your bed instead of a desk.

Many devices use air as a coolant — think internal fans that make a laptop sound like a plane is taking off — but electronics running more intense programs typically use water to combat overheating.

Large centers can consume up to 5 million gallons of water a day, according to EESI. That equals roughly the daily demand for a community of 50,000 people.

That doesn't account for the impacts on agriculture, which also needs water and electricity.

“Don’t forget that it is also required for us to grow food,” Gerard Lim, CEO of vertical farming startup Agroz, said at a November Fortune Innovation Forum in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

AI data centers are never off. They’re always running, always generating, always learning and always using water to cool down. Some data centers use recycled wastewater. Others use fresh water, which is typically used for human consumption and use.

How does one measure this use in a way that makes sense?

Should the indirect use of water in making computer chips be included in counting water use? What about the water used to lay concrete the data centers sit atop? Or perhaps the water used in hydropower plants to generate nearly 6% of the U.S.’s electricity supply that could be powering data centers, too?

Cooling systems are kept trade secret for the most part, making it difficult if not impossible to gauge how much water is being used up completely. The Lighthouse campus will feature a “closed-loop chilled water system” and be “near zero,” thanks to the “latest cooling designs,” Vantage said on its website. But no one outside those companies really knows what this means.

Humans use a lot of water, from raising cows for hamburgers to watering crops to feed said cows or even showering and having internal plumbing, and there isn't always going to be enough to go around.

Even in the face of these worries and future unknowns, not all that comes out of AI is bad.

Benefits of AI: It's not all gloom.

Data centers impact water, air and energy. They also impact how first responders do their jobs, as well as public accessibility and climate change — but perhaps not in the way you may be thinking.

CAL FIRE uses AI elements with the help of cameras managed by Alert California at University of California San Diego. The systems involve around 1,144 cameras in a public-private partnership that scan the horizon every two minutes for “anomalies,” like fire or smoke.

David Acuña, CAL FIRE Battalion chief and spokesperson, said this AI has been helpful for firefighters responding to California’s infamous fires, but it took some time to get there.

“It has improved over time,"" he explained. ""When it started, it would ping a fire multiple times a day, and we’d be like, ‘You’re right, that is a fire. It's called the sun.’ So it had to learn to ignore that.""

The AI scans the horizon for a glow, fire or smoke, then pings a captain in the emergency command center to confirm what it’s ""seeing."" The captain will then make the decision whether to mobilize crews. The decision to use resources is made by humans, not the AI.

Acuña said this AI can detect fires, especially at night, around the size of a quarter-acre, or two NBA basketball courts side by side. The AI can do it before a 911 caller spots and reports the fire. This is particularly helpful in the foothills, where fires can burn undetected for hours before growing large enough for someone to spot them and call it in.

CAL FIRE launched a new AI chatbot that searches the information within official websites and comes up with an answer to questions. The chatbot, “Ask CAL FIRE,” also gives officials a look at what people are searching for and provides the most up-to-date answers for those looking.

The chatbot is available in 70 languages, and CAL FIRE is improving it constantly, Acuña said.

“Our goal is to make sure people have the best information to make decisions for themselves and their families,” he said.

Cities across the country are also turning to AI in cameras to improve road safety. Mounted cameras are tracking potholes in California, inspecting guardrails, road signs and pavement markings in Hawaii and building annual road congestion reports.

EESI said the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Laboratories AI supports innovations in crucial disaster forecasting, preparedness and risk mitigation. The National Cancer Institute says AI helps cancer research and detection.

The United Nations uses AI to track pollution and minimize environmental impact while maximizing efficiency.

Yes, artificial intelligence is being used to combat climate change.

“AI is a tool, right? If you take a hammer, someone can misuse a hammer and harm another person, but someone can also take a hammer and build a house,” Acuña said. “It just depends on how it’s used.”

What's next?: Investing, expanding and planning.

There's an emerging trend referred to as “AI shame,"" in which people are embarrassed to admit they use AI, even if they do so frequently.

A study by WalkMe, surveyed 1,000 U.S. workers and 48.8% admit to hiding their use of AI at work to avoid judgment.

Alex doesn't hide her use, per se, but she said she uses the programs more than she wants to.

“It’s like using a packaged salad kit instead of making it from scratch,” she said. “It feels a little less good and kinda like cheating.”

She feels her industry moves too quickly for her to produce things from scratch, even if that’s something she would much prefer to do.

Despite this, the Trump administration and tech giants are pushing AI into social media apps, basic communication, and every aspect of the internet. Trump’s administration said the U.S. should be a “global leader” in AI and views the new technology as the means to “promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness and national security.”

Meanwhile, big tech companies are dumping billions of dollars into this infrastructure while promising to find ways to minimize concerns on the environment. In January, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella took to the World Economic Forum to urge users embrace AI instead of shun it away.

""We will quickly lose even the social permission to take something like energy, which is a scarce resource, and use it to generate these tokens, if these tokens are not improving health outcomes, education outcomes, public sector efficiency, private sector competitiveness, across all sectors, small and large, right?"" he said. ""And that, to me, is ultimately the goal.""

These companies are still developing new ways to use AI and integrate it into daily life outside work.

Altman admitted to Jimmy Fallon on ""The Tonight Show"" that he uses his company’s AI for a very personal reason: helping raise he and his husband’s 8-month-old child.

“The idea is like a general-purpose, sort of, life adviser,” he said. “I cannot imagine having gone through figuring out how to raise a newborn without ChatGPT.”

In 2025, a new administration took over the executive branch of the government, and a new Congress was sworn in; their policy changes have impacted almost everyone.

Fuel cell manufacturing requires entirely different processes and supplier relationships.","When the final fuel cell system rolls off the line at Fuel Cell System Manufacturing LLC's Brownstown, Michigan facility later this year, it will mark more than the closure of an $85 million joint venture. It will represent a rare admission from two automotive giants that even technological excellence cannot overcome weak demand.

Honda and General Motors established FCSM in January 2017 as the automotive industry's first dedicated fuel cell production partnership. The facility began manufacturing operations in January 2024, supplying Honda's CR-V e:FCEV and underpinning both partners' hydrogen strategies. Production will cease before the end of 2026.

The decision comes after what Honda described as ""extensive discussions"" between the partners about the venture's continuation. Honda will pivot to an independently developed next-generation fuel cell system, whilst General Motors' withdrawal from the collaboration follows the American manufacturer's October 2025 announcement that it would shutter its entire hydrogen fuel cell development programme to concentrate resources on battery-electric vehicle technology.

The broader context is striking. General Motors stated at the time it aimed to focus capital as well as R&D on ""batteries, charging technology and EVs, which have clear market traction, rather than on hydrogen, which has yet to fulfil its potential."" That assessment reflects what manufacturers across the industry are discovering through hard experience rather than theoretical projections.

A recalibration presented as strategy

The joint venture delivered meaningful technical gains. According to Honda, the collaboration produced fuel cell systems with improved durability, enhanced cold-weather performance, better production efficiency and reduced costs through shared supplier relationships. The CR-V e:FCEV, powered by FCSM's technology, entered limited production in 2024 as one of the few fuel cell passenger vehicles available in the United States market.

Yet technical achievement proved insufficient. Honda has struggled with weak fuel cell vehicle sales across markets. The company postponed commercial operations at its planned fuel cell manufacturing facility in Tochigi, Japan, and reduced projected output capacity. Honda attributed these setbacks to slower-than-expected development of global hydrogen markets and delays in hydrogen supply infrastructure projects across Japan, the United States and Europe.

The pattern extends beyond Honda's direct operations. General Motors invested $85 million in the Michigan joint venture, whilst Honda's overall hydrogen programme has included decades of research dating back to the original FCX. The company has positioned hydrogen alongside electricity as a core energy carrier in its drive towards carbon neutrality by 2050. Despite this commitment, market absorption has not materialised at the pace required to justify the manufacturing capacity being built.

EV transition slowdown and domestic politics challenge the US Big Three in new and unexpected ways

US automakers face a tangled web of tariffs, union issues, and a slowing EV market. The threat of Chinese competition looms large, while the IRA’s complex rules create new challenges. Ford, GM, and Stellantis are each fighting to navigate these obstacles.

Manufacturing implications extend beyond two companies

The closure carries consequences that stretch well beyond Honda and General Motors' balance sheets. FCSM represented a model for risk-sharing in emerging technologies. By pooling expertise in fuel cell stack design, manufacturing processes and procurement, the partners aimed to achieve economies of scale that neither could justify independently. That model is now proven inadequate when demand fails to develop.

The automotive manufacturing sector finds itself navigating an exceptionally complex transition. Battery-electric vehicles face their own challenges. General Motors recently recorded a $6 billion charge as it scaled back EV production, idled battery plants and settled supplier contracts amid weakening demand and policy shifts. The OEM halted operations at its two Ultium Cells facilities in Warren, Ohio and Spring Hill, Tennessee for a six-month period beginning in January 2026, placing 1,550 workers on temporary layoff.

Ford Motor disclosed approximately $19.5 billion in special charges related to restructuring and pullbacks in its all-electric vehicle investments. These figures reflect fundamental mismatches between installed manufacturing capacity and actual market absorption across battery-electric platforms.

Yet manufacturers cannot simply abandon electrification. Regulatory frameworks in Europe, California and elsewhere mandate reductions in fleet emissions. The retreat from fuel cells and the scaling back of battery-electric production represent not strategic choices so much as forced recalibrations in response to consumer behaviour that has defied industry forecasts.

Honda's pivot to independent fuel cell development suggests the Japanese manufacturer retains conviction in hydrogen's long-term viability, even as it adjusts near-term manufacturing commitments. The company stated it will ""continue to leverage next-generation fuel cell system technologies developed independently by Honda and strive to further expand business opportunities in order to grow its hydrogen business as one of the new core businesses of Honda.""

Geopolitics and shifting investment plans reshape 2026 automotive strategy

As 2026 begins the automotive industry faces intensifying pressures from geopolitics, tariffs and cost constraints with investment priorities are being reset and flexibility becoming critical

This language warrants scrutiny. Honda has invested more than three decades in hydrogen research. The decision to develop next-generation systems independently rather than through continued partnership with General Motors implies either that Honda believes it can achieve cost reductions General Motors considered unattainable, or that the Japanese manufacturer calculates that hydrogen applications in commercial vehicles, stationary power and industrial equipment will develop faster than passenger vehicle markets.

The broader electrification reckoning

The automotive manufacturing landscape in 2026 presents a stark divergence between policy ambitions and market realities. Governments have mandated electrification timelines. Manufacturers have committed tens of billions of dollars to battery and fuel cell production capacity. Yet consumer adoption has not followed projected trajectories.

The reasons are well documented. Battery-electric vehicles remain more expensive than internal combustion equivalents in most segments. Charging infrastructure, whilst expanding, has not achieved the ubiquity required to eliminate range anxiety for mass-market buyers. Fuel cell vehicles face even steeper hurdles. Hydrogen refuelling infrastructure is sparse outside California and a handful of other markets. Vehicle choices are extremely limited. The technology carries a cost premium that even emissions-conscious buyers find difficult to justify.

What distinguishes the current moment is manufacturers' willingness to acknowledge these constraints publicly. General Motors' Mary Barra stated it is ""too early to tell"" what true demand for EVs will be following the end of federal incentives. She suggested the industry will likely find its natural demand level over the next six months. Ford's Jim Farley told analysts the company evaluated the market and made the call to follow customers to where the market is, ""not where people thought it was going to be.""

This represents a significant shift in tone from the euphoric pronouncements about electrification that characterised industry communications in the early 2020s. Multiple executives have now acknowledged that policies, not consumer preferences, were driving the charge for EVs. The rollback of incentive programmes and regulatory delays have exposed this dynamic.

Hongqi moves solid-state batteries from lab to trial production

Hongqi has produced its first all-solid-state battery packs in a controlled manufacturing environment, marking a shift from experimental development to industrial validation.

Manufacturing strategy in an age of uncertainty

The closure of Honda and General Motors' fuel cell venture crystallises the challenge facing automotive manufacturers. They must invest in technologies before market demand is proven, because regulatory requirements and competitive dynamics leave no alternative. Yet the capital intensity of modern powertrain development means that misallocated investments carry severe consequences.

Honda's decision to continue fuel cell development independently whilst General Motors exits entirely illustrates how different manufacturers are drawing different conclusions from the same market data. This divergence will shape competitive dynamics for the remainder of the decade.

Some manufacturers are hedging through hybrid technologies. Hyundai allocated production at its new $7.6 billion plant in Georgia for both Hyundai and Kia vehicles, with heavy emphasis on hybrid powertrains alongside battery-electric models. This approach provides flexibility as market preferences evolve.

Others are doubling down on specific technologies. Tesla continues to focus exclusively on battery-electric vehicles, betting that cost reductions and improved charging infrastructure will eventually overcome adoption barriers. Chinese manufacturers are expanding range-extended electric vehicle (EREV) platforms that combine battery power with small internal combustion engines, particularly in SUV and commercial vehicle segments.

The lack of consensus among manufacturers about which powertrain technologies will dominate in the 2030s means production planning has become extraordinarily difficult. Plants designed for internal combustion engines cannot easily be retooled for battery-electric production. Fuel cell manufacturing requires entirely different processes and supplier relationships. Each choice commits billions of dollars to a particular technology trajectory at a time when the destination remains unclear.

Digitalisation - Smarter automation

Providing a reality check on smart factory tech - what’s truly delivering on the shopfloor and where automation is finally paying off.

What Honda and General Motors' announcement makes plain is that first-mover advantages in emerging technologies provide little protection when the market fails to develop as anticipated. The companies combined deep expertise in fuel cell development and manufacturing. They achieved the technical objectives they set. They created a production facility capable of delivering fuel cell systems at scale. None of this prevented the venture's closure when consumer demand did not materialise.

The path forward for automotive manufacturing strategy involves fewer grand pronouncements about revolutionary transformations and more attention to the messy realities of consumer behaviour, infrastructure development and the true costs of transitioning to new powertrains. Honda's continued investment in fuel cell technology alongside its battery-electric programmes represents a bet that hydrogen will find viable applications, even if passenger vehicles are not the primary market. General Motors' focus on batteries and charging infrastructure reflects a different calculation about where capital should be deployed.

Both approaches carry substantial risks. What is becoming clear is that manufacturers who maintain flexibility across multiple powertrain options whilst carefully managing capital commitments are best positioned to navigate the transition, however it unfolds. The closure of a state-of-the-art fuel cell production facility after less than three years of operation provides a sobering reminder that technological capability alone guarantees nothing when market demand remains elusive.",https://image.automotivemanufacturingsolutions.com/2591288.jpg?imageId=2591288&x=0&y=0&cropw=100&croph=100&panox=0&panoy=0&panow=100&panoh=100&width=1200&height=683,N,,2026-01-22 10:59:08.651542

25%: Welcome Back To Production Hell, Tesla

Photo by: InsideEVs

In an X post, Tesla's CEO tempered expectations for a quick rollout of the company's two most important products: the Cybercab robotaxi and Optimus humanoid robot. Early production will be, in his words, ""agonizingly slow.""

He explained that the enemies of speed are complexity and novelty. And given that both Cybercab (as long as it can still be called that) and Optimus are all-new machines with new parts, processes and assembly steps, a slow ramp is to be expected. The Cybercab, for example, is supposed to use Tesla's new ""unboxed"" manufacturing process.

""The speed of the production ramp is inversely proportionate to how many new parts and steps there are,"" Musk said in the post.

The CEO has said time and time again that both products are essential to the success of Tesla. The Cybercab is seen as Tesla's path to solving the world's transportation problems (once it can actually solve autonomous driving) and the Optimus robot is billed as essentially an infinite money glitch for Tesla.

Musk has alluded many times to the ""production hell"" period of ramping up Model 3 production, when he slept on the factory floor and when the company nearly went under. Now Tesla is on the brink of another challenging ramp.

What makes this moment particularly tense is that Tesla's valuation is already tied to the success of both products. Investors have already pumped a significant amount of cash into the stock with the expectation that Tesla will succeed in bringing both to market. Reuters explains:

Much of Tesla's $1.39 trillion valuation hinges on investor expectations for its self-driving technology and humanoid robots, even as the company's core revenue and profit continue to come from electric vehicle sales.

The EV maker has said it was on track to start volume production of Cybercab in 2026, with Optimus output ""hopefully"" starting towards the end of the year.

Musk has described the humanoid robot project as central to Tesla's long-term strategy, saying it could eventually dwarf its vehicle business. He has argued the robots could unlock massive new economic value by taking on a wide range of tasks that humans are unwilling to perform.

The ""agonizing"" part won't last forever. Eventually, Musk said, Tesla will be able to churn out robots and robotaxis ""insanely fast."" When exactly that will happen is the question lots of investors are asking right now.

50%: Congress Wants EV Charger Money Back

Photo by: ElectricFish

Remember when America was talking about blanketing its highways from coast to coast with federally funded EV fast chargers? Congress has apparently remembered something else—that the money earmarked for those projects is, in fact, money, and can be redirected toward different priorities.

The Hill covers the specifics of the funding bill:

The bill in question, released Tuesday, would fund the departments of Homeland Security, Defense, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, Labor, Education and other related agencies.

It seeks to claw back $879 million that passed as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021 as part of an effort to fund a nationwide EV charging network. The law originally included billions in funding for the network.

Federal funding for EV chargers has been a problem for recipients since it was originally frozen by the current administration in February 2025. A court eventually reversed the decision, and the program has slowly gotten back on track. Climate advocates slammed the move to cut funding.

""We urge Members of Congress to leave this funding alone,"" Sierra Club Clean Transportation for All Director Katherine García said in a statement. ""States must be able to access the full amount they were promised and are relying on as they work to build essential infrastructure in our communities.”

75%: Volkswagen Won't Give Up Challenging Scout's Direct-Sales Push

Photo by: Scout Motors

Scout Motors, the new Volkswagen Group brand gearing up to sell electric and range-extended SUVs and trucks in the U.S., is facing yet another lawsuit from dealers who take issue with its plans to sell direct-to-consumer.

This time, the fight is in Colorado, where a group comprised of more than one-third of the Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche dealers in the state have unsheathed their litigious pens to take on the manufacturer before even a single production vehicle rolled off the line. But—and here's the weird part—the dealers aren't suing Scout this time.

They're suing the state for, they allege, unlawfully granting Scout a license to sell direct-to-consumer in December.

Automotive News has the scoop on the suit:

The lawsuit, submitted Jan. 20 in Denver District Court alleges that the state’s Department of Revenue Division of Motor Vehicles incorrectly interpreted Colorado law when it found that Scout is a manufacturer of only electric vehicles and downplayed Volkswagen Group’s financial backing of the brand.

The dealers argue that Scout and its parent company, the VW Group, are one and the same. That would mean that VW is essentially competing with its own franchised dealers, and that's not legal under dealer laws.

But here's the fascinating part. Scout's decision to sell extended-range EVs—electric vehicles with gas-powered generators that feed the battery—is also at the center of the lawsuit. According to Automotive News: ""The lawsuit refers to Scout’s extended-range system as a plug-in hybrid system and therefore claims that the brand does not qualify for exceptions in Colorado law which are meant for EV-only brands such as Rivian and Lucid.""

Direct-to-consumer sales might be the future, but the present is full of dealerships fighting as hard as they can to maintain control. If the lawsuit succeeds, Scout's new dealer license could be invalidated—but so far, the young company has managed to avoid a negative outcome.

Its Terra pickup and Traveler SUV are set to go into production in 2027 at a new factory in South Carolina.

How did EPA justify this rulemaking, and what does RFF analysis have to say about the EPA analysis?
As such, EPA’s analysis is not a benefit-cost analysis, but rather a cost analysis.","By now, everyone involved in US environmental policy is familiar with the sweeping regulatory changes the Trump administration has proposed in its first year. Relevant federal agencies from across the executive branch have proposed new rules (and, in some cases, tweaked, revised, and fully repealed existing rules), with executive actions on climate policy receiving special scrutiny. Core agencies such as the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the US Department of Energy (DOE) have fundamentally changed the interpretation of long-standing rules and precedents that established decarbonization programs and standards. Along with reconsidering legal precedent, the agencies also have put forth new and questionable interpretations of scholarship, including the work of Resources for the Future (RFF) researchers.

Our scholars have been swift to respond when opportunities for formal public comment have arisen—often with a correction to governmental regulatory analysis but always with a focus on the rigorous and comprehensive assessment of costs and benefits and related outcomes that is fundamental to our mission. Analysis-based responses to government proposals, informed by insightful discussions with stakeholders and policymakers, are at the core of how RFF ensures that environmental and climate regulations are grounded in the best available evidence.

This fall, RFF hosted an Insights Hour event—a periodic informal discussion with RFF stakeholders and donors—focused exclusively on the public comments RFF experts submitted in response to three key administration efforts: (1) EPA’s proposed repeal of greenhouse gas emissions standards for fossil fuel–based electric power generation; (2) a report produced last year by DOE’s Climate Working Group that questioned the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions on the US climate (and, in turn, related economic outcomes) that was cited extensively in those emissions standards; and (3) an EPA proposal to eliminate vehicle emissions standards along with, more profoundly, the underlying endangerment finding that serves as the basis for the agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

RFF Senior Fellow and Director of RFF’s Electric Power Program Karen Palmer led an insightful discussion with Senior Fellow Joshua Linn, Fellow Brian C. Prest, and Research Associate Nick Roy about how and why RFF engages in public comments. The following is an annotated transcript of the event.

This Insights Hour event took place on September 30, 2025. The original transcript of the discussion has been edited for length and clarity.

Karen Palmer: The subject today is how RFF informs the regulatory process through public comments on recent regulations and related actions by the administration—including some proposed regulatory repeals from EPA on fossil fuel power plants, vehicle emissions standards, and the overall endangerment finding, based on a recent report about climate change from a Climate Working Group established by DOE, to which RFF has submitted a comment. All these comments are published on the RFF website and focus entirely on the analyses of economic costs and benefits from these proposed regulatory changes.

Let me start out with Brian and your public comment on the report that was produced by the Climate Working Group established by DOE. I want to discuss your review of the chapter on economics and the social cost of carbon (SCC). Can you tell me about what that chapter said and your reaction?

Brian C. Prest: While much of the report was about the physical science of climate change, one of the 12 chapters focused solely on the economics of climate change and the SCC. This subject is of course squarely in RFF’s wheelhouse. Basically, this chapter had two sections: one on the SCC and another about the impacts of climate change on the economy.

The SCC section was broadly dismissive of the idea of estimating the SCC and made several misleading or simply false claims. What’s particularly interesting is that the chapter didn’t acknowledge much of the core progress made in environmental economics over the past decade or so, and instead mostly focused on old and outdated research.

For instance, the working group didn’t cite the landmark 2017 National Academies report that prompted RFF to establish the SCC Initiative that same year. They also didn’t acknowledge any of the research that the National Academies inspired, such as more than a dozen peer-reviewed studies over the past decade that were part of the efforts of RFF and the Climate Impact Lab. They made one passing reference to the widely lauded efforts by EPA in 2023, but in doing so, made the astonishing and unsubstantiated claim that EPA’s work did not represent any new data or methods relative to old models, even though that effort in fact built a brand new integrated assessment model from the ground up.

In short, the DOE working group didn’t really engage with the major advances of SCC research over the past decade or so. My public comment highlights this major deficiency with the analysis, and corrects erroneous claims in the report, like confusing the concepts of social costs and external costs.

Palmer: I also understand that, while they didn’t cite RFF’s major work on the SCC, they did cite one of your papers, which was coauthored with former RFF President and CEO Richard G. Newell. How well did their summary represent the results of your paper?

Prest: Right! Our 2021 paper was written in part as a critique of a high-profile 2015 paper that, in our view, strongly overstated the expected adverse impacts of climate change on economic growth. Most existing research estimates the effects of climate change on the level of GDP, while our 2015 paper instead estimates the impacts on its growth rate.

We point out in our paper that growth-rate methods are very sensitive to model specifications, which raises concern about the reliability of the models, but we also found that methods focusing on GDP levels yield much smaller but much more robust estimates that are closely in line with other research.

Nonetheless, the report from the DOE Climate Working Group cites only the less robust set of models in our paper, concluding that the effect of climate change on GDP growth is statistically noisy but “likely positive” on net, while ignoring the more reliable set of models that yield the opposite conclusion. But if you consider the set of models that we found to be more robust, you get the reverse conclusion that the impacts are likely negative, with a 92 percent likelihood of climate change hurting the economy—the opposite of what the DOE working group describes in its report.

In short, our study was meant as a warning against overinterpreting noisy growth-rate models, but the DOE report went on to commit the very same error.

Palmer: The DOE Climate Working Group report is heavily cited in EPA’s proposed rescission of the 2009 endangerment finding, which concluded that greenhouse gases negatively affect public health and welfare and that emissions can be regulated through the Clean Air Act. To remind everyone, the endangerment finding came from the landmark 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA Supreme Court case that focused on vehicle emissions standards.

Let’s turn to our transportation expert, Joshua Linn, about the proposed removal of these standards and how the recently proposed reversal has been justified economically. In 2024, EPA set greenhouse gas standards that would have cut emissions rates in half between 2026 and 2032. This year, EPA has proposed eliminating the standards altogether. How did the agency justify this complete reversal?

Joshua Linn: EPA justifies the proposed reversal largely on the grounds of consumer benefits. Specifically, the proposal asserts that, although consumers would have higher fuel costs, vehicles would be much less expensive, leaving consumers better off overall. But the draft of EPA’s regulatory impact analysis associated with the proposal misinterprets findings from past research, causing the proposal to overstate the net benefits of revoking vehicle emissions standards.

Several assumptions about manufacturer behavior and market outcomes, such as the relationship between compliance costs and regulatory stringency, remain unclear or unjustified in EPA’s recent analysis, causing the proposal’s approach to depart from historical methods for estimating vehicle technology costs, without explanation. Further, the proposal’s analysis relies on obsolete data that are inconsistent with recent market information.

Palmer: In the past, EPA has claimed that consumers would benefit from lower gasoline expenditures. Now, EPA claims consumers are better off without the standards. What has changed?

Linn: EPA clearly is taking a different regulatory and policy approach under the current administration. But we can also see a difference in the analytical methods and rigor that EPA is using to justify the changes. This reduced rigor is true for the analysis of consumer behaviors.

For example, the EPA proposal states that manufacturers and industry should report payback periods of 2.5 years. For a consumer choosing between a fuel-efficient, more expensive vehicle and an inefficient, less expensive vehicle, this number means that a consumer would buy the fuel-efficient vehicle if the first 2.5 years of fuel cost savings justify a higher purchase price. This conclusion differs markedly from past arguments and from contemporary analysis.

In our response, we offer two arguments as to why the 2.5-year payback period is inappropriate. On the one hand, EPA argues that including the first 2.5 years of fuel cost savings accounts for the missing costs related to consumer adoption of electric vehicles; for example, range anxiety. In arguing that EPA’s 2024 standards amount to an electric vehicle mandate, EPA should use an estimate of missing costs that corresponds specifically to electric vehicles. However, the sources that EPA uses appear to predate the rise of electric vehicles in the US market and hence current evidence about such missing costs. For that reason, using the 2.5-year payback period to approximate missing costs of battery-powered electric vehicles is not supported by evidence.

More to the point, some of my research has directly estimated consumer valuation of fuel cost savings, specifically when manufacturers add fuel-saving technologies to the vehicles they offer. During the early 2010s, these technologies included things such as cylinder deactivation. If some costs indeed were missing, those costs would be uncovered in our valuation estimate as deviations from the actual market value of the saved fuel. However, our preferred valuation estimate is consistent with a 7-year payback period. No missing costs from that period would cause consumers to insist on a 2.5-year payback period.

EPA’s assumption of an appropriate payback period is one example of how the proposal undervalues the benefits of the emissions standards. The misinterpretation, in turn, has caused the EPA analysis to overstate the net benefits of revoking the greenhouse gas standards.

Palmer: If EPA goes ahead and revokes the standards, how would the industry respond in the next few years?

Linn: Without the incentive of things like tax credits, manufacturer responses to a repeal of emissions standards will vary.

If a manufacturer offers two vehicles that are identical to each other, except one is gasoline and the other is electric, and the two vehicles have the same lifetime ownership cost, most consumers will choose the gasoline vehicle. In this case, the missing cost is the monetary value of the disutility that the consumer gets with the electric vehicle instead of the gasoline vehicle. The missing cost makes it harder for the manufacturer to comply with greenhouse gas standards, because the automaker has to offer a discount on the electric vehicle.

Emissions standards historically have incentivized manufacturers to reduce the average emissions rates of their vehicles, and the manufacturer response to eliminating the standards likely won’t be a reversion to past behaviors.

This note about manufacturer responses brings up another concern with the proposal’s analysis regarding its comparison cases. In the case of the proposal, EPA also should justify its assumptions about manufacturer behavior and market outcomes if the agency revokes the standards. For example, EPA compares the outcomes from the scenario of maintaining the 2024 standards versus reverting to 2021 standards—but the proposal seeks to remove standards altogether. That’s one example of the ways in which EPA’s approach departs from widely accepted methods for estimating vehicle technology costs; omits explanation and justification of key assumptions, such as the relationship between compliance costs and regulatory stringency; and relies on obsolete data that are inconsistent with market estimates.

It’s good to remind folks that the vehicle emissions standard was the channel for the endangerment finding in 2009, and repeal of the standard is tied to reversing the endangerment finding. But a preponderance of evidence since 2009 confirms that greenhouse gas emissions have significant negative effects on public health and welfare. So, a much broader legal question needs to be addressed, in addition to the technical omissions and errors in economic analysis that RFF has documented.

Palmer: Along with greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, EPA has proposed reversals of emissions-reduction requirements from the electric power sector, specifically questioning Section 111 of the Clean Air Act. Let’s turn to Nick Roy, who conducted much of RFF’s analysis on the proposal. Nick, can you give us some history that led to this current state of affairs?

Nick Roy: EPA has gone back and forth for decades on how to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel–powered electricity generators. The first proposal actually was legislative and goes back to the failed Waxman-Markey bill in 2009. This failed bill motivated executive action years later with EPA’s Clean Power Plan, which was finalized in 2015 but repealed in 2019 and replaced with a proposed Affordable Clean Energy Rule. At the same time, several judicial decisions, such as the West Virginia v. EPA Supreme Court case in 2022, redefined the legal framework for regulating greenhouse gas emissions from power facilities.

Ultimately, the Affordable Clean Energy Rule was repealed in 2024 and replaced with EPA’s Carbon Pollution Standards, which set emissions benchmarks and a range of compliance technologies such as carbon capture and storage, cofiring, and reduced electricity generation. With the change in administration and Congress in 2025, the Carbon Pollution Standards have been repealed.

So, we’re talking about a lot of swings in legislation, executive orders, program rules, and legal decisions. Ultimately, these swings have led to major uncertainties that make planning among electricity providers more difficult and likely lead to increasing costs for consumers.

Palmer: So now, we effectively have no EPA regulation on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. How did EPA justify this rulemaking, and what does RFF analysis have to say about the EPA analysis?

Roy: In its proposal, EPA reused the benefit-cost analysis in the regulatory impact analysis generated for the 2024 Carbon Pollution Standards but assumed no climate damages and excluded any health benefits from reductions in conventional air pollutants. Put another way, EPA does not quantify benefits lost from increased emissions as a result of the proposed repeal, neither from the increase in local air pollutants that cause the premature deaths of Americans nor from the increase in greenhouse gas emissions and the resulting effect on climate change. Instead, EPA’s benefit-cost analysis considers only the estimated $19 billion in avoided compliance costs from lifting the rule. As such, EPA’s analysis is not a benefit-cost analysis, but rather a cost analysis.

RFF’s analysis fills information gaps in two important ways. We’ve updated assumptions about future electricity demand using forecasts from 2025 instead of 2023, and we’ve itemized the benefits of both reduced climate change effects and avoided health costs. We find that the increased health damages alone from the repeal are two to four times the size of the electricity cost savings. Factoring in the costs of climate change, the costs from the repeal are about four to eight times higher than any avoided compliance costs.

Palmer: Without the Carbon Pollution Standards, how would we expect the power sector to change in the coming years?

Roy: The most immediate effect is that many coal- and gas-powered electricity plants will stay online longer and be retired more slowly, even when, as other research finds, many of those power plants are otherwise costly to maintain and operate.

But the level of uncertainty is increasing across electricity markets in general, with massive demand growth from data centers and electrification, variable tariffs that increase the costs of building new power plants, and the fact that methane prices are still subject to global volatility. A range of other factors, such as the permitting process for new electricity transmission and distribution, will challenge EPA’s assumptions about energy costs, too. In the end, this uncertainty has costs that likely are passed on to ratepayers.

Palmer: Finally, an underlying question of the endangerment finding proposal that bridges analytical and legal arguments: Are emissions from any specific sector “significant” contributors? Brian, you have analyzed the evolution of measuring significance. Can you close us out with your findings?

Prest: Sure. A key justification that EPA gave for repealing the carbon pollution standards on power plants was that the sector’s greenhouse gas emissions did not “significantly contribute” to air pollution, on the grounds that its 1.5 billion or so tons of annual carbon dioxide emissions represent about 3 percent of the global total, which EPA deemed insignificant.

However, neither EPA nor the Clean Air Act statute provide a quantitative rationale for what it means to be “significant,” so EPA’s proposed repeal explicitly emphasizes that its conclusion effectively was a judgment call by this particular EPA administrator.

But from an economic and legal perspective, long-standing quantitative thresholds determine what makes for “economically significant” regulations. Those thresholds (for instance, from Executive Order 12866 in 1993 and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995) are commonly pegged at about $100 million–$200 million in annual impacts on the economy, public health, or the environment. Putting environmental impacts into dollar terms is a long-standing practice in economics, and in the case of climate change, this translation of carbon damages into dollar terms is what the SCC does.

SCC estimates vary (our previous work gives a central estimate of $185 per ton of carbon dioxide), but in our comments, we made the straightforward point that, under basically any estimate of the SCC, emissions from the US power sector clearly are economically significant and vastly exceed the well-established $100 million–$200 million threshold.

The math is pretty simple: Even at a minimal $1 per ton of carbon dioxide—the lowest value used by the first Trump administration—the economic impact of the US power sector’s 1.5 billion tons of annual carbon dioxide emissions is measured in the billions of dollars. But using more realistic estimates of the SCC, the impacts of carbon emissions amount to tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars annually.

Palmer: Answers to the analytical questions we have posed clearly are fundamental to how we pursue policy in this country. Thanks to my fellow researchers for bringing their tremendous expertise to bear, not just to RFF and to the broader community of environmental policy stakeholders, but also toward improving policy in the United States.",https://media.rff.org/images/Evidence_and_policy_Insights_Hour_-_Palmer_et_.width-600.png,N,,2026-01-22 10:40:02.478374

A hydrogen fuel-cell variant is also planned for select markets starting in 2028.

The iX7 (G67) is expected to follow in 2027, with an iX6 (G66) arriving in 2028. There are also rumors of a G74 model slated for 2029, reportedly derived from the next X5 but with a more off-road-oriented focus and a mix of hybrid and electric power.

Meanwhile, a closer look at the Delaware Sub-basin in Texas using the Texas Flaring Project’s interactive map highlights alarming trends.","An op-ed in this publication by the Texas Oil & Gas Association (TxOGA) praised Texas oil and gas producers for slashing the intensity of methane emissions by more than half amid rising production, hailing it as a new benchmark for the state’s “energy leadership.”

This may seem like welcome news, but as someone who studies environmental conditions in South Texas and spends every day with the data that captures our reality, I urge caution.

At the Rio Grande International Study Center in Laredo, we monitor the air quality across the Eagle Ford Shale, and along the U.S.-Mexico border. Taking a closer look at this claim of methane “reduction” makes it clear that the truth is more complex, and the underlying data tells a different story — one that raises serious concerns about transparency, accountability and the industry’s PR machine.

Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas responsible for nearly 25% of the warming our planet is experiencing today. In places like El Paso, it’s fueling climate change and wasting valuable energy resources. Cutting methane emissions is the fastest, most effective way to slow down the warming of our planet and protect our communities from a climate catastrophe.

The S&P Global report behind the methane claims omits key details — actual emissions figures, regional data, and modeling methods. It even lumps Texas and New Mexico together, an effective way to mask underperformance in Texas. Our state, unfortunately, is riding the coattails of New Mexico’s policy leadership, who have made it a priority to reduce harmful emissions and natural gas waste, particularly from the massive Permian Basin, which straddles both states.

Even more telling, the report itself quietly acknowledges that satellite data showed no significant change in methane intensity between 2023 and 2024.

This framing is everything. Without the proper data that distinguishes between Texas’ and New Mexico’s emissions, Texans are left with an overly optimistic picture that doesn’t match what’s happening on the ground or in the air.

MethaneSAT’s measurement data captures all emissions, including the many smaller, widespread sources that account for a significant share of total emissions, overall. Thanks to this new data from this satellite launched in 2024, we have been able to dig into methane emissions in the Permian Basin. We know that the methane intensity in the Delaware Sub-Basin, which is the most active part of the Permian, is more than double that of neighboring New Mexico. That means for every unit of oil and gas produced, Texas is releasing over twice as much methane.

The difference lies not in geology, but in policy.

New Mexico has taken methane seriously. It has enacted smart, science-based regulations, including a ban on routine flaring, robust leak detection, and mandated zero-emission equipment in many cases.

Texas, on the other hand, still allows routine flaring, functionally exempts thousands of wells from inspection, and lacks basic standards for emissions control equipment. The massive impact of those differences is both environmental and economic.

Since 2020, New Mexico has doubled its oil and gas production while holding methane emissions flat. Texas, meanwhile, has increased production by just 20% with no meaningful change in emissions. This is unacceptable given the powerful forces of climate change that are bearing down upon us.

The data is unmistakable: Texas is falling behind. Last year alone, operators flared 168 billion cubic feet of gas in the Texas Permian Basin — 40% more than was reported to the state. That would have been enough to meet the residential gas needs of 4.5 million Texas households. Its market value would have been around $380 million.

Meanwhile, a closer look at the Delaware Sub-basin in Texas using the Texas Flaring Project’s interactive map highlights alarming trends.

In Reeves County, alone, an estimated $40 million worth of natural gas was burned off. Just next door in Loving County, satellite data shows flaring levels nearly three times higher than what companies reported to the state—representing another $29 million in wasted energy.

You can’t fix what you don’t track. That’s why RGISC was proud to partner with the Texas Flaring Project to equip our communities with the data we need to hold both state agencies and industry accountable for wasteful flaring and the pollution it causes. They must keep pollution in the pipe.

All told, Texas wasted $1.5 billion worth of natural gas in 2023. That’s 590 billion cubic feet of wasted energy which means lost tax revenue that could help impacted communities like mine on the border, and fund schools, health clinics, or critical infrastructure. Nearly 2.4 million Texans live within half a mile of an active oil or gas well and bear the health burdens of the resulting poor air quality and underregulated operations.

We must do better. New Mexico has shown that strong, sensible regulations don’t threaten industry, which has increased production. They are reducing waste, protecting health, and fostering innovation. Texas has the resources, the technology, and the workforce to lead the field. Why are we okay with our state falling behind?

Texas leaders must stop cherry-picking stats fed to them by the industry’s PR machine, and embrace real solutions. Border communities and your community all deserve clean air, opportunity, and honest leadership.

That's a big ""if,"" however, as it is widely known that some of the plans filed by so-called hyperscalers are more aspirational than hard commitments and will likely be withdrawn if development or grid interconnection takes too long.

Other project estimates likely deliberately inflated the computing capacity that is expected to be constructed, in the hopes that large-scale projects may be eligible for local government support and attain leverage in zoning negotiations.

That said, it is clear that a huge swell in overall data center computing heft - and power consumption - can be expected across the country, which will have sizeable repercussions for local electricity markets, utilities and other businesses.

To help assess which states face the biggest potential impact from the data center build-out, here is a breakdown of where the planned capacity additions are due to be located - and how state electricity supplies and prices have been trending.

COAST-TO-COAST

One of the standout features of the data center capacity pipeline is how widely spread the development plans are across the country.

In total, plans for just over 150 gigawatts (GW) of new data center power capacity have been filed nationally, with 24 different states planning or building at least 1 GW of new capacity, according to Cleanview, an energy data portal.

Given that total current U.S. data center capacity is just under 15 GW and that only three states - Virginia, Texas and Arizona - have more than 2 GW in current operation, the planned capacity building boom is potentially transformational.

The proposed sites span from North Dakota to Alabama, but some states have chunkier development pipelines than others.

Virginia - already called the country's data center alley - plans an eleven-fold rise in computing capacity, which will maintain the state's lead in data center heft with close to 35 GW in development.

Texas ranks second with around 27 GW of capacity plans, while gas-rich Pennsylvania ranks third with a capacity pipeline of around 14 GW.

Outside of those already established hubs for energy-intensive industry, New Mexico, Indiana, Arizona and Utah also have hefty capacity plans in the works, with more than 25 GW of additional capacity planned between them.

Other notable states with plans to bring on massive new capacity include Georgia, Louisiana and Wyoming, which each plan to build more than 3 GW of new computing power.

POTENTIAL ROADBLOCKS

Electricity prices - already buoyed in nearly every market as utility systems upgrade grids and transmission networks - have also risen as data center chatter intensified in key markets.

Among the top 15 states for planned new data center capacity, electricity prices for residential customers have climbed by an average of 16% since the start of 2024, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

That price gain compares to a 10% rise in national residential electricity prices over the same period and indicates that hefty data center capacity pipelines may come with a side of local rate inflation.

Thankfully for large energy consumers, utility-scale supplies of electricity have increased at an even faster rate across the country - especially in the states where large data center demand loads are set to emerge.

Total electricity output across the same 15 states with the largest data center capacity pipelines has increased by an average of 22% since the start of 2024, data from think tank Ember shows.

That growth rate slightly exceeds the national electricity supply expansion of 21% over the same period and suggests that utilities in those states may be outworking their peers in an effort to make the data center capacity dreams a reality.

,American Energy,2026-01-22 11:23:57+00:00,CNN,New-wave reactors are the face of an American nuclear renaissance. Some experts are ...,Laura Paddison,,,,,https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/22/climate/small-nuclear-reactors-smrs-holtec-kairos,"Large conventional nuclear reactors are incredibly expensive, sometimes stretching to tens of billions of dollars.
But Holtec said its staff has hundreds of years of collective operational nuclear experience, and its technology is proven, based on conventional water-cooled nuclear power plants.
“The deployment of advanced reactors is a priority for the Trump administration,” said Rian Bahran, deputy assistant secretary for nuclear reactors.
Nuclear power cannot compete on cost with alternatives, both fossil fuels and increasingly renewable energy, he said.
“If they don’t prove what they’re claiming about how nuclear power is going to save the world, then it’s going to become obsolete,” he said.","On the sandy shores of Lake Michigan, set against a backdrop of thick forest, a sharp-angled grey concrete building could be the face of an American nuclear renaissance.

The Palisades nuclear plant, about a two-hour drive from Chicago, was decommissioned in 2022, judged to be uneconomical in a world of cheap American gas. But Florida-headquartered company Holtec is reviving it. It will mark not only the first ever restart of a shuttered US nuclear plant, but, if all goes to plan, Palisades will also be the birthplace of a nuclear breakthrough: America’s first commercial “small modular reactors.”

These advanced nuclear reactors, known as SMRs, are like mini nuclear power plants but touted as cheaper, safer, faster to build and easier to finance than their conventional counterparts — and hype around them is rising fast.

Their appeal is clear: the prospect of abundant, clean power that can run 24/7. They’re catnip for tech companies seeking reliable energy sources to slake the incredible thirst of their data centers, expected to increase exponentially as AI grows. Money is pouring in from Big Tech and the Trump administration.

SMRs are in a sweet spot right now, said Michael Craig, an associate professor of energy systems and climate at the University of Michigan. “They’re in this perfect ground where there’s lots of great ideas … and they have a lot of promise and potential,” he told CNN.

The reality, as ever, is likely to be messier and experts are sounding notes of caution. The total cost of SMRs may be lower than conventional plants, but they are still very expensive, meaning the price of electricity they produce will be far higher than wind, solar or gas, experts warn.

They also take a long time to get up and running. There are only three operational SMRs in the entire world, and none is in the US. One is on a Russian barge off the Siberian coast and the other two in China.

Whether the SMR hype is warranted will only start to become clear once they are built — and the race is on to do so.

Advanced nuclear is “a ‘Back to the Future’-type story,” Touran said. In the 1950s and ’60s, the US had dozens of small reactors, “and they all operated uneconomically,” he told CNN. So, seeking economies of scale to reduce costs and the price of electricity, the industry went big.

Nuclear, however, is an inherently complex technology and building bespoke mega-projects has proved hard. Timelines were delayed, costs spiraled and nuclear stagnated in the US, unable to compete with cheap fracked gas.

Now, small is in again. Companies are saying “we have new technology, we have new materials, and this time it will be cheaper,” Touran said, although “that is definitely yet to be seen,” he added.

The enduring appeal of SMRs is found in their name. First, it’s about size. Large conventional nuclear reactors are incredibly expensive, sometimes stretching to tens of billions of dollars. Smaller reactors simply cost less to build. They are “a technological solution to a financial problem,” Touran said. “No venture capitalists can say, like, ‘oh, sure, we’ll build a $30 billion plant.’ But, if you’re down into hundreds of millions, maybe they can do it.”

It’s also about modularity. The idea is these small reactors will be mass produced in centralized factories and delivered to sites, making them cheaper and more flexible than huge nuclear plants.

Holtec wants to prove the concept at Palisades in Covert Township, Michigan. Alongside firing up the 800-megawatt conventional reactor, the company plans to install two 300-megawatt SMRs to be built in its Camden, New Jersey, factory.

The company kicked off the formal licensing process with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission last month and hopes to have everything approved by 2029, with the SMRs coming online by 2031, a Holtec spokesperson said.

Its long-term aim, with partner company Hyundai Engineering & Construction, is to build a fleet of SMRs in North America in the 2030s.

Some experts question the ambitious timelines, especially for a company that has never operated a nuclear plant before — Holtec started out in the nuclear waste business before buying up and decommissioning closed nuclear plants. But Holtec said its staff has hundreds of years of collective operational nuclear experience, and its technology is proven, based on conventional water-cooled nuclear power plants.

Using this technology is “a very sensible approach” because it should ease the licensing and supply chain process, said Brendan Kochunas, an associate professor at University of Michigan Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences.

But in the race to bring America’s first SMR online, Holtec has competition.

In 2024, California-based Kairos Power broke ground in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on the construction of a demonstration reactor, aiming to start operations in 2028. The next step will be a commercial-scale reactor which the company says will produce electricity on the grid by 2030. It’s opted for a different technology to Holtec, using molten fluoride salt as a coolant instead of water.

Kairos is interesting because it’s one of the few companies in the US that’s actually building right now, said Allison Macfarlane, director of the School of Public Policy and Global Affairs at the University of British Columbia, and a former chair of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Its process of building, testing, learning and building again may take longer than companies that just design and build one final reactor, but it can provide invaluable learning. “You have to demonstrate the technology before you can sell it to anyone,” Macfarlane told CNN. “Whether it will be successful is another story.”

Big tech companies are betting it will be. In 2024, Kairos signed a deal with Google to deploy a fleet of reactors totaling 500 megawatts — enough to power around 300,000 homes — with the first slated to start operations in 2030. Kairos wouldn’t confirm the value of the deal but said it will help it build out factory production lines and “accelerate the learning curve, making each unit cheaper and faster to deploy.”

Other tech companies are also pouring money into the field. Amazon invested in Maryland-headquartered X-Energy, which uses a gas-cooled design and is planning up to 12 SMRs at a new facility in Washington state.

Earlier this month, Meta announced a deal with SMR startup Oklo to prepay for power and to help build a campus in Pike County, Ohio, to support Meta’s data centers in the region. Oklo did not disclose the value of the deal but a spokesperson told CNN, “the full project build-out would be a multi-billion dollar infrastructure project.”

There’s plenty of public money, too. In December, the Department of Energy approved $800 million toward developing SMRs, with $4 million to Holtec, and more is on the horizon.

“The deployment of advanced reactors is a priority for the Trump administration,” said Rian Bahran, deputy assistant secretary for nuclear reactors. “Additional funds will be invested in the research, development, and deployment of these technologies.”

As the hype increases, some experts are sounding warning bells.

All the arguments in favor of SMRs overlook a fundamental issue, said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists: They are too expensive.

Despite all the money swilling around the sector, “it’s still not enough,” he told CNN. Nuclear power cannot compete on cost with alternatives, both fossil fuels and increasingly renewable energy, he said. “An SMR is still a luxury, and it may be more affordable in terms of its initial price tag, but that doesn’t mean it’s producing less expensive electricity.”

So far, the NRC has approved only one SMR design, by the company NuScale Power, but a project to build them in Idaho was canceled in 2023 as costs soared and not enough utilities signed on to buy electricity.

Neither Kairos nor Holtec would confirm how much their SMRs will cost, citing commercial sensitivity.

Some SMRs also have an issue with fuel. The more unconventional designs, those cooled by salt or gas, often require a special type of fuel called high-assay low-enriched uranium, known as HALEU (pronounced hay-loo). The amounts available are limited and the supply chain has been dominated by Russia, despite efforts to build up a domestic supply.

It’s a major risk, said Touran. The biggest challenge nuclear has is competing with natural gas, he said, a “luxury, super expensive fuel may not be the best way.”

There is still stigma around nuclear waste, too. SMR companies say smaller reactors mean less nuclear waste, but 2022 research from Stanford University suggested some SMRs could actually generate more waste, in part because they are less fuel efficient.

Amid the push to accelerate SMRs, some experts say the biggest concern is safety. The Trump administration has focused on speeding up licensing processes and loosening regulatory requirements, which Lyman fears will not give enough time to evaluate safety and security. “It’s really the Wild West,” he said.

Other experts are more optimistic. “Just eliminating regulations without much thought is dangerous,” Michigan’s Kochunas said. But done properly “I don’t think there’s any inherent concerns to safety by prioritizing and fast tracking SMRs,” he told CNN.

The Department of Energy rejected claims safety would be compromised. “DOE upholds the highest standards of safety in our work with the nuclear industry,” Bahran said.

As companies race to prove SMRs can meet the hype, experts appear to be divided in their thinking.

For some, SMRs are an expensive — and potentially dangerous — distraction, with timelines that stretch so far into the future they cannot be a genuine answer to soaring needs for clean power right now. They may not be ready for decades, Macfarlane said. “Will these companies wait until then? Will AI be relevant then?” she asked.

Lyman believes a driving force behind the push to get SMRs online is fear that time is running out to compete with wind, solar and batteries. “If they don’t prove what they’re claiming about how nuclear power is going to save the world, then it’s going to become obsolete,” he said.

Others, however, point out that all technology is expensive to start with, and costs tend to come down as it advances. SMRs could mean data centers don’t strain the grid and push up people’s electricity bills, they could be used in remote areas instead of diesel generators or even in industrial factories to provide heat, they argue.

Investing in SMRs now will prove, one way or another, if they can be an option to complement wind or solar, Touran said, “progress requires people to do stuff.”

“Let’s build the reactor. Let’s turn it on, and let’s see if it actually runs well,” he said. “The big debate, the big race is who can run one economically.”

But although Saranac Lake is already so environmentally friendly, we have some work to do.
So what can the average person in Saranac Lake do to reduce their carbon footprint?
The programs Saranac Lake offers are funded through grants and charities.
—— Fern is a senior at Saranac Lake High School who loves nature and hopes to study it in the future.","As the locals know, the Adirondack Park is the largest publicly protected state park, at six million acres. Because it is so large and widely protected, taking care of it is very important for wildlife, the environment and local communities within it.

The small town of Saranac Lake is in the northern part of the Adirondacks, so we’re pretty environmentally conscious. We have many programs to support this, such as a community power program, programs to promote electric vehicles, urban and community forestry programs (where we plant trees in the village such as at Mt. Pisgah and downtown) and an organic waste program at our local sewage plant. We’ve switched our street lamps to LED lights, we use clean energy for heating, we work to create a climate smart community and, last but not least, we have a walkable community.

All of these are wonderful programs and I love that we have them. But although Saranac Lake is already so environmentally friendly, we have some work to do. I want to focus on where most of our carbon emissions come from: heating.

Our sewage plant uses methane gas, which is produced from the sewage waste when it is heated and separated. This methane gas is what powers the digester boiler, reducing carbon emissions. A few buildings in town are also using geothermal heating — heating and cooling that comes from the ground — which is amazing but very expensive. To get it, you would dig up your yard and put pipes underneath it to collect the heat and cooling from the ground and pump it into your house. Even so, we still have a large carbon footprint.

Let’s start off with why small town carbon footprints are so much larger than if you were to live in a city. For one, we have to travel farther distances to get to town. There’s also less public transportation. More people own their own homes so they all have to pay for heating, whether that be with electric, gas or wood, compared to an apartment building where there is one source of heat for the whole building.

So what can the average person in Saranac Lake do to reduce their carbon footprint? You can get a gas efficient car to reduce the amount of fossil fuels your car needs. You can have some sort of clean energy producer such as solar panels or wind power to reduce your electric bill if you have electric heating. There are so many other ways to reduce your carbon footprint and these are only a few of them.

The programs Saranac Lake offers are funded through grants and charities. But what else can we do and work on as a community? We have a great river for us to put in a form of hydro power to power our community. We should also work on making public transportation more available for the people who live farther away. The community garden needs to be worked on so we can have fresh greens and fruits for our community. These are all things for locals to think about and work on to create more environmentally friendly communities and lower all of our carbon footprints.

Global electricity generation from renewables is expected to jump by 60% in 2030, accounting for 45% of total electricity output, per the International Energy Agency. Almost 50% of European power came from renewables in 2024, and the region has a strong pipeline of solar and on- and offshore wind waiting to be connected to the grid.

“The problem we have now is integrating all of that variable supply into our power markets,” Peter Osbaldstone, research director for European power and renewables at Wood Mackenzie, told CNBC.

Pressure on integration results in pressure on prices, “which undermines the economics of investments, which makes the whole process of supporting a decarbonized power mix more difficult, more expensive for governments to bear,” he said.

As AI-driven power demand grows, market watchers are eyeing fossil fuels to beat the energy bottleneck. The IEA revised its 2025-2030 growth forecast for renewables downward by 5% compared to 2024, reflecting the changing sentiment and policy, largely from the U.S.

Redeploying fossil fuel energy is a “short‑term crutch” that helps the AI roll-out get going, but “renewable energy is the only way to win in the long term,” Agate Freimane, partner at venture capital firm Norrsken, told CNBC’s “Europe Early Edition” on Jan. 8.

“China and the U.S. have both acknowledged the need for vast energy resources to power an AI future, and this is reflected in the adoption of renewables. Taking the global view — renewable energy prices have dropped by more than 90%, and in 2024, 91% of new renewable projects were cheaper than fossil alternatives,” Freimane said in a follow-up email.

“This shift triggers a self-reinforcing cycle: cheaper clean power accelerates electrification, rising electrification boosts demand for storage and grid intelligence, and those upgrades push the cost of clean energy even lower. In this way, it can be argued that AI is accelerating the shift to renewables,” she added.

Dealing with intermittency

For Alberto Faraco, a senior analyst who covers infrastructure at Morningstar DBRS, intermittency is still a fundamental issue with renewables. Investment needs to be made across the whole system — not just the energy-generating side, he told CNBC.

“Data centers should help the development of renewables, because that should push the price of electricity up, but transmission would need to be developed, battery storage would need to be developed,” he said, adding that renewables alone will not be enough to serve the stable needs of the data centers.",https://cdn.cnbc.africa/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ZLR43JVJLNKRVPPCHI54CZBB74.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 11:40:02.757402

The bill would require the Department of Natural Resources to ensure that 10% of state forest land consists of forests 100 years or older and 10% of state forest land consists of forests 20 years or younger at all times.
""The Department of Forestry estimates that 28% of our state forests consist of trees 100 years or older.
But even the 10% figure intended to preserve forest land isn't entirely logical to environmental advocates who have similar intentions.","Almost everyone agrees that Indiana forests are under threat. Figuring out how to help them is where the quibbling begins even among environmentalists who want to do all they can to preserve the forests.

Lawmakers this session have proposed legislation designed to support forest health. House Bill 1414 intends to bolster funding for the state's Division of Forestry and strengthen forest conservation requirements. The bill would tack entrance fees onto state forest visits (which unlike state parks, are typically free to enter) and regulate new and old growth forest composition.

Bill author Rep. Beau Baird, R-Greencastle, said his intention with the bill is to preserve the environmental, economic, recreational and health benefits that woodlands provide to Hoosiers.

""Our forest lands are under threat,"" Baird said speaking Jan. 21 in the House Committee on Natural Resources. ""We want to make sure they're here for generations to enjoy.""

Many support Baird's plan to increase revenue for state forestry. But not all environmentalist advocates are convinced that the current bill delivers on the forest health front. Some worry that it might actually imperil the ancient trees it was designed to protect.

Age mandates for trees worry some environmentalists

Woodlands that are healthy, biodiverse and able to provide food and habitat for myriad species usually have a mix of tree types, from skinny saplings to looming old-timers. Old growth forests are especially prized for their ability to sequester large amounts of carbon and provide for other life forms.

Baird's bill attempts to maintain multiple generations of trees on state forest land. The bill would require the Department of Natural Resources to ensure that 10% of state forest land consists of forests 100 years or older and 10% of state forest land consists of forests 20 years or younger at all times.

The Nature Conservancy, one of Indiana's largest conservation organizations, supports the bill, citing an amendment that provides some liability protection for land trusts, like TNC, who host hikers, bikers and outdoorsmen.

TNC believes the management techniques outlined would help ensure the longevity of Indiana forests, said John Ketzenberger, TNC's director of government relations.

Other environmental advocacy groups took a slightly different stance, saying the bill's language concerned them.

""As written, this could be interpreted as instructing the department to cull any trees that are 100 years or older that fall outside of that percentage population mark,"" said Nicole Snider, a volunteer with the Sierra Club Hoosier Chapter. ""The Department of Forestry estimates that 28% of our state forests consist of trees 100 years or older. This means that a huge swath of our mature trees that fall outside of that 10% limit will be cut.""

The vague nature of the four-page bill was a frequent theme of discontent among lobbyists who had varying interpretations of what might be required to comply with the bill.

""We believe it is a mandate to continuously log in order to maintain that 20 years and younger. We also believe it caps the ability of the forest to mature beyond 100 years at 10%,"" said Jason Flickman, the executive director of the Indiana Forest Alliance. ""I think that needs to be defined in this legislation before any movement is made on it.""

Baird said he did not think the bill would have that impact. Right now, he said, the DNR isn't mandated to protect any amount of forest that has aged past a century. This bill would set at least some of the forests aside for preservation.

""I'm hoping they keep as much of that as they can, but they do that in a scientific based manner, and I want them to follow that science. I'm just saying if you decide to cut into that, 10% has to be saved,"" he said.

But even the 10% figure intended to preserve forest land isn't entirely logical to environmental advocates who have similar intentions.

David Van Gilder, the senior policy and legal director for the Hoosier Environmental Council, said that HEC supported the heart of the bill and agreed it was wise to find ways to increase revenue for the forests. But he was less positive about the plan to set benchmarks for forest conservation targets.

""HEC is not aware of any data that supports that 10% number,"" Van Gilder said. ""We suspect that that is a smaller number than it ought to be.""

“Our entire entrepreneurial system is thriving in our state, where I think we’ve found that balance.”","California Governor Gavin Newsom drew applause at the World Economic Forum in Davos Thursday with a heated denunciation of President Donald Trump — but also rejected the growing Davos consensus that Trump represents a permanent breach in the American-led global order.

Newsom spoke a day after Trump grudgingly backed off threats to seize Greenland, and two days after Canadian Prime Minister captivated the global forum by declaring that US allies needed to acknowledge a permanent “rupture” in the global systems and begin hedging their bets by deeper engagement with China.

“These relationships are in dormancy. They’re not dead,” Newsom told me in a Thursday morning interview. “I don’t use those binary terms. Don’t fall prey to that. That’s a bit hyperbolic.”

Newsom drew repeated applause from an audience in the Congress Center that included European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde for heated denunciations of Trump, who he painted as an anomalous figure who “will be remembered in years, not decades.” Newsom denounced “corruption and graft at a scale we’ve never seen in American history,” and waved red kneepads at CEOs and American politicians he painted as frightened and subservient.

“I respect what Carney did because he has courage of convictions. He stood up,” Newsom said. But he also lamented that Carney’s deal with Beijing would involve “introducing low cost, high quality electric vehicles, not made in Michigan or Detroit, but overseas, into Canada.

“It says everything you know about the recklessness of America’s foreign policy,” Newsom said. “It’s a remarkable thing to break down 80-plus years of alliances. It takes decades and decades to build trust in organisations …. It takes weeks, tweets, hours, minutes, sometimes to destroy it.”

Newsom also defended his decision to “fight fire with fire” by responding to Trump and his aides with the personal, sometimes sexual, social media jibes the White House directs at their enemies.

AD

“it’s deeply unbecoming. Come on. Of course it is. It’s not what we should be doing,” he said. “But you’ve got to point out the absurdity. You got to put a mirror up to this.” He proceeded to describe Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who had attacked Newsom as a Ken doll, as appearing “as if he was reading a diary and had just broken up with someone.”

Newsom also criticized a proposal by a California union to fund health care with a one-time wealth tax on the state’s super rich. “We’re competing with 50 states,” he said. Capital flows and moves …. The impact of that has to be considered in the context of how freely capital can move and how that’s already occurred..” He added that the if the proposed referendum gets on the ballot, it would lose.

Ben’s view

Newsom has energized American Democrats and their European allies by fighting Trump on his own terms, but some of the most striking parts of our conversation came when I challenged him on Americans’ doubts about Democratic governance in states and cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco, as well as New York and Chicago.

Newsom’s response to that question — perhaps the largest hanging over his likely presidential campaign in 2028 — is an unabashed rejection of its premise. He rejected the notion that government — rather than environmental conditions — bore responsibility for devastating Los Angeles fires, defended extending state health insurance to undocumented migrants, and blew past my question about how the state could run a deficit amid a historic AI boom.

“California has figured it out in many respects,” Newsom told me, touting the state’s growing number of tech giants, a new wave of venture capital pouring into its companies, and OpenAI’s San Francisco headquarters even as the state spends heavily on social programs. “Our entire entrepreneurial system is thriving in our state, where I think we’ve found that balance.”","https://img.semafor.com/32b9b141749f8b3b1c0a15acf19b4b6146f7048c-5500x3667.jpg?rect=0,390,5500,2888&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format",N,,2026-01-22 07:39:50.093084

The measures drew opposition from Rhode Island Energy, and failed to advance out of either chamber.
Michael Dalo, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Energy, pledged to review McKee’s rate cut changes in full detail.","Gov. Dan McKee framed his proposed rollbacks of green energy incentives around affordability — saving Rhode Island ratepayers $1 billion in their energy bills over the next five years, according to analysis by the state budget office.

Tina Munter, Rhode Island policy advocate for Green Energy Consumers Alliance, offered a different summation of the governor’s fiscal 2027 budget proposal on energy bill charges.

“It’s mind-boggling,” Munter said in a recent interview. “Rhode Island’s reliance on natural gas for heating and electricity is what keeps the region in flux with energy prices. The longer we rely on natural gas, the longer we’re stuck in a cycle of seeing [energy] bills spike, seeing ratepayers be confused and shocked and surprised, versus having more stability.”

This logic persuaded lawmakers in 2022 to enact the most ambitious renewable electricity timeline of any state in the nation. The Renewable Energy Standard law, heralded by McKee at the time of its passage, required Rhode Island to gradually transition to entirely renewable energy sources for its electricity needs, reaching 100% by 2033.

Now, McKee wants to push the deadline to 2050, which is the same deadline for the state to achieve net-zero emissions overall under the separate Act on Climate law. The proposed 17-year postponement, with immediate relaxation of existing incremental benchmarks, accounts for more than half of the $1 billion projected savings to Rhode Island ratepayers, cutting nearly $64 million from bills in 2027, and $572 million over the next five years, according to the state Office of Management and Budget.

McKee’s environmental and energy administrators defended the rollback, which mirrors policies set by neighboring states and reflects the hostile energy environment under President Donald Trump.

“At a time when utility bills are already at historic highs and affordability is top concern for Rhode Islanders, President Trump’s actions are raising costs and undermining clean energy production,” Chris Kearns, acting state energy commissioner, said during a Jan. 15 briefing with reporters about McKee’s budget.

Changing winds in Washington have hit Rhode Island hard under the first year of Trump’s second term. Twice, the Trump administration has suspended work on its signature offshore wind project, Revolution Wind; the second federal suspension was lifted by court order on Jan. 12. Repeals of federal electric vehicle tax credits cut $900 million in incentives for Rhode Island motorists, while other key policies governing power emissions and vehicle efficiency standards have been rolled back.

A $49 million state grant under the Biden administration to help low and moderate-income homeowners and renters afford solar panels remains frozen, tied up in litigation. A separate $30 million federal award for home energy efficiency rebates, announced in 2024, is still awaiting final approval from federal regulators to launch, Kearns said.

The cost of going green

Even before the state’s climate change plan was cast into doubt by a Trump presidency, its ambitious “greening” of the local electricity grid was growing pricier.

In 2023, the most recent year available, electricity suppliers, including Rhode Island Energy, spent nearly $60 million to meet the 23% renewable electricity requirement for the year, according to a November 2025 report submitted to state regulators. The cost includes purchasing credits from regional solar, wind and other clean energy projects, which can be substituted for new renewable energy production to meet the mandates. Five years prior, when electricity suppliers only had to meet a 13% clean electricity standard, total program spending was less than $8 million.

The spending is passed on to ratepayers, reflected on the “delivery details” portion of Rhode Island Energy’s monthly billing along with other state mandated fees and energy program costs.

State mandates, fees and policies drive about 25% of monthly energy bills. There are also usage costs, set by third-party suppliers with no room to renegotiate by state administrators nor the utility provider. A separate set of distribution charges is imposed by Rhode Island Energy to help pay for customer service, infrastructure and technology upgrades and emergency outage responses, among other investments. McKee’s appointed, three-member Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over the company’s distribution charges, but the governor himself does not.

Hence, why McKee’s energy affordability plan only touches on the portions of customers’ bills under his control. In addition to revising the renewable energy standard, McKee has proposed a suite of other changes. They include:

Limiting credits to customers who return renewable energy to the grid through direct or virtual projects (mostly solar) and adding a “grid access fee” for large-scale solar fields to cover the costs associated with development, connection and operations. This change would cut ratepayers’ costs by $35 million a year.

Capping utility spending (based on ratepayer charges) for energy efficiency rebates and incentives to home and business owners at $75 million a year. There is no cap currently. This would save an estimated $21 million for ratepayers each year.

Revitalizing a longstanding practice, ended by state utility regulators in 2024, that lets Rhode Island Energy spread out the cost for road repaving over a longer period rather than accounting for the expense in its annual operating budget. This would save $16 million in ratepayer charges each year initially, although it compounds repayment over a longer time period.

Axing a state performance incentive to Rhode Island Energy meant to encourage long-term renewable energy contracts, saving ratepayers $2.5 million a year.

The collective changes, most of which would take effect in January 2027 if approved by the Rhode Island General Assembly, would save the average residential customer $180 a year, or $15 a month, over the next five years, according to the state budget office.

A short-term fix?

Short-term savings come with long-term consequences, including higher costs, Munter warned.

For example, rolling back the state Renewable Energy Standard will prolong the state’s reliance on a limited, unreliable and expensive natural gas supply. Dethroning Rhode Island as a state leader in climate incentives also means sacrificing its edge in the renewable electricity credit marketplace. Electricity suppliers can purchase credits from renewable energy projects anywhere, and Rhode Island’s ambitious incentives for clean energy production draw buyers from other states, fueling the state economy with money and jobs.

And then there are the unquantifiable health and safety benefits from a shift away from fossil fuels.

“The savings won’t show up on your utility bill, but Rhode Islanders will see environmental and health consequences in their life if, for example, air quality worsens,” Munter said.

Especially with less money available to make the switch to clean energy in their own homes and workplaces under McKee’s proposed cap on state energy efficiency funding.

“It’s a serious concern of mine to cap energy efficiency, and to imply that cutting energy efficiency spending will benefit Rhode Islanders,” said Emily Koo, senior policy advocate and Rhode Island program director for the Acadia Center.

Rhode Island Energy’s $95 million energy efficiency budget for 2026 is already 18% less than the $117 million budget for 2025, and nearly one-third below the annual amount that Rhode Island Energy pledged to spend in a three-year plan submitted in 2023.

Limiting state funding also fails to recognize the long-term savings for ratepayers who winterize windows and doors, upgrade furnaces and thermostats or even switch to high-efficiency electric heat pumps, Koo said. And in her view, the drought of federal funding for energy efficiency investments makes preserving, and boosting, Rhode Island’s rebate program even more important.

Koo also serves as a member of the advisory board to the Rhode Island Executive Climate Change Coordinating Council, a consortium of state agencies charged with developing a plan to meet Rhode Island’s decarbonization mandates under the Act on Climate law. The council’s first comprehensive review of state progress and future projections, unveiled in November, warned the 2050 net-zero emissions mandate is out of reach without “additional ambition” to incentivize a clean energy transition. Its analysis assumed the existing incentives and funding McKee now wants to roll back.

“From my point of view, it would appear that elements of the governor’s budget are inconsistent with the Act on Climate,” said Sen. Sam Zurier, a Providence Democrat and chair of a legislative panel created in 2025 to monitor implementation of the Act on Climate law.

However, Zurier said he wanted to keep an open mind, awaiting more detail on McKee’s budget proposal when the five-member Senate panel meets on Wednesday, Jan. 28. Its agenda includes a presentation from Terry Gray, Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management director and head of the Executive Climate Change Coordinating Council.

Gray reiterated McKee’s rationale on the energy bill cuts.

“If customers aren’t comfortable with their electric bills, and they’re not comfortable with the stability in their electric bills, they’re not going to transition over to the appliances we need to meet our mandates,” Gray said in an interview directly after the Jan. 15 budget briefing with reporters.

Eye on 2050

Gray said the state’s 2050 decarbonization deadline was “still achievable,” while noting the need for more frequent tweaks to the state’s plan especially under Trump.

“There are so many things up in the air right now, it’s crazy,” Gray said. “In our climate planning over the next three years, we’re going to have to read and react.”

Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO and co-chair of Climate Jobs Rhode Island, suggested it was premature to upend Rhode Island’s clean energy path.

“I think we should give ourselves one more year,” Crowley said. “Hopefully, things will change in Congress and we can get back on track. My concern is that we are going to drop our focus on what we need to do.”

Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, did not directly address these suggestions or critics when asked for comment.

“The Trump Administration has drastically changed the energy landscape, by taking steps to limit or eliminate available sources of clean energy—thereby driving up costs that are passed onto ratepayers and casting uncertainty on our ability to meet our aggressive climate goals,” DaRocha said in an emailed response Wednesday. “Meanwhile, rising energy costs are driving family budgets to the breaking point; Rhode Islanders need relief now, not later. We remain committed to an affordable energy strategy that still provides a pathway to decarbonization and leverages lower cost, zero-emission resources.”

The blame game

While McKee pointed the finger at Trump, local advocates and lawmakers focused their ire on Rhode Island Energy and its parent company, PPL Corp., contrasting the public company’s multimillion-dollar profits and C-suite executive salaries with ratepayers who struggle to keep the lights on.

A bevy of bills floated in the 2025 legislative session sought customer affordability by capping company profit margins, or creating competition in the form of a state-owned public utility. The measures drew opposition from Rhode Island Energy, and failed to advance out of either chamber.

Sen. Alana DiMario, a Narragansett Democrat, thinks the policy might be worth a fresh look, especially as Rhode Island Energy seeks to raise service charges on gas and electric customers. The company’s application, submitted to state utility regulators a day before Thanksgiving, proposes a two-year set of bill hikes starting in September 2026, adding more than $9 per month to the average residential customer’s electricity bill and more than $440 to annual, average gas bills.

In unveiling the proposed distribution rate hikes, Rhode Island Energy defended the need for $230 million operating revenue to cover inflationary costs and supply chain expenses. The company has been unable to seek a distribution rate increase to offset its service expenses since taking over the state’s gas and electric operations in 2022 as part of the sale agreement with state utility regulators. The moratorium ended in May 2025.

Regulators also required the company to refund customers for deferred income tax hikes associated with the 2022 acquisition. Rhode Island Energy, working with McKee, initially pitched a $149 million, two-year discount plan to honor its 2022 refund commitment, but withdrew the proposal in the fall amid scrutiny over the calculations. The company said previously it plans to file an alternative payout plan this year, but has not submitted anything as of Wednesday.

Michael Dalo, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Energy, pledged to review McKee’s rate cut changes in full detail.

“We remain committed to providing safe, reliable, and affordable energy for our customers, and will be actively engaged in the upcoming discussions to help shape solutions that benefit Rhode Islanders,” Dalo said in an emailed response on Jan. 15.

Working group weighs concerns The working group included state agency representatives, industry experts, and environmental advocates.
Lowen said she agrees with the Energy Office’s conclusion that nuclear energy doesn't make sense for Hawaiʻi right now.
But Lowen said she needs to see evidence that nuclear energy is cost-effective before she buys into the conversation.
State law currently limits the construction of nuclear power plants and the disposal of nuclear waste within Hawaiʻi.","For decades, Hawaiʻi has said no to nuclear power. But advancements in nuclear technology and pressures to shift Hawaiʻi away from costly oil have prompted some lawmakers to revisit the nuclear question.

Last session, the state Legislature directed the Hawaiʻi State Energy Office to convene a working group to explore whether new forms of nuclear energy production, like small modular reactors and microreactors, could be a good fit for Hawaiʻi.

These new technologies take up a significantly smaller footprint than conventional nuclear facilities like Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania. Small modular reactors can be less than a third the size of a conventional reactor, and new microreactors are being developed to fit inside shipping containers.

A nuclear plant can also produce power 24 hours a day regardless of weather conditions, unlike wind or solar farms, and emits zero carbon emissions during operation.

Despite these advantages, the Hawaiʻi State Energy Office determined advanced nuclear technologies are not appropriate for Hawaiʻi at this time.

The Energy Office's Monique Zanfes led the working group and produced its final report. Zanfes told HPR that these new technologies show more promise than conventional nuclear power, but they are still too nascent to be a worthwhile investment.

Only a handful of small modular reactors are in operation in the world, and none of them are in the U.S. Zanfes said even working group members who see a potential role for nuclear power in Hawaiʻi’s future don’t want the state to be ""the guinea pig"" for new nuclear technology.

And right now, the electricity produced by advanced nuclear technologies isn't any cheaper than oil generation.

""We certainly do not want to introduce a new technology that is going to cost more for ratepayers,"" Zanfes said.

Working group weighs concerns

The working group included state agency representatives, industry experts, and environmental advocates.

Zanfes said there was consensus among the group that advanced nuclear technologies need to develop further before they can be a cost-effective energy solution for Hawaiʻi.

But some group members disagreed on some of the finer points, like the threat posed by nuclear waste.

The U.S. has no permanent, long-term place to store spent nuclear fuel, which remains extremely radioactive after use.

Any nuclear waste produced by a local nuclear facility may need to be cooled and stored onsite or somewhere in the state.

Zanfes said some members of the group expressed concerns that long-term storage of nuclear waste in the islands could pose a serious contamination risk to our environment.

""If radiation gets into soils or the atmosphere, there's a chance that plants could take it and then it gets transferred up through the food chain. If it gets into our aquifers, it can dissipate across underground geology,"" she said.

Others in the group countered by pointing out that nuclear waste is safely stored at a number of sites across the U.S.

Working group member Jack Shriver spent over 20 years in the U.S. Navy as a nuclear submarine officer and operated naval nuclear plants during that time. He thinks the hurdles around the storage and transport of nuclear waste are ""very manageable.""

""All of the nuclear waste is contained, and you can point to it and say, that is the waste right there in that container,"" he said. ""If you compare that to any other energy source, in particular fossil fuels, you can't point to it. It's out there in the environment, right?""

But the Pacific is home to more than one example of nuclear contamination.

The U.S. conducted 67 nuclear weapon tests in the Republic of the Marshall Islands between 1946 and 1958. The Energy Office’s report notes that the Marshall Islands still experience radiation impacts to this day. Similar impacts have been felt in Tahiti, Guam, and other Pacific nations.

""In the Pacific in particular, we have people who have direct experience with radioactive waste,"" Zanfes said.

While Zanfes noted that ""the peaceful production of energy is very different then defense related testing,"" she said those experiences have understandably shaped public perception of nuclear power and should not be disregarded.

Lawmakers’ next move

Over the last 15 years, lawmakers have repeatedly introduced bills to create nuclear commissions or conduct feasibility studies on nuclear power, but those measures have rarely gained traction.

Many of those bills have come across the desk of state Rep. Nicole Lowen, who chairs the House Energy and Environmental Protection Committee.

Lowen said she agrees with the Energy Office’s conclusion that nuclear energy doesn't make sense for Hawaiʻi right now. But she added that she thinks the national conversation around nuclear energy is changing.

""There's just been a lot more focus nationally in getting off of fossil fuels. I think that nuclear has a role to play in that,"" she said.

While the Trump administration has shown no interest in limiting fossil fuel use, the White House has been supportive of expanding nuclear energy production.

The U.S. Department of Energy released a memo on Tuesday that lays out plans for ""America’s next nuclear renaissance.""

But Lowen said she needs to see evidence that nuclear energy is cost-effective before she buys into the conversation.

""Any real discussion of it is pending the cost coming down, because until that is something that makes sense, it's sort of like, why open the can of worms?"" she said.

State law currently limits the construction of nuclear power plants and the disposal of nuclear waste within Hawaiʻi. The Energy Office is not recommending any amendments to those laws at this time.

Hawaiʻi Sen. Glenn Wakai led calls last session for the Energy Office to convene the working group. He said he still thinks nuclear power has potential to be a part of Hawaiʻi’s grid and hopes that small modular reactors become commercially viable in the near future.

""Hopefully, in the next three to five years, that will develop, and then we can revisit this issue,"" he said.

Until then, Wakai plans to put the issue on the back burner. He told HPR that this legislative session, he's focusing on grid reliability, reducing energy costs, and geothermal exploration.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a06994a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/9134x4795+0+542/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F42%2F47%2F7f34ed5d44f08f5210afde8222e4%2Fap23018538370282.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 06:37:49.566721

That’s because the most common way to forge it begins with producing iron in coal-fired blast furnaces.

Now, for the first time, a new report identifies who buys the lion’s share of primary steel in the United States — and how much steel they’re buying.

At least 60% of U.S. primary steel is purchased by automobile manufacturers, according to an analysis from the environmental group Mighty Earth that was shared exclusively with Canary Media. The six automakers identified in the report — Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co., Honda Motor Co., Hyundai Motor Group, Stellantis, and Toyota Motor Corp. — produce 73% of all new cars on American roads.

The finding highlights a point of leverage for customers in decarbonizing American steel production at a moment when steelmakers are largely reversing plans for greener mills and doubling down on coal-fired blast furnaces.

“The auto market drives blast furnaces in the U.S.,” said Matthew Groch, senior director of decarbonization at Mighty Earth. ​“If they really cared and wanted to, they could put pressure on these companies they’re buying steel from. But they aren’t, and they don’t.”

Only one of the six automakers, Honda, responded to emailed questions from Canary Media. But the Japanese firm declined to comment on its steel suppliers.

“Honda is actively working to reduce CO₂ emissions associated with raw material procurement and manufacturing processes,” Honda spokesperson Chris Abbruzzese said in an email. ​“We do not publicly disclose individual supplier relationships.”

Automakers have traditionally relied on primary steel to form the outer shell of their cars because it’s long been considered higher quality than steel made from recycled scrap metal in electric arc furnaces. Increasingly, though, thanks to improvements in its purity and strength, so-called secondary steel has been able to displace some of that demand. Steel recyclers like Nucor say the auto sector represents a growing share of their customer base, but primary steel made using coal still dominates the sector.

To identify the buyers of primary U.S. steel, Mighty Earth commissioned the consultancy Empower LLC to conduct ​“an exhaustive review” of supply chains, according to the report. The analysts then reviewed ​“everything from annual reports and investor presentations to new articles and company websites, looking for clues regarding links between the steel facilities of interest and their ties to the largest U.S. automakers.” The study relied on supply chain and financial data from the platforms Panjiva, Sayari Graph, S&P Capital IQ, and MarkLines, and it used OpenRailwayMap to track materials shipped by train.

Since President Donald Trump returned to office a year ago, the nascent efforts to clean up America’s primary steel production have largely collapsed.

Cleveland-Cliffs, which had been awarded a $500 million grant from the Biden administration to finance construction of new, greener equipment at one of its Ohio steelworks, abandoned the initiative and is now working with Trump’s Energy Department to develop a coal-focused scope for the project.

U.S. Steel, whose sale to Japanese rival Nippon Steel was approved by the Trump administration, finds itself at a crossroads. The company has promised some greener investments in the U.S. but has yet to announce any specifics. Its new owner, however, has a reputation as ​“a coal company that also makes steel” — and Nippon has also promised to invest in upgrading U.S. Steel’s blast furnaces to last longer.

That leaves Hyundai’s project to build a low-carbon steel factory in Louisiana as the flagship push for clean steel in the U.S.

Despite recent challenges from the Trump administration, Hyundai has signaled its commitment to bringing the facility online by 2029. The plant is designed to first use blue hydrogen, the version of the fuel made with fossil gas and carbon capture equipment, to produce the cleaner direct reduced iron. But by the mid-2030s, the facility is expected to switch to green hydrogen, made with electrolyzers powered by renewables.

The low-carbon iron will then be fed into electric arc furnaces to produce steel — making it the first integrated low-carbon steel plant in the U.S. That Louisiana plant could reduce emissions by at least 75% relative to a traditional integrated steel plant with a blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace.

In a sign of progress, Hyundai this month announced plans to test its DRI equipment at an existing steelworks in South Korea in anticipation of bringing the technology to Louisiana.

Once that Louisiana plant comes online, Groch said, it’s expected to generate enough steel to meet Hyundai’s needs and supply additional potential buyers — opening up an opportunity for other automakers. In its report, Mighty Earth calls on automakers to commit to buying more green steel in the coming years.

General Motors and Ford have committed to buying at least 10% green steel by 2030 as part of a pledge via the First Movers Coalition, led by the World Economic Forum. Other global carmakers not included in Mighty Earth’s report, such as Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW, have adopted separate targets. Honda, Stellantis, and Toyota, meanwhile, have avoided making such promises.

Holding car companies to those targets has proved challenging. While some companies have vowed to slash emissions by buying more low-carbon steel, a September 2024 report by the International Council on Clean Transportation found that carmakers’ pledges to buy fossil-free steel by 2030 cover less than 2% of their total demand for the metal.

“We’re not asking for everyone to have 100% green steel,” Groch said. ​“But these are their commitments, and the car companies are the ones driving investment in steel.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GMC-factory_2026-01-22-015933_ynmi.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=19f91f7a316c3f2f3a030ab5a2f5e56c,N,,2026-01-22 05:59:12.038123

“It has been an extraordinarily destructive year,” said Rachel Cleetus, climate and energy policy director at the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists.
The Interior Department announced a $625 million investment to “reinvigorate and expand America’s coal industry” and directed a costly Michigan coal plant on the verge of closure to stay open.
Indeed, only a small fraction of the climate damage threatened by Trump is truly permanent, experts told Grist.
Trump’s climate blitzkrieg may be the starkest example yet of the benefits and drawbacks of that model.","One year ago, with one of the first strokes of his presidential Sharpie, President Donald Trump signed an executive order declaring a “national energy emergency,” making good on a campaign promise to “drill, baby, drill.” It was the first of many such orders, signaling that the championing of fossil fuels would be a cornerstone of the new administration: A subsequent order pledged to revitalize America’s waning coal industry, eliminate subsidies for electric vehicles approved by Congress under former president Joe Biden, and loosen regulations for domestic producers of fossil fuels. Yet another executive order withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, the nearly unanimously-adopted international treaty that coordinates the global fight against climate change. He resumed liquefied natural gas permitting paused by his predecessor and reopened United States coastlines to drilling.

In the days following his inauguration, Trump killed a climate jobs training program, closed off millions of acres of federal water designated for offshore wind development, reopened U.S. coastlines to drilling, and scrubbed mentions of climate change from some federal agency websites. To many observers, it looked like the most comprehensive reorientation of the executive branch’s environmental and climate priorities in American history.

On paper, it certainly appears as though Trump has continued to make good on these early promises. He pushed Congress to pass the so-called Big Beautiful Bill, which phases out an extensive set of tax credits — for wind and solar energy, electric vehicles, and other decarbonization tools — that were responsible for much of the progress the U.S. was expected to make toward its Paris Agreement commitments. (That move has already led some companies to abandon new clean energy projects.) Trump’s attacks on the nation’s offshore wind industry, which he recently called “so pathetic and so bad,” have been unrelenting, culminating in a blanket ban on offshore leases last month. A few weeks ago, he upped the ante on his earlier withdrawal from the Paris Agreement by severing ties with the United Nations framework that facilitates international cooperation on matters of climate change, environmental health, and resilience — a treaty that was ratified unanimously by the U.S. Senate in 1992.

“It has been an extraordinarily destructive year,” said Rachel Cleetus, climate and energy policy director at the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists. It’s not hard to find specific moves that have already done tangible harm to the climate: The EPA, for instance, delayed a requirement that oil and gas operators reduce emissions of methane, an ultra-potent and fast-acting greenhouse gas, for a full year. The Interior Department announced a $625 million investment to “reinvigorate and expand America’s coal industry” and directed a costly Michigan coal plant on the verge of closure to stay open.

However, while these moves have been effective in sowing panic and uncertainty, their long-term effects on the country’s climate policy framework are far from certain. Indeed, only a small fraction of the climate damage threatened by Trump is truly permanent, experts told Grist. That’s not only because many of Trump’s moves may ultimately be ruled illegal — federal judges in Rhode Island and New York, for instance, allowed offshore wind farms in those states to resume construction just last week — but also because executive actions can be reversed by a future president. And the president has not shown much interest in passing energy- or climate-related legislation, a far more durable form of policymaking than executive decree. Despite claims to the contrary, Trump has signed fewer bills than any president since Dwight D. Eisenhower.

“He is not changing law,” said Elaine Kamarck, who worked in the Clinton administration and is the founding director of the Brookings Institution’s Center for Effective Public Management. “He is changing practice.”

Even something as unprecedented as the EPA’s moves to relinquish its own authority to regulate the emissions that affect human health — a responsibility that comprises a core tenet part of the agency’s mission and is therefore widely regarded as unlikely to hold up in court — could be unraveled by a future administration even if it’s ruled to be legal, though that process would take years.

“You can’t make up for the lost time, the increased emissions, and the extent that new areas are opened up for [fossil fuel] exploration,” said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. “But from a regulatory perspective, what this administration is doing to EPA and the other agencies are all executive actions that can be undone in the same way they were done.”

The major exception is the GOP’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA. If a future administration wants to restore expansive tax credits for wind and solar energy, that president will have to push Congress to pass new climate legislation. But the climate-relevant portions of OBBBA are noteworthy for being subtractive rather than additive — and are perhaps more accurately viewed as a representation of Trump’s quest to refute former President Biden’s legacy than a desire to radically alter U.S. energy law. Indeed, the new law left in place tax credits for other sources of carbon-free energy, including nuclear and geothermal — something that more moderate Republicans who do not share the president’s dismissal of climate science have been quick to note.

“We like to point out that the baseload clean energy credits were maintained,” said Luke Bolar, head of external affairs and communications at ClearPath, a think tank that develops conservative climate policies. Sean Casten, a Democratic U.S. Representative from Illinois, said that the goal of the Biden-era climate legislation — ensuring that U.S. clean energy can be built in a cost-competitive way — has largely been achieved even if specific parts of the law have been repealed.

“Every single zero-carbon power source … is still cheaper on the margin than a fuel energy source,” he said.

The relative fragility of Trump’s assault on bedrock environmental and climate laws could be a product of the president’s prioritization of political dominance over lasting change, said Josh Freed, senior vice president for climate and energy at the think tank Third Way.

For example, the administration has taken steps to shield the American coal industry from the punishing blows of competition, environmental regulation, and the rising costs of mining. Trump has signed an executive order aimed at “reinvigorating America’s beautiful clean coal industry,” granted coal-fired power plants temporary exemptions from emissions limits, and ended a federal moratorium on coal leasing. But those interventions will do little in the long run to reverse a decline driven mainly by economics: The nation’s aging coal plants are becoming increasingly expensive to run while natural gas and solar energy have only gotten cheaper. And they certainly don’t help the president’s stated goal of reducing household energy costs.

To attempt to make sense of the president’s crusade to save coal is to assume there is a larger political strategy at play — which may not be the case, Freed said.

“There’s no reason to bring back coal other than to show that the administration can bring back coal,” he said. “It’s not like there’s this huge lobbying effort or donor base that will be of significant benefit to MAGA or Republicans if they do it.”

A style of governance motivated by political dominance is a good way to make headlines, but it’s not a particularly effective way to build a lasting legacy. Trump’s efforts to buoy coal may help the industry in the short term, but experts are broadly in agreement that coal can’t be “saved” without sustained support from the federal government. And an industry that can only survive with a coal-friendly Republican in the Oval Office isn’t exactly thriving.

“When you have to get the government to step in to put its thumb on the scale in order to help your industry,” Sean Feaster, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, told my colleagues earlier this week, “it’s a sign that you’re not particularly competitive, right?”

For decades now, the pendulum of U.S. climate policy has swung left and right, reflecting the priorities of the sitting president. Trump’s climate blitzkrieg may be the starkest example yet of the benefits and drawbacks of that model. But despite his best efforts to stand out from the pack, the president’s first year back in office fits a well-worn pattern. As a result, his victories may not last much longer than his presidency.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/trump-climate-legacy.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2026-01-22 04:57:32.508643

On her first day in office Tuesday, New Jersey Democratic Gov. Mikie Sherrill signed executive orders seeking to freeze electricity cost increases, issue ratepayer relief in the form of bill credits, and increase distributed energy resources, including utility-scale solar and battery storage.

One order directed the state’s Board of Public Utilities to ensure bill credits by July 1 and to “consider pursuing a pause, abeyance, or modification of the schedule governing any proceedings in which electric distribution utilities seek approvals for rate increases or cost recoveries.” It also ordered the board to publish a study within 180 days of how to “modernize” the traditional electric utility business model, including opportunities to make utility revenue models “less dependent on capital spending.”

Another order focused on growing the state’s electricity supply and increasing efficiency. It directed regulators to initiate solicitations for solar and transmission-scale battery storage and to begin development of a virtual power plant program to be administered by electric distribution utilities and third-party suppliers in the state.

Dive Insight:

Sherrill, who made affordability and rising energy prices a focus of her campaign, said in her inaugural speech that the orders “will deliver relief to consumers and stop rate hikes.”

“This will also create the conditions to massively expand New Jersey’s power generation, because more power in-state will help lower costs,” she said.

Electric rates were a key issue in the governor’s race, particularly after bills spiked as much as 20% last year. Another increase is slated to go into effect this summer. The increases are a result of higher capacity prices in PJM’s recent auctions, which are held several years in advance and reflect both current and projected power demand.

Residential bill credits will rely on the same or similar funding sources used in August 2025 to provide credits, according to Sherrill’s first executive order. Last year, the BPU said all 3.9 million New Jersey residential ratepayers of Public Service Electric and Gas, Atlantic City Electric, Jersey Central Power and Light, and Rockland Electric would receive $100 in direct bill assistance.

PSE&G emailed a statement responding to Sherrill’s orders, saying “steps must be taken to safeguard long-term energy reliability and cost effectiveness for residents as New Jersey relies on imported electricity for more than 40% of its power.”

“We are confident that open dialogue and information sharing will lead to workable solutions,” the utility said.

Grid advocates hailed the governor’s focus on developing new sources of energy.

“These executive orders are tackling peak demand, unlocking customer-sited resources, and speeding deployment of solar and storage,” Katie Mettle, New Jersey state lead at Advanced Energy United, said in a statement.

According to the second executive order, the BPU has 45 days to initiate a solicitation “for qualifying solar facilities or solar facilities in combination with storage” under the state’s Competitive Solar Incentive program. Within the same timeframe, the BPU must also open 3 GW of capacity for registration under New Jersey’s Community Solar Energy Program, “endeavoring to expedite the registration process by any necessary and appropriate means.”

Regulators must also accelerate the development of grid-scale storage through the Garden State Energy Storage Program by holding a solicitation within 45 days, launching Phase 2 of the program within 90 days, and “thereafter establishing a specific tranche of capacity for electric distribution utilities to develop to support interconnection of distributed energy resources and grid stability.”

And, within 180 days, the BPU must begin development of a virtual power plant program that aims “to drive down peak demand by aggregating behind-the-meter distributed energy resources.”

“Virtual power plants are a proven, cost-effective way to lower peak demand, improve reliability, and put downward pressure on energy bills,” AEU’s Mettle said.

She was delighted to see how fast vibe coding could give her the command codes she needed.
That quick win in generating command codes led Wilton and Computational Biologist Nick Chia to think about other ways vibe coding could help.
He said vibe coding can help him explain his work to the many collaborators from different backgrounds that he works with.","It started with a social media post from Andrej Karpathy, one of the founders of OpenAI. Last year, he tweeted, ​“There’s a new kind of coding I call ​‘vibe coding,’ where you fully give into the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists.” Karpathy said that large language models and voice-to-text programs had gotten so sophisticated that he could just ask a model to create something and then copy and paste the code it generated to build a project or create a web app from scratch. ​“I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy-paste stuff, and it mostly works.”

That groovy technique might be good for patching a glitchy website or building a phone app, but can it really change the way we do science? Researchers from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory are testing vibe coding tools and techniques to see how they stand up to data-intensive scientific challenges. At a recent hackathon, researchers from across the lab gathered to learn together and test commercially available coding tools like Cursor and Warp against scientific challenges as large and hairy as the hunt for dark matter and as pressing as the optimization of nuclear power plants.

As a long-time leader in computational science and the home of Aurora, one of the world’s fastest and most powerful supercomputers, Argonne is no stranger to grand challenges. But to solve huge problems and to process more data than ever before, researchers are working to stay at the bleeding edge of harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) for science.

“With these tools, you’re not bottlenecked by writing code. Now, you’re focused on ideas.” — Rick Stevens, associate laboratory director for Computing, Environment and Life Sciences

Rick Stevens sees vibe coding as another way Argonne researchers can continue to speed up scientific innovation. Stevens is the associate laboratory director for Computing, Environment and Life Sciences at Argonne. He has said that scientists need to be able to work as fast as they can think. He gets frustrated by the bottlenecks of current technology. But vibe coding is a productivity hack. ​“You’re unhobbled from your coding speed,” said Stevens.

With vibe coding, researchers can interact with large language models in real time, asking them questions by talking rather than by typing commands, and then getting usable output in seconds or minutes. Stevens compared it to having an AI co-scientist — or even a team of co-scientists — working alongside you. He challenged fellow scientists to work with the technology every day. ​“You need to get your head around how to be productive in this environment,” he said. ​“Think, play and have a blast!”

Breaking barriers between ideas and action

Part of the excitement around vibe coding is that we don’t know how it’s going to change science. At the hackathon, the vibe in the room was playful. The group was a mix of coders and non-coders from a variety of disciplines. Instead of quietly pecking away at their keyboards, researchers were laughing, bouncing ideas off each other and confidently speaking commands to their laptops.

The promise of AI and vibe coding isn’t just about doing science faster, Stevens explained. These tools free up scientists to be more creative, to put their energy toward things that only a human can do. ​“With these tools, you’re not bottlenecked by writing code,” he said. ​“Now, you’re focused on ideas.”

Here are some of the ideas Argonne scientists are vibing on:

1. Prototyping software to strengthen nuclear power plants

Nuclear power plants are an integral part of America’s energy supply and a reliable source of power for the growing energy needs of AI. Nuclear engineer Yeni Li and her team are creating AI models of those power plants to help plant engineers and managers predict the best times for maintenance. That knowledge can lead to more reliable and affordable energy production.

Li said that vibe coding will be useful for setting up the software architecture she needs to turn her ideas into prototypes. ​“These tools will help us do a few days of work in a single afternoon,” said Li.

2. Automating workflows in bioscience

Rosemarie Wilton doesn’t do a lot of coding in her work as a molecular biologist, but she does spend a significant amount of time using software tools for data analysis. Developing Python-coded pipelines would allow her to automate her data processing workflows and integrate multiple tools seamlessly. She was delighted to see how fast vibe coding could give her the command codes she needed. ​“For a coding novice, it’s really quite amazing. It will be a time saver,” she said.

That quick win in generating command codes led Wilton and Computational Biologist Nick Chia to think about other ways vibe coding could help. Chia mused, ​“If we have an AI agent generating hypotheses for experiments, could we create another AI agent to order the chemicals or samples needed to run those experiments?” Speeding up routine processes like these could help Wilton and her team track the spread of human pathogens with greater accuracy or engineer new enzymes and biosynthetic pathways faster than ever before.

3. Translating coding languages in science infrastructure

Zachary Sherman is a software developer who manages open-source Python tools for the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement group. He came to the hackathon looking for ways to quickly translate other coding languages into Python, a task that could take years of tedious manual coding.

“There are many different atmospheric tools in different coding languages and also databases with application programming interfaces for downloading and interacting with atmospheric datasets,” said Sherman. ​“Some of these tools are outdated. We think vibe coding can help us create tools in Python to interact with these interfaces to download and work with the datasets. We also think vibe coding will help us modernize these code bases so we can troubleshoot issues faster and save time and money as we maintain essential scientific infrastructure.”

4. Understanding the nature of the universe

Chiara Bissolotti is a nuclear physicist trying to understand how all known particles interact. Tim Hobbs is a theoretical particle physicist trying to identify unknown particles that can help us understand the nature of dark matter or other possible ​“new physics” in the universe. Both of their fields generate huge amounts of data from theoretical computer simulations, cosmological observations and experiments at research institutions such as CERN’s Large Hadron Collider and the planned Electron-Ion Collider at DOE’s Brookhaven National Laboratory. The information hidden where their data sets overlap could be the key to answering some of the biggest mysteries of the universe, from quarks to the cosmos. But merging those data sets is a monumental task if you’re coding and comparing them by hand.

“Can the data sets talk to each other?” asked Hobbs. ​“Might they be hiding common patterns, or guide us toward novel theoretical predictions or the automation of burdensome calculations?”

Bissolotti summed it up, ​“We have many, many ideas. Many more ideas than time. If vibe coding can help us build the scaffolding of the code or help us make the data comparisons more scalable and efficient, we can cut our time to solution by a huge factor.”

5. Collaborating on complex problems in national security

Jonathan Ozik is a computational scientist who uses supercomputers and simulations to understand large and complex systems across many scientific domains, such as biological systems, health care interventions and infectious diseases in urban settings. He said vibe coding can help him explain his work to the many collaborators from different backgrounds that he works with. He also sees it as a way that he can help himself switch between complex projects. ​“It could give me a two-minute reintroduction to the code and the context I’m working in,” he said. ​“There’s no reason not to try to make your daily tasks easier.”

Ozik predicts vibe coding will open research up to ideas we can’t yet begin to imagine: ​“If you have fewer perceived barriers, you create new possibilities. Things that were previously infeasible in science will become common.”",https://www.anl.gov/sites/www/files/2026-01/34276D_0034_CELS_AI%20Jam_PRINT_16x9.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 06:37:57.662590

It accounts for roughly 16% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is a major driver of climate change.
He also said uniform EPA rules provided regulatory certainty for changes operators saw as inevitable.
Colin Leyden, Texas state director and energy lead at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, said eliminating the program could hurt Texas industry.
Leyden said tallying up the dollar value of lives saved when evaluating pollution rules is a foundational principle of the EPA since its creation.","The first year of President Trump’s second term has seen an aggressive rollback of federal environmental protections, which advocacy groups fear will bring more pollution, higher health risks, and less information and power for Texas communities, especially in heavily industrial and urban areas.

Within Trump’s first 100 days in office, his new Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Lee Zeldin, announced a sweeping slate of 31 deregulatory actions. The list, which Zeldin called the agency’s “greatest day of deregulation,” targeted everything from soot standards and power plant pollution rules to the Endangerment Finding, the legal and scientific foundation that obligates the EPA to regulate climate-changing pollution under the Clean Air Act.

Since then, the agency froze research grants, shrank its workforce, and removed some references to climate change and environmental justice from its website — moves that environmental advocates say send a clear signal: the EPA’s new direction will come at the expense of public health.

Cyrus Reed, conservation director of the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club, said Texas is one of the states that feels EPA policy changes directly because the state has shown little interest in stepping up its environmental enforcement as the federal government scales back.

“If we were a state that was open to doing our own regulations there’d be less impact from these rollbacks,” Reed said. “But we’re not.”

“Now we have an EPA that isn’t interested in enforcing its own rules,” he added.

Richard Richter, a spokesperson at the state’s environmental agency, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, said in a statement that the agency takes protecting public health and natural resources seriously and acts consistently and quickly to enforce federal and state environmental laws when they’re violated.

Methane rules put on pause

A major EPA move centers on methane, a potent greenhouse gas that traps heat far more efficiently than carbon dioxide over the short term. It accounts for roughly 16% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is a major driver of climate change. In the U.S., the largest source of methane emissions is the energy sector, especially in Texas, the nation’s top oil and gas producer.

In 2024, the Biden administration finalized long-anticipated rules requiring oil and gas operators to sharply reduce methane emissions from wells, pipelines, and storage facilities. The rule, developed with industry input, targeted leaks, equipment failures, and routine flaring, the burning off of excess natural gas at the wellhead.

Under the rule, operators would have been required to monitor emissions, inspect sites with gas-imaging cameras for leaks, and phase out routine flaring. States are required to come up with a plan to implement the rule, but Texas has yet to do so. Under Trump’s EPA, that deadline has been extended until January 2027 — an 18-month postponement.

Texas doesn’t have a rule to capture escaping methane emissions from energy infrastructure. Richter, the TCEQ spokesperson, said the agency continues to work toward developing the state plan.

Adrian Shelley, Texas director of the watchdog group Public Citizen, said the rule represented a rare moment of alignment between environmentalists and major oil and gas producers.

“I think the fossil fuel industry generally understood that this was the direction the planet and their industry was moving,” he said. He also said uniform EPA rules provided regulatory certainty for changes operators saw as inevitable.

Reed, the Sierra Club conservation director, said the delay of methane rules means Texas still has no plan to reduce emissions, while neighboring New Mexico already has imposed its own state methane emission rules that require the industry to detect and repair methane leaks and ban routine venting and flaring.

These regulations have cut methane emissions in the New Mexico portion of the Permian Basin — the oil-rich area that covers West Texas and southeast New Mexico — to half that of Texas, according to a recent data analysis by the Environmental Defense Fund. That’s despite New Mexico doubling production since 2020.

A retreat from soot standards

Fine particulate matter or PM 2.5, one of six pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act, has been called by researchers the deadliest form of air pollution.

In 2024, the EPA under President Biden strengthened air rules for particulate matter by lowering the annual limit from 12 to 9 micrograms per cubic meter. It was the first update since 2012 and one of the most ambitious pieces of Biden’s environmental agenda, driven by mounting evidence that particulate pollution is linked to premature death, heart disease, asthma, and other respiratory illnesses.

After the rule was issued, 24 Republican-led states, including Kentucky and West Virginia, sued to revert to the weaker standard. Texas filed a separate suit asking to block the rule’s recent expansion.

State agencies are responsible for enforcing the federal standards. The TCEQ is charged with creating a list of counties that exceed the federal standard and submitting those recommendations to Gov. Greg Abbott, who then finalizes the designations and submits them to the EPA.

Under the 9 microgram standard, parts of Texas, including Dallas, Harris (which includes Houston), Tarrant (Fort Worth), and Bowie (Texarkana) counties, were in the process of being designated nonattainment areas — which, when finalized, would trigger a legal requirement for the state to develop a plan to clean up the air.

That process stalled after Trump returned to office. Gov. Greg Abbott submitted his designations to EPA last February, but EPA has not yet acted on his designations, according to Richter, the TCEQ spokesperson.

In a court filing last year, the Trump EPA asked a federal appeals court to vacate the stricter standard, bypassing the traditional notice and comment administrative process.

For now, the rule technically remains in effect, but environmental advocates say the EPA’s retreat undermines enforcement of the rule and signals to polluters that it may be short-lived.

Shelley, with Public Citizen, believes the PM2.5 rule would have delivered the greatest health benefit of any EPA regulation affecting Texas, particularly through reductions in diesel pollution from trucks.

“I still hold out hope that it will come back,” he said.

Unraveling the climate framework

Beyond individual pollutants, the Trump EPA has moved to dismantle the federal architecture for addressing climate change.

Among the proposals is eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which requires power plants, refineries, and oil and gas suppliers to report annual emissions. The proposal has drawn opposition from both environmental groups and industry, which relies on the data for planning and compliance.

Colin Leyden, Texas state director and energy lead at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, said eliminating the program could hurt Texas industry. If methane emissions are no longer reported, then buyers and investors of natural gas, for example, won’t have an official way to measure how much methane pollution is associated with that gas, according to Leyden. That makes it harder to judge how “clean” or “climate-friendly” the product is, which international buyers are increasingly demanding.

“This isn’t just bad for the planet,” he said. “It makes the Texas industry less competitive.”

The administration also proposed last year rescinding the Endangerment Finding, issued in 2009, which obligates the EPA to regulate climate pollution. Most recently, the EPA said it will stop calculating how much money is saved in health care costs as a result of air pollution regulations that curb particulate matter 2.5 and ozone, a component of smog. Both can cause respiratory and health problems.

Leyden said tallying up the dollar value of lives saved when evaluating pollution rules is a foundational principle of the EPA since its creation.

“That really erodes the basic idea that (the EPA) protects health and safety and the environment,” he said.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/EPA_AP_25184671279040_NAT_0703,N,,2026-01-22 14:40:43.823425

Ørsted, Equinor, and Dominion Energy all got the green light from federal judges last week to resume work on their massive, multibillion-dollar wind farms off America’s east coast. The companies wasted no time restarting the installation of turbines, offshore substations, and other equipment — eager to make up for delays that had cost each of them millions of dollars a day and threatened to tank at least one project that is more than halfway complete.

The developers had been stuck in limbo since receiving the Dec. 22 suspension order from the U.S. Interior Department, which cited unspecified ​“reasons of national security” — a rationale that failed to convince federal judges as they weighed developers’ requests for relief. Two other in-progress projects remain mired by delays as they await hearings.

The late-December order was the culmination of the Trump administration’s yearlong assault on offshore wind, which has managed to freeze new development but has been less successful in stopping projects already underway. Most of the five projects are in advanced stages of construction and viewed as critical by grid planners for keeping electricity reliable and affordable. These offshore wind farms are likely the only ones that will get built nationwide in the coming years because of Trump’s interventions.

Dominion Energy, which is developing the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project, said it delivered the first batch of turbine components by ship to its leasing area off Virginia Beach, Virginia, last weekend and is now installing the first of its 176 turbines. All the turbine foundations are already in place for the $11.2 billion project, and the utility is working to start producing power in the first quarter of this year.

The wind farm is expected to supply 2.6 gigawatts of clean electricity to the grid when fully completed later this year — power that the region can’t afford to lose, according to the mid-Atlantic grid operator PJM Interconnection.

In a Jan. 13 court brief supporting Dominion Energy, PJM said the offshore wind project would help with the ​“acute need for new power generation to meet demand” in the 13-state region, much of which is being driven by the boom in AI data centers. ​“Further delay of the project will cause irreparable harm to the 67 million residents of this region that depend on continued reliable delivery of electricity,” according to PJM’s filing.

Meanwhile, off the coast of Rhode Island, Ørsted has resumed construction on the 704-megawatt Revolution Wind project, which was nearly 90% complete when the federal stop-work order came late last month. The Danish energy giant was hit with a similar order in August, which a federal judge lifted in September given the lack of any ​“factual findings” by the Trump administration.

Of Revolution Wind’s 65 wind turbines, 58 are already in place, as are the cables and substations needed to bring the power to shore. At the time of the December suspension, the $6.2 billion project had been expected to start generating power as soon as this month, according to Ørsted.

Equinor, which had also previously received a separate stop-work order, is back to work on its 810-MW Empire Wind project off the coast of Long Island, New York.

The developer recently warned that the $5 billion project, which is more than 60% complete, would likely face cancellation if work couldn’t resume by Jan. 16; it won a favorable ruling on Jan. 15. Molly Morris, president of Equinor Renewables America, said the project is using a heavy-lift vessel that is available at the project site only until February, The City reported. After that, Equinor wouldn’t have been able to lease the vessel for another year, creating untenable project delays.

A spokesperson for Equinor said the company now expects to complete work assigned to the vessel, which includes installing an offshore substation, following the injunction ruling.

Continuing construction on America’s offshore wind farms ​“is good news for stressed power grids on the East Coast,” Hillary Bright, executive director of the advocacy group Turn Forward, said in a statement last week. She added that if projects aren’t allowed to advance, the electricity system in the heavily populated region will be ​“more likely to experience reliability issues and see ratepayer bills soar.”

Americans’ utility bills are already climbing nationwide, owing in large part to the rising prices and constrained supplies of fossil gas. Residents in colder-climate states are especially feeling the squeeze this winter — though early data shows that existing offshore wind operations are helping reduce electricity costs in some places.

Vineyard Wind, a 800-MW wind farm off the coast of Massachusetts, has been sending power to the grid from 30 of its planned 62 turbines since last October. On Dec. 7, an especially chilly day, the project’s wind output helped displace a significant amount of fossil gas on the wholesale market, resulting in savings of more than $2 million for New England ratepayers over the course of the day, Amanda Barker, the clean energy program manager with Green Energy Consumers Alliance, said on a Jan. 21 press call.

Vineyard Wind is one of the two projects waiting to resume construction in the wake of Interior’s December suspension order. Its developers, Avangrid and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, sued the federal government on Jan. 15, becoming the last of the affected firms to seek legal relief from the Trump administration’s attacks. Vineyard Wind is now 95% complete, with all but one of its turbines now hovering over the Atlantic Ocean.

The second stalled project, Sunrise Wind, is an Ørsted development off the coast of New York. The 924-MW wind farm is almost 50% complete and, before the stop-work order, was expected to come online in 2026. A court hearing for the development is scheduled for Feb. 2, and the delay is costing Ørsted millions of dollars in the meantime.

Overall, the court orders from last week represent a win for getting more electricity onto the grid during a time of rising demand — and another round of setbacks for Trump’s efforts to destroy the fledgling sector.

Still, it’s hard to say whether this marks the administration’s final attempt to stymie projects or whether more delay tactics are coming for America’s beleaguered offshore wind projects.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/ECO-Liberty-at-monopile-in-lease-area.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=843205a0185a822d0ddeb8562887f93f,N,,2026-01-22 06:38:02.238363

Read more here.

The Principles-- supported by every governor from the 13 PJM states-- build on years of leadership by Governor Shapiro, who has been sounding the alarm since early in his term that PJM’s failures would force Pennsylvanians to pay more while getting nothing in return.

The PJM Interconnection released this statement on January 16 in response to the proposal-- “PJM is reviewing the principles set forth by the White House and governors.

“The PJM Board’s decision, resulting from a multi-month stakeholder process on integrating large load addition [was released the same day as the White House/governors’ proposal. Read more here.]

“The Board has been deliberating on this issue since the end of that stakeholder process. We will work with our stakeholders to assess how the White House directive aligns with the Board’s decision.”

Support For Statement Of Principles

Voices from across the energy economy are echoing the warning raised by the White House/governors’ Statement of Principles and endorsing the plan as the clearest path forward.

Utilities and Power Producers

-- Exelon President and CEO Calvin Butler: “But the high energy supply costs our customers face demand long-term solutions. This is the kind of early action needed to move beyond 20th-century approaches and toward modern energy solutions that meet today’s demands. Exelon is continuing our all-of-the-above efforts in states to address the insufficient energy supply and increasing demand at the heart of high energy supply costs through utility-generated power.”

-- PPL President and Chief Executive Officer Vincent Sorgi: “We continue to believe that whoever is able and willing to build new generation should be encouraged to do so. And at PPL, we are absolutely willing and able to be part of the solution.”

-- Talen Energy CEO Mac McFarland: “Not surprisingly, Friday’s announcement calls for large load customers to pay for this new generation. We agree with most observers that the costs of electricity should be paid by those that use the electricity. Electricity should be affordable and reliable for household consumers. The mechanisms for allocating these costs, however, need to be considered thoughtfully so they do not disincentivize the tremendous economic development that large loads, including data centers, can bring to our communities. We applaud the White House and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s efforts in this area and think reasonable minds can find the right means to allocate burdens appropriately.”

Technology Companies

-- Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith: “Microsoft thanks President Trump and the governors for their leadership on this important issue, and we welcome the bipartisan effort to expand America’s energy generation capacity while protecting Americans from higher costs. This is a strong starting point, and we look forward to engaging with stakeholders as this important work moves forward.”

-- Google: “We agree data centers should pay their own way. For us, it is table stakes. When built responsibly, data centers can provide long-term, reliable demand that stimulates new investments in energy production and transmission in a way that helps all consumers.”

-- Amazon Chief Global Affairs and Legal Officer David Zapolsky: “[Amazon] is paying our full energy costs and is committed to ensuring our data centers don’t increase consumers’ electricity bills.”

Energy and Consumer Advocates and Experts

-- Vote Solar Mid-Atlantic Regional Director Elowyn Corby: “Holding data centers accountable and making them responsible for their own costs is a big step in the right direction… The Shapiro administration can and should point to the extension of the price cap that is part of this plan as a big win that honestly wouldn’t have happened without them.”

-- ITI Executive Vice President of Public Sector Gordon Bitko: “The tech industry remains committed to making investments to modernize the grid and working to offset costs for ratepayers as demand for digital and AI-powered services continues to grow.”

-- Advance Energy United CEO Heather O’Neill: “Advanced energy companies will be first in line to meet data center demand if this proposal is implemented in a way that’s fair and competitive. However, significant hurdles remain. We will never meet our growing energy needs until the grid operator PJM makes it easier for advanced energy projects to connect to the power grid.”

Extending Price Cap

If the price cap is implemented as proposed, the extended price cap would save more than 67 million consumers — including 13 million Pennsylvanians — within the PJM region approximately $27 billion over the next two years with $5 billion in Pennsylvania alone.

These savings would be in addition to the $18.2 billion already saved as a direct result of Governor Shapiro’s 2024 lawsuit.

Together, these reforms are designed to lower costs, strengthen reliability, and finally fix PJM’s broken process — allowing economic growth and data center development to continue without burdening ratepayers.

Donald Trump streamlined regulation to encourage data center development with his Accelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure executive order.

Stories will focus on data center expansion, solar development, the impact to farmers losing land and possible solutions.

Rural communities across the United States are experiencing tech-driven development pressure as electricity-hungry technologies like artificial intelligence take center stage. While high-density regions are accustomed to curating development via local mechanisms like zoning and deed restrictions, others aren’t as prepared.

The federal government uses incentives, or the lack thereof, to broadly influence this development. In August, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins announced that the agency would nix Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act tax credits for wind and solar development on productive ag land by the end of 2027. The USDA also significantly rolled back its Rural Energy for America Program (REAP), which provides grants and loans to agricultural producers for renewable energy systems and efficiency improvements.

Rather than commercial solar developers, REAP beneficiaries are mostly individual farmers looking to lower on-farm energy costs by installing panels on farm shed roofs, according Samantha Levy, senior policy manager for conservation and energy at the advocacy organization American Farmland Trust.

“It’s one of those instances where the idea or the rhetoric is perhaps reflecting a sentiment that they would like to see achieved, but the policy thus far is not the tool that’s really going to be changing this broader challenge,” she said.

There are other policies, both favorable and restrictive, for tech-driven development in the legislative pipeline:

Protecting American Farmland Act. Introduced by Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., it would explicitly prohibit solar development on prime farmland as defined by the Farmland Protection Policy Act. It is currently in committee.

SPEED Act. Already passed by the House, the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act would streamline projects covered by the National Environmental Policy Act. This could benefit both oil and gas, and renewable energy, and is relevant given data centers’ skyrocketing energy needs.

Political rhetoric

Despite the Trump administration’s pivot away from clean energy, Jeff Risley, executive director of Renewable Energy Farmers of America, expects clean-energy development on rural land to find an “equilibrium” and continue “because [electricity] demand is greatly increasing.”

“The market is going to reward the cheapest and fastest that can come on line, and that’s wind and solar,” he said. Some farmers point toward alternative clean-energy sources like nuclear power as a better option; however, powerplants take decades to build, and more electricity is needed now.

Given that, Risley argued that solar is targeted “for political reasons and not practical reasons. Imagine standing up to one of your landowner neighbors and saying, ‘You can’t drill for oil on your land. I don’t want to see a pump jack out there.’”

Risley said this is also true of wind turbines, which take up minimal acreage and don’t impact crop production that much. He said farmers who want to sell or lease their land for clean energy or tech-driven development should be able to do so.

“Aesthetics are not a good argument. They’re just not. Viewshed is not a good argument. Of course, we believe in zoning. We believe that communities need to be involved in the process. They absolutely do. But it needs to be civil and it needs to be a rational conversation about what’s best for everybody,” he says.

States are also taking action. Many pay landowners to voluntarily restrict development on their property through Purchase of Agricultural Conservation Easements agreements. Others tax land on its agricultural value rather than market potential. Missouri is attempting more drastic action via “a bill that would put a moratorium on any solar development, even if it’s under construction at this point, to be able to write statewide regulations on this type of thing,” Risley continues. Rather than moratoriums, Risley emphasized a need for better local-level regulation because every community is unique.

In Ohio, broader protectionary policies are gaining traction. Gerry Puckett, director of communications and industry relations with Ohio Corn and Wheat, points to House Bill 15, which was recently codified into law by the Ohio General Assembly, as a good example. The legislation promotes energy generation on brownfields and abandoned sites. He says it’s good for both urban and rural residents.

“We have areas in our state that could use redevelopment for energy projects,” Puckett says. “That’s a benefit not only to the people who live in those communities, but to all Ohioans. And it helps protect land that will never return to farming otherwise.”

Data center support

Concurrent to sundowning its solar energy incentives, the federal government is working to rapidly expand data centers, which house artificial intelligence and cloud-based digital infrastructure. They’re driving the increasing energy demand that solar arrays and wind farms aim to feed. In July, Pres. Donald Trump streamlined regulation to encourage data center development with his Accelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure executive order.

“We will pursue bold, large-scale industrial plans to vault the United States further into the lead on critical manufacturing processes and technologies that are essential to national security, economic prosperity and scientific leadership,” Trump stated in the order. “It will be a priority of my administration to facilitate the rapid and efficient buildout of this infrastructure by easing federal regulatory burdens.”

Alongside this buildout, Trump’s order supports constructing the high-voltage transmission lines and adjacent power facilities that power the data centers.

“It’s incredible. Many of them are under construction already. We’re leading AI,” Trump said during a White House briefing in early January.

This push is taking America’s rural spaces by storm. Levy compares it to the early days of commercial solar development.“This is an emerging issue the way solar was eight or nine years ago. It took us time to ‘get over our skis on it’ and really understand it from a thoughtful perspective. What’s happening? What’s needed? How does this impact our mission?” Levy said. “Policymaking is trying to get on top of it",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt61a1feb8f1185447/69714beb66a9989ad3cbf12b/0119H1-5640A-1800x1012.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-22 05:37:57.202780

Work will likely begin next year for the 2028 Green Cincinnati Plan.","Cincinnati officials say the city is on track to meet ambitious climate reduction goals in the Green Cincinnati Plan despite reduced support from the federal government.

""When we look at the 130 actions in the GCP, more than 85% of them are in progress or completed,"" said Director of Environment and Sustainability Ollie Kroner, presenting to a City Council committee Wednesday.

The city has seen a 39.6% reduction in carbon emissions since 2006, on track to meet the goal of 50% reduction by 2030 and full carbon neutrality by 2050. Kroner says the city's data lags by a couple of years.

""We need to collect that data, and it will come online and will give us a sense of whether we continue to remain on track or if something has changed,"" Kroner told Council members. ""So I remain optimistic that we can get there. Is it a guarantee? No.""

Kroner says the United States as a whole increased carbon emissions last year. That will likely show up in the local data when it becomes available.

A changing climate

It's been a year of significant change at the federal level, especially when it comes to funding. Kroner says the city secured $50 million in federal climate grants during the Biden administration.

""I think you're familiar with what has happened over the last year,"" Kroner said. ""Much of that funding has been canceled or is tied up in litigation, and we await to see what happens. So that $50 million looks closer to $18 million today.""

One of the grants in active litigation is nearly $10 million for a new solar array on a former landfill in Winton Hills. The city is moving forward with the project using an alternate funding plan.

The city currently can generate more than 100 megawatts of power a year through the city-owned solar array in Highland County and small solar installations on city facilities.

Despite the large reduction in federal support, Kroner says he's optimistic.

""Most of this work has happened without federal investment for 15, 20 years,"" he said. ""We've been able to demonstrate a lot of progress through our own funding. There are community partnerships where we've been able to move the needle. So the Inflation Reduction Act was very exciting because it presented an opportunity to accelerate in the scale, and we still seek those opportunities, but we're not held back.""

The Green Cincinnati Plan also includes goals on topics like increasing recycling and reducing food waste.

The set of climate change-related goals was first launched in 2008 and is updated every five years, most recently in 2023. Work will likely begin next year for the 2028 Green Cincinnati Plan.

Kroner says the next few years will be defined by energy generation and use. Artificial intelligence and the cost of energy are both rapidly increasing; that means mounting pressure to shift to renewable energy sources.

Even Saudi Arabia is ramping up its clean energy capacity, with the 2025 launch of its multibillion-dollar Greenfield solar projects. And in Latin America, nearly 70% of electricity now comes from renewables, as solar, wind, and biofuels see significant increases across the region.

3. The AI revolution needs clean energy to continue

OpenAI CEO and AI billionaire Sam Altman has called for an ""energy breakthrough"" to meet the voracious energy appetites for AI data centers, which are projected to consume as much electricity as the entire nation of Japan by 2030.

In a 2024 summit, Altman said that increased renewables, in particular cheaper solar power and storage, were the way forward. His comments are seconded by Elon Musk, who warned last year that AI's electricity needs could lead to rampant power shortages.

The world will turn to fossil fuels to meet some of this demand. But the energy shortage will further drive interest in renewables, which aren't locked into a zero-sum battle with fossil fuels as many people assume.

A ""catch-all"" way to play this trend

The iShares Global Clean Energy ETF could still be in the early days of its rally as the renewables transition accelerates in 2026.

As an exchange-traded fund, it has over 100 holdings, with broad exposure across renewable energy sectors from solar to wind power to fuel cells. Its largest holding, Bloom Energy, is up 534% over the last year, but at just 10.55% of its portfolio, this fuel cell company's surge isn't the reason for the fund's outperformance. Another holding, the wind power company Vestas Wind Systems, has returned 90% over the last 12 months. And SolarEdge, a producer of microinverters for solar panels, has returned 136% over the last year.

These big gains across a variety of companies in different sectors of renewable energy -- wind, solar, and fuel cells -- show that the fund is thriving from broad-based exposure. Meanwhile, its expense ratio of 0.39% is lower than the industry average of 0.56%. For investors looking for a low-cost, simple way to capture broad-based upside in the renewables transition, this fund looks like a buy.

With an outlay of INR181 billion (USD2.08 billion), the scheme aimed to establish 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) of advanced battery cell manufacturing capacity in India by 2025. However, as of October 2025, only 2.8% (1.4GWh) of the targeted capacity has been commissioned within the stipulated timeline—all by Ola Electric—shows a new report by JMK Research, and the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).

The report, ‘Assessing India’s incentive scheme to enhance the battery manufacturing ecosystem’, provides in-depth analysis of the scheme, its beneficiaries, and progress to date. It identifies key bottlenecks and suggests measures to improve the scheme’s effectiveness.

There is a substantial gap between the intended and actual outcomes of the ACC PLI scheme. Against an estimated 1.03 million jobs, it has generated only 1,118 jobs (0.12% of the target). Investment levels have also lagged, with around INR28.7 billion (USD330 million) committed so far, accounting for 25.58% of the targeted INR112.5 billion (USD1.29 billion).

“Although strong policy support led to substantial investment announcements and capacity plans outside the ACC PLI scheme, on-ground progress remained sluggish. For beneficiaries, the Centre has imposed a penalty of 0.1% of the performance security for each day of delay in commissioning. Moreover, with India’s dependence on imported battery cells still close to 100%, the scheme’s original objectives remain largely unfulfilled,” says Prabhakar Sharma, senior consultant, JMK Research, and a co-author of the report.

While the ACC PLI tenders attracted overwhelming interest, capacity allocation remains incomplete. The MHI initially allocated the full 50GWh in the first auction held in March 2022, but Hyundai Global Motors’ withdrawal from its 20GWh allocation prompted a second auction. In the September 2024 round, bidders secured only 10GWh. The government plans to tender the remaining 10GWh at a later stage.

As of October 2025, no incentives have been disbursed against the targeted INR29 billion (USD332 million). Reliance New Energy has indicated on-time commissioning of the capacity awarded under the second auction round (10GWh), while capacity allocated in the first auction round (5GWh) remains delayed. Ola Electric has scaled back its expansion plans and now aims to install only 5GWh of its 20GWh capacity by FY2029.

The report also highlights gaps in the scheme’s evaluation framework. Among all bidders across both auction rounds, only Exide Industries and Amara Raja had prior experience in battery manufacturing, yet neither qualified. The evaluation criteria placed greater emphasis on domestic value addition (DVA), proposed capacity, and subsidy benchmarks, where new entrants scored higher, resulting in the selection of firms without prior expertise.

“Going forward, improving the effectiveness of ACC PLI will require a holistic, multi-pronged strategy. This would include introducing robust cell testing and certification infrastructure; scaling up equipment manufacturing, and recycling; and developing skilled domestic talent, among other things,” says the report’s co-author Saif Jahangir, consultant, JMK Research and Analytics.

Moreover, a dedicated policy for critical minerals, covering both sourcing and refining,will be crucial.

“It is equally important to assess how India can attract global battery players to establish manufacturing facilities in the country. The government designed the scheme to encourage both domestic and international participation and bringing established global players into the ecosystem would strengthen capabilities, accelerate technology transfer, and help steer the industry in the right direction,” says Vibhuti Garg, Director – South Asia, IEEFA.

It accounts for roughly 16% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is a major driver of climate change.
Shelley said uniform EPA rules provided regulatory certainty for changes operators saw as inevitable.
Colin Leyden, Texas state director and energy lead at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, said eliminating the program could hurt Texas industry.
Leyden said tallying up the dollar value of lives saved when evaluating pollution rules is a foundational principle of the EPA since its creation.","The first year of President Trump’s second term has seen an aggressive rollback of federal environmental protections, which advocacy groups fear will bring more pollution, higher health risks, and less information and power for Texas communities, especially in heavily industrial and urban areas.

Within Trump’s first 100 days in office, his new Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Lee Zeldin, announced a sweeping slate of 31 deregulatory actions. The list, which Zeldin called the agency’s “greatest day of deregulation,” targeted everything from soot standards and power plant pollution rules to the Endangerment Finding, the legal and scientific foundation that obligates the EPA to regulate climate-changing pollution under the Clean Air Act.

Since then, the agency froze research grants, shrank its workforce, and removed some references to climate change and environmental justice from its website — moves that environmental advocates say send a clear signal: the EPA’s new direction will come at the expense of public health.

Cyrus Reed, conservation director of the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club, said Texas is one of the states that feels EPA policy changes directly because the state has shown little interest in stepping up its environmental enforcement as the federal government scales back.

“If we were a state that was open to doing our own regulations there’d be less impact from these rollbacks,” Reed said. “But we’re not.”

“Now we have an EPA that isn’t interested in enforcing its own rules,” he added.

Richard Richter, a spokesperson at the state’s environmental agency, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, said in a statement that the agency takes protecting public health and natural resources seriously and acts consistently and quickly to enforce federal and state environmental laws when they’re violated.

Methane rules put on pause

A major EPA move centers on methane, a potent greenhouse gas that traps heat far more efficiently than carbon dioxide over the short term. It accounts for roughly 16% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is a major driver of climate change. In the U.S., the largest source of methane emissions is the energy sector, especially in Texas, the nation’s top oil and gas producer.

In 2024, the Biden administration finalized long-anticipated rules requiring oil and gas operators to sharply reduce methane emissions from wells, pipelines, and storage facilities. The rule, developed with industry input, targeted leaks, equipment failures, and routine flaring, the burning off of excess natural gas at the wellhead.

Under the rule, operators would have been required to monitor emissions, inspect sites with gas-imaging cameras for leaks, and phase out routine flaring. States are required to come up with a plan to implement the rule, but Texas has yet to do so. Under Trump’s EPA, that deadline has been extended until January 2027 — an 18-month postponement.

Texas doesn’t have a rule to capture escaping methane emissions from energy infrastructure. Richter, the TCEQ spokesperson, said the agency continues to work toward developing the state plan.

Adrian Shelley, Texas director of the watchdog group Public Citizen, said the rule represented a rare moment of alignment between environmentalists and major oil and gas producers.

“I think the fossil fuel industry generally understood that this was the direction the planet and their industry was moving,” he said. Shelley said uniform EPA rules provided regulatory certainty for changes operators saw as inevitable.

Reed, the Sierra Club conservation director, said the delay of methane rules means Texas still has no plan to reduce emissions, while neighboring New Mexico already has imposed its own state methane emission rules that require the industry to detect and repair methane leaks and ban routine venting and flaring.

These regulations have cut methane emissions in the New Mexico portion of the Permian Basin — the oil-rich area that covers West Texas and southeast New Mexico — to half that of Texas, according to a recent data analysis by the Environmental Defense Fund. That’s despite New Mexico doubling production since 2020.

A retreat from soot standards

Fine particulate matter or PM 2.5, one of six pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act, has been called by researchers the deadliest form of air pollution.

In 2024, the EPA under President Biden strengthened air rules for particulate matter by lowering the annual limit from 12 to 9 micrograms per cubic meter. It was the first update since 2012 and one of the most ambitious pieces of Biden’s environmental agenda, driven by mounting evidence that particulate pollution is linked to premature death, heart disease, asthma, and other respiratory illnesses.

After the rule was issued, 24 Republican-led states, including Kentucky and West Virginia, sued to revert to the weaker standard. Texas filed a separate suit asking to block the rule’s recent expansion.

State agencies are responsible for enforcing the federal standards. The TCEQ is charged with creating a list of counties that exceed the federal standard and submitting those recommendations to Gov. Greg Abbott, who then finalizes the designations and submits them to the EPA.

Under the 9 microgram standard, parts of Texas, including Dallas, Harris (which includes Houston), Tarrant (Fort Worth), and Bowie (Texarkana) counties, were in the process of being designated nonattainment areas — which, when finalized, would trigger a legal requirement for the state to develop a plan to clean up the air.

That process stalled after Trump returned to office. Gov. Greg Abbott submitted his designations to EPA last February, but EPA has not yet acted on his designations, according to Richter, the TCEQ spokesperson.

In a court filing last year, the Trump EPA asked a federal appeals court to vacate the stricter standard, bypassing the traditional notice and comment administrative process.

For now, the rule technically remains in effect, but environmental advocates say the EPA’s retreat undermines enforcement of the rule and signals to polluters that it may be short-lived.

Shelley, with Public Citizen, believes the PM2.5 rule would have delivered the greatest health benefit of any EPA regulation affecting Texas, particularly through reductions in diesel pollution from trucks.

“I still hold out hope that it will come back,” he said.

Unraveling the climate framework

Beyond individual pollutants, the Trump EPA has moved to dismantle the federal architecture for addressing climate change.

Among the proposals is eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which requires power plants, refineries, and oil and gas suppliers to report annual emissions. The proposal has drawn opposition from both environmental groups and industry, which relies on the data for planning and compliance.

Colin Leyden, Texas state director and energy lead at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, said eliminating the program could hurt Texas industry. If methane emissions are no longer reported, then buyers and investors of natural gas, for example, won’t have an official way to measure how much methane pollution is associated with that gas, according to Leyden. That makes it harder to judge how “clean” or “climate-friendly” the product is, which international buyers are increasingly demanding.

“This isn’t just bad for the planet,” he said. “It makes the Texas industry less competitive.”

The administration also proposed last year rescinding the Endangerment Finding, issued in 2009, which obligates the EPA to regulate climate pollution. Most recently, the EPA said it will stop calculating how much money is saved in health care costs as a result of air pollution regulations that curb particulate matter 2.5 and ozone, a component of smog. Both can cause respiratory and health problems.

Leyden said tallying up the dollar value of lives saved when evaluating pollution rules is a foundational principle of the EPA since its creation.

“That really erodes the basic idea that (the EPA) protects health and safety and the environment,” he said.

As AI-driven power demand grows, market watchers are eyeing fossil fuels to beat the energy bottleneck.
""Across all the fossil fuels, gas is the most efficient and the cleanest one,"" he added.
To withdraw from fossil fuels in line with climate goals, energy storage must be ramped up.
The European Commission is betting on such gains across the whole energy system in what it has dubbed the ""twin potential of energy for AI and AI for energy.""","Stalled demand for energy in Europe pushed investors away from renewables, but artificial intelligence could see cash flow back into the sector, while also uplifting fossil fuels.

Global electricity generation from renewables is expected to jump by 60% in 2030, accounting for 45% of total electricity output, per the International Energy Agency. Almost 50% of European power came from renewables in 2024, and the region has a strong pipeline of solar and on- and offshore wind waiting to be connected to the grid.

""The problem we have now is integrating all of that variable supply into our power markets,"" Peter Osbaldstone, research director for European power and renewables at Wood Mackenzie, told CNBC.

Pressure on integration results in pressure on prices, ""which undermines the economics of investments, which makes the whole process of supporting a decarbonized power mix more difficult, more expensive for governments to bear,"" he said.

As AI-driven power demand grows, market watchers are eyeing fossil fuels to beat the energy bottleneck. The IEA revised its 2025-2030 growth forecast for renewables downward by 5% compared to 2024, reflecting the changing sentiment and policy, largely from the U.S.

Redeploying fossil fuel energy is a ""short‑term crutch"" that helps the AI roll-out get going, but ""renewable energy is the only way to win in the long term,"" Agate Freimane, partner at venture capital firm Norrsken, told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Jan. 8.

""China and the U.S. have both acknowledged the need for vast energy resources to power an AI future, and this is reflected in the adoption of renewables. Taking the global view — renewable energy prices have dropped by more than 90%, and in 2024, 91% of new renewable projects were cheaper than fossil alternatives,"" Freimane said in a follow-up email.

""This shift triggers a self-reinforcing cycle: cheaper clean power accelerates electrification, rising electrification boosts demand for storage and grid intelligence, and those upgrades push the cost of clean energy even lower. In this way, it can be argued that AI is accelerating the shift to renewables,"" she added.

Dealing with intermittency

For Alberto Faraco, a senior analyst who covers infrastructure at Morningstar DBRS, intermittency is still a fundamental issue with renewables. Investment needs to be made across the whole system — not just the energy-generating side, he told CNBC.

""Data centers should help the development of renewables, because that should push the price of electricity up, but transmission would need to be developed, battery storage would need to be developed,"" he said, adding that renewables alone will not be enough to serve the stable needs of the data centers.

""Gas for the time being would be impossible to phase out,"" said Faraco.

watch now

Nuclear energy is touted as a steady baseload option for renewables, but that doesn't account for volatility in their supply and demand. Nuclear can't be switched on and off when it's needed, Faraco said. ""Across all the fossil fuels, gas is the most efficient and the cleanest one,"" he added.

This is part of the reason why Wood Mackenzie expects gas — considered a transition fuel by the European Union — to remain part of the energy mix up as far ahead as 2060.

""There is a call to be made at some point by governments: What do I do with gas generation?"" Osbaldstone said. But ultimately, ""the lights have got to stay on.""

To withdraw from fossil fuels in line with climate goals, energy storage must be ramped up. Battery costs have fallen 90% in less than 15 years, per a 2024 IEA report, and newer chemistries are being developed for long-duration storage.

The investment case is not clear-cut, however.

""If you've got that long-duration battery storage, its utilization in a typical year is going to be very low, because you're not going to have that many opportunities to really deploy that asset,"" Osbaldstone said, noting that their use depends on the weather.

There's a price risk too, given operators don't know how much they will pay or make from storing and selling energy. ""As you add more batteries to the grid, this arbitrage margin may compress because there will be more batteries buying electricity at the low price and more batteries selling electricity at the higher prices,"" Faraco said.

A 'twin potential'

Supporters argue that AI could also serve as a critical enabler of smarter storage, allowing for better management.

""AI-driven data analytics could improve planning, project design and real-time operational decisions, resulting in reduced fuel consumption, lower CO2 emissions and extended asset lifetimes,"" according to an IEA report.

The European Commission is betting on such gains across the whole energy system in what it has dubbed the ""twin potential of energy for AI and AI for energy.""

The bloc's forthcoming roadmap for digitalization and AI in the energy sector will ""accelerate the uptake of digitalisation and AI in the energy sector while improving energy efficiency and system reliability,"" a Commission spokesperson said when approached about a rollback of climate policy to fuel soaring electricity demand from AI and data centers.

""As AI rapidly advances, its potential to strengthen Europe's energy resilience and accelerate the clean transition is becoming increasingly clear. At the same time, the growing electricity needs of AI technologies call for smart, forward-looking planning,"" they said.

""The European Commission aims to ensure the EU is fully prepared to seize these opportunities while safeguarding the stability and reliability of Europe's energy system.""

Agate echoed the ""huge opportunity.""

""As it stands, there are several examples of companies using AI to improve energy systems — Vind AI revolutionising wind energy, Granular Energy enabling greater transparency, and Juna.ai in manufacturing,"" she said, pointing to startups that Norrsken has invested in.

""Additionally, improving efficiency in heavy industry is one of the most powerful levers for emissions reduction. Heavy industry accounts for around a third of global energy consumption, and AI-driven optimisation is now pushing industrial efficiency forward by decades.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107321624-1698072093729-gettyimages-1466471704-dji_0067.jpeg?v=1768986820&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2026-01-22 02:37:30.492075

The bill in question, released Tuesday, would fund the departments of Homeland Security, Defense, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, Labor, Education and other related agencies.

It seeks to claw back $879 million that passed as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021 as part of an effort to fund a nationwide EV charging network. The law originally included billions in funding for the network.

An emerging point of contention in the new legislation, meanwhile, is more about what’s not in the bill, as opposed to what is.

Some lawmakers, including Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) are pushing for the inclusion of a provision that would include sales of high-ethanol gasoline year-round.

A spokesperson for Bacon confirmed Punchbowl’s reporting that he brought up sales of high-ethanol gas at a Republican conference meeting on Wednesday morning but is not planning to vote down the bill over the issue.

“I’ve heard from our NE farmers and this is their #1 priority,” Bacon wrote in a post on the social platform X.

Bipartisan lawmakers from the Midwest have pushed for sales of E15 gas, named for its 15 percent ethanol content, year-round. This type of gasoline has historically been restricted in the summer because of concerns about smog — which can form more easily from evaporation in the heat.

Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, told The Hill in an email there is a “full-fledged push to get year-round E15 in the final package.”

He said “several” Midwestern lawmakers are “drawing a line in the sand on this issue because it is vitally important to jobs and economic vitality in their districts and states.” He did not specify which lawmakers are doing so.

“This should not be controversial — E15 is a more affordable, American-made, cleaner-burning fuel that boosts the farm economy,” Cooper said.

Meanwhile, lawmakers are also seeking to rein in the administration’s cuts to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

A joint explanatory statement accompanying the funding bill calls for restoring positions eliminated over the past year and retaining staffing levels needed for the agency to complete its statutory missions, including Cadre of On-Call Response/Recovery (CORE) staffers.

The statement comes amid reports that the administration is considering eliminating half of its staff and that it is not renewing some CORE staffers’ positions.

India’s ambitious electric vehicle (EV) and energy storage targets have accelerated battery demand, underscoring the strategic importance of lithium-ion cells, almost all of which India currently imports, primarily from China. To reduce this dependence, the Ministry of Heavy Industries (MHI) launched the Advanced Chemistry Cell Production Linked Incentive (ACC PLI) scheme in October 2021 to catalyse domestic cell manufacturing. With an outlay of INR181 billion (USD2.08 billion), the scheme aims to attract large players by mandating a minimum investment of INR11.25 billion (USD129.3 million) and by adopting an evaluation framework that places significant weight on domestic value addition (DVA), capacity development, and subsidy benchmarks.

The 50-gigawatt hours (GWh) ACC PLI tenders attracted strong interest from domestic players, with auctions heavily oversubscribed. Ola Electric, Reliance New Energy, Hyundai Global, and Rajesh Exports emerged as the selected beneficiaries. However, the initial 50GWh allocation remains incomplete after Hyundai Global Motor pulled out of its 20GWh allocation from the first tender. This prompted the MHI to re-tender 10GWh in the second auction, while reserving the remaining 10GWh for a future tender.

As of October 2025, progress under the ACC PLI scheme has been limited. Only 2.8% (1.4GWh) of the targeted 50GWh capacity has been commissioned within the stipulated timeline, entirely by Ola Electric. However, this 1.4GWh, too, represents only a partial commissioning of Ola Electric’s awarded 20GWh capacity and is yet to meet the DVA requirements needed to qualify for incentive claims. As a result, zero incentives have been disbursed to any beneficiary against the targeted INR29 billion (USD332 million) by October 2025. Ola Electric has also scaled back its expansion plans and now aims to install only 5GWh by financial year (FY) 2029. The other beneficiaries are yet to commission their ACC battery manufacturing facilities. Rajesh Exports lags the most, with progress limited to land acquisition, while reports of financial discrepancies have further raised concerns about its ability to commission the facility in the near term.

Beneficiaries have also encountered major supply chain and implementation bottlenecks that have significantly delayed facility installation. India lacks a mature cell manufacturing ecosystem, including critical mineral refining and cell component production, which leaves the industry almost entirely dependent on imports from China. Industry stakeholders also highlight delays in visa approvals for Chinese technical specialists required for equipment installation, further slowing progress. In addition, scheme-related issues such as an aggressive two-year installation timeline and high DVA requirements pose significant challenges for PLI beneficiaries with no prior experience in battery manufacturing.

There is a substantial gap between the intended and actual outcomes of the ACC PLI scheme. Against an estimated 1.03 million jobs, the scheme has generated only 1,118 jobs (0.12%). Similarly, investments of approximately INR28.7 billion (USD330 million) account for just 25.58% of the targeted INR112.5 billion (USD1.29 billion). Although strong policy support and impetus from the central government have led to substantial investment announcements and capacity plans outside the ACC PLI scheme, on-ground progress across the sector has remained sluggish. For ACC PLI beneficiaries, the central government has imposed a penalty of 0.1% of the performance security for each day of delay in commissioning. Moreover, with India’s dependence on imported battery cells still close to 100%, the scheme’s original objectives remain largely unfulfilled.

Going forward, improving the effectiveness of the ACC PLI scheme and accelerating sectoral growth will require a holistic, multi-pronged strategy. The government could begin by extending implementation timelines for beneficiaries and waiving associated penalties for another one year.

To build a competitive ecosystem similar to one China developed over a decade (2000–2010), the government must introduce and effectively implement a dedicated scheme for critical minerals, covering both sourcing and refining, as well as for cell components. In addition, tariff protection measures such as basic customs duty (BCD) and anti-dumping duties along with focused talent development and research and development (R&D) support, will be essential for the cell manufacturing industry to achieve the intended outcomes of the ACC PLI scheme.

The government’s move to promote domestic cell manufacturing was well timed, but the policy focused primarily on making cells cost-competitive through sales-linked incentives. The core challenge, however, lies in setting up manufacturing facilities, where both ACC PLI beneficiaries and non-PLI players continue to struggle. Even after India builds adequate capacity, the industry will face sustained pricing pressure from China, which benefits from a mature ecosystem and significant overcapacity. Overall, India remains at least five to ten years away from establishing a robust and competitive cell manufacturing industry, assuming policy decisions and execution stay on track.",https://ieefa.org/sites/default/files/2026-01/hero%20graphic%20%2864%29.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 00:39:15.098017

Millions of American drivers only want one thing: a small- to medium-sized SUV, with a small- to medium-sized price tag.

It’s a huge, lucrative market — comprising around half of new-car sales in the United States — but one that few electric vehicles have managed to enter. In 2026, however, that will change. Carmakers are planning to roll out at least six new electric SUVs this year with price tags at or below $35,000, products that could help a ease a slowdown in EV sales.

“EVs have to move more into the mass market and there are launches that are now squarely hitting that,” said Nathan Niese, Boston Consulting Group’s global lead for electric vehicles. “It’s what’s going to prop up what otherwise would be a down year.”

EV sales have surged in recent years, as carmakers improved range and charging speed, while federal incentives helped entice buyers. Relatively high costs, however, remained the last speed bump to mass adoption. Of the roughly 60 electric cars and trucks for sale in the United States last year, only three could be had for less than $35,000; the median starting sticker price was $59,100, nearly $10,000 higher than the average price for all vehicles.

When federal subsidies disappeared in September, EV sales swooned. The message for the C-suites of Detroit was clear: Price is at least as important as powertrain preference, if not more. Many auto executives have since slowed their EV plans and shifted some production back to gas-powered models that they can build (and price) more affordably.

“Anything you can do to make a customer feel you’ve given them a more affordable product is an advantage to them right now,” said Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas Public Policy.

The good news for auto executives: a steady drop in battery prices has improved the economics of EVs, opening a lane for new small models.

“The end of the EV subsidies does not necessarily spell bad news across the board,” BloombergNEF analyst Huiling Zhou wrote in a recent report. “Carmakers that can cut costs and offer affordable models in the most desirable vehicle segments are likely to see sustained sales growth.”

Here’s a look at the EVs that will likely find plenty of interest in 2026.- - -

Nissan Leaf

Nissan has long known the sales magic of an affordable EV. Since its debut 15 years ago, the Leaf has parked itself in nearly 1 million households’ driveways and garages, despite its modest range and quirky hatchback design. For the 2026 iteration, Nissan overhauled the car for the first time in nearly eight years, upsizing it to the SUV category. The end result seems to have shed many of the model’s quirks and compromises.

For one, the new Leaf no longer looks “cartoonish”, according to reviewers. Gone is the near-obsolete CHAdeMo charging port that’s akin to a Betamax videotape, replaced by a traditional CCS charging receptacle on the driver’s side and a NACS port (better known as the Tesla plug) on the passenger’s side. It does retain one important feature of past Leafs: The new model still slips under the $30,000 threshold.

Chevrolet Bolt

General Motors Co. has a similar overhaul in the works for its Chevrolet Bolt, another affordable machine that won a crowd of buyers right up until the company pulled the plug on the model in 2023. Chevy revealed the resurrected iteration of the small SUV in October and it’s set to go on sale early this year. The car looks pretty much the same and the driving range is similar, but the reborn Bolt is powered by a new battery that will cost far less and charge far more quickly than the previous version. The Bolt also has GM’s hands-free driving system — dubbed Super Cruise — and is now capable of bidirectional charging, which means it can provide power in a blackout or whenever else you need it.

Toyota C-HR BEV

The company calls the coming C-HR a “coupe-like SUV.” While the description reads like an oxymoron, it’s one that plays well with U.S. tastes in car design. The machine is big enough for a hefty Costco run, but small enough to park in a compact space.

And the new Toyota ride offers nearly 300 miles of range while coming with standard all-wheel drive, which typically compromises efficiency. Toyota teamed up with Subaru to develop the platform for this new small electric SUV, a bit of cost-sharing that will help keep the sticker price around $35,000.

Subaru Uncharted

The Subaru side of the Toyota partnership is the Uncharted, an SUV that will be a little smaller than the brand’s other electric offering, the Solterra. With the base model — starting around $35,000 — buyers can forgo all-wheel drive for about 15 more miles between charges.

Among SUV owners, Subaru ranks second in brand loyalty, meaning Crosstrek and Outback drivers waiting to go electric will finally have more than one option.

Kia EV3

Kia has already checked the “medium” and “large” boxes in its EV product line; now, it’s steering for small. The EV3, which is expected to sell for about $35,000, will slide just behind the brand’s EV6 size-wise even as its boxy design echoes the EV9, a bulky, three-row SUV. Kia is also planning to give buyers some unique color choices, from “shale grey” to “frost clue.”

Slate

Cheap EVs aren’t just the realm of incumbents. Startup Slate is swooping in with plans to deliver its first machine by year-end. The company’s first vehicle, which can be converted from pickup to SUV, is to a Ford F-150 what an Ikea futon is to a Pottery Barn sectional. The base version — the company calls it “the blank Slate” — is best described by what it isn’t. It lacks a touchscreen, cooled seats, all-wheel drive and a stereo. What Slate promises in return is a sticker price in the mid-$20,000s.

At the company’s launch event last year, Chief Executive Officer Chris Barman delivered what has since become a bit of a stump speech for cheap EVs. “The definition of what’s affordable is broken,” she said.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/09/PDTN/86602424007-my-27-chevrolet-bolt-mcm-lt-ca-4680.jpg?crop=8022,4515,x0,y838&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-22 01:38:26.140965

Legislators in the major steel state of Ohio are currently considering the measure, said Bill Paxton, a national lobbyist for the iron and steel industry.
He’d rather have peace of mind that the steel going into public roads, bridges and buildings is going to hold up.
The U.S. steel industry has been floundering for decades, shuttering mills and laying off workers amid increased global competition.
The steel industry championed the tariffs on foreign steel but is now facing another hurdle as it rushes to build new mills.","COLUMBIA — South Carolina steel companies are pushing a bill to require state and local officials to build all taxpayer-funded projects using U.S.-made steel and iron.

A House panel voted unanimously to advance the bill Tuesday after hearing from steel giant Nucor Corp., as well as American SpiralWeld, a company with operations in Columbia that turns Nucor’s steel into pipe.

“If we’re going to spend our taxpayer dollars, we would rather it come back to places like Darlington County,” said Republican Rep. Richie Yow, whose district covers a Nucor steel plant in Darlington.

The federal government has had U.S. production requirements for federally funded road projects on the books since the 1980s. Congress has tightened those mandates over the years, including most recently in the Biden administration’s massive infrastructure law.

Yow said the bill, which he sponsored, takes those federal requirements and applies them to the state.

Texas passed similar legislation in 2017, and Florida did the same last year. Legislators in the major steel state of Ohio are currently considering the measure, said Bill Paxton, a national lobbyist for the iron and steel industry.

Rep. Robert Williams, D-Darlington, raised concerns about how the measure might raise the cost of public projects, which already have ballooned in recent years.

Scott Baier, an economist at Clemson University, said those concerns may be founded.

“While such mandates increase demand for domestic producers, they also raise input prices,” he said. “If the bill passes, and increased demand drives up the costs of the construction projects, then citizens may be impacted because the higher construction expenses may reduce the number of infrastructure projects, reduce overall spending flexibility or imply higher taxes in the future.”

American-made steel is the most expensive in the world. However, the price paid for foreign steel has risen to a more even level since the Trump administration increased import taxes, known as tariffs, imposed by the U.S. government on companies that import steel into the country.

The bill also seeks to address the issue by waiving the requirement if a government can’t get U.S.-made steel fast enough or if the use of American steel increases costs by more than 25%.

Those carveouts were enough to calm worries from state agencies, especially the S.C. Department of Transportation, said Rep. Mark Smith, R-Daniel Island.

No one testified against the bill. It advanced to the full House Labor Commerce and Industry Committee.

Yow said the higher costs don’t bother him. He’d rather have peace of mind that the steel going into public roads, bridges and buildings is going to hold up.

“If it costs $5 more a yard or $5 more a ton, it’s worth the life that it saves in the end,” he said.

The U.S. steel industry has been floundering for decades, shuttering mills and laying off workers amid increased global competition.

Vice President Vance touts ‘golden age’ of manufacturing in SC steel visit

That includes the Liberty Steel Mill in Georgetown, which closed for good in 2024 after nearly a decade of on-again-off-again operations.

“I wish that we had had this bill a few years ago and our steel mill would probably still be open,” said Democratic Rep. Carl Anderson, whose district includes the former mill site.

Paxton, along with Devin Webster, a Nucor vice president in the state, blamed cheaply made steel from Turkey, India and China for the industry’s decline.

Nucor employs some 2,500 South Carolinians at multiple locations across Florence, Laurens, Lexington, York and Berkeley counties, as well as in Darlington, Webster said.

While China is the world’s largest steel producer and exporter, it sends very little to the U.S. — less than 2% of total imports into the country, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. President Donald Trump passed a 25% tariff on Chinese steel during his first term, pricing the country out of the market. He’s since upped that to 50%.

Most steel coming into the country comes from Mexico and Canada, followed by Japan, South Korea and Germany. Imports make up about a fifth of all steel used in the U.S.

The steel industry championed the tariffs on foreign steel but is now facing another hurdle as it rushes to build new mills. Demand is not keeping up, the Wall Street Journal reported in August.

Interest rates and the rising cost of steel means less demand for cars and construction that the industry relies on to buy its product.

Baier said policies, such as this legislation, aim to increase that domestic demand. How much of a dent these proposals might make in the industry’s struggles remains to be seen.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/construction-worker-2048x1381.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 07:39:59.236162

Despite the energy dominance agenda of the White House.","On the campaign trail to the 2024 elections, Donald Trump made affordable energy for Americans a top priority—along with a boost for the country’s energy industry with a view to “energy dominance”. Now, conflicts are emerging between these priorities, making it difficult to follow them all.

Two of President Trump’s energy goals are compatible enough: cheaper oil makes for greater demand both at home and abroad, so cheap gasoline for Americans can go hand in hand with growing U.S. energy dominance through exports. The latter are being boosted through sanctions on Russia and pressure on India to switch from Russian to U.S. crude, and it’s working. The Venezuelan takeover will also go towards expanding the share of U.S. oil in the global mix.

In liquefied natural gas, the dominance is even more pronounced. Last year, the United States became the first country to export over 100 million tons of the superchilled fuel, largely thanks to shipments to Europe. There is a certain sense of irony in this situation because the European Union has adopted a new methane regulation that could see LNG deliveries from the Gulf Coast take a dip because of the effect the regulation will have on prices. U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has already called for its removal twice—as has Qatar’s energy minister.

Energy affordability, then, is perfectly compatible with energy dominance. The third priority, however, boosting the energy industry, is proving tougher to fit in with the other two—because oil and gas companies do not really thrive at low oil and gas prices. And when oil and gas companies don’t thrive, they start reducing production, which lifts prices, and there goes the affordable energy goal, along with the dominance, which needs the price-sensitive energy importers such as India to grow.

The United States is the world’s biggest producer of crude oil and natural gas. The industry got to that position despite four years of a rather hostile federal government, proving that it can survive and do well even without the support of Washington. But, of course, such support is always welcome—up to a point.

Some expected oil and gas producers to go on a drilling spree once Trump was elected, but instead, they remained cautious. That new normal of strict capital discipline and pickiness about new investments was not a passing fad. It is, quite literally, the industry’s new normal. This is what prompted Exxon to call Venezuela “univestable” after the U.S. president prompted oil majors to go in and spend $100 billion to make Venezuelan oil great again over the next ten years.

Wood Mackenzie said earlier this month that upstream capex fell globally last year and is about to fall further this year—notably including in the United States. Despite the full support of the federal government. Despite the energy dominance agenda of the White House. Many are citing uncertainty about the years after Trump’s second term ends, and they are right to be worried about who will replace him. Caution is the new “Drill, baby, drill” in the oil and gas patch.

There are, however, fundamental factors at play as well. With all the predictions of a massive global oil glut, an oil company would be justified in not drilling at will. Weak prices are also not conducive to production growth, as evidenced by the slowdown in drilling activity last year. Of course, some of that was better efficiency that drove still-higher production, but the rate of growth in production has slowed substantially.

The energy dominance priority is also a bit complicated. In liquefied gas, for instance, the United States has become heavily reliant on Europe, which has been taking in over half of U.S. exports. Now, part of that surge in purchases has been an attempt to please President Trump and get better trade deal terms, which did not happen. Another part is that the EU does not really have many options, and it will have one fewer soon after the ban on Russian gas imports comes into effect. The U.S. and Europe, in other words, are dependent on each other in LNG. Even so, Asia remains a major market as well, and demand for energy from the tech sector amid the AI frenzy is rather bullish for demand—and for that dominance agenda.

In crude oil, there is no such close interdependency with a group of buyers, but there is more competition, notably from OPEC+ but also from non-OPEC producers. None of these comes even close to the production rates of the U.S., but they do add to a market that most analysts say is already oversupplied. This oversupply situation, coupled with the intense competition in oil, makes the dominance goal harder to achieve—and doesn’t do anything about the industry’s job satisfaction levels. The three energy priorities of the Trump administration, while individually admirable, are tricky to turn into reality all at once—because some come at the expense of others.

Zanskar in the Field

LDG Rig and Plant

SALT LAKE CITY, Jan. 21, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zanskar, a company using custom-built AI to become the world’s most successful geothermal explorer, today announced a $115 million Series C funding round led by Spring Lane Capital. The round included participation from Obvious Ventures, who led the Series B; Union Square Ventures and Lowercarbon Capital, who co-led the Series A; and more than a dozen other notable energy and technology investors, including Munich Re Ventures, Susquehanna Sustainable Investments, Clearvision Ventures, Orion Industrial Ventures, Safar Partners, Imperative Ventures, StepStone Group, University Growth Fund, Cross Creek, GVP Climate, Tranquillion, Carica Sustainable Investments, UP.Partners, and the All Aboard Fund; and brings Zanskar’s total equity funding to date to $180 million.

This Series C positions Zanskar for rapid growth by enabling the company to advance its gigawatt-scale pipeline through a historic geothermal exploration and development campaign. Zanskar will spearhead one of the largest ever expansions of American geothermal power supporting construction on multiple geothermal power plants throughout the Western U.S., which are slated to begin delivering power before 2030. Zanskar will also expand its industry leading discovery platform and exploration drilling programs, and establish new relationships with strategic partners and customers.

This round marks the largest venture investment to date into AI-enabled discovery of geothermal resources, signaling a decisive shift in market confidence toward the commercial potential of undiscovered, naturally-occurring geothermal systems. By uncovering gigawatts of new geothermal potential in just a few years, and at a fraction of the traditional cost, Zanskar has proven that high-grade natural systems aren't rare: they are just hidden. This disrupts conventional thinking that these systems are too risky or too constrained to develop at any meaningful scale, and sets the stage for rapid growth in the geothermal sector.

“We started Zanskar with the belief that AI would have as profound an impact on geothermal cost and scalability as modern drilling technologies have. It would do so by enabling us to find more hidden geothermal systems, and to produce more power from each of those systems, than legacy models assumed. The result is a terawatt-scale opportunity,” said Carl Hoiland, CEO and Co-founder of Zanskar. “We’ve already confirmed multiple large, previously unknown geothermal resources across the Western U.S., and deeper drilling has validated that these systems can produce far more energy than expected. Thanks to the support of forward-thinking investors across energy, infrastructure, and technology, and the exceptional progress of our world class team, we are ushering in a new wave of clean, firm, geothermal power.”

Zanskar’s AI-native platform is a unified operating system for geothermal discovery and development that lowers discovery costs and increases the size of each geothermal field. Zanskar’s unique approach of marrying boots-on-the-ground geoscience with custom built software and AI tools has empowered Zanskar to collapse discovery timeframes and costs relative to industry best practices. This has firmly established Zanskar as the leading geothermal exploration company.

“Spring Lane is excited to lead the Series C financing for Zanskar and join the Board of the company,” said Jason Scott, Partner and Entrepreneur in Residence, Spring Lane Capital. ""We are eager to support Zanskar because we believe there is a near infinite demand for firm, clean power around the world right now and geothermal energy is one of the only immediate ways to serve this enormous market. Zanskar is unique in that they have identified more geothermal anomalies in North America than any other company in decades. We believe that Spring Lane’s financial and operational support will enable them to rapidly develop enormous amounts of geothermal capacity, initially across the Western US.”

“The world class team at Zanskar is exactly what this country needs: fast, disciplined and very effective,” said Andrew Beebe, Managing Director at Obvious Ventures. “They are positioning geothermal to be one of the cheapest, cleanest and safest energy sources in America—right when we need it most.”

“We’ve always been inspired by the early, legendary explorers that came before us. Their resourcefulness and unfailing optimism laid the groundwork for discovery today. We like to think they’d be proud to see how we’ve resurrected and accelerated grassroots exploration with big data, modern computing, and more efficient field data collection, resulting in a pace of discovery not seen before,” said Joel Edwards, co-founder and CTO of Zanskar. “The resources we need are out there, hidden within the Earth's crust, and we’re working hard to find the most exceptional hotspots to build a new era of geothermal energy, starting in the United States.”

As the U.S. races toward meeting demand for baseload power, and hyperscalers seek out clean, firm power for their data centers, Zanskar is positioned to deliver gigawatts of power—proving AI has the ability to help meet its own power demands. As it builds out geothermal power plants across the U.S., Zanskar seeks out engineers, developers, financers and others to join the team to help discover and deliver geothermal power at a pace, scale, and cost that solves energy, forever.

About Zanskar

Zanskar is the first AI-native geothermal energy company using AI to transform how we find, assess, and deliver geothermal energy.

Although natural gas is only half the cost of electricity, the colder weather may increase the amount of natural gas you use, which will then lead to higher bills.

However, here are a few tips you can do at home to help save money on your upcoming energy bill:

Inspect your natural gas piping and appliances. You are responsible for any natural gas piping on your property from our gas meter to your house or business. As the owner of your home’s gas piping and appliances, it’s your responsibility to schedule regular inspections and maintenance.

To help keep your home safe and to improve energy efficiency, always operate and maintain your natural gas appliances according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Never use an oven or a gas stovetop to heat your home.

Save money and energy by setting your thermostat to 68 degrees during the day and 58 degrees when you are away from home, where it's safe to do so.

Reduce your shower and bath time. Showering and bathing can account for 40 percent of your home's hot water use.

Keep warm air inside. Unless a fire is burning, close your fireplace damper to prevent warm air from escaping up the chimney.

Protect natural gas meters. Natural gas meters are weather-proof; however, to help keep the meter working smoothly, remove snow and ice from natural gas meters with a broom or brush. Never kick or chip snow and ice away with a hard object. Call Atmos Energy's Emergency Number at 866.322.8667 if you have concerns about your meter.

Make sure external vents for dryers and other natural gas equipment are clear. Blocked vents can lead to a dangerous buildup of carbon monoxide gas. If you have questions about proper venting, contact a licensed plumber or qualified contractor.

Minimize the risk of frozen pipes. Leave faucets running at a trickle, open cabinet doors, and close all exterior doors and windows to keep heat inside.",https://media.wfaa.com/assets/WFAA/images/5b648dfb-2a70-4667-a0b9-a876fda395ae/20260119T233148/5b648dfb-2a70-4667-a0b9-a876fda395ae_1140x641.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 04:38:57.646993

As we enter 2026, the “Golden Age” of universal green subsidies has transitioned into a more complex, results-oriented landscape. While some early-adopter programs have sunsetted, new legislation like the 2026 Global Energy Resilience Act and local initiatives like the UK Warm Homes Plan have introduced billions in fresh funding targeted at middle-income households and grid-integrated technology.

At Grid Modernist, we believe that “incentive literacy” is the first step toward energy independence. Here is your master guide to the incentives available in 2026 and how to ensure you don’t leave money on the table.

1. North America: The US & Canada Shift

In the United States, the massive direct-to-consumer rebates of the mid-2020s have been replaced by the “Targeted Transition” model.

EV Tax Deductions (US): The flat $7,500 credit has largely shifted. For 2026, many buyers are now utilizing the Interest Deduction Rule, allowing up to a $10,000 deduction on loan interest for EVs assembled in North America. This significantly lowers the “Total Cost of Ownership” (TCO) for those financing their vehicles.

Alternative Fuel Refueling Credit: Good news for home chargers! If you install a bidirectional (V2G) charger before June 30, 2026, you can still claim a 30% tax credit (up to $1,000) on hardware and installation costs.

Canada’s “Tiered ZEV” Program: Following a brief subsidy dip in 2025, Canada has launched a 2026 program specifically for affordable EV models (under $45k CAD), offering up to $5,000 for eligible battery-electric models.

2. The United Kingdom: The “Warm Homes” Revolution

The UK has officially scrapped many older insulation-only schemes in favor of the 2026 Warm Homes Plan. This is a major win for the “modernist” home.

The £5bn Grant Pool: Low-income households can now access direct grants for Solar + Batterybundles.

Heat Pump Push: A massive £2.7bn has been allocated to help homeowners transition from gas boilers to heat pumps, often covering up to £7,500 of the installation cost.

Green Mortgages: Major UK banks now offer “Interest Rebates” if you can prove your home’s EPC rating has improved via the installation of a Home Energy Management System (HEMS).

3. European Union: Social Climate Fund (SCF) 2026

The EU has pivoted toward a “Fair Transition” model.

Low-Income EV Subsidies: Countries like Germany and France have launched 2026 programs offering up to €6,000 for fully electric cars, specifically for households with a taxable income below €80,000.1

CBAM Implementation: With the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism fully operational in 2026, locally manufactured green tech (EU-made solar panels) is now often cheaper than high-carbon imports, creating an “indirect subsidy” for European-made hardware.

4. Southeast Asia: The Rise of Solar ATAP (Malaysia)

Malaysia has become a regional leader in 2026 with the launch of Solar ATAP (Accelerated Transition Action Programme).2

The Continuation of NEM: Replacing the old Net Energy Metering, Solar ATAP allows homeowners to export excess solar to the grid and receive “ATAP Credits” to offset their evening bills.3

EV Road Tax: While the tax-free period for EVs ended on Dec 31, 2025, the new 2026 tiered system remains significantly cheaper than traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) taxes, rewarding high-efficiency models.

5. Summary Table: What Can You Claim?

6. How to Apply: The “Grid Modernist” Strategy

To ensure your application isn’t rejected, follow this 3-step audit:

Check the “Installation Date”: Most 2026 incentives are based on the date the equipment is placed in service, not the date of purchase. Ensure your installer provides a “Commissioning Certificate.”

Verify MSRP Limits: Many EV incentives (especially in the US and Canada) have strict price caps ($55,000 for sedans / $80,000 for SUVs). Adding too many “Luxury Options” could disqualify you from a $5,000 rebate.

Income Verification: In 2026, subsidies are increasingly “Means-Tested.”4 Have your 2025 tax returns ready to prove you fall below the eligibility thresholds.

The Modernist Verdict

In 2026, the most lucrative incentives are no longer about buying the car—they are about integrating the system. Governments are paying you to help balance the grid. By combining a V2G charger with a solar-backed HEMS, you can “stack” these incentives to cover up to 40% of your total home energy upgrade cost.

OFFICE OF SEN. GARY PETERS

*************************

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (Mich.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, secured funding for high-impact, local public projects and Michigan priorities in the Fiscal Year 2026 Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act that passed the Senate. The bipartisan legislation includes funding for protecting the Great Lakes, continued construction of the Soo Locks, strengthening our power grid, and flood prevention. The bill now heads to the President’s desk to be signed into law.

“This bipartisan legislation delivers crucial investments that will support Michigan’s economy and help protect our Great Lakes and precious freshwater assets,” said Peters. “I was proud to secure funding in the bill to build more resilient infrastructure, bolster clean energy production, and advance research that keeps our state at the forefront of innovation.”

The bill includes numerous measures led and supported by Peters, including:

Strengthening Critical Infrastructure

Robust Funding for Soo Locks Construction: Peters secured $176.6 million in the bill for the Soo Locks construction project. This funding will support ongoing construction of the new Poe-sized lock. Peters has prioritized securing the funding necessary to build the new lock. Last year, through his role on the Appropriations Committee, he secured more than $264 million through government funding legislation. In 2024, he toured the ongoing construction project after helping to secure $257.4 million for the project. In January 2022, Peters also helped to secure $479 million for modernizing the Soo Locks through the bipartisan infrastructure law.

Brandon Road Lock and Dam Funding: Peters secured $28 million for construction of numerous measures to counter invasive carp at the Brandon Road Lock and Dam, a critical choke point for halting the continued spread of invasive carp and preventing them from establishing in the Great Lakes.

Supporting U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: The bill provides over $10 billion for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to support critical projects that strengthen our nation’s waterways and protect communities from extreme weather events.

Strengthening Michigan Ports and Harbors: The bill provides a historic more than $3 billion, a $702 million increase over fiscal year 2025, to improve navigation and commerce on our nation’s waterways, including the Great Lakes. The bill also includes funding for inland waterway navigation projects, which help improve the transport of important commodities like grain, iron, and petroleum.

Protecting the Great Lakes, Access to Clean Water

Replacing Lead Service Lines in Detroit: Peters secured $9 million in funding for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to replace lead service lines throughout the City of Detroit, helping to ensure safe drinking water and public health.

Great Lakes Authority: The bill includes $5 million for the Great Lakes Authority (GLA), one of ten federal regional commissions that seek to address major economic distress in certain geographic regions. The funding will be used to make targeted investments in economically distressed communities across the Great Lakes Basin, helping to ensure communities throughout the region have access to quality public infrastructure, job training opportunities, and the general tools necessary for economic prosperity. The GLA encompasses counties throughout eight states: Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania, and Indiana.

Great Lakes Coastal Resiliency Study: The bill provides the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers with $3 million to continue conducting its Great Lakes Coastal Resiliency Study, which is developing a coordinated strategy and identifying aging infrastructure to protect 5,200 miles of Great Lakes coastline against flooding and erosion.

Bolstering U.S. Manufacturing and Innovation, Michigan’s Automotive Sector

Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB): The bill provides $110 million for FRIB operations and $15 million for the construction of the High Rigidity Spectrometer (HRS). The facility is housed at Michigan State University. The rare isotopes produced at FRIB will allow nuclear scientists and researchers to explore a range of potential applications in the fields such as energy, medicine, and national security, including diagnosing and curing diseases, improving next generation nuclear reactors for energy, and finding processes to destroy nuclear waste. Once completed, HRS will enable isotope harvesting and substantially increase FRIB’s scientific reach and productivity.

Supporting Scientific Discovery: The bill provides $8.4 billion in funding for the Office of Science. The Office of Science is the largest federal sponsor of basic research in the physical sciences and supports 22,000 researchers at 17 national laboratories and more than 300 universities, including in Michigan. The bill will advance research in the highest priorities including high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, biology, and clean energy to maintain and strengthen our global competitiveness. The bill also boosts funding for the Office’s work on artificial intelligence and advanced computing to help the Department of Energy implement the Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence for Science, Security, and Technology (FASST) initiative.

Renewable Energy: The bill provides $3.1 billion for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs that support all types of research, including into advanced manufacturing and building and industrial decarbonization. The bill rejects President Trump’s proposed cut of over $2.5 billion for this research, as well as his proposal to zero out funding for critical solar, wind, and hydrogen research programs. The bill maintains vital investments to bolster energy and manufacturing supply chains to help ensure our continued global leadership in energy technologies.

Protecting Our Energy Grid: The bill provides $190 million to help ensure the continued success of the Department of Energy’s programs aimed at strengthening the security and resilience of our energy sector and grid. It also provides robust funding for both the Office of Electricity and the Grid Deployment Office, rejecting President Trump’s proposed merger of the two offices. The bill will also support upgrades to critical electrical grid infrastructure, an essential investment when energy costs are skyrocketing due to President Trump’s policies, including the termination of renewable energy projects across the country.

Tribal Energy: The bill provides funding for the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs. The bill also rejects President Trump’s proposal to prohibit funding for wind, solar, and battery projects. This funding will help electrify the 30,000 Tribal homes that currently do not have access to power.

The commission on Thursday advanced two proposed rules for public hearing and public comment.
The rules would require industrial manufacturers to test for three types of PFAS and 1,4-Dioxane in their wastewater and create PFAS mitigation plans if necessary.
Smith said she voted not to advance the rules for public comment because she felt they needed to be more detailed before they were brought forward for public consideration.
“My feeling was that the rule drafts were not ready yet for public comment,” Smith said.","RALEIGH, N.C. — North Carolina's environmental agencies are taking steps to further address PFAS contamination across the state. Earlier this month, the Environmental Management Commission voted to approve new rules for how PFAS production is monitored.

Nationally, as the conversation continues on how to regulate these ""forever chemicals,"" North Carolina is facing a call for more transparency and set standards for PFAS being discharged in the state’s drinking water.

The commission on Thursday advanced two proposed rules for public hearing and public comment. The rules would require industrial manufacturers to test for three types of PFAS and 1,4-Dioxane in their wastewater and create PFAS mitigation plans if necessary.

Publicly owned treatment works (POTW) and industrial direct dischargers would be required to report data collected from their baseline sampling and mitigation plans directly to the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality. The public would be able to access this information through a website maintained by the DEQ.

The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program was a federal program established through the Clean Water Act in 1972. NPDES is authorized through the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate dischargers and point sources that pollute waters.

NPDES’ projected schedule for implementing the proposed 1,4-Dioxane minimization rule could go into effect as early as July 2026. With minimization plans for industrial dischargers having to be updated every two years, the fiscal impact of both rules would be determined between 2026 and 2031.

POTWs would be given notice from N.C. Department of Environmental Quality’s Division of Water Resources within 60 days to begin baseline sampling by December 2026 through December 2027. Industrial dischargers notified of the monitoring and mitigation plan requirement would need to submit a plan for review by October 2028 to be approved and implemented by June 2029.

The projected timeline for the second rule addressing PFOS, PFOA and GenX above detection levels could be enacted as early as April 2026 and share a similar implementation period.

At Thursday's more than two-hour discussion, some members on the committee argued the rules did not provide a set limit for PFAS discharge levels or compliance expectations.

It is something NCDEQ deputy communications director Josh Kastrinsky noted in a statement to Spectrum News 1.

""The most effective way to protect people from the health impacts of forever chemicals, which are tied to numerous long-term health concerns, is to reduce pollution at the source,” Kastrinsky said. “The Environmental Management Commission’s proposed monitoring and minimization rules for three PFAS chemicals target pollution sources, but the rules lack numeric limits that would require specific reductions that DEQ believes are the best means for reducing forever chemicals discharged into our environment.”

Members on the commission who voted to advance the rules to public comment argued the need to address public health concerns was urgent and that the action would bring the board one step closer to a solution. Commission Chair JD Solomon said this was not a vote to approve the two rules and the board would address PFAS limits in future meetings.

Solomon said that several public hearings on the two rules would be scheduled through April. Spectrum News 1 reached out to Solomon and other members on the board who supported the rules, but they were not available for comment.

EMC Commissioner Robin Smith motioned to add the EPA’s enforceable limits on PFAS to both rules during Thursday’s meeting, but her request was rejected by a majority of the board. Smith said she voted not to advance the rules for public comment because she felt they needed to be more detailed before they were brought forward for public consideration.

“My feeling was that the rule drafts were not ready yet for public comment,” Smith said. “I thought there were some gaps that needed to be filled, and one of them was that the rule draft didn't really have any standards to meet for these minimization plans.”

According to the EPA, North Carolina ranks third for the highest concentrations of PFAS chemicals in its drinking water nationwide.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/Image_1-21-26_at_6_35_PM,N,,2026-01-22 00:40:49.246030

The bill in question, released Tuesday, would fund the departments of Homeland Security, Defense, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, Labor, Education and other related agencies.

It seeks to claw back $879 million that passed as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021 as part of an effort to fund a nationwide EV charging network. The law originally included billions in funding for the network.

An emerging point of contention in the new legislation, meanwhile, is more about what’s not in the bill, as opposed to what is.

Some lawmakers, including Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) are pushing for the inclusion of a provision that would include sales of high-ethanol gasoline year-round.

A spokesperson for Bacon confirmed Punchbowl’s reporting that he brought up sales of high-ethanol gas at a Republican conference meeting on Wednesday morning but is not planning to vote down the bill over the issue.

“I’ve heard from our NE farmers and this is their #1 priority,” Bacon wrote in a post on the social platform X.

Bipartisan lawmakers from the Midwest have pushed for sales of E15 gas, named for its 15 percent ethanol content, year-round. This type of gasoline has historically been restricted in the summer because of concerns about smog — which can form more easily from evaporation in the heat.

Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, told The Hill in an email there is a “full-fledged push to get year-round E15 in the final package.”

He said “several” Midwestern lawmakers are “drawing a line in the sand on this issue because it is vitally important to jobs and economic vitality in their districts and states.” He did not specify which lawmakers are doing so.

“This should not be controversial — E15 is a more affordable, American-made, cleaner-burning fuel that boosts the farm economy,” Cooper said.

Meanwhile, lawmakers are also seeking to rein in the administration’s cuts to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

A joint explanatory statement accompanying the funding bill calls for restoring positions eliminated over the past year and retaining staffing levels needed for the agency to complete its statutory missions, including Cadre of On-Call Response/Recovery (CORE) staffers.

The statement comes amid reports that the administration is considering eliminating half of its staff and that it is not renewing some CORE staffers’ positions.

Here are five key facts about the L.A. homeless count this year: 1.
At an event Tuesday, LAHSA’s interim CEO Gita O’Neill said this year’s homeless count comes at a pivotal time.
“This year’s homeless count is more important than ever,” said Amber Sheikh, chair of the LAHSA Commission.
That means the homeless count now affects city budgets in a way it never has before.","Thousands of volunteers are out on streets and sidewalks this week tallying people, tents, vehicles and shelters as part of the annual Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count.

The yearly count of the local unhoused population has become increasingly consequential and controversial in Los Angeles County. The area is home to the largest unhoused population in the U.S., estimated at more than 72,000 last year.

But it’s also one of the few places where homeless population estimates are shrinking. For the past two years, homelessness declined slightly in both the city and county of Los Angeles — even as homelessness surged 18% nationally in 2024, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Whether that trend will continue is far from certain. This year's count comes amid a major transition period for L.A.’s homelessness response system. Serious funding shortfalls threaten homeless services across the region.

Meanwhile, questions are mounting about whether the count itself can be trusted, with some local officials openly expressing doubts about its accuracy and usefulness.

The 2026 results are expected to be released in late spring or early summer.

Here are five key facts about the L.A. homeless count this year:

1. Stakes are high

Last year's count found homelessness dropped for a second consecutive year, down 3.4% in the city of Los Angeles and 4% countywide. Local officials touted those results as evidence the region’s investments in shelter and homeless services were paying off, after years of increasing homelessness.

At an event in July, L.A. Mayor Karen Bass took credit for the numbers going down.

“ For the first time in our city's recent history, homelessness has gone down two years in a row,” Bass said. “ This lasting change was only possible because we chose to act with urgency and reject the status quo.”

Now, local homelessness officials warn the L.A. region’s unhoused population may be growing again, as some state and local funding for homeless services and housing is disappearing.

The L.A. region’s lead homeless agency, known as LAHSA, is responsible for conducting the count. At an event Tuesday, LAHSA’s interim CEO Gita O’Neill said this year’s homeless count comes at a pivotal time.

“Across Los Angeles, the homeless services system is undergoing major changes, from funding shifts and program transitions to the way outreach, shelter, and housing are delivered,” O’Neill said. “Those changes, combined with ongoing economic pressures, may put the progress we’ve made over the last couple of years at risk.”

Thousands of Angelenos are set to lose federal housing vouchers this year as pandemic era emergency grant funding expires. A large number of homeless services and programs are facing cuts, because of shortfalls in state, county and city budgets.

Officials and service providers say this year’s count will be crucial for understanding the impacts of cuts.

“This year’s homeless count is more important than ever,” said Amber Sheikh, chair of the LAHSA Commission. “With looming funding cuts at all levels of government, this will give us critically needed data to allow us to advocate effectively.”

There's also a new concern this year: Councilmember Eunisses Hernandez's office said heightened activity by federal immigration enforcement officers might add challenges, if more people meant to be counted are laying low.

“Regardless of what the topline numbers show, the urgency remains the same,” a spokesperson for Hernandez told LAist. ""We need sustained investments in permanent housing, tenant protections, and mental health care to actually reduce homelessness over time.""

2. Regional homelessness agency faces scrutiny, reduced funding

In addition to conducting the count, LAHSA has been responsible for administering most homeless service programs across the region, but that’s in flux.

Recent audits and reports found LAHSA mismanaged funds and failed to collect accurate data on its vendors or properly hold them accountable for providing services.

Last April, L.A. County leaders redirected more than $300 million in funding away from LAHSA and formed a new county homelessness department to oversee the funding itself. The county’s Department of Homeless Services and Housing launched Jan. 1.

LAHSA will continue conducting the annual count with a reduced budget. The agency’s former CEO once warned those funding declines could jeopardize this year’s count.

“ Our team is working to reduce costs for next year's count given this situation,” Va Lecia Adams Kellum said last May. “But even with cost saving adjustments, we anticipate that the current allocations will not provide enough funding for LAHSA to conduct an unsheltered count in 2026.”

The proposed L.A. County homelessness budget for next fiscal year includes $2.3 million for the Homeless Count.

3. Count determines Measure A funding for cities

This year's count will help determine how much money each of Los Angeles County's 88 cities receives from Measure A, the voter-approved half-cent sales tax expected to generate about $1 billion annually for homeless services and affordable housing.

About $96 million from Measure A goes into a Local Solutions Fund divided among all cities. The funding formula is based 90% on each city's homeless count results from the past two years and 10% on the number of extremely low-income households.

That means the homeless count now affects city budgets in a way it never has before.

Based on its unhoused population estimates, the city of Los Angeles got roughly $55 million in the current budget year, 57% of the entire local fund. Smaller cities with fewer unhoused residents are getting far less. Rancho Palos Verdes is allocated about $38,000 and Manhattan Beach $41,000.

Some cities have argued the funding formula is unfair and should be more proportional to a municipality’s tax contributions.

The mayor of Torrance told LAist that the city expects to generate about $26 million annually through the Measure A sales tax and received about $559,000 in local funding. There were 355 unhoused people living in Torrance in February, according to last year’s official estimate.

4. Organizers made some technology updates

LAHSA has made several changes to this year's count following volunteer complaints about the mobile app, which has been plagued by glitches since its introduction in 2023.

“The app as it has been particularly glitchy over the years,” a spokesperson for L.A. City Councilmember Bob Blumenfield told LAist. “We tend to always do a paper count, as well as count through the app, just in case there are any discrepancies.”

For the 2026 count, LAHSA says it has simplified volunteer training, created improved maps in partnership with community stakeholders and assigned more staff to provide technical support at deployment sites.

The agency is also coordinating with county health services and emergency response teams to better count hard-to-reach areas like river embankments, deserts and parks. For example, the Sepulveda Basin in the San Fernando Valley is counted during a specialized daytime operation.

5. Concerns about the annual count’s accuracy

Even with improvements, some remain skeptical about the count's accuracy and usefulness.

L.A. City Councilmember John Lee told LAist the count “falls short of accurately portraying the situation on our city streets” and cautioned against “relying too heavily on a single annual snapshot that may not reflect day-to-day reality.”

“Rather than focusing on a single set of numbers once a year, we should be working year-round to gather consistent data that tracks outcomes like housing placements, retention, and system capacity,"" Lee said. “That kind of information would be far more valuable in evaluating what's actually working.”

A RAND Corporation analysis released in October found that the annual LAHSA tally has been increasingly inaccurate in recent years. RAND found LAHSA undercounted more than 30% of the population in Skid Row, Hollywood and Venice last year. The analysis was based on RAND’s own professional counts of those neighborhoods.

An LAist investigation last year found that LAHSA used inconsistent data processing methods, without clear documentation or written policies. This led to volunteer app observations being excluded from the data at a higher rate than the year before — and at a higher rate within L.A. city limits than in the rest of the county.

“There have been results in prior years that didn't make sense,” Blumenfield’s spokesperson said, referencing a recent example when count results showed way more RVs in a Reseda corridor than the office’s staff had observed during regular outreach.

Several representatives from smaller cities said they don’t rely solely on the count to understand the crisis on their sidewalks and streets. Santa Clarita officials called the count “one of the many tools used to guide local and regional responses to homelessness.”

Metro’s Board of Directors is set to vote Thursday on a $2.7 billion project that would extend light rail farther into the South Bay.

The Board will also consider a competing proposal that takes a different route for the extension than the one staff for the countywide transportation agency recommended and studied extensively.

Three members of Metro’s Board formally asked their colleagues to approve the alternate route Friday, less than a week before the meeting.

Some transit advocates have warned that approving the last-minute motion, which would make the project more expensive and more difficult to construct, could set the extension back years.

“All of a sudden, we have this alternative motion out of left field that did not come out of a committee process,” Scott Epstein, policy and research director of Abundant Housing L.A., said to LAist. “This is really concerning. I urge the Metro Board to return to common sense and stay the course on a high-quality project.”

The news of the motion inspired the opposite feeling in Chelsea Schreiber, who founded a group that’s in favor of the alternate route for which the motion advocates.

“I fell to my knees and cried when I read it,” Schreiber, a Lawndale resident, said to LAist.

The background

The goal of the extension as a whole is to improve connectivity between the South Bay and greater transit network. Metro staff said in a report to its Board that the extension would expand access to jobs, housing, and education.

Before any shovels hit the ground with regional transit projects, Metro studies several routes, collects public input and conducts technical analyses. Based on their work, agency staff then approach the board with their recommendation for the route they believe best serves the project’s goals.

In this case, staff recommended in 2024 a route that would operate on tracks already owned by the agency and includes stations at transit hubs in Redondo Beach and Torrance. In May the same year, Metro’s Board voted in favor of the recommendation and directed agency staff to focus on that route for further analysis.

The dueling route

Before last Friday, the Board was primed to approve those additional studies for the staff-recommended route and advance the project to its design and pre-construction phase.

L.A. County Supervisor Holly Mitchell, whose district represents some of the project area, and her Metro Board colleagues, Tim Sandoval and Jacquelyn Dupont-Walker, don’t want to see that happen.

Instead, according to the motion they introduced, Mitchell and her colleagues want the Board to further a different alignment for the extension that would have the train run along Hawthorne Boulevard, a major commercial corridor.

Their motion shares the concerns of the chief advocacy group in favor of the Hawthorne route, the South Bay Environmental Justice Alliance.

That group, which was founded by Schreiber, claims the staff-recommended route runs too close to homes and would eliminate green space. The group says pollution and noise associated with construction would negatively affect local residents.

The cities of Hermosa Beach, Lawndale, Hawthorne and Redondo Beach have also expressed support for the Hawthorne route whereas the city of Torrance has advocated for the Metro staff-recommended route.

In a statement, Mitchell told LAist she fully supports expanding transit access in the South Bay and thinks the Hawthorne option is the best way to do that “without having to make trade-offs on the safety and quality of life communities.”

Metro staff disagree. According to a report to the Metro board, agency staff determined the Hawthorne alignment wouldn’t provide the same access to local transit, would require additional environmental clearance and cost $737 million more than the route it recommended.

Metro staff also also put forward a suite of mitigation measures, including sound walls, sidewalks and bike paths, to assuage concerns over the route it recommended.

Metro’s board will vote on both proposals Thursday.

It’ll also consider selecting a route for the Sepulveda Transit Corridor for further study. That project would create a rail connection between the Valley and Westside.

At home, I'm in charge of making dinner. Most nights it's the usual rotation of staples that I know my small children will actually eat. I’ve got a routine in the kitchen, prepping vegetables in advance, batch cooking proteins, but some days, there’s just too much to do. You have to finish up a project for work, then you’ve gotta straighten up the house, then pick up the kids, and you didn’t get a chance to make dinner! That’s why I’m always grateful that there are restaurants out there that help feed our families in a pinch and on a budget.

On nights when I’m not cooking, you can call me “the King of the Family Meal Deal.” You can find me waltzing around the Costco food court looking for a large $9.95 pizza, or scouring the weekly supermarket circulars for El Pollo Loco coupons. I’m meticulously watching the instagram reels of local food influencers looking for leads. I’m always on the hunt for ways to expand the to-go options to feed four to six people for under $60.

I’ve searched far and wide and found a variety of tasty bargain takeout solutions from throughout Southern California. Here's a list of places that can affordably cater tonight’s dinner (with a few leftovers for tomorrow).

Chio's Peruvian (Van Nuys)

From time to time, my parents will bring over food from Chio’s Peruvian. They have all the classic Peruvian menu items like lomo saltado, arroz chaufa and tallarines verdes but the sweet spot for a great family meal deal is their Pollo a La Brasa. You can get the Pollo Entero Con Dos Combinaciones meal, which includes a whole chicken with two sides for $29.99. Side dishes include white bean frijoles peruanos, rice, salad, french fries and platanos. Sometimes they’ll have the same deal where you get twice as much food plus a 2-liter bottle of Inca Kola (or Diet Coke) for a little under $60.

Locations:

7755 Sepulveda Blvd., Van Nuys

7115 Van Nuys Blvd., Van Nuys

Hours: Monday to Thursday, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Friday to Sunday 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.

Pita Pitaki (Long Beach)

This authentic Greek city of Long Beach recommendation comes from LAist food and culture writer Gab Chabrán, who has fed his family with Pita Pitaki’s signature Pitaki Apola special. This combination gets you either chicken, pork or lamb gyro meat, two chicken skewers, two pork skewers, potatoes, tzatziki, Greek salad, and pita for only $37. If you feel the need for nearly a kilo of gyro, you can get the Family Gyro Meat Special for $54.99.

Location: 3401 Cherry Ave., Long Beach

Hours: Wednesday to Sunday, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.; closed Monday; Tuesday,10.30 a.m. to 9 p.m.

Chicken Maison (11 locations in the South Bay and Orange County)

Chicken Maison, a Mediterranean rotisserie chicken chain, is also famous for its grilled kabobs. The Kabob Feast includes six chicken, kafta, or steak kabobs, plus four veggie skewers, four large sides, pita, and garlic sauce for $65.95. They also have a similar combo called the Chicken Feast for $52.95. It replaces the kabobs with two whole rotisserie chickens. Their side dishes include steamed vegetables, potato salads, grape leaves, tabbouleh, falafel, and more. They’ve got 11 locations in the South Bay and Orange County.

Locations: Hawthorne, Santa Ana, Fountain Valley, Gardena, Harbor City, North Redondo Beach, South Redondo Beach, Rolling Hills Estates, Torrance Crenshaw, Torrance PCH, Torrance Vermont

Stonefire Grill (12 locations in the Southland)

There are a dozen Stonefire Grill locations from Ventura to Rancho Cucamonga and on down to Irvine. They’ve got a distinctly Southern California menu of pizza, tri tip barbecue, and fresh salads. I think this might be a holdover from the early 2020s lockdown era, but a hungry family can still order the Stonefire Grill 'Stimulus Package.’ It’s no longer publicized on their main menu, but you can access it when you order online. This great deal includes a whole chicken or half tri tip, a 12-inch two-topping pizza or shareable pasta, plus a garden or caesar salad, and eight breadsticks for $45.29 (though the price slightly varies by location.) It’s easily enough for 4-6 people. Sometimes we’ll pay a few bucks more for their BBQ Chopped Chicken Salad and The Works Pizza with sausage, pepperoni, bell peppers, mushrooms, and red onions.

Locations: Torrance, Chatsworth, West Hills, Lakewood, Pasadena, Valencia, Thousand Oaks, Brea, Fountain Valley, Irvine

Panini Kabob (30 locations throughout Southern California)

Whenever we celebrate a birthday with my wife’s family we’ll order in from Panini Kabob. Their Persian-style skewers, fresh salads and side dishes always hit the spot. We’ll typically pick up the Family Kabob Combo. It comes with four chicken kabobs grilled alongside tomatoes, green peppers and onions. It also includes a tray of rice, and salad. You can feed four to six people for $69.99. I like splitting the rice between basmati and bulgur wheat pilaf. For the salad option we’ll usually get a half caesar salad / half romaine avocado. We’ll also add two a la carte koobidehs. Everybody is festively well-fed and the bill comes out to around $100.

India Sweets & Spices (five locations in Los Angeles)

If you’re looking for a filling vegetarian option at a nice price point head to India Sweets & Spices. It’s a small chain of South Asian grocers with an excellent cafeteria-style restaurant in the back. The menus differ at each location, but if you pick up a few lunch specials you can feed a family for days. At the Northridge store the Food Combo #2 is $9 and comes with your choice of white or yellow rice, samosa, naan, papadam, pickle, yogurt, and a dessert which is usually gulab jaman. It also comes with two of the many entrees on the steam table. I’ll usually get chana masala, aloo gobi, saag paneer and paneer tikka masala. If I get two orders for $18, that’s enough for my wife and kids (but my kids are only gonna eat the rice and naan. So I usually order a few more foils of naan.)

22011 Sherman Way, Canoga Park

Tikiyaki (City of Orange)

Tikiyaki in the City of Orange is one of those places that people whisper about in online forums for having delicious food with absurdly enormous portions. They do offer party trays, but if you’re trying to pick up dinner for the family, just order a few of their combo plates. They generously stuff a mountain of rice, meat, vegetables, and an egg roll into the container. The #12 Chicken & Steak Plate will set you back $11.99, but it feeds two to three people. Other popular items include the short ribs, coconut shrimp, tropical orange chicken and the extra spicy version, ‘Volcano Chicken.’ If you need a good vegetarian option, they also serve tofu. Mix-and-match and easily get enough food for 6 people for under $40.

Location: 2271 Tustin St., Orange

Hours: Monday to Saturday, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; closed Sunday

King Pollo (Anaheim)

At King Pollo, the beloved Orange County chicken shack, you can get great burgers, boba, burritos and teriyaki bowls but a family of 6-8 is gonna want to order the famed Family Pack. For $45.49 you’ll get two whole chickens, plus large orders of beans, rice and potato salad. It also comes with tortillas and two containers of salsa. If you need a third pollo rostisado plus extra large sides, you can get the Super Family Pack for $67.49. If you need less, there’s always the single chicken’d Mini Pack for $26.49.

Location: 1925 E. Lincoln Ave., Anaheim

Coal ash harms people and contaminates groundwater, as articulated and regulated under the 2015 Coal Ash Rule.
The EPA has already given coal plants over a decade to transition away from coal-fired facilities or retrofit the coal ash impoundments.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) continues to roll back protections by moving the goal posts for planned coal retirements.

This new EPA proposal presents a threat to communities’ groundwater by allowing toxic coal companies to operate past their planned retirement dates. With coal ash contaminating groundwater with harmful chemicals such as arsenic, chromium, lithium, and more, citizens deserve the utmost protection. Without accountability, more toxic waste will enter our water, making cleanup more costly and difficult when coal plant retirement inevitably arrives.

We urge you to submit a comment to the EPA voicing your concern over their proposal to delay compliance and closure of retiring coal plants. Below is a sample message that we encourage you to modify to make your own. Then go here to submit your comment on this issue via the EPA’s public comment portal.

As a concerned citizen, I oppose the US Environmental Protection Agency’s proposal to delay the closure of toxic, poisonous coal ash ponds.

Coal ash harms people and contaminates groundwater, as articulated and regulated under the 2015 Coal Ash Rule. The EPA’s recent proposal is simply extending a loophole for coal plants to continue polluting.

While the proposal would currently apply to 11 coal plants, the impacted facilities still heavily pollute surrounding communities with little oversight. For example, the Naughton Power Plant in Wyoming violated the Coal Ash Rule with 2022 exceedances of Lithium (x242), Selenium (x150), and Sulfate (x66). If the proposal is accepted as-is, this plant would get an additional three years to close the coal ash pond leaking 242 times the federally allowable level of Lithium into the groundwater.

People do not need excuses; they need protection. Coal-fired power generation has been in decline for years, along with its performance and reliability. The EPA has already given coal plants over a decade to transition away from coal-fired facilities or retrofit the coal ash impoundments. Delaying compliance deadlines will only cost Americans who will pay with their health and pocketbooks.

I oppose the EPA’s proposal to delay the compliance and closure of certain coal ash ponds. I urge the EPA to rescind the proposal so it can hold polluters accountable and protect citizens from harmful coal.",https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/public_citizen_shared_link.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 00:39:48.507902

In court last week, three of the five offshore projects that were blocked won injunctions to continue construction.
While a bill passed in the House, Senate debate broke down after the administration’s Dec. 22 stop-work orders for all five offshore wind projects under construction on the East Coast.
“President Trump has been extremely transparent: wind energy is the scam of the century,” said White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers.
Companies have argued for decades that onerous restrictions make it too difficult to build infrastructure such as big energy projects, power lines and highways.","On his first day in office, President Donald Trump launched a campaign against wind energy with an executive order to stop leasing and permits for offshore wind farms.

The administration went on to block wind farms already under construction, while Trump himself vowed in Cabinet meetings that he would not allow any to be built under his watch, as he criticized them for being ugly, inefficient and harmful to animals.

A year later, Trump appears to be losing his war on wind on several fronts. In court last week, three of the five offshore projects that were blocked won injunctions to continue construction. Two remaining cases are expected to be heard soon.

And in recent months an informal coalition of companies has emerged across the energy industry, including oil and clean energy firms, to push for an end to the targeting of wind energy, fearing they could fall prey to the same tactics in the future.

“We know what administrations can do to our projects when they have opposition to building pipelines or other energy infrastructure. This has never just been about wind,” said Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute lobby group.

The blocked wind projects have become inextricably linked to a push in Congress to overhaul the system for permitting infrastructure projects, a top legislative objective for oil firms. While a bill passed in the House, Senate debate broke down after the administration’s Dec. 22 stop-work orders for all five offshore wind projects under construction on the East Coast. Negotiations remain on hold.

“It’s time for both sides to put their weapons down and let’s work on getting comprehensive permitting reform done in this Congress,” Sommers said.

Still, analysts agree that Trump’s personal preferences are driving the anti-wind policy. More than a decade ago, he unsuccessfully sued to stop offshore wind turbines built near a Scottish golf course he owned and has apparently nursed a grudge ever since. The mounting court losses and industry pressure may not change his mind.

“Given the legal rulings so far, we can expect the projects that are under construction to finish and to ultimately start operating,” said Julia Hoos, an analyst at Aurora Energy Research. “That said, I think this is a war of attrition more than a war of a single ruling … the administration might very well succeed in doing long-term damage to the industry as a whole.”

Legal defeats

Trump officials last year began targeting individual wind projects, generally citing unspecified concerns that their permits were improperly granted, a move that companies were able to fend off.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) negotiated an agreement in May to lift a stop-work order on Empire Wind, slated to help power half a million homes in the New York City area, in exchange for reconsidering her stance against natural gas pipelines.

Revolution Wind, off the coast of Rhode Island, successfully sued to lift a stop-work order in September, winning a preliminary injunction that allowed construction to resume.

And in early December, a federal judge struck down the administration’s order to halt permitting for wind projects, ruling that it was “arbitrary and capricious.”

The administration quickly pivoted to targeting offshore leases instead of permits. On Dec. 22, the Interior Department announced stop-work orders for all five projects under construction, citing national security concerns in a classified report that has not been publicly released.

Last week, separate courts delivered a swift rebuke by granting preliminary injunctions to Revolution, Empire and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, with all companies announcing intentions to quickly restart construction. Sunrise Wind, off the coast of New York, and Vineyard Wind, near Massachusetts, are also awaiting a hearing.

It’s unclear what effect the court losses have had on the administration’s wind policy.

“President Trump has been extremely transparent: wind energy is the scam of the century,” said White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers. “The Administration looks forward to ultimate victory on the issue.”

Rogers did not comment on the court losses or pending litigation.

“The likelihood of the administration continuing to lose in court, hopefully, would factor into their recognition that supporting all forms of American energy is actually their job,” said Jason Grumet, chief executive officer of the American Clean Power Association.

A Senate stalemate

Immediately after the Dec. 22 stop-work orders, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-Rhode Island) halted negotiations over a permitting reform bill.

“The illegal attacks on fully permitted renewable energy projects must be reversed if there is to be any chance that permitting talks resume,” Whitehouse said in a joint statement with Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-New Mexico). “There is no path to permitting reform if this administration refuses to follow the law.”

Whitehouse’s office said earlier this month that permitting reform is “dead in the water,” and congressional aides confirmed that negotiations on the bill have not resumed since the stop-work orders were issued.

Permitting reform is a shorthand for overhauling how infrastructure projects are vetted and authorized under a constellation of laws including the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Clean Air and Water acts.

Companies have argued for decades that onerous restrictions make it too difficult to build infrastructure such as big energy projects, power lines and highways. They particularly want shorter time limits for filing lawsuits to challenge their permits.

Democrats want assurances written into the law that projects will be evaluated fairly, regardless of whether they involve oil, gas, wind or solar energy. They, along with industry, also want guarantees that once a permit is issued, it cannot later be revoked just because another political party wins the White House.

Energy firms across the board, including oil companies, are trying to stop the war on wind in exchange for a more stable and predictable business environment.

“If you’ve got a project that’s gotten all of its approvals and started construction, there ought to be some kind of safe harbor, so that we don’t have the next administration coming back and rethinking or stopping it,” said Marty Durbin, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Global Energy Institute.

“All sides here, the oil and gas industry, the renewables industry, and everyone else involved are saying, ‘Yeah, we all get it,’” he added.

“If there’s a flip in administration and the Democrat president follows the Trump approach of weaponizing the permitting process, the impacts on oil and gas would be profound,” Grumet said.

The oil industry has made the case to the administration that all companies will benefit from neutrality regardless of energy source and certainty that issued permits will be honored, even if that would rule out blocking the offshore wind projects, according to one industry representative who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private.

Lobbyists say that permitting reform hinges on Trump changing his position on blocking renewables projects, although there are no signs of that happening. Even if Republicans broke ranks to pass permitting reform that included constraints on targeting wind, Trump could still veto it or direct staff to reject renewables permits.

And a looming energy crunch

Industry groups and analysts say what’s at stake is the ability of the United States to meet surging electricity demand from artificial intelligence, data centers and the increasing electrification of society in general.

Headed into the midterm elections later this year, the White House is also feeling pressure to respond to voters’ concerns about rising prices and affordability, including ballooning electricity bills.

PJM, the electricity authority in 13 states and the District of Columbia, said last week in a court filing that delaying Dominion Energy’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) project will hurt the 67 million customers in their region.

Those concerns are real, as PJM struggles to maintain electricity capacity at 20% above peak demand, said Hoos, the energy analyst, a margin that ensures there will be enough power to prevent blackouts even in a crisis. In its most recent auction with electricity producers, PJM has been able to reach only 15% above peak demand. CVOW could help close the gap.

Responding to the December stop-work orders, New England’s electricity authority similarly said that stopping Revolution Wind as well as Vineyard Wind would hurt grid reliability and increase costs for consumers.

Durbin and others in the energy sector say the only way to alleviate the expected shortfall in electricity through the end of the decade is to build more energy projects, regardless of the source. Bureaucratic delays and bottlenecks will just drive prices up, he said.",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2026/01/Wind-Power.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 07:40:04.145296

Consider just two of the states analyzed in The Western Way report – South Dakota and Arizona – which have some of the most reliable power grids in the country.
The lesson from states like South Dakota and Arizona is that energy decisions cannot be made based on broad-brush national arguments.","Sometimes the debate over U.S. energy policy feels more like a shouting match, instead of a factual discussion about how to meet the nation’s rapidly growing needs.

In one corner, there’s the push for 100% renewables. In the other corner, it’s almost all about oil and gas.

But outside the competing echo chambers on the left and the right, a quiet success story is unfolding in America’s rural – and yes, more politically conservative – communities.

It turns out that keeping the lights on isn’t about picking a side. It’s about picking all the energy sources that can deliver affordable and reliable electricity based on local conditions.

That was the major finding of a new report issued by The Western Way, a non-profit that seeks pro-market solutions to energy and environmental challenges, on power grid reliability in rural America.

The report reviewed 10 rural and conservative-leaning states – Arizona, Idaho, Iowa, Missouri, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming. It concluded the power grids in those states are 2 to 7 times more reliable than the national average, according to data on electrical outages from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

What is their secret? It isn’t a singular reliance on coal or natural gas, nor is it a blind rush toward renewables and battery storage. The data reveals that there is no “one-size-fits-all” solution. Instead, these states are harnessing a range of energy sources to keep their power grids reliable.

Consider just two of the states analyzed in The Western Way report – South Dakota and Arizona – which have some of the most reliable power grids in the country.

In South Dakota, the number one source of electricity is wind (58%), followed by hydropower (22%) and natural gas (11%), with coal and other sources making up the remainder. When working together, these sources make South Dakota’s grid the 2nd most reliable in the country.

But in Arizona, the top source of electricity is natural gas (45%), followed by nuclear (27%) and solar (13%), with coal and hydropower making up most of the balance. Arizona also has more than 2 gigawatts of battery storage capacity, which allows solar power generated during the day to be used after the sun goes down.

Despite looking nothing like South Dakota, the Arizona power grid is also highly reliable, ranked 3rd in the country – and the reliability difference between the two states is less than 0.001%.

Two very different models for keeping the lights on. Both highly effective.

But that’s not all. The Western Way report also finds that the Trump administration’s policy on energy is a lot more nuanced than the mainstream media would have you believe.

Back in July, the U.S. Department of Energy published a study outlining what it will take to keep America’s power grid stable by the end of the decade if the nation’s rising appetite for energy – led by data centers and the reshoring of manufacturing – continues.

The study called for the continued operation of coal and natural gas-fired power plants that have previously been slated for retirement. While most media coverage of the DOE study focused on that recommendation, there was much, much more to the story.

Keeping older plants running longer would close less than a third of the looming reliability gap. The rest of the gap would have to be closed with a range of different energy sources, including 187 gigawatts of solar, wind and battery storage, according to the DOE.

For scale, those projections would increase U.S. renewable electricity capacity by around 40% and the nation’s battery storage by more than 80%, according to September data from the EIA.

The lesson from states like South Dakota and Arizona is that energy decisions cannot be made based on broad-brush national arguments.

Yes, the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress opposed federal tax subsidies for wind and solar and started to phase them out. But tax policy is a completely separate conversation from the engineering reality of keeping a regional grid running during a blizzard or a heatwave.

As we face a future of higher demand, no energy source should be sidelined because of rhetoric that doesn't reflect conditions on the ground. A stable power grid requires a mix of energy sources working together as efficiently as possible – in other words, “all of the above.”

If we truly care about keeping the lights on, let’s stop fighting over the “right” kind of energy and embrace the idea of building a grid that uses it all.",https://assets.realclear.com/images/70/707482_6_.jpeg,N,,2026-01-22 00:41:14.096927

As our example, we’ll respond to the proposed rollback of clean car standards: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has proposed reversing the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for cars and trucks.
The 2022 CAFE rule has made cars more fuel-efficient, saving drivers money at the pump and reducing air pollution.
For example: “I’m here because I’m concerned that reversing the CAFE standards will increase costs for millions of families like mine.
For example: “I oppose the proposal to reverse the CAFE standards because it will make driving even more expensive while we are already struggling with higher costs.","Are you looking for more ways to take action on the environmental issues that you care about? In this series, we’re exploring overlooked ways to advocate for our environment and communities. We believe that the more people participate in the workings of our government, the better outcomes will be for people and the planet!

First up in our series: speaking truth to power – regulatory power, that is. You can give federal agencies your thoughts on their proposed rules and regulations – like those that impact our air, water, and climate. We first explored how to submit a public comment online. Today, we’re diving into how you can speak directly to policymakers by testifying in a public hearing.

You will have up to three minutes to give your remarks. A good rule of thumb for drafting testimony is that one minute = about 150 words. Plan your comments for no more than 450 words. Write your comments down and practice them so you are familiar with what you want to say and how long it will take.

Here’s how to structure your testimony. As our example, we’ll respond to the proposed rollback of clean car standards:

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has proposed reversing the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for cars and trucks. The 2022 CAFE rule has made cars more fuel-efficient, saving drivers money at the pump and reducing air pollution. Reversing it would allow automakers to make less fuel-efficient cars that are more expensive to drive. The comment period closes February 4, 2025.

Introduction: Introduce yourself and say why you are there.

For example: “Thank you for the opportunity to testify. My name is [your name here] and I am here today as a private citizen. [You can also include your job title; where you’re from; that you’re a parent, grandparent, aunt or uncle, etc; and any expertise or affiliations you have]. I urge DOT to not finalize this proposal to take away fuel economy standards that save consumers money.

Give your personal reason for testifying: Explain why the proposal is important to you and the impacts it will have. Use examples from your own life – this will make your testimony compelling and memorable! The agencies would rather hear about your specific concerns and story than just hear the same talking points repeated.

For example: “I’m here because I’m concerned that reversing the CAFE standards will increase costs for millions of families like mine. Our costs for groceries, electricity, and other expenses are already skyrocketing. We can’t afford to spend more on gas for less fuel-efficient cars. I have a long commute to work and have to fill my tank every week. I worry how I would afford it if I had to fill up more often.”

Conclusion: Reiterate your position and thank the panel.

For example: “I oppose the proposal to reverse the CAFE standards because it will make driving even more expensive while we are already struggling with higher costs. On top of that, it will increase air pollution that makes people sick and unsafe. Thanks for the opportunity to testify today.”

Keep an eye out for an email from the rulemaking agency. They will send a speaker list with specific timeslots a few days before the hearing.

Plan to log on 20-30 minutes in advance of your scheduled time to access the virtual room. It is possible that they will be running ahead of schedule. But, also be prepared for a wait. Depending on the number of speakers, there may be a delay. Often, the people running the hearing will announce the next 3-5 speakers in a block, so you’ll have an additional heads up before they call your name to speak.

Remember to keep your testimony to three minutes or less. The hearing administrators will be strict about this time limit.

When it’s your turn, take a deep breath and speak slowly! Remember, this is an influential moment in the rulemaking process. Officials want to hear about how this rule would impact you personally.

For more inspiration, check out the testimony LCV’s Darien Davis gave at the recent hearing on the CAFE rule:

Testimony of Darien Davis, Government Advocate for Climate and Clean Energy at the League of Conservation Voters,

before the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Department of Transportation (DOT),

at the Public Hearing for The Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule III for Model Years 2022 to 2031 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks

January 7, 2026

Hello and thanks for giving me the opportunity to testify today. My name is Darien Davis, and I’m a Government Affairs Advocate at the League of Conservation Voters, or LCV. I’m here today on behalf of LCV’s members across the country to oppose the inaccurately-named Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles rule.

The SAFE vehicle rule will actually do the exact opposite of its name; it will gut fuel economy standards that for decades have helped to reduce fuel costs for drivers and air pollution for everyone. These money-saving standards, known as the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or “CAFE”, Standards, help to ensure that new cars are more efficient and can go longer distances on a single tank of gas.

At a time when the costs of basic goods and services are already sky-high, and steadily increasing, the Trump administration should not be increasing costs even further by gutting miles per gallon standards. Electricity costs are up 13% over the past 12 months, and I’ve seen my electricity bill rise significantly, despite my usage staying mostly the same. Fortunately, I am a single person with enough support and job benefits that I can adjust my budget to absorb these higher utility bills. I would be hard-pressed to do this if I had the additional, rising expense of owning and operating a car.

People across the country are doing the same thing that I’m doing – they’re examining their budgets and looking for places to cut back just to make ends meet. Working families need access to affordable and reliable transportation options in order to make a living. Unfortunately, transportation is the second largest household expense, just behind housing.

Even so, the existing efficiency standards for cars and trucks have been providing relief to drivers for decades; a recent NRDC study found that fuel economy improvements over the past fifteen years have saved the average household hundreds of dollars per year. The Trump administration is misguided to eliminate this relief for families’ transportation costs.

Rolling back fuel-economy standards would also have steep costs for our health. The current standards for cars and trucks have the added benefit of reducing dangerous, health-harming air pollution. Eliminating these cost-saving standards means decreased air quality, and lower air quality means families, especially those suffering from asthma or heart disease, could see more frequent hospital visits.

In summary, I oppose the proposed SAFE Vehicles rule because it will make driving a car even more expensive while we are in the midst of an affordability crisis, and will increase the pollution that makes people sick and unsafe.

We expect gas demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports to increase rapidly, as well.

They combine weather, production output, logistics, and regional demand patterns into real-time forecasts that enable traders to anticipate volatility.","The energy landscape in the United States and Canada is entering a defining decade. Electricity demand is outpacing supply, driven by data center consumption, industrial electrification, and population growth. Meanwhile, the use of renewables and nuclear energy is expanding too slowly to fill the gap. As a result, natural gas is becoming a more important part of meeting the region’s electricity needs. Gas already provides baseload generation in many places and will play an increasing role in managing demand peaks.

With this increase, regional imbalances in gas demand and pricing mean that stakeholders will need to prepare strategically to capture part of the trading opportunity—a projected $7 billion by 2040—within the natural-gas-industry value pool. In this article, we explain the main sources of these market imbalances and offer strategies for companies to harness returns from natural gas trading—both today and as the sector shifts in the future.

The gas industry in the United States and Canada

In the United States alone, power demand is expected to grow by up to 3.5 percent per year through 2040, and emerging power sources can offer only limited near-term relief. Proprietary McKinsey analysis suggests that such sources will provide approximately 30 percent of total power generation by 2030 (Exhibit 1). The next wave of nuclear capacity, including small modular reactors, is unlikely to arrive until the late 2030s. Renewables, predicted to continue to expand in the United States, may face slowed deployment as incentives expire and as the reemergence of nuclear power stokes competition for long-term power contracts.

Against this backdrop, our analysis shows about 4.1 billion cubic feet per day (BCFD) of additional gas demand expected for power generation across the United States and Canada by 2030 (Exhibit 2). We expect gas demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports to increase rapidly, as well.

Demand for roughly three BCFD—more than half of the additional gas demand for power—is expected to come from data centers. These centers will likely cluster in corridors near natural gas supplies, such as the PJM interconnection in the eastern United States and supplies in Texas and the US Southeast (Exhibit 3).

Gas is well positioned to meet the coming demand but will have some difficulties. Gas-turbine-manufacturing backlogs are delaying new generation capacity. Permitting hurdles, cost inflation, and community opposition are slowing pipeline and transmission development. Following the addition of pipelines in the region, the Permian Basin now risks overbuilding and declining returns from oversupply, while pipeline-constrained US regions such as Appalachia and the Gulf Coast lack the infrastructure to carry gas to regional demand centers. The result of these competing pressures is a market defined by volatility, regional divergence, and physical bottlenecks.

Opportunities for trading, arbitrage, and optionality

Understanding the crosswinds of volatility, regional divergence, and physical bottlenecks can enable well-established traders to acquire value through arbitrage and optionality in the following areas:

Wider nodal spreads: Distinct regional consumption patterns, from seasonal heating to consistent 24/7 loads from clustered data centers, are expanding price gaps between grid nodes.

Shifting spark spreads: The difference between the electricity price and corresponding gas price varies by location and time, largely because of load variation, power composition mix, and uneven infrastructure development.

Volatility from LNG exports: Expanding export capacity along the US Gulf Coast is producing fresh price differentials, including the influence of global gas prices and transport risk premiums. The large gas needs for LNG production create concentrated demand in a few locations in western Louisiana and eastern Texas. This concentration can generate additional dislocations and increase potential volatility.

Natural gas equivalents as proxy hedges: Equivalents, such as compressed gas and emerging e-methane, are gaining traction as proxy hedges for power market exposure, creating an additional lever for portfolio diversification.

Optionality through physical holdings: Fuel and land assets offer important optionality. Stored onshore gas holdings hedge against unexpected load or outages from extreme weather. Land near major interconnections or pipelines is gaining strategic importance, particularly where infrastructure access aligns with data center or industrial development.

These opportunities are dynamic. The underlying drivers will change over time, creating new spreads and hedges for trading and value creation.

Essential capabilities for stakeholders

Navigating these persistent yet shifting structural differentials will require organizations to react quickly across a range of financial and physical markets. Success at securing the potential benefits will likely depend on three capabilities—sufficient trading scale, infrastructure access, and analytics-driven optimization:

Trading scale: Leading organizations are building scale and breadth by expanding both their positions and their trading desks across commodities. Scale allows traders to improve their capture of market opportunities and management of risk across markets.

Infrastructure: Owning or controlling access to key infrastructure (including pipelines, backhaul capacity, and storage) allows traders to balance portfolios, manage event risk, and create their own optionality. These assets also enable participation in secondary capacity markets, which often remain liquid in downturns and can reduce exposure to long-term take-or-pay contracting. Investing to ease congestion and align asset locations with deliverability can unlock additional advantage. Integrating gas connectivity into power plant and data center planning can help ensure reliable fuel supply and price stability.

Data and analytics: Advanced data platforms ingest comprehensive data sets and leverage AI-powered analytical tools and dashboards to provide traders with fresh and reliable market insights. They combine weather, production output, logistics, and regional demand patterns into real-time forecasts that enable traders to anticipate volatility. These capabilities can improve trading outcomes through higher decision speed and accuracy. They also help organizations design long-term fuel and tolling agreements and optimize behind-the-meter supply contracts to stabilize returns.

The coming decade will be a defining one for US and Canadian gas. Rising energy demand, constrained power infrastructure, and the limited pace of scaling for renewables all create risk—but they also create a rich trading environment. Organizations that act decisively now will be in a position to capture an outsize share of this expanding energy value pool, not just today, but for years to come, as opportunities shift in this rapidly evolving sector.",https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/oil%20and%20gas/our%20insights/capturing%20the%207%20billion%20dollar%20value%20in%20canadian%20and%20us%20natural%20gas%20trading/trading%20the%20power%20gap-2232329170-thumb-1536x1536.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 19:59:24.361336

Now Wyoming is building charging stations on routes between its national parks and EV-loving California.
The move underlines the ongoing challenge of curbing carbon pollution amid climbing prices, spiking energy demand and a Trump administration opposed to renewable energy, writes Adam Aton.","Even before Donald Trump returned to the White House, a Biden-era program to build a national network of electric vehicle chargers was struggling to take off.

Four years and a funding freeze later, states have spent only 2 percent of the $4.4 billion available to them under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, writes David Ferris. Estimates vary, but that amounts to between 120 to 150 charging stations nationwide — out of the roughly 1,600 needed to achieve the program’s aim of a station every 50 miles on major highways.

The program initially suffered from run-of-the-mill bureaucracy during the Biden era — state transportation departments had to figure out how to build chargers — and then ran into the Trump administration’s funding freeze. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy paused the money for seven months, prompting station builders to back out and throwing states’ plans into disarray.

Arkansas, for example, saw 19 awarded contracts dwindle to just seven.

“All that time was lost and we are now playing catch-up,” Jared Wiley, director of the Arkansas Department of Transportation, told David.

But with the Trump administration back on board — Duffy lifted the freeze in August, following an adverse court ruling that the administration chose not to appeal — state officials and experts say the program is turning a corner.

States have firm plans for $1.4 billion of the funds, with construction set to ramp up later this year and into 2027 and 2028.

And at least one state that had resisted the program — Wyoming — is now supportive. In unfreezing the program’s funding, Trump issued new guidance that relaxed rules on station locations that Wyoming said didn’t make sense for more rural states.

Now Wyoming is building charging stations on routes between its national parks and EV-loving California.

“Assuming no new political hurdles arise, it wouldn’t be a stretch to see the current open site count double by the end of the year,” wrote Steve Birkett, an independent EV-charging-station analyst, in a post on LinkedIn.

Still, the obstacles — and political hurdles — are significant.

Five states — Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Nevada and Wyoming — have spent no money. And Congress just announced a bipartisan bill that would reallocate $500 million of the program’s funds, diverting it to other federal highway programs.

On top of that, Republicans have already axed federal incentives for EVs and other clean energy programs. Already, Americans are buying fewer EVs, with sales hitting a three-year low in November.

Trump insults Europe, makes his Greenland pitch

Trump assailed Europe’s pursuit of green energy, bragged about axing wind projects and made a forceful case for U.S. ownership of Greenland during a speech to world leaders Wednesday, writes Robin Bravender.

Trump’s main message: Other countries should follow his playbook of boosting fossil fuels and firing government bureaucrats.

His comments come as Trump takes a victory lap celebrating his first year in office, which has been marked by dramatic swings on energy production and foreign policy. They also come at a turbulent moment when Trump’s quest for control of Greenland has escalated tensions with European allies.

EPA’s proposal seeks to limit the scope of state-issued water quality certifications (WQCs) under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) to water quality impacts associated with discharges authorized by federal agency actions. The Proposed Rule also addresses concerns raised by applicants for federal licenses and permits (including for hydroelectric projects, natural gas pipelines, and other energy and infrastructure projects) that certain states have overstepped their Section 401 authority to impose onerous terms and conditions unrelated to water quality and artificially extended the statutory time limits for issuing WQCs.

CWA Section 401 requires any applicant for a federal license or permit that may result in any discharge to waters of the United States (WOTUS) to obtain a state certification that “any such discharge will comply with the applicable provisions” of sections 301, 302, 303, 306, and 307 of the CWA — all of which relate to effluent limitations. States may impose conditions on such certifications, including to comply with “any other appropriate requirement of State law” as provided in CWA Section 401(d). Over time, however, many states have used this conditioning authority to address issues unrelated to water quality.

EPA’s Proposed Rule, similar to the 2020 Rule, would narrow the scope of WQC conditions and provide predictable timelines for projects to receive their WQCs. In so doing, the Proposed Rule rolls back significant portions of the current rule, issued in 2023 under the Biden administration (2023 Rule).

Following is an overview of key changes in the Proposed Rule:

Scope of Certification – EPA notes the current 2023 Rule “provides States with sweeping authority to decide the fate of nationally important infrastructure projects, such as natural gas pipelines and hydropower dams, based on potentially speculative water quality impacts not linked to a point source discharge into waters of the United States.” To correct this, and consistent with the 2020 Rule, the Proposed Rule would scrap the 2023 Rule’s provision that the WQC can relate to the “activity as a whole” and instead limit state certifications to addressing discharges “from a point source into waters of the United States.” This, in turn, would prevent states from using Section 401 to address nonpoint source impacts, impacts to purely state waters that are not considered WOTUS, and non-water quality policy concerns such as land use, endangered species, and climate change. The preamble to the Proposed Rule describes in detail how limiting WQCs in this way is consistent with the legislative history and plain language of the CWA, relying heavily on the Supreme Court’s landmark 2024 decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo curtailing judicial deference to agencies’ statutory interpretations.

Request for Certification – The Proposed Rule would create a uniform, national standard for what a permit applicant must submit in a “request for certification” to establish, with certainty, the start of the one-year statutory period for states to act on a WQC request. Conversely, the Proposed Rule would bar states from imposing their own “completeness” criteria that control when the clock starts — although they may still request additional information from applicants.

Timing of Review – The Proposed Rule reiterates that the failure of a state to act on a WQC request within one year results in a waiver, while imposing several restrictions on states’ ability to extend the one-year certification deadline. Extensions would require the approval of the federal agency and only be allowed for specified reasons, and state certifying authorities would be barred from orchestrating withdrawal and resubmittal of requests to extend the one-year “reasonable period of time” cap — a maneuver that has long been criticized by applicants as gamesmanship that further facilitates the injection of non-water quality policy priorities into the certification process. Notably, the Proposed Rule does not foreclose another form of gamesmanship: denial of WQC applications without prejudice.

Contents of Certifications – Among other changes, the Proposed Rule would require states to explain how each condition of a certification relates to a CWA effluent limitation and would mandate any WQC denial to cite the specific water quality requirement at issue, which may deter certain states’ efforts to prolong the WQC process by denying applications without prejudice. Notably, EPA explains that WQC conditions should be limited to “water quality requirements” defined as applicable provisions of sections 301, 302, 303, 306 and 307 of the CWA, and any applicable and appropriate state water quality-related regulatory requirements for discharges. In explaining what water quality-related requirements are “applicable and appropriate,” EPA expressly provides that it is not limiting state regulatory provisions to only EPA-approved provisions — although it requests comment on this point. The Proposed Rule continues to allow states to incorporate narrative water quality standards and other regulatory requirements that apply to point source discharges, declining to limit conditions to just “numeric water quality criteria.”

Modifications – The Proposed Rule would allow states to modify a previously granted WQC only when the federal permitting agency and the applicant agree to the modification, including the content of that modification.

Neighboring Jurisdictions – The Proposed Rule would streamline the process by which other states may object to a discharge that “may affect” their water quality under CWA Section 401(a)(2), including establishing a 60-day deadline for the other state to file an objection and a 90-day deadline for the permitting agency to act on a valid state objection.

In aggregate, the proposed amendments would create a WQC process that is more predictable, provides long-term certainty for WQC holders, and significantly constrains states’ ability to bootstrap other policy concerns onto their Section 401 authority. However, EPA notes in the preamble that if a state imposes conditions in a WQC that exceed the scope outlined in the 401 Rule, the remedy would be found in court. This means litigation of both the Proposed Rule and individual WQCs is likely to continue.

EPA did not include several regulatory changes suggested by industry during past comment periods in the Proposed Rule, indicating that there are still opportunities for further improvement before EPA adopts a final rule. For example, the Proposed Rule is silent on the issue of who (states and/or action agencies) has the authority to enforce WQC conditions incorporated into the federal license or permit, as well as the extent to which EPA or the federal permitting agencies can serve as a “gatekeeper” for WQC conditions that exceed the scope of CWA Section 401.

Not only has that surging demand driven up power prices, but the speed at which data centers are trying to connect to the grid has created reliability concerns. Mounting worries about affordability and energy security prompted the White House and 13 governors last week to propose an emergency power auction that would compel tech giants to bid for electricity supplies.

Subject: Support Reauthorization of Vital Water Infrastructure Programs

Dear Chairman Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, Chairman Guthrie and Ranking Member Pallone,

The National Conference of State Legislatures, the bipartisan organization representing the legislatures of our nation's states, territories, writes to express our support for the reauthorization of the Drinking Water and Clean Water State Revolving Funds (SRFs).

Our nation’s water infrastructure is essential to the strength of American communities. For decades, Congress has worked with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the states to provide billions of dollars in loans, principal forgiveness and technical assistance for clean water and drinking water projects. This investment, along with billions of dollars in supplemental funding provided through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, has gone a long way to ensuring water systems can continue to serve their communities.

However, recent EPA surveys and assessments show that further investment will be needed over the next 20 years to fund necessary drinking water infrastructure projects across the country, as well as wastewater, stormwater, wastewater treatment and nonpoint source control projects. These needs, compounded by a 31 percent decrease in federal capital investment in water infrastructure over the last few decades—as reported by the Value of Water Campaign and the American Society of Civil Engineers—has put a strain on states and local governments, who now must choose between keeping water rates affordable and deferring critical maintenance.

When communities can leverage low-interest loans from the SRFs, they save on average an estimated $960 million in interest rates over the life of the loan and can cut the cost of financing by more than 50%, according to the testimony of Jeff Walker on behalf of the Council of Infrastructure Financing Authorities to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee on March 11, 2025.

These long-standing programs are an important part of protecting human health and keeping our economy moving. Preventing water infrastructure failure could save billions in cumulative healthcare costs over the next 20 years. Additionally, completing critical infrastructure repairs and replacements on schedule, rather than deferring maintenance, saves money in the long run. By having access to state revolving loan funds and direct federal grants, communities can provide safe, reliable infrastructure at an affordable rate.

The Drinking Water and Clean Water SRFs are essential for maintaining reliable access to affordable financing and providing clean and safe water for residents and businesses. We urge you to reauthorize the SRFs at no less than current funding levels. If you have any questions regarding the priorities outlined above, please do not hesitate to contact Ben Nasta at 202.624.3596 or ben.nasta@ncsl.org.

Sincerely,

Tim Storey

However, it can take time for big changes like a new data center to be reflected on your bill, says Stein: “Rate increases filter down to consumers over the course of years, so the rate increases we're seeing today are the result of investment decisions or policy actions taken two, three, or five years ago.”

Stein warns that electricity rate hikes, painful as they are, are often needed to keep the electricity grid reliable—even more so now with increased demand.

(the “Company”) (NASDAQ:GSBC), the holding company for Great Southern Bank (the “Bank”), today reported that preliminary earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2025, were $1.45 per diluted common share ($16.3 million net income) compared to $1.27 per diluted common share ($14.9 million net income) for the three months ended December 31, 2024. Full-year preliminary earnings for 2025 were $71.0 million, or $6.19 per diluted common share, compared to $61.8 million, or $5.26 per diluted common share, for 2024.

For the quarter ended December 31, 2025, annualized return on average common equity was 10.16%, annualized return on average assets was 1.16%, and annualized net interest margin was 3.70%, compared to 9.76%, 1.00% and 3.49%, respectively, for the quarter ended December 31, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2025, return on average common equity was 11.38%, return on average assets was 1.22%, and net interest margin was 3.67%, compared to 10.55%, 1.05% and 3.42%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Key Results :

Significant Expense Items : During the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company recorded expenses related to adjustments to asset values for branch closures and certain leased facilities. Expenses totaling $259,000 and $287,000 were recorded in Other Income and Net Occupancy and Equipment Expense, respectively.

Net Interest Income : Net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2025 decreased $371,000 (or approximately 0.7%) to $49.2 million compared to $49.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, largely driven by the completion of accounting recognition in October 2025 of interest income from a previously-terminated interest rate swap, partially offset by lower interest expense on deposit accounts and other borrowings. Annualized net interest margin was 3.70% for the quarter ended December 31, 2025, compared to 3.49% for the quarter ended December 31, 2024, and 3.72% for the quarter ended September 30, 2025.

Asset Quality : Non-performing assets and potential problem loans totaled $9.5 million at December 31, 2025, a decrease of $7.1 million from $16.6 million at December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2025, non-performing assets were $8.1 million (0.15% of total assets), a decrease of $1.5 million from $9.6 million (0.16% of total assets) at December 31, 2024. See “Asset Quality” below.

Liquidity : The Company had secured borrowing line availability at the FHLBank and Federal Reserve Bank of $1.32 billion and $305.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2025.

Capital : The Company’s capital position remained strong as of December 31, 2025, significantly exceeding the “well-capitalized” thresholds established by regulatory agencies. See “Capital” below.

Loans : Total net loans, excluding mortgage loans held for sale, decreased $333.5 million, or 7.1%, from $4.69 billion at December 31, 2024 to $4.36 billion at December 31, 2025. This decrease was primarily driven by decreases in other residential (multi-family) loans, construction loans, one- to four-family residential loans, and commercial business loans. Compared to September 30, 2025, net loans decreased $110.8 million. The Bank experienced significant loan repayments in the 2025 fourth quarter and year.

Selected Financial Data:

Three Months Ended December 31, December 31, September 30, 2025 2024 2025 (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net interest income $ 49,163 $ 49,534 $ 50,773 Provision (credit) for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments 882 1,556 (379 ) Non-interest income 7,188 6,934 7,062 Non-interest expense 36,000 36,947 36,116 Provision for income taxes 3,194 3,043 4,346 Net income $ 16,275 $ 14,922 $ 17,752 Earnings per diluted common share $ 1.45 $ 1.27 $ 1.56

Joseph W. Turner, President and CEO of Great Southern, commented, “Our fourth quarter and full year 2025 results reflect the sustained success of our core banking operations and our commitment to long-term tangible book value appreciation, despite a volatile economic environment. Throughout the year, we remained focused on preserving net interest margin, protecting credit quality, controlling non-interest expense, and opportunistically repurchasing our stock. That discipline translated into solid profitability in the fourth quarter, with net income of $16.3 million, or $1.45 per diluted common share, compared to $14.9 million, or $1.27 per diluted common share, in the prior year period. For the full year, net income was $71.0 million, or $6.19 per diluted common share, compared to $61.8 million, or $5.26 per diluted common share, in the prior year.”

Turner noted, “Core performance remained solid during the quarter, supported by resilient net interest income, a steady net interest margin, continued moderation in funding costs, and disciplined asset-liability management. Net interest income totaled $49.2 million for the 2025 fourth quarter, down modestly from the prior-year quarter, due mainly to the end of quarterly recognition of interest income from a previously-terminated interest rate swap, as we had disclosed in prior filings. The quarterly recognition had been $2.0 million in prior quarters and was only $134,000 in the fourth quarter of 2025, since it ended in early October 2025. Despite lower interest income, effective management of funding costs reduced interest expense and mostly offset the decrease in interest income. The effective management of loan repricing and funding costs resulted in net interest margin expansion, reaching 3.70% in the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to 3.49% in the same quarter in 2024. Core deposits remained stable during the quarter, underscoring the strength of our customer relationships and the enduring value of our community banking franchise. Compared to the third quarter of 2025, net interest income decreased $1.6 million, due mainly to the ending of income recognition from the previously-terminated interest rate swap.”

Turner added, “Loan production remained active during the quarter, though total net loans declined modestly due to heightened paydown and refinancing activity. These repayments were primarily within the multi-family, construction, one- to four-family residential, and commercial business loan portfolios. While we continue to be selective with loan originations, our pipeline of unfunded commitments remained solid, particularly within construction and commercial real estate lending. Additionally, our credit discipline, emphasis on relationship-based lending, and conservative underwriting standards remain evident in our excellent asset quality metrics.”

Turner further commented, “Non-performing assets were 0.15% of total assets at year-end 2025, and net charge-offs were negligible for both the fourth quarter and the full year. We did not record a provision for credit losses on loans during 2025.”

Turner continued, “Operating discipline remained a priority in the fourth quarter. Non-interest expense totaled approximately $36.0 million, in line with the prior-year quarter and the third quarter of 2025. As part of our focus on controlling operating costs, we continue to strategically invest in technology, infrastructure, and personnel, enabling efficiencies and ultimately expanding capabilities for our customers. The fourth quarter of 2025 also included certain facility-related costs incurred during the period which were not normal operating costs. In 2026, we expect to continue investing in technology. Non-interest income for the quarter totaled $7.2 million, supported by recurring fee-based revenue streams and increased loan-related fee income.”

“As we begin 2026, we remain focused on maintaining strong capital and liquidity positions, deploying capital thoughtfully, maintaining strong credit metrics, and supporting our customers and communities. At December 31, 2025, our tangible common equity ratio was 11.2%, and book value per common share was approximately $57.50, reflecting the benefit of consistent earnings and disciplined capital management, including share repurchases during the quarter and throughout 2025. While economic conditions and market interest rate levels may fluctuate throughout 2026, we believe our conservative approach, sound balance sheet, and dedicated associates position Great Southern to continue delivering long-term value for our stockholders,” Turner concluded.

Net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2025 decreased $371,000 (0.7%) to $49.2 million, compared to $49.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2024. This decrease was driven primarily by the $1.9 million net reduction in quarterly interest income associated with a previously-terminated interest rate swap (income ended on October 6, 2025). Additionally, interest income declined due to lower loan balances and lower market rates, which primarily impacted the interest rates on variable-rate loans and new originations of fixed-rate loans. Mostly offsetting the decrease in interest income was reduced interest expense, due to the strategic management of maturing/repricing brokered deposits and interest-bearing demand deposits. Also, there was no interest expense on subordinated notes in the quarter ended December 31, 2025, as those notes were redeemed in June 2025. Correspondingly, annualized net interest margin was 3.70% in the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to 3.49% in the same period of 2024 and 3.72% in the third quarter of 2025. The average interest rate spread was 3.16% for the three months ended December 31, 2025, compared to 2.87% for the three months ended December 31, 2024 and 3.13% for the three months ended September 30, 2025. Net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2025 decreased $1.6 million (3.2%) compared to $50.8 million for the third quarter of 2025, primarily due to the impact of the end of income recognition on the previously-terminated interest rate swap.

The average yield on total interest-earning assets decreased from 5.83% in the 2024 fourth quarter to 5.53% in the 2025 fourth quarter, with the average yield on loans decreasing 34 basis points, the average yield on investment securities increasing 12 basis points and the average yield on other interest earning assets (primarily funds held at the Federal Reserve Bank) decreasing 91 basis points. The average rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities decreased from 2.96% in the 2024 fourth quarter to 2.37% in the 2025 fourth quarter, with the average rate paid on interest-bearing demand and savings deposits, time deposits and brokered deposits decreasing 26 basis points, 50 basis points and 76 basis points, respectively. The average rate paid on short-term borrowings decreased 70 basis points.

Market interest rates, primarily the federal funds rate and SOFR rates, declined in the fourth quarter of 2024, and remained lower through the fourth quarter of 2025, with additional federal funds rate cuts in September, October, and December of 2025, totaling 75 basis points. This market rate decline reduced the average yield on loans, though the impact was tempered as cash flows from lower-rate fixed rate loans originated a few years ago were deployed into residential and commercial real estate loans with comparably higher rates of interest. The decline in market interest rates also resulted in lower average rates paid on deposits and borrowings, compared to the prior-year fourth quarter.

To mitigate exposure to the risk of fluctuations in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates (primarily related to falling interest rates), the Company has strategically utilized derivative financial instruments - primarily interest rate swaps - as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.

The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the effect of cash flow hedge accounting included in interest income in the consolidated statements of income:

Three Months Ended December 31,

December 31,

September 30, 2025 2024 2025

(In thousands) Terminated interest rate swaps $ 134 $ 2,047 $ 2,047 Active interest rate swaps (1,364 ) (2,172 ) (1,761 ) Increase (decrease) to interest income $ (1,230 ) $ (125 ) $ 286

The Company entered into an interest rate swap in October 2018, which was terminated in March 2020. Upon termination, the Company received $45.9 million, inclusive of accrued but unpaid interest, from its swap counterparty. The net amount, after deducting accrued interest and deferred income taxes, was accreted to interest income on loans monthly until the originally scheduled termination date of October 6, 2025. With this date having passed, the Company no longer has the benefit of that income from the terminated swap. At December 31, 2025, the Company had two active interest rate swaps with a combined notional amount of $400 million. These swaps resulted in a reduction of interest income of $1.4 million and $2.2 million in the three months ended December 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Market rates for time deposits for much of 2024 were elevated, but have declined as the FOMC cut the federal funds rate by 100 basis points in late 2024, 25 basis points in the third quarter of 2025 and 50 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2025. As of December 31, 2025, time deposit maturities over the next 12 months were as follows: within three months — $591.3 million, with a weighted-average rate of 3.53%; within three to six months — $262.9 million, with a weighted-average rate of 3.13%; and within six to twelve months — $38.7 million, with a weighted-average rate of 1.87%. Based on time deposit market rates in December 2025, replacement rates for these maturing time deposits are likely to be approximately 2.70-3.10%, depending on term.

NON-INTEREST INCOME

For the quarter ended December 31, 2025, non-interest income increased $254,000, to $7.2 million, when compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2024, primarily as a result of the following item:

Late charges and fees on loans : Late charges and fees on loans increased $289,000, or 218.9%, from the prior-year quarter. This increase was primarily due to prepayment fees on one large commercial real estate loan, which paid off in the 2025 fourth quarter.

Additionally, Other Income, which decreased by $67,000, includes $259,000 in contra-income associated with leased facility asset disposals, mentioned in the ‘Significant Expense Item’ section above.

NON-INTEREST EXPENSE

For the quarter ended December 31, 2025, non-interest expense decreased $947,000, to $36.0 million, when compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2024, primarily as a result of the following items:

Other operating expenses : Other operating expenses decreased $2.0 million, or 49.0%, from the prior-year quarter. In the 2024 period, the Company expensed $2.0 million due to developments related to a litigation/contract dispute matter.

Net occupancy and equipment expenses : Net occupancy and equipment expenses increased $1.2 million, or 13.9%, from the prior-year quarter. Various components of computer license and support expenses, related to upgrades of core systems capabilities and disaster recovery site, collectively increased by $593,000 in the fourth quarter of 2025 compared to the fourth quarter of 2024. During the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company recorded expenses totaling $287,000 related to adjustments to asset values for branch closures and certain leased facilities. Also, during the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company recorded a total of $219,000 of seasonal expenses for snow removal and adjustments to real estate taxes.

The Company’s efficiency ratio for the quarter ended December 31, 2025, was 63.89% compared to 65.43% for the same quarter in 2024. The Company’s ratio of non-interest expense to average assets was 2.56% for the three months ended December 31, 2025, compared to 2.46% for the three months ended December 31, 2024. Average assets for the three months ended December 31, 2025, decreased $381.1 million, or 6.4%, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to the decline in the average balance of net loans.

INCOME TAXES

For the three months ended December 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company's effective tax rate was 16.4% and 16.9%, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company's effective tax rate was 18.7% and 18.1%, respectively. These effective rates were below the statutory federal tax rate of 21.0%, due primarily to the utilization of certain investment tax credits and the Company’s tax-exempt investments and tax-exempt loans, which reduced the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company’s effective tax rate may fluctuate in future periods as it is impacted by the level and timing of the Company’s utilization of tax credits, the level of tax-exempt investments and loans, the amount of taxable income in various state jurisdictions and the overall level of pre-tax income. State tax expense estimates continually evolve as taxable income and apportionment between states are analyzed. The Company currently expects its effective tax rate (combined federal and state) will be approximately 18.5% to 19.5% in future periods.

CAPITAL

December 31, December 31, September 30, 2025 2024 2025 Consolidated Regulatory Capital Ratios (Preliminary) Tier 1 Leverage Ratio 12.2 % 11.2 % 11.9 % Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio 13.6 % 12.3 % 13.3 % Tier 1 Capital Ratio 14.1 % 12.8 % 13.8 % Total Capital Ratio 15.3 % 15.4 % 15.1 % Tangible Common Equity Ratio 11.2 % 9.9 % 10.9 %

As of December 31, 2025, total stockholders’ equity was $636.1 million, representing 11.4% of total assets and a book value of $57.50 per common share. This compares to total stockholders’ equity of $599.6 million, or 10.0% of total assets, and a book value of $51.14 per common share at December 31, 2024. The $36.6 million increase in stockholders’ equity from December 31, 2024, was primarily driven by $71.0 million in net income, a decrease in unrealized losses on investments and interest rate swaps, and a $6.7 million increase from stock option exercises, partially offset by $18.8 million in cash dividends declared on the Company’s common stock and $44.5 million in common stock repurchases. The decreased unrealized losses on the Company’s available-for-sale investment securities and interest rate swaps, which totaled $32.2 million and $54.4 million (net of taxes) at December 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, increased stockholders’ equity by $22.2 million during 2025. These net unrealized losses primarily resulted from increased intermediate-term market interest rates in prior periods, which generally decreased the fair value of the investment securities and interest rate swaps. In 2025, these market interest rates decreased, resulting in increases in the fair value of the Company’s investment securities and interest rate swaps.

The Company had unrealized losses on its portfolio of held-to-maturity investment securities, which totaled $16.6 million and $24.7 million at December 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, that were not included in its total capital balance. If held-to-maturity unrealized losses were included in capital (net of taxes) at December 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, they would have decreased total stockholder’s equity at those dates by $12.5 million and $18.6 million, respectively. These amounts were equal to 2.0% of total stockholders’ equity of $636.1 million at December 31, 2025, compared to 3.1% of total stockholders’ equity of $599.6 million at December 31, 2024.

In April 2025, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the purchase, from time to time, of up to one million additional shares of the Company’s common stock. As of December 31, 2025, approximately 687,000 shares remained available under this stock repurchase authorization.

During the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company repurchased 241,301 shares of its common stock at an average price of $59.33, and the Company’s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.43 per common share, which, combined, reduced stockholders’ equity by $19.2 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2025, the Company repurchased 755,759 shares of its common stock at an average price of $58.35, and the Company’s Board of Directors declared regular quarterly cash dividends totaling $1.66 per common share, which, combined, reduced stockholders’ equity by $63.3 million.

LIQUIDITY AND DEPOSITS

Liquidity is a measure of the Company’s ability to generate sufficient cash to meet present and future financial obligations in a timely manner. The Company’s primary sources of funds are customer deposits, FHLBank advances, other borrowings, loan repayments, unpledged securities, proceeds from sales of loans and available-for-sale securities and funds provided from operations. The Company utilizes some or all of these sources of funds depending on the comparative costs and availability at the time. The Company has from time to time chosen not to pay rates on deposits as high as the rates paid by certain of its competitors and, at management’s discretion, supplements deposits with alternative sources of funds. Management believes that the Company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors’ requirements and meet its borrowers’ credit needs.

At December 31, 2025, the Company had the following available secured lines and on-balance sheet liquidity:

December 31, 2025 Federal Home Loan Bank line $1,320.6 million Federal Reserve Bank line 305.2 million Cash and cash equivalents 189.6 million Unpledged securities – Available-for-sale 338.5 million Unpledged securities – Held-to-maturity 24.4 million

During the year ended December 31, 2025, the Company’s total deposits decreased $122.8 million. Interest-bearing checking balances increased $74.7 million (3.4%), primarily in certain money market accounts, and non-interest-bearing checking balances decreased $1.4 million (0.2%). Time deposits generated through the Company’s banking center and corporate services networks decreased $87.3 million (11.3%). Brokered deposits, obtained through a variety of sources, decreased $108.7 million (14.1%). During the three months ended December 31, 2025, the Company’s total deposits decreased $45.3 million, $16.6 million of which was in brokered deposits and $35.2 million of which was in retail time deposits. As total assets (primarily loans receivable) decreased, the Company elected not to replace some of its maturing brokered deposits.

At December 31, 2025, the Company had the following deposit balances:

December 31, 2025 Interest-bearing checking $2,289.4 million Non-interest-bearing checking 841.5 million Time deposits 688.4 million Brokered deposits 663.4 million

At December 31, 2025, the Company estimated that its uninsured deposits, excluding deposit accounts of the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries, were approximately $720.1 million (16.1% of total deposits).

LOANS

Total net loans, excluding mortgage loans held for sale, decreased $333.5 million, or 7.1%, from $4.69 billion at December 31, 2024 to $4.36 billion at December 31, 2025. This decrease was primarily driven by decreases in other residential (multi-family) loans of $161.8 million, construction loans of $96.5 million, one- to four-family residential loans of $51.3 million and commercial business loans of $41.8 million. Compared to September 30, 2025, net loans decreased $110.8 million.

The pipeline of the unfunded portion of loans and formal loan commitments remained strong, with the largest portion of these unfunded balances represented by the unfunded portion of outstanding construction loans ($605.5 million at December 31, 2025). See the table below.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

During the three months ended December 31, 2025 and 2024, the Company did not record a provision expense on its portfolio of outstanding loans. During the year ended December 31, 2025, the Company did not record a provision expense on its portfolio of outstanding loans, compared to a provision expense of $1.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2024. Total net recoveries were $22,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2025, compared to total net charge-offs of $155,000 during the same period in the prior year. Total net recoveries were $11,000 for the year ended December 31, 2025, compared to total net charge-offs of $1.6 million during the prior year. Additionally, for the quarter ended December 31, 2025, the Company recorded a provision for losses on unfunded commitments of $882,000, compared to a provision for losses on unfunded commitments of $1.6 million for the same period in 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2025, the Company recorded a provision for losses on unfunded commitments of $45,000, compared to a provision for losses on unfunded commitments of $1.0 million in 2024.

The Bank’s allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.46%, 1.36% and 1.43% at December 31, 2025, December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025, respectively. Management considers the allowance for credit losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the Bank’s loan portfolio at December 31, 2025, based on recent reviews of the portfolio and current economic conditions. However, if challenging economic conditions persist or worsen, or if management’s assessment of the loan portfolio changes, additional provisions for credit losses may be required, which could adversely impact the Company’s future financial performance.

ASSET QUALITY

At December 31, 2025, non-performing assets were $8.1 million, a decrease of $1.5 million from $9.6 million at December 31, 2024 and an increase of $319,000 from $7.8 million at September 30, 2025. Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets were 0.15% at December 31, 2025, compared to 0.16% at December 31, 2024 and 0.14% at September 30, 2025.

Average Balances, Interest Rates and Yields

The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the total dollar amounts of interest income from average interest-earning assets and the resulting yields, as well as the interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, expressed both in dollars and rates, and the net interest margin. Average balances of loans receivable include the average balances of nonaccrual loans for each period. Interest income on loans includes interest received on nonaccrual loans on a cash basis. Interest income on loans also includes the amortization of net loan fees, which were deferred in accordance with accounting standards. Net fees included in interest income were $1.0 million and $1.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Net fees included in interest income were $4.1 million and $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Tax-exempt income was not calculated on a tax equivalent basis. The table does not reflect any effect of income taxes.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

This document contains certain financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), specifically, the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets.

In calculating the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets, we subtract period-end intangible assets from common equity and from total assets. Management believes that the presentation of this measure excluding the impact of intangible assets provides useful supplemental information that is helpful in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, as it provides a method to assess management’s success in utilizing our tangible capital as well as our capital strength. Management also believes that providing a measure that excludes balances of intangible assets, which are subjective components of valuation, facilitates the comparison of our performance with the performance of our peers. In addition, management believes that this is a standard financial measure used in the banking industry to evaluate performance.

This non-GAAP financial measurement is supplemental and is not a substitute for any analysis based on GAAP financial measures. Because not all companies use the same calculation of non-GAAP measures, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures as calculated by other companies.

The bill in question, released Tuesday, would fund the departments of Homeland Security, Defense, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, Labor, Education and other related agencies.

It seeks to claw back $879 million that passed as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021 as part of an effort to fund a nationwide EV charging network. The law originally included billions in funding for the network.

An emerging point of contention in the new legislation, meanwhile, is more about what’s not in the bill, as opposed to what is.

Some lawmakers, including Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) are pushing for the inclusion of a provision that would include sales of high-ethanol gasoline year-round.

A spokesperson for Bacon confirmed Punchbowl’s reporting that he brought up sales of high-ethanol gas at a Republican conference meeting on Wednesday morning but is not planning to vote down the bill over the issue.

“I’ve heard from our NE farmers and this is their #1 priority,” Bacon wrote in a post on the social platform X.

Bipartisan lawmakers from the Midwest have pushed for sales of E15 gas, named for its 15 percent ethanol content, year-round. This type of gasoline has historically been restricted in the summer because of concerns about smog — which can form more easily from evaporation in the heat.

Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, told The Hill in an email there is a “full-fledged push to get year-round E15 in the final package.”

He said “several” Midwestern lawmakers are “drawing a line in the sand on this issue because it is vitally important to jobs and economic vitality in their districts and states.” He did not specify which lawmakers are doing so.

“This should not be controversial — E15 is a more affordable, American-made, cleaner-burning fuel that boosts the farm economy,” Cooper said.

Meanwhile, lawmakers are also seeking to rein in the administration’s cuts to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

A joint explanatory statement accompanying the funding bill calls for restoring positions eliminated over the past year and retaining staffing levels needed for the agency to complete its statutory missions, including Cadre of On-Call Response/Recovery (CORE) staffers.

The statement comes amid reports that the administration is considering eliminating half of its staff and that it is not renewing some CORE staffers’ positions.

It also calls for FEMA to not be eliminated or reorganized.",https://www.wtaj.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2026/01/electric_vehicle_california_05222025_AP25142840017091-1.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-21 19:00:56.811717

“I’ve heard from our NE farmers and this is their #1 priority,” Bacon wrote in a post on the social platform X.

Bipartisan lawmakers from the Midwest have pushed for sales of E15 gas, named for its 15 percent ethanol content, year-round. This type of gasoline has historically been restricted in the summer because of concerns about smog — which can form more easily from evaporation in the heat.

Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, told The Hill in an email there is a “full-fledged push to get year-round E15 in the final package.”

He said “several” Midwestern lawmakers are “drawing a line in the sand on this issue because it is vitally important to jobs and economic vitality in their districts and states.” He did not specify which lawmakers are doing so.

“This should not be controversial — E15 is a more affordable, American-made, cleaner-burning fuel that boosts the farm economy,” Cooper said.

Meanwhile, lawmakers are also seeking to rein in the administration’s cuts to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

A joint explanatory statement accompanying the funding bill calls for restoring positions eliminated over the past year and retaining staffing levels needed for the agency to complete its statutory missions, including Cadre of On-Call Response/Recovery (CORE) staffers.

The statement comes amid reports that the administration is considering eliminating half of its staff and that it is not renewing some CORE staffers’ positions.

It also calls for FEMA to not be eliminated or reorganized.",https://myfox8.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2026/01/electric_vehicle_california_05222025_AP25142840017091-1.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-21 18:01:00.297927

One EPA official awarded grant funding to his former employer.","JEFFERSON CITY, Mo — Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway joined a coalition of 24 state attorneys general in challenging potential Biden-era grant fraud and supporting the EPA’s cancellation of billions of questionable grants. Biden’s Environmental Protection Agency handed out $20 billion in grants as part of its “Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund,” a program that had little to no oversight and awarded political allies huge sums of money.

“I’m proud to stand with other attorneys general to fight back against potential Biden-era fraud and violations of ethical standards. We will continue to step in to protect Missourians against unconstitutional government overreach,” said Attorney General Hanaway. “Our Office supports the EPA’s move to cancel these grants, reinforcing accountability and integrity in federal spending.”

The Trump administration’s EPA tried to cancel the grants due to new oversight findings, but was blocked by a district court. The coalition of 24 state attorneys general filed an amicus brief supporting the Trump administration’s move.

The states argue that the EPA has both the right and the duty to cancel these grants after mismanagement was discovered. However, the program’s structure limits the EPA’s ability to oversee or terminate grants. The states propose this structure was intentionally designed to evade oversight and accountability.

Grants should be awarded competitively, and these grants allegedly went to political allies. One EPA official awarded grant funding to his former employer. Another recipient had only $100 in assets the year before being awarded $2 billion.

The states write in the brief, “When federal grant programs operate without meaningful oversight—as the House Oversight Committee found the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund did—States bear the consequences of projects that may be poorly conceived, executed, or managed. Taxpayers in amici States deserve to know that federal climate spending is subject to proper oversight and accountability, not rushed out the door as ‘gold bars off the Titanic.’”

The states are asking the en banc United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to vacate the district court’s preliminary injunction order. A panel of the D.C. Circuit earlier sided with the Trump administration and vacated the order.

On Tuesday, the city council gave preliminary approval to rent the unused building at 649 S. River St. to the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act Workforce Development Hub run by the College of DuPage.

“This 100% is the right kind of space,” Callie Matheny, the hub’s director, told the council.

CEJA was designed to help Illinois transition to using 100% “clean” energy by 2050.

COD’s program is 180 hours of entry-level bridge training. Students earn basic first aid and CPR, OSHA-10 job-site safety, and National Center for Construction Education and Research Core Construction certificates.

Then they can advance to job-specific training in solar energy, energy auditing, heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration, and weatherization. Those courses take place at the college’s campus.

The hub has been offering the bridge training at Waubonsee Community College’s downtown Aurora campus, but it needs more room, and a space appropriate for working with power tools.

The hub started training students about a year ago, Matheny said.

The 548 Foundation will also use the building. It provides programs to certify students as solar voltaic system installers. Its students will earn credentials from the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners, an OSHA 30-hour construction certification, and basic construction skill certification.

The city will charge the 548 Foundation and COD $5,000 a month.

The Aurora hub is one of 13 throughout the state. A 14th will soon start in Kankakee, Matheny said.

The hubs are located in equity investment-eligible communities.

Experts say the shift to private equity ownership will only exacerbate the power imbalance between power companies and public utilities commissions.
“Prior to the acquisition,” Robinson says, “the vast majority of stock ownership in Minnesota Power was outside of Duluth, outside of Minnesota.
On the other hand, investor-owned power companies are disincentivized to promote energy efficiency and self-reliance, as it reduces their profits.
Farrell says that individual consumers concerned about rising electricity costs can guard against predatory utility companies by becoming energy self-sufficient through solar energy.","Power companies have long had a reputation for being stable, if unsexy, investments. They’re typically granted exclusive operating rights in their service districts and have a tried-and-true playbook for skirting accountability from the state-level public utilities commissions tasked with regulating them. While today this status quo allows utility investors to reap billions in profits annually on the backs of ratepayers, it brought stable electricity to the vast majority of American households for relatively affordable prices throughout the twentieth century.

But in Northeast Minnesota, this hundred-year-old arrangement came to an end in October 2025, when the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission voted to hand the reins of Minnesota Power, an electric company serving about 150,000 customers, over to private equity investors—despite warnings from consumer advocacy groups, environmental organizations, and an administrative law judge. These groups expressed concerns about the potential for large rate hikes down the line, a decline in service quality due to cost cutting measures, and the possibility of investors saddling the utility company with debt before making an untimely exit.

On December 15, Allete, Minnesota Power’s parent company, announced that the acquisition was complete, with 60 percent going to a BlackRock subsidiary called Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), and the remaining 40 percent going to the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, a government-owned pension fund, marking a turning point in the history of American energy.

The majority of American power companies, including Minnesota Power prior to its acquisition, are investor-owned and typically operate as regulated monopolies, meaning they are the sole provider within a specific region, unencumbered by competition. Each state’s investor-owned utility companies are regulated by a public utilities commission—a state-level government agency, whose members are either elected or appointed by the governor or legislature, tasked with protecting consumers from blackouts and unnecessary rate hikes. But as a recent report from the Harvard Electricity Law Initiative indicates, investor-owned utilities use a number of strategies to convince or even trick state regulators into approving unnecessary rate hikes and subsidizing expensive industrial infrastructure projects. Experts say the shift to private equity ownership will only exacerbate the power imbalance between power companies and public utilities commissions.

To understand private equity’s sudden interest in Minnesota Power, just look seven miles west of the company’s Duluth headquarters to Hermantown, Minnesota, where an unnamed Fortune 50 tech company is reportedly planning to build a 1.8 million-square-foot data center campus directly adjacent to a Minnesota Power substation. Large hyperscale data centers like the one proposed in this area can easily consume 7.2 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per month—nearly 500 times as much as the average Minnesota resident consumes in an entire year.

Given private equity’s recent interest in data centers and artificial intelligence (AI), it’s perhaps unsurprising that these firms would widen their focus to encompass power companies as well. As Alissa Jean Schafer, climate and energy director at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, told the American Prospect about the Allete buyout, “We see BlackRock positioning itself very aggressively to take advantage of the entire supply chain when it comes to AI and data centers, and power generation is a really key part of that.”

Duluth local Buddy Robinson, who spent his career advocating for Minnesota Power customers with the Minnesota Citizens Federation and now sits on the board of a consumer advocacy nonprofit called the Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota, tells The Progressive he believes Minnesota Power had a clear interest in making up for future revenue loss in its industrial sector. The taconite mines in Minnesota Power’s service district have long made up a significant portion of its retail energy usage, but the industry is on a downward trajectory, with two mines pausing operations in the last year. Between 2024 and 2025, taconite customers went from 35 percent of Allete’s total energy sales to 28 percent.

With no indication that this trend will reverse, Robinson says, “The extremely logical thing in Minnesota Power’s interest is to find some other industrial source that could use a huge amount of electricity and basically compensate for the loss of these others. Bingo: a data center.” Robinson’s theory was confirmed in September 2025 by a publicly released email in which Hermantown City Administrator John Mulder directly states Minnesota Power introduced the data center project to Hermantown City Officials, despite claims by Allete’s manager of financial planning that, “the company does not have any specific plans related to data centers.”

In response to Mulder’s email, which was sent in September 2024 and discovered through a public records request, citizens advocacy group CURE formally petitioned the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission to reassess its approval of the Allete sale. In a January 6, 2026, press release, Hudson Kingston, legal director for CURE, said, “The official record is incomplete, and the utility should account for what it hasn’t told the [public utilities commission] and the public regarding its plans” for the Hermantown data center.

Robinson says he suspects Minnesota Power colluded with GIP/BlackRock to secure the data center proposal in Hermantown. “There is great competition for data centers around the country and not as many will get built as everyone hopes will,” he says. “If [Minnesota Power] made a deal with [GIP], ‘Hey you buy us out and promise that you will get us a data center,’ then the problem’s solved for their long term future.” While GIP’s involvement in the Hermantown data center remains unconfirmed, CURE’s petition hints at possible conflicts of interest, noting that, in the time since the October 3 vote, GIP/BlackRock has announced several billion-dollar investments in data center projects around the world, on top of their large previous investments.

For Allete’s board of directors, the last year has been a massive success: Board members received a multimillion-dollar windfall from the sale and, by bringing a data center to Hermantown, secured the company’s financial future. (Allete has not responded to a request for comment.) And for GIP and the Canadian Pension Plan, the proposed data center—which would necessitate new infrastructure projects to fuel it—all but guarantees returns on investment.

In the terms of the sale, the two firms made a few concessions to consumers, including a one-year freeze on base electricity rates and $50 million in additional rate credits. But these protections are temporary and difficult to enforce. John Farrell, codirector of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance and the director of its Energy Democracy Initiative, tells The Progressive, “There were very few legally binding things that were in the settlement agreement or in the ultimate order that protect consumers over a long period of time.”

According to Robsinson, the Duluth community was left in the dark about the potential sale until it was nearly finalized. For many in the community, he says, the sale means the loss of local control over the utility. “Even though the company remains intact [with] the same management team,” he says, “the notion that the real control is now far removed . . . . That made people very concerned.”

But while Minnesota Power has a history of outreach and charitable giving in the community, it has never been under true local control. Like nearly 75 percent of electric utilities in the United States, it was an investor-owned, publicly traded for-profit company up until the recent buyout. “Prior to the acquisition,” Robinson says, “the vast majority of stock ownership in Minnesota Power was outside of Duluth, outside of Minnesota. So it’s very obvious that profits were being extracted through our rates to go outside of Duluth and outside of Minnesota.”

According to Farrell, the massive gap in resources, expertise, and information between utility companies and public utilities commissions makes it difficult for commissioners to adequately protect consumers. “Utilities have all the knowledge and information about the grid, and commissions only get it through pulling teeth,” he says. “[The commissioners] are political appointees, and they don’t know a whole lot. And I’m not saying they don’t try very hard. But . . . this is basically a job that nobody does well.”

The transition from investor ownership to private equity ownership, Farrell believes, is a turn from bad to worse. “This is a continuation of the privatization of a public good, and with less public scrutiny, because it’ll be harder to get information out,” he says. Like all publicly traded companies, investor-owned utilities are legally obligated to publish their finances, operations, and liabilities, while private firms are exempt from even the most basic disclosure requirements. “Once it’s private, it will just become more difficult to effectively regulate,” Farrell says.

What’s more, Farrell is skeptical of the idea that a clean energy transition can be made compatible with the rapid proliferation of data centers. On one hand, he points to home electrification nonprofit Rewiring America’s argument that, if hyperscale data center companies were to pay for household energy efficiency upgrades on a mass scale, the reduced residential energy consumption would sufficiently offset the electricity needed by those data centers, reducing strain on the power grid and keeping electric rates stable or lower for residential consumers. On the other hand, investor-owned power companies are disincentivized to promote energy efficiency and self-reliance, as it reduces their profits. “Our whole system is designed to be top-down and not to even consider it,” he says. “And the people who have the most power in the system also have no financial incentive to pursue it.”

In February 2023, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz signed a bill requiring public utilities to supply 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2040. While the state was previously on track to meet its goals, the explosion in data center proposals and projects has threatened to stall its progress. Pete Wyckoff, a deputy commissioner at the Minnesota Department of Commerce, told utility regulators in October 2024, “My analysts are skeptical about rapidly delivering power of any sort, much less clean power, in the size and time frames that the data centers are likely to request.” Minnesota Power justified the buyout, in part, by arguing the company needed private equity’s access to capital in order to build the clean energy infrastructure needed to meet the state’s goals. However, the company had previously told shareholders it was poised to meet its capital needs through the public market. Further, the two firms made no binding commitments to fund clean energy projects.

BlackRock’s acquisition of Allete appears to be just the beginning of private equity’s increased interest in utility companies: Blackstone, the largest private equity firm in the world, is now vying to acquire TXNM Energy, which serves customers across Texas and New Mexico, for $11.5 billion. Just like BlackRock’s acquisition of Allete, Blackstone’s proposal coincides with plans to build an enormous new data center campus in the Texas and New Mexico service district.

Private equity firms aim for a higher rate of return than public market investors, and often unload their investments after just a few years, meaning they often take extreme cost cutting measures with little regard for the longevity of the company. In the case of Allete, the two firms overpaid for their shares by upwards of $1.5 billion, and must recoup this cost before they can begin turning a profit for stakeholders.

Robinson says he hopes that private equity’s negative reputation will galvanize Duluth residents and city leaders to be more skeptical of proposed infrastructure projects and rate hikes, but only time will tell how successfully they can hold the world’s largest asset manager accountable.

Farrell says that individual consumers concerned about rising electricity costs can guard against predatory utility companies by becoming energy self-sufficient through solar energy. “If [you] have the wherewithal to buy solar panels, now might be a good time,” Farrell says. “If you’re worried about your rates being jacked up a lot over time, making an investment now in solar is going to last twenty-five or thirty years.”

But there’s a limit to what individuals can accomplish in the face of an all-powerful monopoly. “You cannot, as an individual, boycott or a protest or petition in a way that is likely to make a meaningful difference,” he says. “You can do something on your own property to reduce your exposure, and then you can organize.”",https://progressive.org/downloads/22472/download/MinnesotaPower.jpg?cb=127def75c5fa54dec77fe89c49c8e047&w=1200,N,,2026-01-21 18:00:42.594999

Republicans’ attempt to gut Clean Air Act protections will eliminate over half a century of economic and public health progress.
The assault on Americans' health continues with those bills, as they only increase pollution that affects people's health.","Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone, Jr. (D-NJ) delivered the following opening remarks at today's Full Committee markup of 11 bills, including from the Environment and Communications and Technology subcommittees:

Today the Committee is considering 11 bills – some of them out of our Communications and Technology Subcommittee will be bipartisan, while bills out of our Environment Subcommittee will be partisan as Republicans continue to assault Americans' health care.

We will begin by considering seven Republican bills that strike at the heart of the Clean Air Act and make Americans sicker, solely to increase corporate polluter profits. Four of the bills we are considering today will undermine the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, or NAAQS – a suite of health-based standards that let us know what level of pollution is safe to breathe. These bills would turn the NAAQS from standards that protect public health to ones that protect special interests.

Republicans are also taking aim at the New Source Review Program. H.R. 161 would simultaneously allow polluters to cook the books on how they measure cancer-causing emissions and remove the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to review the public health and environmental impacts of major projects.

If that wasn’t enough, H.R. 6373 gives the President the ability to waive Clean Air Act permit requirements for his pet projects and creates a pay-to-pollute scheme that lets large industrial sources of pollution off the hook for the harm they cause by simply paying their way into compliance.

Looking at this slate of bills, it appears my Republican colleagues have forgotten that air pollution is dangerous and poses significant health risks, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and over 100,000 premature deaths every year. They also ignore the fact that the Clean Air Act is one of the most successful public health laws in history. It has dramatically cut air pollution since 1970, while the U.S. Gross Domestic Product has nearly quadrupled in that time. Republicans’ attempt to gut Clean Air Act protections will eliminate over half a century of economic and public health progress.

To add insult to injury, Republicans continue to ignore the affordability crisis. American families are struggling to afford their groceries, their utility bills, and their health insurance premiums. Instead of working to address this crisis, Republicans are advancing harmful bills that fundamentally undermine EPA’s ability to protect human health and the environment.

Once again, Republicans are focused on their corporate interest friends, not hardworking everyday Americans. These bills push policies that benefit their billionaire buddies and sell out Americans’ health for industry profit. Republican inaction has already sent health care premiums skyrocketing for millions of Americans, and now they want to make people even sicker as they struggle to afford care.

That’s why I continue to oppose these bills, and I strongly urge my colleagues to do the same.

We will also consider several bills out of the Communications and Technology Subcommittee. The Emergency Reporting Act, from Subcommittee Ranking Member Matsui and Representative Bilirakis, will improve processes at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to assess communications failures caused by natural disasters like hurricanes and wildfires. This effort is a critical step to ensure that policymakers and regulators are equipped with detailed information to identify trends and inform efforts to address points of vulnerability in preparation for future disasters.

We will also consider the Kari’s Law Reporting Act that builds upon a 2018 law. Kari’s Law requires providers of multi-line telephone systems, which serve entities like office buildings and hotels, to reconfigure their systems to enable callers to simply dial 9-1-1 without a prefix to reach emergency assistance. Unfortunately, providers have yet to fully comply with Kari’s Law, so this bill provides Congress and the FCC with the tools necessary to track down delinquent providers and ensure they comply with the law.

I appreciate the bipartisan cooperation that went into bringing these bills up, but again, I express my deep disappointment in the bills out of our Environment Subcommittee. The assault on Americans' health continues with those bills, as they only increase pollution that affects people's health.

Christian Smith,,,,,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2026/01/21/aurora-looking-to-create-hub-for-clean-energy-job-training/,"Both organizations are funded by the state to run clean energy-related job training programs, but those programs do not yet have a permanent location in Aurora.
“We’re excited to say we found an important alliance in the city of Aurora,” said the College of DuPage’s director of the Aurora CEJA Aurora Workforce Hub, Callie Matheny, at a launch event on Tuesday.
If the Aurora City Council approves the leases at its meeting next Tuesday, they will go into effect on Feb. 1.
In a press release, city officials said the Aurora CEJA Workforce Development Hub will act as a magnet for living-wage job creation and innovative green job training.
Aurora is also actively looking for additional partners to further expand the CEJA Workforce Development Hub, the city’s press release about the launch event said.","The city of Aurora has announced it will be launching a new center that will offer job training in green energy-related fields through a partnership with two educational organizations.

Aurora’s CEJA Workforce Development Hub, set to be located in a currently unused city facility at 649 S. River St., will bring together the existing workforce development programs of the College of DuPage and the 548 Foundation. Both organizations are funded by the state to run clean energy-related job training programs, but those programs do not yet have a permanent location in Aurora.

“We’re excited to say we found an important alliance in the city of Aurora,” said the College of DuPage’s director of the Aurora CEJA Aurora Workforce Hub, Callie Matheny, at a launch event on Tuesday. “This is city government at work. They have been an extreme, fast-moving partner.”

The programs offered by the two organizations get their funding through the state Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, which also gives the Aurora center its name. The act was signed into law in 2021 and specifically notes Aurora as one of the 13 statewide locations to have such a job-training hub.

Mavis Bates — who is a Kane County Board member, chair of the local chapter of the Sierra Club and on the city’s Sustainable Aurora Advisory Board — called the newly-announced physical location of the Aurora CEJA Workforce Development Hub a “big fancy deal” when she spoke at Tuesday’s launch event.

“I was so excited five years ago when I saw that Aurora’s name was on the list,” she said during her speech. “At that time, I did not realize it was going to be five years before this day would finally happen.”

And although the city did host a “launch” event, Mayor John Laesch in his own speech was quick to point out that the day Mavis spoke about still hasn’t come yet. The leases for the College of DuPage and the 548 Foundation to rent out the building, formerly used by the city’s water and sewer division, have yet to pass the Aurora City Council.

If the Aurora City Council approves the leases at its meeting next Tuesday, they will go into effect on Feb. 1.

In a press release, city officials said the Aurora CEJA Workforce Development Hub will act as a magnet for living-wage job creation and innovative green job training.

Alison Lindburg, Aurora’s director of sustainability, noted in a speech at Tuesday’s launch event that her division is within the city’s economic development department in part because sustainability offers an opportunity for job creation. In Illinois, there’s over 132,000 people working jobs related to clean energy, which is more than the number of lawyers, web developers and real estate agents combined, she said.

Those jobs might include the installation of efficient lighting, connecting heat pumps and other efficient HVAC systems, completing energy audits of homes and commercial buildings, installing electric vehicle charging stations, solar panels and battery storage, and helping to modernize the energy grid, according to Lindburg.

The building set to hold the hub is planned to one day contain both classroom and work space. The classroom is set to be a “living laboratory,” Lindburg said, with its own HVAC system for students to work on and empty spaces in the walls for students to install insulation in.

“We’re lucky to have found a space that can provide for both classroom and workshop in one concise location,” Matheny said. “On a program management level, we’re super excited to have staff, students and all of our stuff in one place. It’s going to be a game changer.”

From the new physical hub in Aurora, the College of DuPage is set to run its seven-week entry-level CEJA Bridge Program, which earns students various certificates related to construction and first aid, Matheny told the Aurora City Council’s Committee of the Whole on Tuesday. After completing that training, students can then choose to go on to more advanced, job-specific training in solar installation, energy auditing and HVAC work, she said.

In total, the college has the capacity to run about six of these programs each year, according to Matheny. More information can be found at: www.cod.edu/academics/continuing-education/career-professional-training/climate-equitable-jobs.html

The planned Aurora hub is also planned to hold a training program from the 548 Foundation, which sets graduates up to become first-year apprentices in the Mid-America Carpenters Regional Council with training in construction and solar systems. Founder AJ Patton said at Tuesday’s launch event that his organization’s program offers $500 weekly stipends to its students to “earn while you learn,” helping to carry them through the training.

The 548 Foundation is open to partnership and doesn’t care about taking the credit, Patton said, so any who have ideas on how to create jobs or have job opportunities are encouraged to reach out. More information about the program can be found at: 548foundation.org

The College of DuPage is on the “workforce development” side of things, which means they are more specific to meeting the needs of local employers, while the 548 Foundation is more on the “climate works” side, which is more in-tune with what the unions would like to see, according to Matheny’s presentation to the Committee of the Whole on Tuesday. She said that both programs rely on Goodwill, which works to educate the community about the programs and guide interested people towards them.

Aurora is also actively looking for additional partners to further expand the CEJA Workforce Development Hub, the city’s press release about the launch event said.

Sustainability and living-wage job creating, particularly through green building, was a large part of Laesch’s campaign platform last year.

As a mayoral candidate, he told The Beacon-News that he would work to attract higher-paying jobs by “positioning Aurora for the green collar economy that’s coming,” at least in part by encouraging businesses that create innovative building materials to move to the city. Later, during his inauguration speech, Laesch spoke about partnering with the local CEJA Workforce Hub to help train students for that coming “green collar economy.”

The training is only the first step, Laesch said at Tuesday’s launch event. The next step will be creating the living wage jobs for Aurora residents, he said, and the city is working hard at finding ways to do that.

One way city officials are hoping to encourage the creation of green energy jobs is through a proposed Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy financing program, commonly called C-PACE. Through the lending program, the owners of commercial properties can borrow at a fixed, low interest rate for renovation or new construction projects related to energy efficiency and similar types of things.

The ordinance allowing the Illinois Finance Authority to manage a C-PACE program from Aurora, alongside the leases for the new CEJA Workforce Development Hub, are set to go before the Aurora City Council at its meeting on Tuesday. Those items are likely to pass since they are all on the meeting’s consent agenda, which is typically reserved for routine or non-controversial items that are all approved with a single vote.

“Each year, global emissions become increasingly concentrated among a shrinking group of high-emitting producers, while overall production continues to grow.
Much of the global carbon emissions in 2024 came from state-owned entities, which represented 16 of the top 20 emitters.
Historically, ExxonMobil and Chevron rank in the top five for fossil carbon emissions generated from 1854 through 2024, accounting for 2.79 percent and 3.08 percent of overall carbon pollution, respectively.
Nearly two-thirds of the 32 entities responsible for over half of CO2 emissions in 2024 saw their emissions increase compared to 2023.","As fossil fuel-based carbon dioxide emissions continue to rise to record levels, a new analysis shows that a majority of these emissions can be traced back to a shrinking number of large corporate entities.

Just 32 companies accounted for over half of global fossil carbon emissions in 2024, according to a report published Wednesday by the U.K.-based think tank InfluenceMap. That is down from 36 companies responsible for half the global CO2 emissions in 2023, and 38 companies five years ago.

The analysis is the latest update to the Carbon Majors database, which tracks the world’s largest oil, gas, coal and cement producers and uses production data to calculate the carbon emissions from each entity’s production. The database, first developed by researcher Richard Heede and now hosted by InfluenceMap, quantifies current and historical emissions attributable to nearly 180 companies and provides annual updates. It is the only database of its kind tracking corporate-generated carbon emissions dating back to the start of the Industrial Revolution, research that’s being used in efforts to hold major polluters accountable for climate harms.

“Each year, global emissions become increasingly concentrated among a shrinking group of high-emitting producers, while overall production continues to grow. Simultaneously, these heavy emitters continue to use lobbying to obstruct a transition that the scientific community has known for decades is essential,” Emmett Connaire, senior analyst at InfluenceMap, said in a press statement. The findings of the new analysis, he added, “underscore the growing importance of this kind of rigorous evidence in efforts to determine accountability for climate-related losses.”

Despite dire warnings from scientists about the consequences of accelerating climate change, fossil fuel production is continuing apace. Last year, fossil fuel CO2 emissions reached a record high, topping 38 billion metric tons. In 2024 these emissions were 37.4 billion metric tons—up 0.8 percent from 2023—and traceable to 166 oil, gas, coal and cement producers, according to the report.

Much of the global carbon emissions in 2024 came from state-owned entities, which represented 16 of the top 20 emitters. The five largest emitters overall—Saudi Arabia’s Aramco, Coal India, China’s CHN Energy, National Iranian Oil Co. and Russia’s Gazprom—were all state-controlled, and accounted for 18 percent of the total fossil CO2 emissions in 2024.

ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, ConocoPhillips and BP—the top five emitting investor-owned companies—together were responsible for 5.5 percent of the total emissions in that year.

Historically, ExxonMobil and Chevron rank in the top five for fossil carbon emissions generated from 1854 through 2024, accounting for 2.79 percent and 3.08 percent of overall carbon pollution, respectively. According to the analysis, the 178 entities in the database have generated 70 percent of fossil CO2 emissions since the start of the Industrial Revolution, and just 22 entities are responsible for one-third of these emissions.

The report further indicates that many of the largest emitters are increasing their fossil fuel output, and hence their emissions, while lobbying against climate policies and blocking climate action. Nearly two-thirds of the 32 entities responsible for over half of CO2 emissions in 2024 saw their emissions increase compared to 2023.

“The latest Carbon Majors data shows once again that large emitters are on the wrong side of history. When we need to accelerate progress to the clean energy future that would give us greater energy security, affordability and freedom, these emitters continue to block our way,” Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and a chief architect of the Paris Agreement, said in a press statement. “While clean energy and electrification is already receiving nearly twice the investment of fossil fuels globally, carbon majors are clinging on to outdated, polluting products and continue to mislead the public on the urgent real-world consequences of their actions.”

In the U.S., Big Oil executives are touting the long-term demand for oil and gas. American Petroleum Institute president and CEO Mike Sommers proclaimed last week at an industry event that “the next ten years are shaping up to be the Demand Decade,” while ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods, speaking at a recent White House meeting on Venezuela, said: “We’re in a depletion business for a product that is in great demand and will be in demand for many, many, many decades to come.”

Scientists say that fossil fuels must be phased out if we are to avoid the most catastrophic outcomes. In a paper titled “The 2024 state of the climate report: Perilous times on planet Earth,” scientific experts note that “stiff resistance from those benefiting financially from the current fossil-fuel based system” is holding back progress on mitigating the climate problem. “Rapidly phasing down fossil fuel use should be a top priority,” they say.

At the COP28 U.N. climate summit in Dubai in 2023, countries agreed, at least in principle, on the need to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems. But at the most recent U.N. climate summit, COP30 in Brazil last November, petrostates and major fossil fuel-producing countries blocked a proposed roadmap for this transition, which had the backing of more than 80 countries. According to the latest Carbon Majors analysis, 17 of the top 20 carbon emitters in 2024 were controlled by countries that opposed a roadmap for phasing out fossil fuels. These countries included Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, Iran, United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Iraq, Qatar and India.

Tzeporah Berman, chair and founder of the Fossil Fuel Treaty Initiative, said the analysis reveals that “a powerful, concentrated group of fossil fuel corporations are not only dominating global emissions but are actively sabotaging climate action and weakening government ambition.”

“Their increasing output and blatant opposition to a fossil fuel phase-out, as witnessed at COP30, reveal a systemic barrier to progress,” she said in a press statement. “This is precisely why a Fossil Fuel Treaty is not merely an option, but the indispensable mechanism to hold these giants accountable, break their stranglehold on climate policy, and ensure a fast and fair global transition away from the products threatening our very existence: oil, gas, and coal.”

The first steps on negotiating a fossil fuel phaseout treaty will begin to take shape this spring. The governments of Colombia and the Netherlands announced at COP30 that they will co-host the world’s first International Conference on the Just Transition Away from Fossil Fuels, which will take place April 28 and 29 in Santa Marta, Colombia.

“This will be a broad intergovernmental, multisectoral platform complementary to the UNFCCC designed to identify legal, economic, and social pathways that are necessary to make the phasing out of fossil fuels,” Irene Vélez Torres, Colombia’s minister of environment and sustainable development, said in the announcement.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2256127814-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 17:02:38.289321

South Carolina public power utility Santee Cooper on Jan. 20 said that its personnel are making preparations for the effects anticipated winter weather may have on Santee Cooper’s electric system.

Approximately 2 million South Carolinians depend on the state-owned electric and water utility as their power source, either directly or through the state’s electric cooperatives.

As of noon Jan. 20, Santee Cooper moved to Operating Condition (OpCon) 4 alert status. This means there is a possible threat to Santee Cooper’s electric system, but effects may be limited or uncertain.

Santee Cooper is preparing for effects from a cold weather and freezing precipitation event that could enter South Carolina this weekend, Jan. 24 and 25.

At OpCon 4, the utility is primarily:

• Completing freeze protection checklists for generating station equipment.

• Preparing to have additional personnel on site at generating stations in the event of road closures, and securing additional personnel, including contractors, for transmission and distribution crews.

• Checking and fueling vehicles, including line trucks.

• Checking inventory and procuring supplies as needed, such as utility poles, electric transformers and associated equipment.

""Santee Cooper is monitoring the weather and preparing accordingly to help us be best positioned to keep the lights on for all of our customers across the state,” said Marty Watson, Senior Director, Commercial and Customer Service. “In addition, the extreme cold weather means customers may be using more electricity, which could cause their bills to increase. We encourage customers to consider ways they can save energy to help combat higher bills.""

Estimates of deployment of fabric measures, low-carbon heating technology, and energy generation and storage technology in the ‘Warm Homes Plan’ are the result of the aggregating impacts across multiple policies. We use the National Buildings Model (NBM), a housing stock model based on the English Housing Survey, supplemented by other policy-specific models. For each policy, we identify the households in scope and estimate the measures installed as a result of that intervention, taking into account interactions between policies.

While the NBM and policy-specific models go through continuous review and robust quality assurance, the results of the modelling are subject to uncertainties, real world behaviour may not match the modelled outcomes for several reasons. Therefore the actual deployment depends on final policy design and choices made by households, landlords and developers.

The following sections provide more detail on specific metrics and targets presented in the ‘Warm Homes Plan’:

Heat pump market target

Our aim is to grow the heat pump market to deliver more than 450,000 annual heat pump installations in existing and new buildings by 2030. For new build, the analysis uses estimates of the new homes to be constructed to Part L 2021 or Future Homes Standard (FHS) performance standards which use a heat pump route to compliance. In 2030 around 200,000 heat pumps are estimated to be installed in new build homes. Build rate assumptions should be taken as an indicative trajectory and do not represent an official forecast of housing supply. In existing homes, the analysis uses modelled heat pump installations supported by government policies over the current Spending Review period, with an extrapolation made to 2030 informed by historic year-on-year growth in the heat pump market. This is a UK-level ambition and assumes proportionate heat pump deployment in existing homes within the devolved administrations, equivalent to that projected under UK government policies.

Homes upgraded

The analysis presented includes estimates of homes upgraded from July 2024 – December 2030 based on Official Statistics of scheme delivery published to date and modelling of potential future policy impacts at the geographic scope of the policy. The estimate includes homes treated under:

capital funding schemes and retrofit schemes (including the Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS), the Warm Homes: Social Housing Fund (WH:SHF), the Home Upgrade Grant, the Warm Homes: Local Grant (WH:LG), Energy Company Obligation (ECO) and the Great British Insulation Scheme (GBIS) to the end of March 2026, provisional estimates of the impact of the additional low income £1.5bn capital delivery route announced at Budget 2025 from 2027/28 onwards, and HMG backed low-interest loans through the Warm Homes Fund (WHF) and other market-led domestic solar photovoltaic (PV) installations

investment from Private and Social landlords to meet the Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards (MEES) proposals, based on estimates provided in the regulatory impact assessments and adjusted for overlaps with other policies to avoid double counting; and;

estimates of the number of new build homes constructed to FHS performance standards which use a heat pump route to compliance or are built with solar panels. Build rate assumptions should be taken as an indicative trajectory and do not represent an official forecast of housing supply

The estimate of low-income households benefitting from these policies was based on the number of households in the bottom 4 income deciles (equivalised, after housing costs) modelled to receive measures. New build homes were not included in this estimate.

Solar PV installations

Estimates of future domestic solar PV installations up to and including 2030 are comprised of modelled deployment from Private Rented Sector and Social Rented Sector MEES regulatory impact assessments ; estimated new build homes built to the FHS performance standards with solar PV; the WH:SHF and the WH:LG; the continuation of market-led deployment based on domestic retrofit installs in 2024/25, and provisional estimates of the impact of the new low income £1.5bn capital delivery route from 2027/28 onwards and the Warm Homes Fund.

Estimated deployment under new schemes reflects latest analysis or published positions where applicable but is subject to final policy design. Geographic coverage varies by policy. For example, Private Rented Sector MEES applies to England and Wales; Social Rented Sector MEES and FHS to England only. The deployment estimates include assumptions around landlord choices. For example, assuming all Social Rented Sector landlords choose smart readiness (proxied for with solar PV) secondary to meeting a primary fabric performance target, under the £10k cap per home. The element of choice amongst landlords means that the degree of solar PV deployment realised may differ from that in the modelled projection.

Deployment from these schemes is additional to historic domestic solar PV deployment, sourced from DESNZ published statistics, and future market led deployment where homes take up solar PV outside of government schemes.

Heat networks

The National Zoning Model identifies buildings in England, where heat networks are expected to offer the lowest-cost solution for decarbonising heat. Using outputs from this model, we expect around 20% of UK heat supply to come from heat networks by 2050. Interim targets have been set in order to be consistent with the trajectory required to meet this level.

Targets are presented in 2025 terms, i.e. they are not adjusted for future changes in heat demand due to factors such as changes in population, temperature or energy efficiency.

Bills

Estimates of domestic bill savings are calculated through one of the following approaches:

dynamic simulation of typical housing archetypes, building on the Cost Optimal Domestic Electrification (CODE) study

NBM based estimates of example archetypes under different policies

CODE

Our estimate of a typical household being able to save up to £550 a year from adopting a package of a heat pump, solar PV and battery is based on CODE. The following assumptions have been applied:

the coefficient of performance for the heat pump is 2.8

the modelled PV installation is equivalent to 4 kW of PV panels, and the battery is equivalent to 4 kWh of storage

4 kW of PV panels represents a common installation size which can fit on most roofs, though PV installations smaller than 4 kW for terraced and semi-detached houses would result in lower estimated bill savings

with a conventional tariff the battery is run to maximise self-consumption of the generated PV

solar PV installations are not optimally laid out, with PV laid on the East and West facing roofs. It may be possible for an optimally installed PV array to generate more electricity than modelled

the model assumes that archetypes have had a basic level of energy efficiency measures applied (cavity and loft insulation of 100mm) to begin with as well as double glazing

model assumes that households adopting a heat pump no longer pay the gas standing charge. Households which continue to use gas, such as in cooking appliances, would therefore experience lower bill savings

Additional analysis has been undertaken to estimate the potential savings from adopting an illustrative time-of-use tariff and setting up the battery to charge during off-peak hours. The estimated additional bill savings from adopting a time-of-use tariff - alongside a heat pump, solar PV, and battery - is based on the following assumptions:

figures are based on average energy prices for 2024, for a household in Yorkshire (selected to reflect weather conditions representative of the country overall)

time-of-use tariff assumed to offer 8 hours of electricity at off-peak rate, 13 hours at standard rate and 3 hours at peak rate

the battery charges during off-peak hours and aims to maximise self-consumption of solar PV and avoid peak hours

Estimates on bill savings, including those from time-of-use tariffs, are presented separately. Combining or aggregating estimates on bill savings would lead to misinterpretation and therefore all figures should be considered independently.

Example archetype bill savings

Example housing archetypes have been derived from the Quarterly Energy Prices (QEP) Statistics, NBM and CODE, with projected prices for 2028 applied as set out below. The example archetype bill savings for each policy represent a specific set of installations in a specific dwelling to give an example of how a household could see bill reductions under a ‘Warm Homes Plan’ policy. This is different to the average savings expected across a policy, which will average across a larger set of homes combining smaller and larger impacts. For example, the average PRS MEES bill saving across the policy are estimated to be £210/year per household while the example archetype has bill saving of £410/year.

Gas price projections for 2028, used to estimate bill savings for the example archetypes, have been taken from the Green Book supplementary guidance. To split prices into standing charge and unit rate an illustrative future standing charge projection for gas and electricity has been estimated based on 2024 average standing charges from QEP. An implied gas unit rate was then estimated from green book gas prices using 2024 average actual consumption. To produce an electricity unit rate price series more reflective of current prices, the electricity to gas ratio from the Q1 2026 Ofgem’s default price cap was applied to estimated unit gas prices.

The following policy adjustments were then made to reflect the announcements to remove particular costs from gas and electricity prices at Budget 2025. These impacts have been calculated against baseline prices produced using 2025 values taken from Ofgem’s default price cap , using summer and winter demand weights to produce an annual average value paid by those on single rate metering arrangements. Future £/MWh prices have been adjusted to account for changes in aggregate sales, using the DESNZ Energy and Emissions Projections gas and electricity demand projections.

75% of Renewable Obligation (RO) funded by exchequer from April 2026 until March 2029. Baseline RO cost projections have been taken from Office for Budget Responsibility November 2025 Economic and fiscal outlook

Energy Company Obligation (ECO) and Great British Insulation Scheme (GBIS) levy funding ends in April 2026. Baseline ECO/GBIS costs have been assumed to remain flat in real terms until 2030

The illustrative impact of a higher performing heat pump with a Time of Use (TOU) tariff demonstrates what some households could achieve in the nearer term from switching from a gas boiler to a higher performing heat pump. This is based on average actual electricity and gas consumption for 2024 taken from QEP statistics. Prices are based on the Q1 2026 price cap, adjusted for changes announced at Budget 2025. Gas demand converted to heat-pump consumption based on 8% demand uplift, 84% boiler efficiency and 311% heat pump efficiency and assumes heat pump household no longer pays the gas standing charge. Savings from adopting a time of use tariff are consistent with a 10% reduction in the unit rate for electricity, based on a review of evidence of time of use tariffs in relation to heat pumps and adjusting for the role of other demand shifting technologies in shifting electricity to lower price periods.

Jobs supported

Estimates of jobs supported by the ‘Warm Homes Plan’ includes estimates of both direct and indirect jobs, which can be defined as:

Direct jobs: the roles involved in the deployment, installation and maintenance of technologies such as heat pumps, heat networks, energy efficiency measures and solar PV and batteries

Indirect jobs: intermediary roles in the supply chain, such as manufacturing

The 2030 estimates are for jobs supported by the Plan but do not measure net additional jobs across the sector. The 2030 figure is inflated by the assumption that a large proportion of private rented sector homes will be treated in that year, in time for the regulations. The overall job impact, from this policy, estimated at 180,000, may be more spread out, reducing the 2030 figure. Further details of how the number of for jobs supported are estimated are detailed in the ‘Clean Energy Jobs Plan Technical Annex’. This applies to both UK and regional estimates, with equivalent policy actions assumed in devolved governments.

Investment

Estimates of investment over 2024 to 2030 are calculated by aggregating estimates of gross capital expenditure for multiple policies (new build standards use net capital expenditure to avoid counting the impact of general construction costs). Estimates include both public investment through spending review settlements and private investment, for example Housing Association Co-funding.

The gross capital expenditure for each policy is calculated based on measures costs; it therefore does not include additional costs needed to administer policies. The capital expenditure is calculated based on the geographical scope of the policy, however, where devolved governments are expected to take similar actions, an appropriate scaling factor is applied to the gross capital expenditure to account for this.

The public funding committed in the ‘Warm Homes Plan’ - £15bn this Spending Review period – is the largest capital allocation to schemes improving the energy efficiency and heating of homes to date. This is based on a comparison of the £15bn committed under the ‘Warm Homes Plan’ to the following comparable historic funding commitments and outturn funding:",https://www.gov.uk/assets/frontend/govuk-opengraph-image-4196a4d6333cf92aaf720047f56cfd91b3532d7635fc21ebcf0d5897df6b5f77.png,N,,2026-01-21 17:00:56.005783

NEW ORLEANS — The transformation of the former Naval Support Activity East Bank site officially began today as project partners broke ground on a multi-phase effort to return the long-dormant federal campus to active use as a center for innovation, housing, and neighborhood-serving spaces. Led by Brian Gibbs Development, the redevelopment will reimagine the historic riverfront site as a modern, mixed-use campus that supports New Orleans’ role in the future of energy and industry while delivering tangible community benefits and long-term economic growth.

The redevelopment of the former Naval Support Activity East Bank site represents one of the most significant mixed-use investments in New Orleans in decades. The multi-phase plan will deliver affordable housing, neighborhood-serving retail, a world-class venture platform, and shared community spaces that reconnect a long-isolated riverfront campus to the surrounding neighborhood. Together, these elements are designed to strengthen connections between residents, workers, and the broader Bywater community — establishing a place that supports daily life as much as long-term economic growth.

“This groundbreaking marks an important step in putting long-idle public land back to work for New Orleans,” said New Orleans Mayor Helena Moreno. “Through partnerships like Newlab New Orleans, we’re building on Louisiana’s strengths in energy, maritime, and industrial innovation to help local talent and businesses grow, while also delivering real community benefits, including much-needed affordable housing for the Bywater community.”

A key initiative of this development is Newlab New Orleans, an innovation and technology hub designed to help startups and industry partners develop, test, and scale the critical technologies that will shape future industries in the State. Newlab New Orleans is anchored by a public-private partnership that includes Louisiana Economic Development, the City of New Orleans, Future Use of Energy in Louisiana (FUEL), Louisiana State University, Greater New Orleans, Inc., and Shell.

“Reactivating the former Naval Support Activity site reflects how Louisiana is rethinking innovation, industry, and community,” said LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois. “By embedding advanced technology development within our legacy industries, Newlab New Orleans will help new companies scale, modernize existing industries, and deliver sustained economic benefits to communities. This is Louisiana innovation — driven by purpose and anchored in partnership.”

Newlab’s platform is built around a simple but powerful premise: scaling the next generation of critical technologies will require deep public-private collaboration, purpose-built infrastructure, flexible capital, and real-world deployment opportunities. Newlab New Orleans will focus initially on advanced energy and power solutions, carbon management, industrial efficiency, and maritime innovation – sectors where Louisiana’s existing assets and workforce create a clear competitive advantage. Through structured programming with industry and government partners, the platform will help founders move from technology development and lab-scale testing to first field deployments and commercial scale.

“Today marks a defining moment in Newlab’s long-term commitment to anchor industrial innovation in the region,” said Newlab CEO David Belt. “We see in New Orleans, and the State more broadly, both the capability and the momentum required to lead — making this region and the NSA site the perfect place to build a home for scaling critical technologies.”

Newlab New Orleans is being built specifically for industrial-scale innovation. The new facility will support startups as they fabricate, assemble, and pre-commission first-of-a-kind systems, allowing technologies to be tested and proven in real-world conditions before being deployed at commercial scale. By lowering the cost and risk of early deployment, Newlab accelerates commercialization timelines and helps attract companies that might otherwise build and scale elsewhere.

“Today is more than a groundbreaking – it is the start of a redevelopment that will transform the neighborhood and the city,” said Michael Hecht, President and CEO of Greater New Orleans, Inc. “The NSA site will seamlessly combine the practical with the aspirational, providing hundreds of units of affordable housing, while launching Newlab – the most successful venture platform in the world – right here in New Orleans. We are grateful to all of the committed and creative partners who have brought us to this day.”

Newlab’s approach has delivered measurable results in other legacy industrial cities like Detroit, MI, and Brooklyn, NY, where its hubs have supported high-growth startups, generated billions in economic activity, and anchored high-wage jobs. In New Orleans, the goal is to apply Newlab’s model in a way that is tightly aligned with the state’s economic development strategy, manufacturing base, and skilled workforce, positioning the region as a launchpad for scaling critical technologies.

“FUEL’s investment in the Newlab partnership will put Louisiana energy startups on a faster path from lab to market,” said Mike Mazzola, Executive Director of Future Use of Energy in Louisiana (FUEL). “When combined with FUEL’s other investments, our founders will have access to the tools, capital, and partnerships needed to scale.”

Newlab New Orleans is one of several major components of the broader NSA redevelopment, a multi-phase effort led by Brian Gibbs Development to transform the former military operations site into a vibrant new campus that delivers housing, retail, and long-term community and economic value for New Orleans. Designed as an integrated campus, the redevelopment aligns these elements to create community and economic activity while delivering long-term value for the surrounding neighborhood.

Lincoln Avenue Communities’ NSA East Bank Apartments will anchor the housing component of the redevelopment through an adaptive-reuse project that will deliver 294 units of affordable housing and approximately 30,000 square feet of ground-floor retail. The development will include 1-, 2-, and 3-bedroom units serving individuals and families earning between 20% and 60% of Area Median Income, including 74 Project-Based Voucher units.

At $197 million, the Lincoln Avenue Communities investment represents the largest affordable housing development in Louisiana history, setting a new benchmark for scale, preservation, and long-term affordability. By transforming former military facilities into high-quality homes, the project expands access to housing in a high-opportunity area while ensuring that the NSA redevelopment delivers immediate and lasting benefits for local residents.

“This project will be transformative for the New Orleans Bywater community and will bring new life to this historic property,” said David Garcia, LAC Vice President and Project Partner. “LAC along with Brian Gibbs Development are proud to play a role in preserving New Orleans’ architectural heritage while creating sorely needed affordable housing for New Orleans residents.”

With construction now underway, the redevelopment will proceed in phases to deliver new homes, ground-floor retail, and shared community spaces, returning the former Naval Support Activity East Bank site to active use and creating a riverfront campus that supports daily life in the Bywater while positioning New Orleans for long-term growth in industrial sectors. Together, these investments represent a long-term commitment to local residents and the region’s economic future.

It accounts for roughly 16% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is a major driver of climate change.
Shelley said uniform EPA rules provided regulatory certainty for changes operators saw as inevitable.
Colin Leyden, Texas state director and energy lead at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, said eliminating the program could hurt Texas industry.
Leyden said tallying up the dollar value of lives saved when evaluating pollution rules is a foundational principle of the EPA since its creation.","The first year of President Trump’s second term has seen an aggressive rollback of federal environmental protections, which advocacy groups fear will bring more pollution, higher health risks, and less information and power for Texas communities, especially in heavily industrial and urban areas.

Within Trump’s first 100 days in office, his new Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Lee Zeldin, announced a sweeping slate of 31 deregulatory actions. The list, which Zeldin called the agency’s “greatest day of deregulation,” targeted everything from soot standards and power plant pollution rules to the Endangerment Finding, the legal and scientific foundation that obligates the EPA to regulate climate-changing pollution under the Clean Air Act.

Since then, the agency froze research grants, shrank its workforce, and removed some references to climate change and environmental justice from its website — moves that environmental advocates say send a clear signal: the EPA’s new direction will come at the expense of public health.

Cyrus Reed, conservation director of the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club, said Texas is one of the states that feels EPA policy changes directly because the state has shown little interest in stepping up its environmental enforcement as the federal government scales back.

“If we were a state that was open to doing our own regulations there’d be less impact from these rollbacks,” Reed said. “But we’re not.”

“Now we have an EPA that isn’t interested in enforcing its own rules,” he added.

Richard Richter, a spokesperson at the state’s environmental agency, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, said in a statement that the agency takes protecting public health and natural resources seriously and acts consistently and quickly to enforce federal and state environmental laws when they’re violated.

Methane rules put on pause

A major EPA move centers on methane, a potent greenhouse gas that traps heat far more efficiently than carbon dioxide over the short term. It accounts for roughly 16% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is a major driver of climate change. In the U.S., the largest source of methane emissions is the energy sector, especially in Texas, the nation’s top oil and gas producer.

In 2024, the Biden administration finalized long-anticipated rules requiring oil and gas operators to sharply reduce methane emissions from wells, pipelines, and storage facilities. The rule, developed with industry input, targeted leaks, equipment failures, and routine flaring, the burning off of excess natural gas at the wellhead.

Under the rule, operators would have been required to monitor emissions, inspect sites with gas-imaging cameras for leaks, and phase out routine flaring. States are required to come up with a plan to implement the rule, but Texas has yet to do so. Under Trump’s EPA, that deadline has been extended until January 2027 — an 18-month postponement.

Texas doesn’t have a rule to capture escaping methane emissions from energy infrastructure. Richter, the TCEQ spokesperson, said the agency continues to work toward developing the state plan.

Adrian Shelley, Texas director of the watchdog group Public Citizen, said the rule represented a rare moment of alignment between environmentalists and major oil and gas producers.

“I think the fossil fuel industry generally understood that this was the direction the planet and their industry was moving,” he said. Shelley said uniform EPA rules provided regulatory certainty for changes operators saw as inevitable.

Reed, the Sierra Club conservation director, said the delay of methane rules means Texas still has no plan to reduce emissions, while neighboring New Mexico already has imposed its own state methane emission rules that require the industry to detect and repair methane leaks and ban routine venting and flaring.

These regulations have cut methane emissions in the New Mexico portion of the Permian Basin — the oil-rich area that covers West Texas and southeast New Mexico — to half that of Texas, according to a recent data analysis by the Environmental Defense Fund. That’s despite New Mexico doubling production since 2020.

A retreat from soot standards

Fine particulate matter or PM 2.5, one of six pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act, has been called by researchers the deadliest form of air pollution.

In 2024, the EPA under President Biden strengthened air rules for particulate matter by lowering the annual limit from 12 to 9 micrograms per cubic meter. It was the first update since 2012 and one of the most ambitious pieces of Biden’s environmental agenda, driven by mounting evidence that particulate pollution is linked to premature death, heart disease, asthma, and other respiratory illnesses.

After the rule was issued, 24 Republican-led states, including Kentucky and West Virginia, sued to revert to the weaker standard. Texas filed a separate suit asking to block the rule’s recent expansion.

State agencies are responsible for enforcing the federal standards. The TCEQ is charged with creating a list of counties that exceed the federal standard and submitting those recommendations to Gov. Greg Abbott, who then finalizes the designations and submits them to the EPA.

Under the 9 microgram standard, parts of Texas, including Dallas, Harris (which includes Houston), Tarrant (Fort Worth), and Bowie (Texarkana) counties, were in the process of being designated nonattainment areas — which, when finalized, would trigger a legal requirement for the state to develop a plan to clean up the air.

That process stalled after Trump returned to office. Gov. Greg Abbott submitted his designations to EPA last February, but EPA has not yet acted on his designations, according to Richter, the TCEQ spokesperson.

In a court filing last year, the Trump EPA asked a federal appeals court to vacate the stricter standard, bypassing the traditional notice and comment administrative process.

For now, the rule technically remains in effect, but environmental advocates say the EPA’s retreat undermines enforcement of the rule and signals to polluters that it may be short-lived.

Shelley, with Public Citizen, believes the PM2.5 rule would have delivered the greatest health benefit of any EPA regulation affecting Texas, particularly through reductions in diesel pollution from trucks.

“I still hold out hope that it will come back,” he said.

Unraveling the climate framework

Beyond individual pollutants, the Trump EPA has moved to dismantle the federal architecture for addressing climate change.

Among the proposals is eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which requires power plants, refineries, and oil and gas suppliers to report annual emissions. The proposal has drawn opposition from both environmental groups and industry, which relies on the data for planning and compliance.

Colin Leyden, Texas state director and energy lead at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, said eliminating the program could hurt Texas industry. If methane emissions are no longer reported, then buyers and investors of natural gas, for example, won’t have an official way to measure how much methane pollution is associated with that gas, according to Leyden. That makes it harder to judge how “clean” or “climate-friendly” the product is, which international buyers are increasingly demanding.

“This isn’t just bad for the planet,” he said. “It makes the Texas industry less competitive.”

The administration also proposed last year rescinding the Endangerment Finding, issued in 2009, which obligates the EPA to regulate climate pollution. Most recently, the EPA said it will stop calculating how much money is saved in health care costs as a result of air pollution regulations that curb particulate matter 2.5 and ozone, a component of smog. Both can cause respiratory and health problems.

Leyden said tallying up the dollar value of lives saved when evaluating pollution rules is a foundational principle of the EPA since its creation.

“That really erodes the basic idea that (the EPA) protects health and safety and the environment,” he said.

By 2023, data centers represented 4.4% of total electricity demand.

Challenges of concern include: Sharp forecasted growth, driven in large part by data centers and resulting in projected cost increases and capacity shortfalls.
At the conclusion of the meeting, representatives from the Governors’ offices took the stage to announce a joint statement of intent to create a PJM Governors’ Collaborative, signed by 11 Governors, to develop a PJM Governors’ Collaborative to promote greater state and consumer representation in both decision-making processes at PJM.","The American economy, communities, public health and national security are all dependent on a reliable, affordable and abundant supply of electricity. Electricity is delivered to consumers through a complicated and interconnected network of generators, transmission lines and distribution networks. Thousands of companies contribute to a robust, multi-resourced supply of electricity – from the generators that produce electrons to the electric companies that deliver those electrons where they are needed, not to mention the thousands of contractors and suppliers supporting this critical infrastructure.

Demand for power has remained relatively flat for the last several decades, helping these entities balance supply with demand and mitigate against sharp price increases. However, this era of flat demand appears to be ending, with electricity demand forecasted to grow by 5.7% annually over the next five years – reaching 32% by 2030. This growth is being driven largely by new data centers powering the boom in artificial intelligence (AI). By 2023, data centers represented 4.4% of total electricity demand. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory forecasts that this will grow at an accelerating rate, reaching between 6.7% and 12.0% of total demand by 2028.

While Governors support economic growth in their states, many are concerned about the potential for new costs to supply data centers being shouldered by consumers. Meeting this demand will require an unprecedented and rapid buildout of new generation and transmission infrastructure.

Nowhere is this more apparent than in the mid-Atlantic, where recent auctions for new generating capacity have hit record highs, driven in large part by demand from data centers, according to the regional grid operator, PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM). Even with these record high prices being paid to incentivize new generation, PJM risks not procuring adequate supply to meet demand, with applications for interconnection so backlogged that the queue was temporarily closed to new projects in February 2022. Challenges of concern include:

Sharp forecasted growth, driven in large part by data centers and resulting in projected cost increases and capacity shortfalls.

Constrained new generation, 40 GW of conventional fossil generation at risk of retiring by 2030, and a backlogged queue of projects awaiting interconnection studies, in many cases for multiple years. The Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) reported that projects that became operational in 2025 spent an average of over 8 years getting interconnected.

Questions remain regarding who should pay for the new infrastructure powering new large loads, with concerns that current customers will be saddled with higher costs to power data centers.

Uncertain and variable load forecasts, which add risk and uncertainty to new grid infrastructure investments. This is complicated by growing facility sizes and the emergence of new, gigawatt-scale data centers.[1]

Bipartisan Solutions: Governors Take Action to Fast Track Investment

As electricity prices continue to rise in the region and reliability is threatened, Governors of the PJM states – Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia – came together in a show of bipartisanship to brainstorm solutions and governance reform to better address future needs.

In June 2025, after hearing acute concerns from Governors of both parties, the National Governors Association (NGA) convened representatives from each of the PJM Governors’ offices in Washington, D.C., to discuss regional planning and governance to address rising prices and resource adequacy challenges in the region. At this meeting, Governors’ teams identified three solutions to accelerate reforms in PJM. These included:

States taking a more active role in PJM governance through the appointment of two members of the PJM board;

A state-hosted technical conference with leaders from across the region and nation to identify technical, planning and governance solutions to the region’s energy challenges; and

Exploring the formation of a new “PJM Governors’ Collaborative” to continue bipartisan, executive branch coordination.

Building off the inaugural meeting, 10 out of the 13 Governors drafted and sent letters[2] to the PJM Board of Managers requesting a meeting with the eight members of the Nominating Committee to share their proposal for board seat candidates and encouraged PJM to allow for the state’s input into these two board seats going forward.

On September 22, 2025, with support from NGA and the Great Plains Institute, all 13 states convened a first-of-its-kind PJM Multi-State Technical Conference at the Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. More than 500 participants attended the conference, with an additional 500 attending virtually. Attendees heard directly from Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro in addition to NGA Vice Chair Maryland Governor Wes Moore, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy and Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin. Other speakers included state leaders, PJM leadership, critical stakeholders and experts from across the region. Technical sessions, each of which was moderated by a bipartisan pair of Governors’ office representatives, addressed resource adequacy challenges, innovative solutions to supply and demand constraints, governance lessons learned from across the country, and solutions for governance reform in PJM.

At the conclusion of the meeting, representatives from the Governors’ offices took the stage to announce a joint statement of intent to create a PJM Governors’ Collaborative, signed by 11 Governors, to develop a PJM Governors’ Collaborative to promote greater state and consumer representation in both decision-making processes at PJM.

Latest Actions: Governors and the Administration Issue Joint Principles Regarding PJM

On January 15, all 13 regional Governors joined U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum and U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, both of whom lead President Trump’s Energy Dominance Council, to sign a Statement of Principles Regarding PJM to address ongoing affordability and reliability concerns in PJM.

These principles aim to (1) cut through the backlog of projects pending interconnection and accelerate the speed at which new power comes online, (2) have data centers cover their share of the costs of any new resources, and (3) stem the increase in auction prices to bring affordability back to the PJM region.

More specifically, these principles include:

Trigger a reliability backstop auction by September 2026, an emergency mechanism to procure adequate generation resources to fill the gap left by the last base residual auction (BRA) and put in place a 15-year price guarantee to provide revenue certainty for generators.

Allocate the costs of this additional backstop power to data centers through a two-part process:

The principles direct PJM to allocate the cost of new capacity to load serving entities[3] (LSEs).

Governors agreed to then use their authorities to have state regulators design new, large load rate classes that would allow the LSEs to allocate their share of new generation costs to data centers. Data centers that have procured their own power or agree to curtail their power usage during times of high demand are not expected to shoulder the costs from the Reliability Backstop Auction.

Protect rate payers by continuing the existing price restrictions over to the next two base auctions, intended to freeze prices through 2030.

Refine PJM’s load forecasting projections to only include real new demand,[4] improving the ability of states and the markets to project future power needs and avoid double-counting future energy-users.

Institute a 150-day time limit for interconnection studies, vastly accelerating the interconnection process and bringing PJM into compliance with FERC Order No. 2023, which aimed to accelerate interconnection for electric generation and storage projects.

Meaningfully engage stakeholders to reform the capacity market and return PJM to “market fundamentals” in time for the May 2027 auction.

As a non-binding set of principles, there is much work that remains to be done to ensure success. However, with bipartisan coordination and improved regional governance, Governors will continue working to protect their constituents from increasing electricity rates, develop their states’ economies, and ensure that power remains reliable and affordable into the future.

[1] An analysis by Grid Strategies found that nationwide, aggregated utility forecasts for new demand by 2030 were potentially overstated by as much as 40%, with utilities collectively projecting 90 GW of new power demand and other analysts projecting closer to 65 GW.

[2] Nine Governors signed the initial letter to the PJM Board of Governors. Ohio Governor Mike DeWine followed with a letter of his own supporting the previous, multi-Governor letter.

To more actively participate in the future of clean energy tax incentives, join the Renewable Energy Working Group, bringing bipartisan industry stakeholders together to drive policy on the clean energy transition.","The deployment of clean energy will be essential for meeting the historic electricity demand surge, which is forecasted to require more than 150 gigawatts (GWs) in additional capacity within five years, by 2030, according to Grid Strategies’ November 2025 report. The explosive growth of artificial intelligence (AI), reshoring of heavy industry to build up American manufacturing, increasing electrification and the planned retiring of aging energy generation facilities necessitate this new generation be added as quickly as possible across the country.

The federal extension of operations of fossil generation facilities planning to retire, namely coal plants, have in fact only increased costs and prolonged emissions. A significant expansion of generation will require modernization and all available, economically viable resources. A diverse, efficient, well-regulated and affordable energy mix will bring down costs while supporting the data centers necessary for the race to develop AI and strengthen U.S. national, economic and energy security.

Low-cost zero-emissions renewable resources that can be promptly deployed are a critical element of this framework. Solar, wind and battery storage facilities can be sited closer to or within communities because of their flexible scalability and site engineering and lack of emissions. Facilities can be tailored to a variety of locations, such as agrivoltaics solar farms and canopy and rooftop solar in more urban environments and including brownfield sites. However, a significant barrier stands in the way. Delays in processing new generation facilities in the grid interconnection queues are a systemic challenge that is severely inhibiting a vast capacity of proposed renewable generation from coming online. Continued delays only hinder U.S. energy, economic and national security ambitions.

Interconnection Queues are Hindering Clean Energy

Interconnection queues are a critical part of the clean energy ecosystem in the United States. It refers to the process by which new energy generation facilities request permission to connect to the transmission grid. Regional grid operators, known as Independent System Operators (ISOs) and Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs), and utilities are responsible for managing these queues. Their role is to ensure that new projects can be safely and reliably integrated into the grid, but the procedures for doing so have become increasingly complex and time-consuming.

In recent years, the scale of the backlog in these interconnection queues has reached unprecedented levels. As of the end of 2023, an astonishing 2,600 GWs (2.6 terawatts) of proposed generation and storage projects were waiting for grid access, with typical wait times stretching to five years or more. More than 95% of this queued capacity consists of zero-carbon resources, including solar (1,080 GW), battery storage (1,030 GW) and wind (366 GW). Delays in connecting these resources not only slow the transition to clean energy but also compromise U.S. energy security and hinder the nation’s ability to compete in the global AI race, particularly against China.

The interconnection queue backlog is rooted in several longstanding structural challenges. Traditionally, a first-come, first-served process has allowed speculative facilities to occupy queue positions ahead of those ready to build, incentivizing “queue clogging” and slowing progress. The absence of standardized, transparent data and processes has further lengthened study timelines and complicated coordination among stakeholders. Transmission system limitations and mismatches in regional planning often mean that grid expansion lags behind actual resource interconnection needs. Additionally, regulatory and procedural inefficiencies, such as inconsistencies across ISOs and RTOs and a lack of clear penalties for delays, have compounded the problem, making it harder for renewable energy projects to move forward efficiently.

Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s annual interconnection review, published in December 2025, found that while queue capacity dropped for the first time in 2024, it was not solely due to increased efficiency. Though record amounts of large-scale solar (31 GWs) and battery storage (11 GWs) completed interconnection and began operating, new solar and battery storage capacity entering the queue declined sharply along with an increase in withdrawals. Solar and battery storage declined by 47% and 32%, respectively, and a record 112 GWs of solar and storage capacity combined withdrew from the queue in 2024 due to factors like political uncertainty, high interest rates, tariffs and local permitting challenges. The decrease in backlogged capacity then, is also equally due to the impacts of other regulatory and political externalities taking their toll on the renewable energy industry, in addition to some gains in queue processing speed. There is therefore still work to be done to truly address interconnection and the significant capacity stalled in the queues.

FERC’s Order No. 2023 was a Major Step but there is More to Do

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s (FERC) Order No. 2023, “Improvements to Generator Interconnection Procedures and Agreements,” issued in 2023, marked a significant advancement in reforming generator interconnection procedures and agreements, aiming to reduce backlogs and improve project timelines. The rule introduced a cluster study process to evaluate groups of projects together, firm deadlines and penalties for transmission providers that miss study deadlines, and stronger financial and site control requirements to discourage speculative projects. Advanced technology integration, such as improved storage modeling, was also emphasized. The subsequent Order 2023-A reaffirmed most reforms and set compliance deadlines for transmission providers in 2024, with FERC now reviewing and approving proposals. Some grid operators, like the California ISO (CAISO), have reported reduced interconnection study delays, while others remain in negotiations with FERC to finalize effective reforms.

Despite the progress made by Order 2023, it is widely recognized as not sufficient alone, as it primarily addresses process improvements rather than the underlying lack of transmission capacity. Industry experts and FERC have described the order as setting a floor but not a ceiling for interconnection reform. Persistent challenges include lagging data transparency and queue visibility, which could be improved through better dashboards and metrics. Future reforms could draw from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Interconnection Innovation e-Xchange (i2X) initiative, designed to complement and extend beyond Order 2023, with ideas such as enhanced coordination of affected system studies, additional data transparency requirements, queue processing automation and refined infrastructure cost-sharing among clustered projects. Crucially, interconnection reform must be paired with transmission modernization and expansion, including grid-enhancing technologies, to ensure renewables can reach demand centers efficiently.

In 2023, FERC also issued Order 901 (Docket No. RM22-12-000), “Reliability Standards to Address Inverter-Based Resources.” In response the North American Electric Reliability Corporation proposed reliability standards which the Commission approved in July 2025. The Commission issued Order 1920 in 2024, “Building for the Future Through Electric Regional Transmission Planning and Cost Allocation,” as amended, requiring transmission providers address how they conduct long-term planning for regional facilities and determine how to pay for them, and Order 909 in July 2025 (Docket No. RM25-3-000), “Reliability Standards for Frequency and Voltage Protection Settings and Ride-Through for Inverter-Based Resources.” Order 909 building on Order 901. While these orders have begun to illicit progress, further facilitation for building intra- and interregional transmission capacity is needed to accelerate renewable integration.

The backlog’s consequences are far-reaching, slowing capital deployment, increasing costs and discouraging investment in renewables. It also raises concerns about resource adequacy and reliability, as slower renewable integration affects capacity planning and readiness for peak demand. For consumers, the impact is tangible, slow interconnection processes, such as those seen in PJM, the largest RTO in the country, have driven up interconnection charges, making clean energy less affordable. As Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) and many others have noted, the interconnection process in PJM, serving more than 65 million people across 13 east coast states and Washington, D.C., has become drastically untenable. Projects that became operational in 2025 spent an average of eight years in the queue waiting to connect. PJM runs its auctions, however, on a two- to three-year forward-looking basis. New generation simply cannot respond fast enough to new demand and the pace of the capacity auctions. PJM’s cumbersome process, skyrocketing interconnection requests, surging demand (due in large part to data centers) and retiring assets, have caused prices to soar.

The PJM July 2025 capacity auction prices soared from about $29 per megawatt (MW)-day for the entire region for the 2024 to 2025 Delivery Year (DY) to about $270 per MW-day for DY 2025 to 2026 everywhere except two zones which cleared at about $466 and $444 per MW-day. Prices for DY 2026 to 2027 hit the FERC cap of $329 per MW-day for the entire PJM footprint. A 22% rise for most zones except for the same two zones, which would have been priced even higher but actually experienced a price decrease due to the cap. Analysis published in October 2025 commissioned by GridLab and executed by Aurora Energy Research concluded that if just 10% of the 107 GWs of land-based renewables in the queue before 2024 had been built in time for the 2026 to 2027 auction, this would have added 1.5 GWs in net supply to the auction and saved PJM consumers $3.5 billion in costs.

The Midcontinent ISO (MISO) in the Midwest saw an even larger price increase earlier this year. The price for summer 2025 shot up to $666.50 per MW-day from just $30.00 per MW-day in summer 2024. Consumers are starting to feel the effects of tightened supply and the significant, accumulating price increases in the markets across the country. According to the Energy Information Administration’s Electricity Monthly Update, which tracks supplies and pricing and reports national-level metrics, the 2024 to 2025 year-over-year change in the national average residential retail electricity price likely peaked in September 2025, based on the data available so far through October 2025, reaching a 7.4% increase from September 2025. The prior summer months were not far behind. August 2025 was up 6.1%, July was up 5.2% and June was up 6.6%. The data for October shows that cooler temperatures somewhat tempered demand but the average still grew 5.2% since 2024.

PJM held another capacity auction in December 2025 for DY 2027 to 2028. The auction concluded at the price cap again and also failed to secure enough capacity to meet the reliability criterion of maintaining a 20% reserve margin during a one‑in‑10‑year event, procuring only a 14.8% reserve margin.

Proposed Interconnection Reforms

Across these analyses of U.S. grid interconnection, stakeholders converge on a set of reform recommendations aimed at speeding access to the grid, reducing cost and uncertainty, and better aligning interconnection with broader transmission planning and clean-energy deployment. Experts stress that while cluster study reforms and strengthened queue requirements provide an important baseline, further structural reforms are needed. This includes proactive rather than reactionary planning, enhanced data transparency, queue automation, better coordination of “affected system” studies, and refinements to how network upgrade costs are allocated to meaningfully reduce the massive backlog and integrate renewables more efficiently.

Another January 2025 Lawrence Berkeley Lab analysis highlights the need to tighten linkages between long-term transmission planning and the project-level interconnection process so that the grid can accommodate burgeoning clean energy and storage queues without imposing excessive costs or delays on developers. Increased transparency of interconnection outcomes and costs, better data for monitoring process health, and stronger integration of transmission planning into interconnection decisions emerge as key recommendations.

Similarly, the previously noted November 2025 RMI analysis of PJM, “PJM’s Speed to Power Problem and How to Fix It,” identifies practical reforms to shorten study timelines and reduce costs. Recommendations include deploying modern third-party automation and software tools to accelerate interconnection studies, reforming the Energy Resource Interconnection Service (ERIS) process to be a truly faster and lower-cost pathway, rigorously considering advanced and grid-enhancing technologies in network upgrade planning, and prioritizing proactive rather than ad hoc planning and analysis. These reforms are aimed at further unleashing thousands of queued projects and alleviating the cost and reliability pressures caused by long interconnection delays.

Collectively, experts are advocating for reforms that go beyond the FERC rules so far to improve transparency, further develop and integrate planning processes, adopt new technologies and automation, and redesign underlying cost-allocation and study methodologies so that the interconnection process can more reliably and affordably bring new energy resources online.

Permitting Reform in Congress is an Opportunity

Permitting reform has been a focal point for the last few Congress’ and is atop the agenda once again at the start of the second session of the 119th Congress, presenting a policy window to address interconnection, transmission buildout, and permitting challenges in a comprehensive manner for both clean and traditional energy generation. Ever increasing industry angst and urgency is now coupled with a nationwide affordability crisis going into midterm elections in November 2026. Skyrocketing electricity costs have made the situation even more dire and the stakes higher for reaching a deal that could bring down costs.

The primary legislative vehicle, the SPEED Act, H.R. 4776, led by House Natural Resources (HNR) Committee Chair Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, could significantly unlock renewable energy deployment if it also incorporates interconnection and transmission reforms into the final version. Streamlined and aligned permitting and interconnection processes paired with expedited transmission buildout and modernization would bring critical, stalled capacity online to stabilize the grid and bring down costs.

The House passed the SPEED Act Dec. 18, marking a significant step forward. While the bill was amended to address concerns from anti-offshore wind factions, allowing the administration to pursue legal action against previously approved projects, it still garnered bipartisan support, with 11 Democrats voting in favor. HNR chair Westerman hailed the passage as a bipartisan achievement, building momentum as the Senate prepares to take up the issue in the new year.

A counterproposal from a bipartisan group of House members, Reps. Scott Peters, D-California; Gabe Evans, R-Colorado; Gabe Vasquez, D-New Mexico; and Andrew Garbarino, R-New York, seeks to again propose protections for projects that are delayed by agencies and for final permitting decisions. The CERTAIN Act, a discussion draft, proposes shielding lawfully issued permits from being overturned due to political decisions and enhancing permitting certainty by enabling court challenges against agencies that miss deadlines or review milestones. It would require agencies to publicly disclose and justify any permit delays.

Addressing permitting interference and delays are the top priorities for Democrats as the SPEED Act advances to the Senate for negotiations. Democratic members have also released other proposals that lay out more of their priorities, which include recommendations for reforming interconnection and transmission processes and incentivizing deployment. Rep. Peters introduced his SPEED and Reliability Act of 2025, H.R. 5600, while Reps. Sean Casten, D-Illinois, and Mike Levin, D-California, introduced a broader package, the Cheap Energy Act, as a discussion draft in September 2025. The SPEED and Reliability Act focuses on transmission expansion while the Cheap Energy Act seeks to address transmission as well as delayed and expensive interconnections, reinstatement of energy tax credits, affordability, modernization, supply chains, public land deployment, wildfire security and community engagement. These proposals lay the groundwork for negotiating further possible reforms such as how interconnection queues are managed and transmission modernization and expansion could be expedited.

Looking ahead, the Senate’s Environment and Public Works Chair Shelley Moore Capito, R-West Virginia, has signaled interest in further strengthening protections for project permits for all types of energy. Industry groups and Democrats are advocating for the Senate to bolster safeguards for both existing and new projects, supporting grid reliability and investment.

However, the administration’s attempted cancellations and pauses of offshore wind facility permits, as well as heightened restrictions for renewable energy deployment on public lands through the U.S. Department of the Interior and restricted funding for rural renewable energy through the U.S. Department of Agriculture, discussed in this previous Notes from Novogradac post, have complicated negotiations. Democrats have communicated that reversing and preventing future permit cancellations and lifting the restrictions on public land deployment are a requirement for any bipartisan deal. The CERTAIN Act discussion draft will lay a bipartisan foundation for continued discussion. Key senators anticipate robust but difficult bipartisan negotiations ahead, emphasizing the need for certainty and durable solutions for energy producers.

To more actively participate in the future of clean energy tax incentives, join the Renewable Energy Working Group, bringing bipartisan industry stakeholders together to drive policy on the clean energy transition.

,Texas American Energy ,2026-01-21 20:07:07+00:00,Mexico News Daily,Opinion: Could Mexico make America great again? The energy equation,Pedro Casas Alatriste,,,,,https://mexiconewsdaily.com/opinion/opinion-could-mexico-make-america-great-again-the-energy-equation/,"Today, Mexico exports more than $620 billion, with oil representing just 3.5% of the total, while manufacturing accounts for nearly 90%.
This transformation has tied Mexico and the United States together through energy flows that are structural, not optional.
Refined products & crude: A circulatory system The result is clear: under many trade measures, the United States now runs an energy surplus with Mexico, meaning the value of U.S. energy exports to Mexico exceeds the value of Mexican energy exports to the U.S.
Mutual benefits embedded in infrastructure As documented by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, this integration is neither temporary nor marginal.
Mexico is not peripheral to U.S. energy security — it is central to it.","Energy may be the most foundational pillar behind everything we’ve discussed so far: re-industrialization, nearshoring, AI and North American competitiveness. You don’t run factories, servers or supply chains without reliable, scalable and affordable power. Energy isn’t a side story — it’s the operating system of modern economic activity.

Mexico’s role in this system is often framed through an outdated oil lens.

Forty years ago, that framing made sense. In 1982, Mexico exported roughly $24 billion, and almost 65% of that was crude oil. Today, Mexico exports more than $620 billion, with oil representing just 3.5% of the total, while manufacturing accounts for nearly 90%. In other words, Mexico’s economy has transformed from being oil-dependent to manufacturing-driven — and manufacturing is, above all, energy-intensive.

This transformation has tied Mexico and the United States together through energy flows that are structural, not optional.

Natural gas: The backbone of integration

Looking only at imports, the integration is even clearer: virtually all of the natural gas Mexico imports — over 99% — arrives via pipeline from the United States, reflecting a high degree of physical and commercial interdependence between the two energy systems, particularly U.S. producers in Texas, for whom Mexico has become a critical and stable export outlet.

Natural gas now anchors Mexico’s electricity generation, industrial production, and export manufacturing — much of which directly supports U.S. supply chains.

Refined products & crude: A circulatory system

The result is clear: under many trade measures, the United States now runs an energy surplus with Mexico, meaning the value of U.S. energy exports to Mexico exceeds the value of Mexican energy exports to the U.S. This surplus supports U.S. GDP, sustains jobs in energy production and refining, and strengthens America’s position in global energy markets.

Mutual benefits embedded in infrastructure

As documented by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, this integration is neither temporary nor marginal. Pipeline shipments of U.S. natural gas to Mexico have increased by an order of magnitude since the early 2000s, and today the majority of U.S. pipeline exports flow south of the border rather than overseas.

U.S.-Mexico Border Crossing Natural Gas Pipelines and Expansions of Mexico’s Domestic Pipelines

Why policy certainty matters

This is why energy policy cannot be an afterthought in debates about economic strategy or geopolitical competition. Mexico is not peripheral to U.S. energy security — it is central to it. American energy production, refining, and export capacity are increasingly linked to Mexican demand, infrastructure, and industrial growth. Likewise, Mexico’s ability to sustain its manufacturing base and capture nearshoring opportunities depends on continued access to U.S. energy and predictable investment conditions.

If the United States wants to remain an energy powerhouse, it cannot do so alone. It’s not just about drilling in Texas or New Mexico — it’s about smart partnerships, strong trade frameworks and working closely with reliable neighbors.

Seen this way, energy fits naturally with the other themes in this series. If AI is the brain of the future economy, energy is the bloodstream. And today, that bloodstream flows across North America.

Senators had no discussion on Senate Bill 258 on Tuesday.
The commission regulates commercial nuclear power plants and other uses of nuclear materials.
Some activists have expressed concerns with nuclear power, saying that it might not meet energy demands and might not be as clear as nuclear power companies say.
“Indiana has no experience whatsoever operating nuclear facilities,” Kerwin Olson, executive director of the Citizens Action Coalition, previously said.","The Indiana Senate moved a bill that would shape how permits are issued to nuclear facilities to its third reading.

State. Sen. Eric Koch, R-Bedford, authored Senate Bill 258, which would make changes to the state code about how the Indiana Department of Environmental Management issues permits to nuclear-powered generating facilities and fuel processing plants.

The changes include repealing a prohibition from constructing or operating a nuclear facility without an IDEM permit and repealing the authorization for the commissioner to conduct a public hearing on environmental effects. The bill would require the facility operator to file an environmental feasibility report to IDEM.

Senators had no discussion on Senate Bill 258 on Tuesday. No amendments were made to the bill.

Alex Goodnight, deputy legislative director for IDEM, previously said the bill makes common sense changes to Indiana Code and eliminates “outdated and unnecessary provisions,” according to Post-Tribune archives.

“These proposed changes reflect existing laws and establish appropriate division of responsibilities between the state and Nuclear Regulatory Commission,” Goodnight said. “The federal government maintains exclusive authority over radiological safety and the construction and operation of nuclear facilities under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954.”

According to its website, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission was created in 1974 and ensures the safe use of radioactive materials for “beneficial civilian purposes” and protects people and the environment. The commission regulates commercial nuclear power plants and other uses of nuclear materials.

State laws conflict with and are preempted by the Atomic Energy Act, according to Post-Tribune archives.

Gov. Mike Braun has been dedicated to bringing nuclear power to the state. In November 2025, Braun announced that First American Nuclear would bring its headquarters, manufacturing facilities and an energy park to Indiana, according to Post-Tribune archives.

First American Nuclear is dedicated to building small modular reactors, or SMRs, which are advanced nuclear reactors that have about one-third the generating capacity of traditional nuclear reactors, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.

A First American Nuclear spokesperson told the Post-Tribune in November that the company is looking for sites for its corporate headquarters, manufacturing facility and energy park, but none have been decided yet. Construction for the manufacturing and energy park sites is expected to start in 2028.

Some activists have expressed concerns with nuclear power, saying that it might not meet energy demands and might not be as clear as nuclear power companies say.

“Indiana has no experience whatsoever operating nuclear facilities,” Kerwin Olson, executive director of the Citizens Action Coalition, previously said. “We have great concerns about eviscerating the abilities of (IDEM).”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ctc-l-nuclear-plant.jpg?w=1024&h=752,N,,2026-01-21 16:00:16.997820

Nestled in a redwood forest atop a hill overlooking the Pacific Ocean, UC Santa Cruz stands out not just for its remarkable setting, but for its unconventional approach to research and higher education. Since its inception 60 years ago, the university consistently strives to support socially-engaged collaborations between traditionally distinct disciplines.

“I think it’s the Santa Cruz spirit,” said Jennifer Parker, professor of art and founding director of OpenLab, a collaborative research center supporting interdisciplinary innovation in the arts, sciences, and technology. “This campus has always celebrated its difference,” she said. “There’s a freedom in shaping something new, rather than fitting in.”

Where some institutions might have shirked that reputation, UCSC leaned in, rewarding professors for creative, interdisciplinary research and education and encouraging student activism. The result can be seen in UCSC’s rich ecosystem of art and science collaborations that are addressing some of the biggest challenges facing society today. That includes climate change, the effects of which Santa Cruz is already feeling, with forests on fire, streets flooding, and roads washing away into the sea.

Facing a challenge as big as the climate crisis requires new ways of thinking and seeing. Though their disciplines are conventionally seen as distinct, artists and scientists alike ask questions, make observations, and interpret findings. Where science systematically and empirically investigates to draw conclusions, art engages and moves people through felt expression. Art can transform raw data or an abstract idea into a tangible, viscerally understandable experience. Together, art and science can drive collective action and reshape our understanding of how we interact with the world around us, and each other.

From a 15-foot augmented reality sculpture of a global ocean current to imaginative visual interpretations of marine mammal vocalizations, here are some of the visionary art and science collaborations flourishing at UCSC.

Jennifer Parker and Karolina Karlic

When UCSC’s Genomics Institute building opened in 2019, Parker and Karolina Karlic, associate professor of art, merged their passions for socially engaged art to create Intersecting Data Fields, an installation and gallery space in the new building. Using photography — an important tool for both science and art that transforms the way we see the world — the two envisioned a site-specific installation together where Karlic made portraits of the Institute’s scientists and photographed objects that had personal significance to them. Together, Parker and Karlic collaborated on the conceptual framework for the project where Parker’s sculptural pieces and Karlic’s photography converged, hanging throughout the halls of the building. The works explore the impacts of the Institute’s research and the diversity of the people doing it.

Parker launched OpenLab to dissolve barriers between disciplines, giving artists opportunities to tell stories that spark curiosity and build empathy for ideas like environmental change. With a practice rooted in sculpture and new media, she ran the experimental Mechatronics research group from 2009-2016, integrating mechanical, electronic, and information technologies to create multimedia art. One of Parker’s current projects is The Algae Society, a bioart and design lab composed of an international group of artists, scientists, and designers creating work — like a stop motion animation inspired by two scientists’ desert ecology and algal research in Joshua Tree National Park, or blown glass sculptures of intricate seaweed forms reimagined by AI — to expand people’s understanding of the interdependence of all life on this rapidly changing planet.

Karlic, who is also the art and science director of the Kenneth S. Norris Center for Natural History, aims to bring art and science research together to explore our relationship to place in the post-Industrialized world. As the founding director of Unseen California, she leads a research initiative and artist in residence program that integrates arts, sciences, and humanities to explore environmental and social issues across California. Based in the UC Natural Reserve System, the largest network of field stations in the world, Unseen California supports field-based arts research, teaching, public programming, and the creation of site-specific artworks that highlight the state’s cultural and ecological landscapes.

California’s creative capital spans from fashion and film, to agriculture, and technology. “It’s enormous, and I think we’re just starting to recognize that,” Parker said. “The role that art plays within a research institute as creative capital for understanding knowledge is huge.”

Karlic has already seen the impact of this shift in interdisciplinary thinking on students using archives and ecological field research to redefine what arts field research can be. As the director of the Graduate Studies Environmental Art + Social Practice MFA program, she has also seen a growing support network of faculty in the Environmental Studies, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, and Humanities who want to engage with the arts in a more direct manner.

Art is more than just a commodity that belongs in galleries, Karlic said. “I think of these interdisciplinary collaborations as a way of changing the siloed ways of thinking current western culture is structured and addressing some of the most pressing questions of our time with a multitude of perspectives which are in my opinion our only way forward .”

micha cárdenas

An augmented reality video game, a science fiction novel, a 3D-printed conceptual particle accelerator — micha cárdenas’ work transcends mediums, disciplines, and boundaries. As the director of Critical Realities Studio, a hybrid studio/lab for critical theory and art practice, and professor of performance, play and design, and professor of critical race and ethnic studies, cárdenas’ multidisciplinary work focuses on virtual and augmented reality, critical race and ethnic studies, environmental justice, digital arts and media, gender studies, and transgender theory. The questions that unite cardenas’ practice and guide her work come from studying not just science and theory, but also activism.

cárdenas was inspired to create her latest project after reading a 2022 scientific paper stating that just 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming above pre-industrial levels would set off a series of catastrophic ecological tipping points. “It was something I just wanted to shout from the rooftops,” said cárdenas. “It’s important for artists to be doing work about climate change or engaging with different questions in science because most people are not reading scientific journals,” she said, “and I wanted everyone to know that we are on this very dangerous precipice.”

In 2023, cárdenas created The Probability Engine: Using Augmented Reality and 3D Printing to Envision Futures of Resilience to Sea Level Rise — one of 15 projects to receive a pilot grant from the Center for Coastal and Climate Resilience which funds research projects, collaborations, and creative works that address coastal climate-related impacts and solutions. The Probability Engine uses augmented reality to imagine possible realities based on the various degrees of temperature above pre-industrial levels. “With the probability engine, I’m asking, how do we envision futures of climate justice that can help us build resilience, in particular here on the California coast?” she said.

One work in the series is Atlantic Overturning, a 15-foot tall undulating sculpture depicting the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a vast global current that defines global temperatures, carrying warm water from the South to the North hemisphere, and is on the verge of collapsing and reversing as soon as this year. The sculpture debuted last Fall at Toronto’s Nuit Blanche, the city’s annual all-night contemporary art festival that attracts more than 1 million attendees, according to attendance reports, which is a lot of people who are probably encountering this vital issue for the first time, cárdenas said. It was exhibited at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center in October.

Sin Sol similarly interrogates the impacts of climate change via an augmented reality video game cárdenas designed, wrote, and directed. The game won the 2020 Impact Award at the Indiecade festival of independent games. Guided by a trans latinx AI hologram, players can find, see, and hear a story told through poetry about living through climate change-induced wildfires. The work came out of cárdenas’ own experience living through wildfires in Seattle and thinking about how wildfires disproportionately harm certain groups of people, like trans people, immigrants, and disabled people.

cárdenas draws on the lineage of UCSC alum and faculty emeritus Donna Haraway who founded the field of feminist science studies and asked important questions about science itself, like who decides what questions are allowed to be investigated, and what questions get funded?

“Often, science reflects the hegemonic values of society,” said cárdenas. “As an artist approaching science, I can bring different values, like queer and trans liberation or gender and racial justice, to how I think about science, and not be restricted by the influences science is usually restricted by.”

Ari Friedlaender and Rachel Nelson

Professor Ari Friedlaender teamed up with director and chief curator of the Institute of the Arts and Sciences, Rachel Nelson, to create An Aesthetics of Resilience, a multi-year interdisciplinary initiative working with artists from local and Indigenous communities in California to explore how scientists study and communicate the impacts of climate change through the lens of marine mammals. The project includes research, artworks, and a series of exhibitions, the first one exhibited at the IAS in Spring 2025, and is supported by a $2 million grant from the California Climate Action Seed Grant.

The Institute of the Arts and Sciences is an interdisciplinary hub that brings together artists, scientists, and scholars to engage with urgent social and environmental issues. Through exhibitions, public events, acclaimed and emerging artist residencies, and collaborations with UCSC faculty and students, the IAS fosters creative, cross-disciplinary approaches to research and public engagement.

“Science hits a bit of a ceiling if we keep it in our scientific communities,” Friedlander said, “and if we’re interested in studying animals and ecosystems that need protection, we need to be able to communicate our science and the things that we think are important to broad audiences.”

Part of the grant supports Friedlander’s lab in conducting three distinct research projects focused on marine mammals and climate change. PhD student Chloe Liu is working with an Indigenous community in Prince William Sound, Alaska, using underwater microphones to track the timing and distribution of marine mammals based on their vocalizations. This research will help the community understand where animals are throughout the year, how changing environmental conditions impact their movements, and what that means for their ability to hunt and fish these traditional food sources.

Postdoc Natalia Botero-Acosta is tracking migrating humpback whales to better understand how whales use the California coastline, how their migration corridors overlap with human activities like vessel traffic and noise pollution, and how climate change may be affecting their habitats. The third project, led by postdoc Logan Pauline in collaboration with researchers across California, will collect and analyze tissue samples from sea otters, California sea lions, and humpback whales to assess the impact of environmental contaminants on marine ecosystems and the species that depend on them.

Friedlander and Nelson are collaborating with several artists, like Imani Jacqueline Brown, Christine Howard Sandoval, and Carolina Caycedo, who are working with the scientists to create art that reflects the research findings. The result will be a series of exhibitions at IAS.

To Friedlander, An Aesthetics of Resilience demonstrates that there are very tangible ways art and science can work together to create something greater than the sum of its parts. Working with artists allows scientists to unlock from traditionally rigid experimental design structures and ask new and different kinds of questions, he said. “At UC Santa Cruz, we have a lot of freedom to to try new things, to experiment, and to not think of these diversifications as a watering down, but as enhancement of our collective impact.”",https://news.ucsc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Seaweed-Wallpaper-2-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 16:00:12.608170

Heading into President Donald Trump’s second term, coal looked like an industry nearing the end of its life. Utilities planned to retire more than half of the nation’s coal-fired power plants by 2028, no new facilities were coming online, and production had been flat for years.

Trump’s first year back in office has given the industry an opportunity to retrench. The president is an avowed supporter of coal, and his Department of Energy has repeatedly intervened to prevent plants from shutting down. At the same time, a Trump-supported boom in the construction of artificial intelligence data centers has led to a surging need for power, prompting many utilities to postpone coal facility closures.

The combination of federal intervention and rising energy demand may have stalled coal’s decline, at least for the moment. Consumption increased 13 percent last year, reversing a long downward slide and causing a bump in domestic carbon emissions. Of the 11 coal-fired plants slated for retirement last year, just two shuttered. But one of them may return: A Utah facility closed in November after losing its primary customer, but the legislature hopes to save it by finding another buyer. Many of the utilities that committed to shutdowns over the next two years have abandoned those plans.

The administration has combined this effort to prop up coal with delays and rollbacks of rules governing pollution and miner safety, actions central to its heavily pro-coal agenda of “Unleashing American Energy.”

Still, these efforts may not reverse a decline that started nearly 20 years ago. The nation’s aging coal plants — more than 200 in all — are increasingly expensive to run, even as methane, more commonly known as natural gas, and solar become cheaper and more abundant. And although the Trump administration has promised to boost employment, layoffs have continued amid the industry’s ongoing contraction.

Coal may see a short-term reprieve, but experts see little hope of a lasting revival. “When you have to get the government to step in to put its thumb on the scale in order to help your industry,” said Sean Feaster of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, “it’s a sign that you’re not particularly competitive, right?”

Chris Wright, a former fracking executive, has played a central role in this revival by turning the Department of Energy into an industry lifeline. He has issued emergency orders delaying the retirement of at least five of the 11 plants slated for closure, and has renewed them every 90 days. That has sparked legal challenges, drawn scrutiny from regulators, and could saddle utilities and ratepayers with millions in added costs.

Wright argues that keeping them open is necessary to avoid blackouts and price spikes. Few beyond his agency are convinced. Environmental groups, energy experts, and state regulators have accused the department of misrepresenting data in its emergency claims.

“It’s just not justified,” said Michael Goggin, an analyst with Grid Strategies. “They’re grasping at what they can.” He has studied the impact of the emergency orders on behalf of Earthjustice and other groups suing to contest the delay order Wright issued in May for the J.H. Campbell coal power plant in Michigan.

Goggin warns the orders could impose significant costs on utilities. He estimates that keeping all of the various fossil fuel plants slated for retirement through 2028 open could cost ratepayers as much as $6 billion — on top of a $6 billion increase in coal-fired generation costs from 2021 to 2024. He calls the extra expense an involuntary subsidy paid by ratepayers to utilities that neither needed nor requested them.

“You’re making [the utilities] keep these plants that most likely they’re not going to need, and are very likely a waste of money,” he said. While plants like Campbell still generate a positive return from selling power, high maintenance costs make them unprofitable. That’s why many utilities have replaced them with methane or renewables.

Under the DOE orders, plant operators can seek approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to recover these costs from customers. Campbell’s owner, for instance, will spread the expense across millions of ratepayers in the Midwest. Other utilities, however, may struggle. A representative of Colorado’s Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, a rural co-op, said the organization has no idea how it will pay the expenses associated with a federal order to keep its coal plant in northwest Colorado running.

“We have no information available yet on cost recovery,” the representative said. “At this time, there is not a clear path for doing so.”

The Department of Energy did not respond to requests for comment.

Other utilities are postponing closures to meet projected demand from AI data centers. There have been at least half a dozen such delays by investor-owned utilities in the Southeast. The largest of them in Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, and Mississippi have retooled their investment plans over the last two years, pushing planned retirements into the 2030s.

Trump and Wright have endorsed this trend, arguing that coal should play a key role in powering these energy-hungry facilities. In an April executive order intended to revitalize the industry, Trump declared, “Our Nation’s beautiful clean coal resources will be critical to meeting the rise in electricity demand due to the resurgence of domestic manufacturing and the construction of artificial intelligence data processing centers.”

The situation is most extreme in Virginia, which is home to more than 600 of these operations and handles 70 percent of the world’s internet traffic. Experts believe the surge in power demand will force Dominion Energy to import more energy from fossil fuel plants beyond the state, extending the life of polluting facilities in Ohio and West Virginia.

“That region is pretty constrained in terms of supply, so that additional electricity is coming from … additional coal-fired electricity,” said Joe DeCarolis, former head of the Energy Information Administration and now a professor of engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. According to his analysis, “there’s 25 gigawatts of this aging and costly coal capacity that [will continue] to operate to meet the incremental demand that’s coming from data centers” through 2030.

In South Carolina, for instance, the utility Santee Cooper said it would need to push the closure of its Winyah Generation Plant in Georgetown from 2028 to the mid-2030s so it can meet demand from data center development. The plant has received numerous state citations for violating air emissions of sulfur dioxide and has been criticized for operating with expired wastewater discharge permits.

“I think they’re responding to market conditions and political atmosphere, and the political atmosphere is creating the market conditions,” said Marilyn Hemingway, the head of the Gullah Geechee Chamber of Commerce, who lives in Georgetown a few miles from the plant.

Hemingway is a member of a state-mandated transition council overseeing the shutdown of Winyah and Santee Cooper’s other coal assets. She said the utility has repeatedly delayed closing the plant and has yet to decide what energy source will replace coal.

“I’m not naive about this at all,” she said. “I know you have to replace it, but I find it problematic because it’s dragging this transition out.”

Living near coal plants like these may become more dangerous because of Trump’s interventions. Even as the Department of Energy has moved to keep such operations open, the Environmental Protection Agency has rolled back a suite of rules governing their air and water pollution. Over the past year, the agency repealed limits on mercury and other toxic pollutants, scrapped greenhouse gas limits, and extended deadlines allowing coal plants to dump waste, called coal ash, in unlined pits — a move that spared 11 facilities from imminent shutdown. Meanwhile, the Department of the Interior opened 13 million acres of public land for mining.

Emily Arthen, CEO of the American Coal Council, said such regulations were onerous, unnecessary, and contributed to coal’s decline. “Doing the right thing without having to be told is forefront for the industry,” she said, adding that minimal oversight allows the industry to preserve jobs.

Some miners and their families feel the sector hasn’t taken much initiative with regard to worker safety. They are particularly frustrated by the administration’s inaction on a regulation limiting exposure to silica dust, a carcinogen that causes a chronic, fatal condition called silicosis but known more commonly as black lung disease. The rule, finalized during the Biden administration after decades of advocacy, remains stuck in limbo even as the number of cases of the terminal condition skyrockets among young miners.

Vonda Robinson, vice president of the National Black Lung Association, said her only option is to keep fighting. She and her husband John Robinson, a retired coal miner, feel betrayed by an administration whose coal production goals they initially supported. Over the past year threats to mine safety offices and layoffs at the federal agency that runs black lung screenings disrupted protections for miners. Vonda Robinson even wrote to Vice President J.D. Vance, urging him to confront the epidemic. She never received a response.

“If we don’t take care of those miners that’s in there now, we’re not gonna have coal, we’re not gonna have a coal industry,” Robinson said. Her husband, who is awaiting evaluation for a double lung transplant, said he felt abandoned by the industry that fed his family.

“The coal miner’s your workhorse,” he said of the industry’s attitude toward men like him. “When you fall over dead, we’re gonna get another horse.”

Efforts to spur new coal extraction, meanwhile, are faltering. When the Interior Department opened public lands to mining, bids came in below market rate, and three projects in the West collapsed within a month. With no new coal-fired plants planned, the market for thermal coal they burn — much of it mined in the West — remains bleak. So does the market for metallurgical coal, used to make steel, which comprises most coal mined in the Eastern U.S.

Coal mining employment held relatively steady in 2025; the mining workforce stands at around 40,000 workers, less than a quarter of its size in the 1980s. But Erin Bates, communications director for the United Mine Workers of America, warned of trouble ahead. China has stopped importing metallurgical coal used to make steel, undercutting demand for ore mined largely in Appalachia. Overall coal exports fell 14 percent between January and September 2025, and international demand is expected to plateau in the coming years as renewable energy continues to expand; coal power generation fell in both China and India last year after rising for decades.

“It’s something that will trickle down,” Bates said. “The end result is, if they can’t export this coal, and the cost of coal plummets because no one’s buying it, that’s going to mean layoffs, that’s going to mean shutdowns.”

Though one stated goal of Trump’s “Unleashing American Energy” agenda is to “create jobs and prosperity” in extraction and energy production, Harvard labor economist Gordon Hanson doubts the administration’s moves will deliver. What’s actually being built, he said, are gas plants, along with wind and solar projects approved under, and funded through, the Biden administration. Renewable energy generated more electricity than coal power for the first time last year, and Hanson said any effort to revive coal relies less on economics than on nostalgia.

“Many Trump administration policies seem more symbolic than realistic,” Hanson said.

The Novi-based firm said in a notice to Michigan's employment agency that it laid off engineers, managers, technicians and others on Jan. 6. The state didn't get the layoff notice until a week later, but Our Next Energy said it wasn't able to provide the usual 60 days of notice required by federal law due to the unnamed EV customer's sudden departure.

Our Next Energy representatives didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.

On Jan. 7, a day after the layoffs, the company said it was suspending its EV battery investments and would focus on making batteries used for rail, defense and utility-scale energy storage systems instead. It said the changes resulted in a 45% workforce reduction.

The Our Next Energy pivot comes as the U.S. EV battery industry at large struggles with demand that hasn't met expectations. The company, however, sees growing demand in the other areas for domestically-made batteries, which ""is expected to enable cash-flow breakeven by the end of 2026.""

“Our business turnaround in 2025 focused on fundamentals — reducing operational costs, diversifying away from automotive EVs, and securing new purchase orders that demonstrate strong product-market ﬁt,” Founder and CEO Mujeeb Ijaz said in the Jan. 7 announcement.

Our Next Energy originally planned to outfit a large building in Van Buren Township for EV and other battery production, and it was awarded up to $237 million in state taxpayer subsidies for the project. But much of the building remains vacant and is listed for lease. Ijaz told The Detroit News in November that about 50 employees were working on battery cell production in one part of the building, but 60% of the building, originally slated for EV battery production, was being repurposed by the landlord.

As of late last year, the Michigan Economic Development Corp. said it had disbursed $70 million in subsidies for the project. Payments were paused as the agency sought to understand the company's next plans. The agency said Wednesday it has made no further payments to the company.

The company said it's finished retooling to make a new type of lithium iron phosphate battery cells at the Van Buren Township facility. The new type of batteries are ""engineered for extreme operating environments,"" the firm said, for defense drones, underwater systems and deep-sea mining platforms.

Imagine if the most effective climate solutions weren’t coming from Congress or global summits, but from mayors working city by city, block by block …

In this episode, co-hosts Cleo Carney and Victoria Riskin have a conversation with Eric Garcetti, former mayor of Los Angeles and U.S. Ambassador to India — and Victoria’s longtime friend. “I was thrilled to reconnect with my good friend Eric, whom I’ve known and admired since the beginning of his career,” Victoria says. “Eric remains a wellspring of inspiration for me, and even more so when I learned other new things about my old friend in this conversation.”

In this part-interview, part-conversation-among-friends, Eric reminds us to focus on local action, because cities have become the real engines of climate progress, and community resilience and everyday leadership matter now more than ever. He reveals how mayors quietly kept the U.S. in the climate game even when the federal government stepped out, in part because of the rise of Climate Mayors, a coalition that began with a handful of leaders and has since exploded into hundreds of cities across red, blue, and purple states. “I knew the depth of his commitment to human rights,” Vicki says. “But I was so excited to hear how he has galvanized hundreds of mayors in the U.S. and the world to work together on the climate in their communities … sharing ideas and supporting one another.”

We also explore how practical, local solutions cut through partisanship, the global climate crossroads in India, L.A.’s vision for the first carbon-reducing Olympics, and the emotional side of leadership: courage, joy, and staying connected to community during moments of crisis.

Transcript

Hosts: Victoria Riskin and Cleo Carney

Guest: Eric Garcetti

Eric Garcetti: Most pollution out of a gas-powered car really comes from the acceleration at a stoplight. By having roundabouts, there's a huge reduction in emissions. They also work better for traffic, by the way. That's not Democratic; that's not Republican. We used to joke that there's no such thing as a Democratic or Republican pothole. There really isn't when it comes to climate resilience, despite climate deniers and people trying to make it partisan.

Victoria Riskin: Hi everyone. Welcome back to the Bluedot Living podcast, where we imagine if people were actually making progress on climate change because they are. Every episode we talk to great people in the trenches doing big and small things to make a difference. As you just heard, today we'll be talking to former L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti. Imagine if mayors around America or around the world shared ideas of how to address climate change on the ground in their community.

I love Eric Garcetti. He was a great mayor for Los Angeles for nine years, and then he was U.S. ambassador to India, where he was wildly popular. Before he left, he built an amazing coalition of hundreds of mayors across the United States to work on climate resiliency and then went global, bringing together mayors from cities like Paris, Mumbai, and Boston to tackle climate solutions. We know action has to happen locally. And not least of all, he's a devoted father and husband. That's important too. Alright, let's do it. As always, I'm Vicki Riskin, founder of Bluedot Living.

Janet Kraus: She is so humble. Founder of Bluedot Living, founder of this incredible movement, frankly. I'm so proud to be here with you, Vicki. I'm Janet Kraus. I'm a serial entrepreneur, I'm a coach of CEOs and growing businesses, and I'm a board member of Bluedot. I'm so excited for our podcast.

Ally Giebutowski: Hi everyone. I'm Ally Giebutowski. I am a Bluedot intern, and I am also a freshman at Lafayette College. I'm studying environmental studies and economics. I'm also the daughter of Janet Kraus.

Cleo Carney: Hi guys. I am Cleo Carney. I actually began working for Bluedot Living in high school, and now I'm a sophomore at Harvard studying social studies with a minor in economics. I continue to work for Bluedot Living. I'm also on the board of Bluedot Institute, so I love the Bluedot-verse.

Janet Kraus: The Bluedot-verse?

Ally Giebutowski: Oh, that was…

Janet Kraus: The Bluedot-verse!

Victoria Riskin: Yay. Good for you.

Cleo Carney: I'm trying to stay hired.

Victoria Riskin: OK, we'll see about that because now we need to battle it out to see who's the one to interview our guest, my longtime friend, Eric Garcetti.

Janet Kraus: All right. Now let me just say it. I think it's great that you really like him and that he's your pal, but I don't think you're right to interview him. I think it is me. I think you are crazy and do so many things. This guy is everywhere and feels so right. I'm excited to talk to him.

Victoria Riskin: Yeah.

Janet Kraus: Battle me out for it, girls.

Ally Giebutowski: Well, here's what I'll say. I'm nervous; he's a mayor. I'm 18. Do I have the capabilities to talk to a mayor? But because I feel that way, because I'm a little bit scared about it, maybe that's important. I need to lean into my discomfort. So that's my stake. That's why I feel I need to face that challenge.

Cleo Carney: Well, what I will say is I definitely think Vicki can't interview him alone because she is a great friend of his, and there might be some bias there. However, I do think Vicki, being a good friend of his, will know where to push him, where we can get the most out of him. I would say my benefit, my unique angle, is that I am not American. I have a different perspective on the political system. I grew up in Canada and the UK, so that might be interesting. I've been to L.A. once. However, Ally, you also have a good point.

Janet Kraus: Well, here's the thing I've got going on in my mind. Ally, you're scared of talking to mayors, and I don't know, Cleo, if we're allowed to let it out of the bag, but you talk to leaders of countries on a regular basis. I don't know, just saying.

Cleo Carney: I yell at leaders of countries on a regular basis. “Talk” is too diplomatic.

Janet Kraus: Oh, that's very funny. So is this going to make you … you're not really bound by the normal expectations of how we treat the leaders of cities, states, and countries?

Cleo Carney: Gotta keep them in check.

Victoria Riskin: I just have to make my own case here a little bit. I haven't seen him since he left for India. It's been a long time, and I would just really love to spend time with him. If I can't do it, I'm out of here.

Ally Giebutowski: As in out of Bluedot? Oh no!

Cleo Carney: That's an ultimatum if I ever heard it.

Victoria Riskin: Put it to the vote. Everybody writes on a piece of paper who you think should be the two interviewers. OK.

Janet Kraus: All right. All right.

Ally Giebutowski: Ready? Are we ready?

Cleo Carney: One, two, three. Yay!

Janet Kraus: We don't have to go to war. Look, we're bridging. We're bridging.

Cleo Carney: This was not predetermined at all.

Janet Kraus: No, it wasn't.

Victoria Riskin: Alright, it's Cleo and me, and we're going to interview Eric, and then we'll report back our thoughts afterwards if that's okay. So, hey everybody, stay with us.

Ally Giebutowski: Can't wait to hear.

Cleo Carney: Perfect.

The Interview

Victoria Riskin: Hi. Hey, Eric.

Eric Garcetti: Vicki!

Victoria Riskin: So nice to see you, Eric.

Eric Garcetti: Nice to see you.

Victoria Riskin: It's been so long.

Eric Garcetti: How are you doing?

Victoria Riskin: I'm doing great. Thank you for coming to join us today.

Eric Garcetti: Of course.

Victoria Riskin: The requirement here is that we have dinner in Los Angeles when I come.

Eric Garcetti: Absolutely.

Victoria Riskin: Can you tell the audience who you are? Who are you?

Eric Garcetti: So, I'm Eric. I am a father of Maya, a 13-year-old, a husband, son, and brother. I'm an Angeleno, first and foremost a rare fourth-generation native of Los Angeles, one of the world's great cities. But I'm also a committed activist, urbanist, and artist, somebody who believes in creativity and joy in celebrating our accomplishments and fighting for the values we believe in. I've dedicated my whole life to either human rights or political work, engaging my fellow citizens so that we can break down the idea that there are those who govern and those who are governed, and try to find joy in every single day.

Victoria Riskin: Yeah. And you do it beautifully. I always like to start at the beginning. Eric, if you don't mind, I want to take you back to your childhood. What did you envision for your future?

Eric Garcetti: It's so funny that we always ask that, and it's a very professional and work-oriented question where we identify ourselves by what we do. It's funny, having lived around the world where one of the first things Americans ask, to some degree less so with Europeans, and the further you get away, even not at all, is “What do you do?” It was interesting living in India for the last two and a half years because people might get around to what you do the third or fourth time you meet them. They actually meet people first and then try to figure out what you do.

When I was young, I had some professional ideas, but it was more interesting. I think I had impulses of who I wanted to be, not what I wanted to be. I grew up in a very loving family — half Jewish, half Mexican-American, great-grandson of immigrants — and they impressed upon me the idea that you need to be in and of the world. My parents met on opposite sides of the tracks in L.A. My mom on the ritzier Westside; her father owned a clothing company. Dad was the son of a barber and a meatpacker in South Los Angeles. But they both met at Pan Am Airlines. They raised my sister and me with the idea of traveling not as vacations, but trips. Whenever they had an extra nickel or dime, it wasn't going into a nicer home or a fancier car. It was: “Let's go to China now that it's just opened.” “Let's go to India.” “Let's go to Egypt.” “Let's see Morocco.” “Let's go to Rwanda.”

They impressed upon me that I wanted to be in and of the world. I was trained as a musician; I thought I'd maybe be a musician, maybe an actor, maybe an astronaut. I had no idea. Maybe a baseball player, if I look at my old notebooks. I have been able to do many of those things, and my advice for anybody listening is you don't have to be something. You can do lots of things in life, and you don't have to assign yourself one track. I think this generation knows that you're going to have many different careers, experiences, engagements, and connections. That's probably what I wanted to do as a kid. And so far, so good.

Victoria Riskin: So far, you are doing a fantastic job. It makes me think about how I wanted to be a school teacher or a mom or something. It was a very narrow vision, but I also felt I could see people gravitated to me and that I had leadership skills. Like you obviously have had all your life, Eric. You begin to see you have a much bigger mission, which is to bring people together to do good things.

Eric Garcetti: It's funny, some people call it leadership skills. I think half the people called leaders just have a volunteer impulse. When nobody else says “I'll do it,” you go, “I'll do it.” And they're like, “Oh, you're a leader.” It's just because everybody stepped one step back and you're the only one still forward sometimes.

Victoria Riskin: So you and Amy have fostered seven kids. Can you touch on that?

Eric Garcetti: Yeah, I think a couple more than that, actually, in the end. Thinking of the things you want to do or things you want to be, I never considered growing up what a foster parent would be or what that experience would be like. My wife, Amy, grew up in a family that had halves and steps and some kind of unofficial fostering of siblings. She grew up with a much more fluid understanding of what family was. It was one of her goals. She said, “I always wanted to be a foster parent.”

At that point, I was an elected official, which made things a little bit complicated. But as a city council member, I said, “I've inflicted this life of politics on you. If you want to do this, it's the least I can do to say absolutely.” And it wound up being the best thing that I've ever done in life being a father and a foster parent. It's funny, people distinguish between those two. I think we've just been parents.

Victoria Riskin: Beautiful. Would you mind telling me, when was that first moment when you said, “I really need to focus on climate change?”

Eric Garcetti: I don't know if there's ever been just one. I think my work as an environmentalist started small and just kept continually building without one spiking moment. I think it was when I became an intern in high school at something called the TreePeople. Andy Lipkis is this great hero who transformed everyone's thinking about trees — that trees weren't just trees, they were shade. In a dry area like Los Angeles that has paved over all of our land and water can't infiltrate, they are places that absorb water and create so much good. That transformed me in a very personal way to work around climate and connectivity.

Then I think the real thing that sparked it was my human rights work, which brought us together, Vicki. Looking at the multiple generations of human rights, it started with civil and political, went to economic and social and cultural rights, but then people were talking about third, fourth, and fifth-generation rights — group rights, Indigenous rights, and environmental rights. The idea that connection to the environment was a human right.

I spent two summers that were very formative. When I graduated from college and as I was studying for my master's in human rights and international law, I was in the jungles of Burma working with the democratic resistance. They had risen up and were about to overthrow the government democratically, but the government started killing them, mowing them down, and imprisoning them. They fled to the jungles, where ethnic minority groups had for a long time been in conflict with the central government. Living there in the jungle, I came across some Greenpeace people and others working on the environment in one of the last remaining countries that still had amazing teak reserves, which unfortunately have been decimated in Burma. I saw that impact on climate.

The last thing I'll say is I was also really lucky to try to take the easiest science class I could take at Columbia. It was called “Design and Maintenance of a Habitable Planet” and was taught by Wallace Broecker — Wally. He was the professor who coined the term “global warming.” I took that class when the first U.N. scientist report came out on global warming. When I look back, I still have my book and notes from that class. That changed everything for me. He's passed away now, but Wally's predictions of what would happen with the rising heat of the Earth have come within 0.1 or 0.2 degrees; they have been exactly on time. The good news is he predicted we will curve that down. The question for all of us is when. But that was so far ahead of its time, before people were commonly using the terms global warming and climate change. That certainly had a huge impact.

Victoria Riskin: Powerful how a teacher can have such an important impact on a student for the rest of their lives.

Cleo Carney: I've just finished my first year and I've taken some courses that have changed the way I've thought about life and society. University is an amazing experience. We are very fortunate, particularly in the States where higher education is of such high caliber. But I want to shift from your time as a student to your time as the mayor of Los Angeles. In that capacity, you started the Climate Mayors. First of all, if you could explain to our audience what that is, that'd be great. And then we'd love to know, where did that idea come from and how did you actualize it?

Eric Garcetti: Thank you, Cleo. To me, one of the nicest things in life you can do is to work with others to start something. I started a couple of organizations in college; some of them survived, some didn't. I've done that as a city council member and as a mayor. One of the best feelings in life is to come back to something. By the way, if you find something, don't stick around forever. Pass it on to the next generation. One of the most satisfying feelings you can ever have is to have had a hand in starting something that others then take forward.

Our world needs a lot more institutions and structures than we do today. Most of our activism is like, “OK, I tweeted something, I made a comment, I'm done for the day.” It's armchair activism as opposed to real-world action. Climate Mayors was something that came out of three of us who were mayors: the mayor of Houston, the mayor of Philadelphia, and myself. We saw a need for work across cities. I love mayors, I love cities, and I love the sub-national level because it moves so quickly. There's a joke we make: “Good mayors borrow, great mayors steal.” Constantly, whether you're in Mexico City or Topeka, you're looking at the sidewalk, the bus line, the architecture of the buildings, and you're like, “I want to take that. I want to do that. Tell me how you did that.” I remember talking to a mayor in the South, I think in Alabama, who set up a system for reading because literacy rates were low. In all the restaurants, there were just kids' books when you came in. Kids could read them and then take them if they wanted. The library moved to the restaurants. Things like that are just so smart.

Climate Mayors came out of that. The three of us were very committed to bringing together a nonpartisan, bipartisan, tri-partisan group of mayors who would be focused on solutions. We brought our buying power together to purchase electric vehicles when those were still new and expensive, helping smaller towns that didn't have the buying power to get the same price as a big city. We looked at how we could begin to count our carbon — both of the people in our city and of the operations of our governments — and set goals to do the hard work necessary to arrest the damage.

It isn't just about science and carbon reduction; it's about real communities. What do we do when there are fires? What do we do with floods? How do we prepare communities to be resilient and adapt? We started as a few dozen mayors. Then when President Trump was elected the first time and said the U.S. would be the only country to withdraw from the Paris Accords, I was in Madison, Wisconsin, giving a speech. Instead of crying in a corner, we decided to pick up the phone and start calling. That day we went from a few dozen to over a hundred members. The pitch was this: “If he says we're out, then as a country we're going to be in as communities.” Within a week we had two or three hundred. We were getting calls from mayors saying, “My constituents are harassing me. Why haven't I signed on to Climate Mayors?” By the end, we had mayors from 49 states. Democrats, Republicans, independents — over 737 mayors and cities have now signed on to this. It's become this force for good, to play defense in times like this, but also to be on offense together when we have those opportunities.

Victoria Riskin: So many of the problems that people are going to be facing are very local, and they have to be dealt with on a local basis.

Cleo Carney: I took a climate course last semester where we learned all about state and local solutions and how those can blossom on a larger scale. What came to mind for me when you were talking about the original coalition being bipartisan is: How did you overcome some challenges that inevitably came up? We want to learn from past successful initiatives to hear about how we can continue to work together with anyone of any political ideology, particularly on matters of climate.

Eric Garcetti: Constituents want to not be harmed. They want to be safe. The greatest threats, besides things like poverty and crime, are usually the disasters that come from and are accelerated by climate change or the suffering of living through extreme heat. When I lived in New Delhi serving as ambassador for the last two years, New Delhi hit a new high. It was 125 Fahrenheit one day with close to 100% humidity. We had the most rain, the most pollution, and the most heat that city had ever experienced, all in a single year.

Those practical things bring the conversation back to what this is really about: human survival. Then there's a whole bunch of geeky stuff. We had a Republican mayor who was part of the Obama task force on climate with me, Mayor [James] Brainard in Carmel, Indiana. He became the go-to guy on roundabouts. Roundabouts are used all around the world, but not really in the U.S. The most pollution out of a gas-powered car really comes from the acceleration at a stoplight. By having roundabouts, there's a huge reduction in emissions. They also work better for traffic. That's not Democratic or Republican. There is no such thing as a Democratic or Republican pothole. Bring those conversations back to what a sea wall in New York or Miami has in common; people will lose their homes otherwise, regardless of whether it's a red or blue state.

Victoria Riskin: Yeah. I think that's what's exciting: there are ways that people can feel bonded and find solutions. At Bluedot, we try very hard not to be political, but that doesn't mean we don't focus on policy. That's a different matter.

Cleo Carney: You brought the bid for the 2028 Olympics to Los Angeles. Can you tell me what that means for the city and how that fits in your vision for the climate future of Los Angeles?

Eric Garcetti: We're an Olympic-crazy city. We're now going to join London and Paris as the only cities to host the Olympics three times. We've always been “games changers.” In 1932, it was the first profitable Olympics, the first Olympic Village, and the first photo finish. In 1984, the model was broken; the Montreal Olympics had almost bankrupted them. We brought private sponsorship and showed how the Olympics could be sustainable, earning $350 million in profit. We put that into a foundation that has funded youth sports ever since.

When we came back to this, it was actually my first day as mayor. The first letter I wrote on anything was to the U.S. Olympic Committee saying we want to host. I was 13 when it came in 1984. The civic pride and the way people volunteered was unforgettable. Environmentalism really won us the bid this time. We looked at the Olympic Village; usually, everyone builds housing that turns into dorms or family homes, but they build subway lines that aren't used afterward. Places like Athens and Rio have empty venues.

We said, “Let's take all that off the table. Let's do the most sustainable games by using what we already have.” Nothing permanently new will be built. We'll do temporary stuff that will be recycled. For the athletes' village, we'll use the dormitories at UCLA where students already are. We're going to see not only the first carbon-neutral games but the first carbon-reducing games. We'll show what a green sustainable model can be. Paris went first in 2024, and we were given 2028. We're going to take the profit and put it back into sustainable communities. Environmentalism isn't just about carbon; it's about communities that thrive. In too many communities in Los Angeles, kids don't have access to a park, a coach, or uniforms. Our vision is to make sustainability about greening those communities to make them healthy too.

Victoria Riskin: It's so exciting. My mother was at the 1932 Olympics, and I have a picture of her sitting next to Amelia Earhart. If that's not a blast from the past!

Eric Garcetti: That's incredible.

Cleo Carney: This last Olympics, break dancing was there for the first time. Vicki, do you have any…

Victoria Riskin: Yeah, we heard a rumor. Well, first of all, Eric, you loved your time in India. There's no question. I saw your love letter to India, which was so beautiful. It's clear you love the culture. However, we also saw a clip of you doing some I don't know, do you call it break dancing? Could we run that clip?

[clip of Eric Garcetti dancing]

Victoria Riskin: What ambassador does this? I don't think anyone in the history of ambassadorships has done that.

Cleo Carney: Sorry, Eric, we didn't tell you we were going to share this.

Eric Garcetti: Oh yeah, that's bhangra dancing and some Hindi film dancing. We stole some moves. I didn't even know this was ever going to be on the internet. There's a big celebration every year for Diwali at the U.S. Embassy. It was a really great way to connect with Indian people. It's tough to be in the public light; it's a pretty merciless place to be. I tell young people who want to go into politics to really consider it hard. But on the flip side, if you can figure out a way to be active, make sure you connect with people. Don't be a formal elected official; don't be somebody who doesn't show your heart.

Victoria Riskin: I was visiting the Indian Embassy in Washington under Biden, and I said to somebody, “What do you think of your American ambassador to India?” And he said, “Oh, we love him.” They pulled out a little video you had done. It was very funny. But I think, Eric, you just took off all the artifice about that position and were able to connect heart-to-heart.

Eric Garcetti: India is a tremendous place for our climate work, to both learn from and work with. By some measures, 40% of the delta of carbon change in the next 20 years will happen in India. If we do it right, we can help India and India can help itself. There's a lot of opportunity technologically and energy-wise if they can produce low-cost green energy.

Then there are also incredible environmental assets like the Himalayas. There's a great Himalayan forest that is second only to the Amazon; we should be collectively enhancing this green lung of the Earth. I talked to women in my first month in the western state of Gujarat, in Ahmedabad. There's an organization called SEWA, the Self-Employed Women’s Association. I was talking to a bricklayer, and she said, “It's so hot here now that even with my gloves on, I can't hold the bricks, and I don't know how I'm going to support my family.” It was women's work, environmental work, and anti-poverty work all coming together.

The flip side is, a foundation from the U.S. helped do something where there's insurance now for those workers. On days that it's too hot, they get paid. Their family doesn't have to worry when they're living paycheck to paycheck. We know these are predictable things. Let's get insurance for those days. That kind of creativity is coming out of India.

Victoria Riskin: And do you feel like there's support at the highest levels of the government in India?

Eric Garcetti: The goals are slower there, but their point is that they have further to go, and they're still growing. India is adding population. There's really no country besides the U.S. where there's any debate about climate change. So even in India where they produce coal and refine oil, they are doing both at the same time. People from the outside say “stop doing that,” and it's true, we need solutions so they don't add coal on top of renewables. Renewables are almost 40% there now in capacity. We need to help with battery technology, water batteries, and even nuclear power plants. I grew up thinking it was bad, but technologies now are there; it's one of the few zero-emission technologies that can replace coal in a steady-state way. It's going to be challenging because they are going to add almost another America to their population.

Victoria Riskin: You came back to Los Angeles after big swaths of Los Angeles had burned from climate change. People you and I know lost their homes. How are you processing that?

Eric Garcetti: It's devastating. We have to take these moments as wake-up calls. I'm now working as a C40 Ambassador and with the Global Covenant of Mayors, representing cities and regions in climate negotiations. Three-quarters of those cities are on track or ahead of Paris science. If cities can do this and they're complex and political, so can countries. When people get depressed, I would say if we had done nothing, we would be on track for a four-degree rise. We're on track for a two-degree rise right now. That's too much, but it shows human beings actually have power.

Cleo Carney: Yeah.

Eric Garcetti: I think it's time for us to feel that power we have.

Victoria Riskin: Yeah. Take it in, adjust, and help each other. Help your neighbors. This has been a wonderful conversation, Eric. Cleo and I have one closing question for you. Our podcast is called “Imagine If,” and I'd like you to fill in the blank. Imagine if… do you have an “Imagine if” you would share with us?

Eric Garcetti: It's a small one and a personal one. I imagine if you found joy in every day and felt your power every day. We're living through a moment with so little joy where people feel powerless. Do something and smile at something. Today you will feel that joy and power. If everybody did that, we would feel collectively in a very different place, and our ambition would soar.

Victoria Riskin: Absolutely. A perfect closing because that's exactly what we need right now. A great medicine.

Victoria Riskin: All right, so Cleo, what did you think of my friend Eric?

Cleo Carney: Well, first off, I thought he was lovely. He was so sociable and interesting and really a humble person. But I had three main takeaways. The first was about our scope of action. I really liked how he talked about us hitting two degrees of warming instead of four degrees. While that's still warmer than we would like, it shows how much impact our small daily habits can have. We're making a change even if we don't feel like it's necessarily fast enough.

Victoria Riskin: Right. He's basically saying things would be much worse if we didn't do the things we have been doing. So we have to do those things and more.

Cleo Carney: I couldn't agree more. One of my other takeaways was about action — that we can come together. When there are wider issues at play, like the Climate Mayors coming together after the U.S. pulled out of the Paris Accords, it shows that individuals have advocacy. Whether you're a mayor or an everyday person, together we're strong.

Victoria Riskin: Together you're strong. I like that. I love the fact that even though it was disappointing that they pulled out of the Paris Accords, it mobilized a bunch of mayors who said, “OK, let's jump in.”

Cleo Carney: Yeah, I couldn't agree more. And so, Vicki, now it's your turn to be on the hot seat. What is your third and final takeaway?

Victoria Riskin: Well, I thought it was pretty interesting that they put so much time and thought into how to decarbonize during the Olympics. That's exciting, and it led me to think about how we can decarbonize in our own little orbit. And of course, I loved his “Imagine if.” Imagine if we found joy in every day, especially since we're going through so much in the country right now. That really touched my heart.

Cleo Carney: I couldn't agree more.",https://bluedotliving.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/eric-garcetti-imagine-if-1024x1024.png,N,,2026-01-21 18:00:26.372739

Data centers evolved and expanded quickly, with few checks, says Abe Silverman, an assistant research scholar at Johns Hopkins’ Ralph O’Connor Sustainable Energy Institute.
Virginia was an early adopter and now hosts the largest cluster of data centers in the country, with 663 operating and nearly 600 more planned.
Data centers need just as much energy to cool down as they do to run their computer systems.
How AI will reshape society remains an open question, but how its data centers will reshape our energy system is no longer theoretical.","Merriam-Webster’s word of the year for 2025 was “slop”: low-quality, AI-generated content. That feels apt.

If the public wasn’t fully aware of AI when it entered the lexicon roughly three years ago, it is now impossible to miss. AI-created commercials aired during the NBA finals. Google pushes Gemini into searches. You can’t miss the scourge of anthropomorphized polar bears and cute “amphiblets” on social media feeds. At least 35 million people pay for pro subscriptions to OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

There’s a real argument that AI will unlock advances across science, technology, and business. But this brave new world of 12-fingered, AI-generated images and deepfake videos is coming at a steep cost to our pocketbooks—and our environment.

Americans got a collective reality check last year when electric bills soared across the United States. Those rates are still climbing, and a central culprit is what’s driving AI, cloud storage and crypto mining: data centers.

There are now roughly 4,000 data centers operating across the U.S., with another 3,000 planned or under construction.

They exist in every state, often hidden in plain sight—warehouses on former farmland in Ohio, unused office buildings in downtown Los Angeles, shuttered malls in Louisiana. You might not notice them, but you’re paying for them.

Nationally, average electricity rates have risen more than 30% since 2020. In 2025 alone, bills climbed faster than the national average in Virginia (13%), Illinois (16%), and Ohio (12%)—all states with heavy data center concentrations.

Data centers evolved and expanded quickly, with few checks, says Abe Silverman, an assistant research scholar at Johns Hopkins’ Ralph O’Connor Sustainable Energy Institute.

“A data center can go from [being] a field to [consuming] a city’s worth of electricity in two years. That’s just unprecedented,” says Silverman.

Tech companies have pushed aggressively to scale AI since ChatGPT’s debut, often taking advantage of states and counties that offer tantalizing tax breaks. Virginia was an early adopter and now hosts the largest cluster of data centers in the country, with 663 operating and nearly 600 more planned. Texas ranks second.

The energy footprint is already enormous. In 2023, U.S. data centers consumed about 4.4% of the nation’s electricity—more than the state of New York uses in a year. That demand has exploded: Estimates suggest data center grid demand rose 22% in 2025, and this year could reach nearly 76 gigawatts—enough to power roughly 40% of U.S. homes.

Historically, utilities haven’t judged or regulated how electricity is used. The rates they set per kilowatt hour don’t distinguish between, say, a factory using a huge portion of the grid or a small household.

“Utilities are really deeply ingrained in that they don’t make value judgments over their customers’ use of energy,” Silverman says. “Utilities do not want to be in the business of saying, ‘Hey, you’re just using that electricity to play video games, so you have less social utility than, you know, an orphanage.’”

But data centers may force a reckoning.

President Trump last week took to Truth Social to blame Joe Biden for rising power prices and vowed to work with tech companies so American households don’t foot the bill for data centers. On Friday, governors from 13 states joined Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in urging PJM—the nation’s largest grid operator—to rein in costs.

At the state level, Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger rode cost-of-living concerns to victory last fall, pledging to make tech companies “pay their own way.” Democrats see energy prices as a ticket to voters in this year’s midterms.

Even tech companies are starting to acknowledge the problem. Microsoft Vice Chair Brad Smith wrote in a post last week that it would be “unfair and politically unrealistic” to ask the public to shoulder AI’s electricity costs, and that tech firms should pay for the demand they create.

None of this points to slowing data center growth. In fact, the Department of Energy last fall pushed regulators to speed up data-center connections to the grid. Meeting that demand will mean more power plants.

To power the data centers, some companies are reviving nuclear facilities. Others are building their own gas turbines. States like Georgia are keeping aging coal plants online. Clean energy options could be on the table, but Trump has already fought actively to derail some of the biggest offshore wind options. So, more energy likely means more emissions.

“Increased demand is being met through burning fossil fuels and through fossil fuel power plants, especially gas,” said Michael Cork, a postdoctoral research fellow in biostatistics at Harvard University. “We know that that leads to higher emissions of harmful air pollutants that are directly linked to heart and lung disease.”

In a paper, Cork’s lab found that 56% of current U.S. data center energy consumption was derived from fossil fuels, which generated more than 2% of U.S. emissions in 2023.

What’s even less visible is water usage. Data centers need just as much energy to cool down as they do to run their computer systems. In other words, data centers use lots of clean water.

Some cities are already feeling the squeeze. In The Dalles, Oregon, for example, Google data centers in 2024 accounted for nearly 33% of the city’s water use after tripling consumption in just five years. Facing shrinking reserves, the city is now exploring additional water sources in the Mount Hood National Forest.

How AI will reshape society remains an open question, but how its data centers will reshape our energy system is no longer theoretical.

Last year might have been the year of “slop,” but hopefully 2026 is the year of action—before the costs and emissions rise beyond recognition.",https://atmos.earth/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ca-raha-allaroundus016_hor-1280x719.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 15:03:35.186571

This award is part of Press Ganey’s annual ranking of the top hospitals and health systems in the country, according to performance in Patient Experience.

As a winner of the Press Ganey HX Guardian of Excellence Award®, AVALA is in the top 5% of healthcare providers in delivering an excellent patient experience in the last year. Press Ganey works with more than 41,000 healthcare facilities in its mission to reduce patient suffering and enhance caregiver resilience to improve the overall safety, quality, and experience of care.

“This recognition belongs to the people who show up for our patients every single day,” said Joy Melgar, MSN, RN, AVALA Chief Nursing Officer. “Real care happens in the small moments. Taking the extra time to educate and making sure patients feel safe and respected. That’s the experience we hold ourselves accountable to at AVALA.”

AVALA leaders say many patients arrive for surgery with fear and uncertainty, a reality that shapes how care is delivered from the moment they enter the facility. The organization describes its care model as one that prioritizes reassurance, clear communication and patient comfort throughout the surgical experience.

According to AVALA, the facility’s environment is intentionally designed to be calm and welcoming, with an emphasis on minimizing stress for both patients and their families. Staff members are trained to take time to listen, explain procedures and respond to concerns so patients do not feel rushed or overlooked. AVALA notes that family members frequently comment on feeling supported and informed during the process.

The approach, AVALA says, reflects its broader commitment to restoring patient confidence in healthcare by emphasizing comfort, communication and trust as central components of care delivery.

“AVALA is showing what it truly means to deliver compassionate, person-centered care,” said Patrick T. Ryan, Chairman and CEO of Press Ganey. “Their deep commitment to both patients and caregivers is creating a culture where empathy drives action—and where people feel seen, heard, and supported. It’s a privilege to stand beside them on this journey.”

There were 283 electric vehicles registered in Humboldt County in 2025.
“We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating the California electric vehicle mandate once and for all,” Trump said.
Trump similarly tried to curb California’s electric vehicle rules and allow new offshore oil drilling in his first term from 2017 to 2021.
Two weeks ago, Newsom announced in his state budget proposal that he would allocate $200 million to a new electric vehicle rebate program.","In 2012 — when there were about 30,000 electric vehicles on the road in California, Tesla was a small new company that mostly appealed to hobbyists and the hybrid Toyota Prius was still a novelty in many areas — former Gov. Jerry Brown signed an executive order setting an audacious goal: 1.5 million EVs sold statewide by 2025.

There were lots of skeptics, given that Brown was calling for a 50-fold increase in the status quo. But, as it turned out, California achieved it easily.

With the final sales numbers tallied for 2025, more than 2.5 million electric vehicles have been sold in the state since 2012, according to data released Tuesday by the California Energy Commission.

“We invested in this future when others said it was impossible,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement.

Newsom highlighted the number — 2,551,121 to be exact — during his appearance Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

For the past two decades, California has led the nation in electric vehicle sales. The state has provided rebates, tax credits and other incentives as part of its efforts to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases.

As technology has improved, allowing much farther battery range — with many models able to travel more than 300 miles when fully charged — EV sales now make up 22.9% of all new car sales in California. Santa Clara County has the highest rate in the state, with 41.1% of all new vehicles sold being electric in 2025. There were 283 electric vehicles registered in Humboldt County in 2025. Teslas account for nearly 23% of the vehicles purchased locally.

But electric vehicles face major headwinds. President Donald Trump has reversed or blocked many of the federal incentives put in place by former President Joe Biden.

This past year, Trump and Republicans in Congress eliminated the federal tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of new electric vehicles. They let a law expire that allowed states to permit solo EV drivers in carpool lanes on federally funded highways, ending that perk nationwide.

And in June, Trump signed a resolution blocking California’s first-in-the-nation regulations banning the sale of new gasoline-powered passenger vehicles by 2035, which Newsom had put in place in 2020.

Trump held a White House ceremony June 12, saying California’s rules limited consumer choice. He revoked federal permission for the ban, called a “waiver,” that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had given to the state when Biden was in office.

“We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating the California electric vehicle mandate once and for all,” Trump said. “They said it couldn’t be done. It’s had us tied in knots for years. They passed these crazy rules.”

Republicans said California’s rules were overly broad and would effectively set a national standard because the state is the largest car market in the United States and, under the Clean Air Act, other states are allowed to copy its rules.

Environmental groups and Democratic leaders said Trump’s rollbacks will lead to more air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and health problems for Californian residents.

Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit over the issue minutes after Trump acted. California was joined by 10 other states — Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. The lawsuit is pending.

In the months since, several large automakers have pulled back on some EV models. In December, Ford announced it would cease production of its all-electric F-150 pickup truck, and would focus instead on hybrid vehicles and a new line of smaller, cheaper EVs.

“When the market really changed over the last couple of months, that was really the impetus for us to make the call,” Ford CEO Jim Farley told Reuters in an interview.

In California, 408,731 EVs sold in 2025. That’s double the number from 2022, but down 8% from 2024, when 443,374 sold.

Sales surged in the weeks before Sept. 30, when the federal tax credits expired, and then dropped off in October, November, and December.

Even though two of the top three highest-selling vehicles of all types in California last year were the Tesla Model Y and the Model 3, the other being the gas-powered Toyota Camry, Tesla has seen some softening of sales in the state. Some residents of the blue state, angry that Tesla CEO Elon Musk contributed $250 million to Trump’s re-election campaign and led an effort called DOGE to reduce federal staffing through firings and early retirements, have resisted buying Teslas, put stickers on the vehicles denouncing Musk, or purchased other EVs, like Hyundais, Hondas or Rivians instead.

The Trump administration’s fight over electric vehicle rules stands as one of the major environmental clashes between his administration and California during the first year of his second term, along with Trump’s proposal to allow new offshore oil drilling along the state’s coastline.

Trump similarly tried to curb California’s electric vehicle rules and allow new offshore oil drilling in his first term from 2017 to 2021. But California sued in both cases. The lawsuits were pending when Biden took office, and he reversed Trump’s positions.

On Tuesday, Newsom, who is considering a run for president in 2028, cast Trump’s resistance to electric vehicles as putting the United States at a competitive disadvantage in a world where Europe, Japan, Canada, China, and other countries have passed similar laws to encourage the sale of electric vehicles, reduce oil consumption and phase out the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035 or 2040.

“While Washington now cedes the global clean vehicle market to China, California is ensuring American workers and manufacturers can compete and win in the industries that will define this century,” Newsom said.

Two weeks ago, Newsom announced in his state budget proposal that he would allocate $200 million to a new electric vehicle rebate program. Details, including how much motorists will receive, which cars are eligible and what income limits may apply, have not yet been finalized.

“California isn’t slowing down, we’re still leading the pack,” said California Air Resources Board Chair Lauren Sanchez. “It’s not just about clean air, it’s smart economic policy.”",https://www.times-standard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/LDN-L-TESLA-DINER-0725-DC-4.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2026-01-21 15:03:27.226283

OBBBA boosts growth over the long run primarily by extending the expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), including lower income tax rates across five of the seven tax bracketsA tax bracket is the range of incomes taxed at given rates, which typically differ depending on filing status.
In a progressive individual or corporate income tax system, rates rise as income increases.

The permanent features of OBBBA, primarily the extension of TCJA’s pro-growth tax cuts, put the economy on a sound footing.","The US economy is on a tear lately, boosted by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s (OBBBA) income taxA tax is a mandatory payment or charge collected by local, state, and national governments from individuals or businesses to cover the costs of general government services, goods, and activities. cuts signed into law in July but undercut by the administration’s erratic and punitive tariffTariffs are taxes imposed by one country on goods imported from another country. Tariffs are trade barriers that raise prices, reduce available quantities of goods and services for US businesses and consumers, and create an economic burden on foreign exporters. policy. While the net effect is positive, it appears much of the economy’s surprising strength over the last year and in recent forecasts is coming from the boom in artificial intelligence (AI). Over the long run, OBBBA’s permanent extension of lower marginal tax rates on work, saving, and investment lays a solid foundation for stronger economic growth.

The economy has substantially outperformed most forecasters expectations over the last year, with real GDP growth averaging 2.5 percent in the first three quarters of 2025 versus 2.0 percent in the baseline projection provided by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) at the beginning of the Trump administration. The Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank currently estimates real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2025 will hit 5.3 percent, which (if it holds) would result in an average growth rate of 3.2 percent for 2025 compared to CBO’s forecast of 1.9 percent. Many economists attribute this outperformance in large part to AI, including capital expenditures on data centers, as well as a wealth effect from a rising stock market leading to higher consumer spending. For instance, Barclays estimates that about half of growth in output in the first half of 2025 came from AI spending.

Forecasts for 2026 are also looking up. In the December meeting of the Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee, the median forecast for real GDP growth in 2026 was 2.3 percent, up from 1.8 percent in September’s meeting and 1.7 percent projected for 2025. This comes close to matching CBO’s latest forecast (released January 8th) of 2.2 percent growth in 2026, up from 1.8 percent in CBO’s estimate from a year ago. CBO expects growth to taper in both 2027 and 2028 to 1.8 percent annually.

CBO notes that OBBBA “spurs additional economic activity” in 2026 that is “partially offset by the effects of higher tariffs, which continue to weigh on trade flows and economic growth, and by changes in immigration policy that slow labor force growth.” In 2027 and 2028, “growth is supported by increases in the labor supply and in investment that result from the 2025 reconciliation act and by the positive effects on productivity stemming from the adoption of generative artificial intelligence. Those factors are offset by other forces, including the fading of the reconciliation act’s boost to aggregate demand and the slower growth in the labor force due to reduced net immigration.”

Our modeling of the economic effects of OBBBA and the Trump tariffs are consistent with CBO’s analysis. We estimate that OBBBA will boost GDP by 1.2 percent in 2026, 1.4 percent in 2027, and 1.5 percent in 2028, before trailing off to an increase of 1.2 percent over the long run. The initial surge is due to temporary tax cuts that expire over the next four years, including tax deductions for overtime and tipped income as well as expensing for factories and other buildings used in manufacturing and production. OBBBA boosts growth over the long run primarily by extending the expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), including lower income tax rates across five of the seven tax bracketsA tax bracket is the range of incomes taxed at given rates, which typically differ depending on filing status. In a progressive individual or corporate income tax system, rates rise as income increases. There are seven federal individual income tax brackets; the federal corporate income tax system is flat., expensing for short-lived assets (bonus depreciationDepreciation is a measurement of the “useful life” of a business asset, such as machinery or a factory, to determine the multiyear period over which the cost of that asset can be deducted from taxable income.

These are supply-side effects that boost labor and capital, resulting in a 0.7 percent increase in the capital stock, a 0.4 percent increase in wages, and a rise in hours worked equivalent to 938,000 full-time jobs. It does not reflect any increase in aggregate demand that may arise from “putting more cash in people’s pockets,” such as through higher tax refunds, which many analysts emphasize.

The effect of the new tax cuts will be muted to the extent taxpayers are uncertain about how the new rules work. While the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service continue to issue guidance, there remains a lack of clarity on some of the key provisions that went into effect in 2025. For instance, taxpayers still await Treasury guidance on the new expensing provision for structures used in manufacturing and production, where there is ambiguity about which assets and which activities qualify.

OBBBA’s positive economic impacts are substantially offset by the Trump administration’s ever-evolving tariff policy. Assuming the current tariff policy remains in place, we estimate it will reduce GDP by 0.5 percent over the long run, shrink the capital stock by 0.4 percent and eliminate 503,000 full-time equivalent jobs. Accounting for retaliation by other countries—which thus far has been less than most anticipated—further reduces long-run GDP by 0.2 percent. The full brunt of the tariffs has not yet taken effect, as importers and other businesses have relied on un-tariffed inventory and delayed price adjustments to account for the higher costs. Furthermore, the policy remains highly uncertain as taxpayers await a Supreme Court ruling on the legality of the tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

As discussed in an earlier post, the tariffs also offset about half of the fiscal cost of OBBBA. However, even if the current tariffs remain in place, debt as a share of GDP will reach a record high by 2028 and continue growing indefinitely, reaching 120 percent of GDP by 2034 versus 117 percent under CBO’s pre-OBBBA baseline. The unsustainable debt trajectory represents the greatest threat to sustained economic growth and by worsening the fiscal outlook OBBBA adds risk to the economic outlook, increasing the potential for higher interest rates, higher inflationInflation is when the general price of goods and services increases across the economy, reducing the purchasing power of a currency and the value of certain assets. The same paycheck covers less goods, services, and bills. It is sometimes referred to as a “hidden tax,” as it leaves taxpayers less well-off due to higher costs and “bracket creep,” while increasing the government’s spendin, or abrupt policy adjustments.

Tax policy developments over the last year have been dramatic, to say the least, but the offsetting effects of OBBBA and tariffs make the net effects on the economy and the fisc less consequential in aggregate. The permanent features of OBBBA, primarily the extension of TCJA’s pro-growth tax cuts, put the economy on a sound footing. It remains a major challenge for lawmakers to address the unsustainable fiscal trajectory while maintaining or improving the ability of the tax code to support economic growth over the long run.

There was a buzz in town in late October when Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, visited, though it was unclear what drew him to Homer City.
It also urged state utility regulators, who are drafting a policy on data centers, to issue one that does not saddle data centers with costs that might “push” them out of state.
“From start to finish, the Homer City Energy Campus will be developed in partnership with skilled local craftsmen and will bring quality, good-paying jobs back to the Homer City community,” Gorman said.
But in Homer City, it’s clear that there’s an appetite for the promise of a new, job-producing industry, regardless of hurdles.","As the September evening inched along, the line of residents waiting their turn for the microphone held steady. Filing down the auditorium aisles at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania, they were armed with questions about a new gas plant slated for their community.

Sitting quietly in the audience was John Dudash. For decades he’s lived in Homer City, a southwestern Pennsylvania town that was once home to the largest coal-fired power plant in the state. The plant, which shares its name with the town, closed nearly three years ago after years of financial distress.

Dudash, 89, has lived in the shadow of its smokestacks — said to be the tallest in the country before they were demolished — for much of his life. At its peak, the Homer City power plant employed hundreds of people and could deploy about 2 gigawatts of energy, enough to power 2 million homes

It was also a major source of air pollution, spewing sulfur dioxide and mercury, both of which pose serious health risks. Today, Dudash wonders if the pollution might have exacerbated the lung issues that claimed his wife’s life six years ago.

The proposed gas plant, expected to be up and running in 2027, will replace the old coal-fired power station, but with more than double the energy output — 4.5 gigawatts of energy. The new plant also will have the potential to emit 17.5 million tons of planet-heating greenhouse gasses per year, the equivalent of putting millions of cars on the road.

And it will serve a new purpose: Rather than primarily sending electrons to the regional grid to power homes or businesses, the new power plant will exist mainly to feed data centers planned on the site.

As the hearing wore on that September night, Dudash, a conservationist, did not stand to speak; instead, he sat quietly, taking mental notes. The next morning, he emailed two staffers at the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.

“First of all, the project will not be stopped,” he began, with resignation. He went on to offer a few caveats — among them, advice about air monitoring.

His letter reached the agency alongside more than 550 comments on a key air permit for the proposed plant, a testament to the project’s complexity. After the permit was approved Nov. 18, Dudash’s prediction began to look remarkably accurate — though the Homer City plant still has about a dozen additional permits awaiting approval before the project can be completed, including one that would impact several acres of wetlands and hundreds of feet of a local stream.

Though it is among many energy sites popping up to power the artificial intelligence boom across Pennsylvania, the Homer City facility is unique for its size, its advertised economic potential — the owners have promised the project will generate more than 10,000 construction-related jobs — and for its likely environmental impact. It has earned the backing of President Donald Trump, who called it “the largest plant of its kind in the world,” a distinction its owners could not verify. There was a buzz in town in late October when Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law, visited, though it was unclear what drew him to Homer City.

“I don’t really trust the people who are coming in to build and run the place,” Dudash said. “I do not agree with the artificial intelligence portion of it.”

“They’re going to have to sacrifice the environment for these jobs,” he added. “In Appalachia, we’ve been doing that for years.”

When the old plant sputtered to a close in 2023, it left the surrounding community — which was built on the local abundance of coal — in search of an economic lifeline. Now, the data center boom sweeping the country brings promise of such a rebirth for communities like Homer City — though this promise is one that some experts say may be less than billed. And, it comes with risks.

The new power plant will be much larger than its predecessor and is permitted to emit more than twice as much of some pollutants as its predecessor did. The data center, or centers, it powers would also consume a tremendous amount of water — perhaps more than its host townships can spare, some fear.

Artificial intelligence requires vast amounts of electricity and has the potential to offer a lifeline to the fossil fuel industry. Though some in the community are sanguine about the promise of jobs, experts say the reality for many living around data centers may fall short. Some are left wondering exactly who the new plant is for — them or some faraway tech companies.

The Homer City project is far from alone in its emergence: The nonprofit Fractracker has identified 39 planned data centers in the works across Pennsylvania. Tech companies like Microsoft and Amazon are moving in, alongside others intrigued by the state’s rich legacy of power production, deep natural gas reserves and generous subsidies. In July, Republican U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick, from eastern Pennsylvania, held a conference in Pittsburgh during which companies announced more than $90 billion in data center investments and related energy infrastructure.

This tech boom largely has bipartisan support, including from Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat who said at a June press conference that he is committed to “ensuring the future of AI runs right through Pennsylvania.” Legislators in Harrisburg, meanwhile, are introducing bills that would both spur the burgeoning industry and give it guardrails.

The extent to which the Homer City facility’s owners have lobbied for supportive legislation is not clear. The company’s lobbying registration with the Pennsylvania Department of State goes back only to January 2025. It has, however, spent at the local level. In November, for instance, the company gave a community nonprofit $25,000 for a holiday food drive. It also urged state utility regulators, who are drafting a policy on data centers, to issue one that does not saddle data centers with costs that might “push” them out of state.

Meanwhile, communities are pushing back and the environmental nonprofit Food & Water Watch recently called for a nationwide moratorium on new data center construction. More than 200 other groups later joined them in making such a plea to Congress. On the ground in Homer City, a coalition of neighbors have formed Concerned Residents of Western Pennsylvania to oppose the project.

The Homer City proposal is the brainchild of the same private equity owners that closed the plant in 2023 — after years of financial difficulty and two bankruptcies. Two firms own close to 90% of the plant, with New York City-based Knighthead Capital Management holding the vast majority of that. It’s part of a wave of private equity investment in the data center industry. In March, the owners, operating under an LLC called Homer City Redevelopment, toppled the plant’s signature smokestacks. A few weeks later, they announced that the plant would reopen with a data center customer, or suite of customers, to be announced as soon as 2026.

Critics fear the new plant will require a lot more water than its predecessor. The supercomputers that data centers house whirr away around the clock, and need to be routinely cooled down. Some data center companies have introduced recycled water into their systems. Homer City Redevelopment has not said if their data center clients will be among them.

In 2014, U.S. data centers used 21.2 billion liters of water, enough to fill nearly 9,000 Olympic-size swimming pools. That number tripled by 2023, with the vast majority of the water consumed by “hyperscale,” or large, facilities like Homer City. In states like Colorado, where water use has, for decades, been meticulously planned and negotiated, data centers are threatening to strain such finely tuned systems.

Dudash, the longtime Homer City resident, is concerned about a similar fate. “I’m not sure how they’re going to handle the water,” he told Capital & Main after the September hearing.

The power plant has, since 1968, been allotted an uncapped amount of water from Two Lick Reservoir, a 5 billion gallon, dammed-off portion of a creek that the plant’s former owners built explicitly for its use.

The power plant shares the water with a utility that serves two local communities — Indiana borough and the broader White Township — as part of a 1988 drought management plan to prevent and respond to catastrophic weather conditions. The borough of Homer City gets its water from Yellow Creek, a tributary of Two Lick Creek, which serves the reservoir and picks up the slack in the event of a drought.

“Should the Two Lick Creek Reservoir be emptied, [the water utility] would not be able to provide sufficient water to protect public health and safety in their service area,” the drought management plan reads.

In 1985, the delicate system between Two Lick and Yellow Creek was strained when the then-Homer City plant drew so much water from the reservoir that it led to a drought. “Had a significant rainfall not occurred … the reservoir may have faced total depletion,” the drought management planreads.

A report from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection shows that the water utility drawing from Two Lick has, in recent years, routinely used nearly half its allotted amount. But critics fear that allocation could be at risk once a data center opens and starts drawing water.

Robin Gorman, a spokesperson for Homer City Redevelopment, told Capital & Main that it plans to leave cooling and water-use decisions to its data center clients, making it unclear how much water will be needed to keep all the computers running, or where that water would come from.

Rob Nymick, Homer City’s former borough manager, who serves as manager of the Central Indiana County Water Authority, told Capital & Main that he is confident local municipalities can share water resources with the planned gas plant. But the data centers could be a different story.

“I do know that data centers do require a tremendous amount of water,” Nymick said. “That’s something we probably cannot provide.”

Nymick said that community officials are operating with “limited knowledge,” and that during the handful of meetings they have held with Homer City Redevelopment, “The only thing that they wanted to discuss is the actual power plant.”

Eric Barker, who grew up in Homer City, attended the September hearing with restrained optimism. “The power plant was a source of pride and is a source of pride for the community,” he said. “There’s not too many large employers in Indiana County,” he added.

But he found little comfort at the September hearing.

The Department of Environmental Protection “seemed woefully, woefully, comically underprepared,” Barker said, citing a response he received to a question about the types of pollutants that would increase under the new Homer City proposal, compared to what was emitted by the old plant. Barker was told the agency would look into it and get back to him.

“Some questions and concerns were raised at the public meeting regarding the plan approval about matters beyond the limited scope of the meeting,” said Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection spokesperson Tom Decker in a statement. “Interested parties are encouraged to look to the DEP’s extensive website, including its community page dedicated to the Homer City project, for resources addressing such questions and concerns.”

Despite the questions that followed, the department, on the whole, signaled satisfaction with the Homer City plant’s air permit application at the hearing. “What’s being proposed is what we consider state-of-the-art emission controls,” said Dave Balog, environmental engineering manager at the department’s northwest regional office.

Environmental nonprofits Citizens for Pennsylvania’s Future, Clean Air Council, the Sierra Club and Earthjustice countered in a 44-page comment on a draft of the key air permit that the application does not incorporate the best tools for mitigating pollutants such as ammonia, which is known to cause respiratory issues and other health risks. The Department of Environmental Protection agreed with Homer City Redevelopment’s analyses of its best available technology, and the permit was granted.

As Homer City’s smokestacks imploded and fell to the ground last March, leaving only a gray cloud, Dudash wondered what particulates might be in the dusty mix. While there were rumors in town that asbestos might be among them, the Department of Environmental Protection told Capital & Main that the site was inspected for the substance before it was demolished and none was found.

Still, coal dust, fly ash and silica particulates are all possible during such implosions, an agency representative said. In the months since, residents have complained of repeated blasts from the site rattling their houses. As of January, the blasts occurred daily.

But the particulates that drift from the old plant during the blasts may pale in comparison to the carbon dioxide emissions the new power plant is predicted to release. The key air permit the Department of Environmental Protection issued to the facility allows it to release up to 17.5 million tons of the heat-trapping gas, like carbon dioxide, per year — the equivalent of putting 3.6 million gas-powered vehicles on the road annually. In 2010, according to federal data, the plant emitted just over 11 million tons of greenhouse gasses. In 2023, when it was operating at a fraction of its capacity, it emitted 1.3 million.

In their comment to regulators, the nonprofit environmental groups said that the carbon dioxide emissions would be triple those of any polluting facility in the state, representing 6% of Pennsylvania’s total emissions. The new plant will emit sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides, two classes of respiratory irritants, but at rates lower than the old plant. The nonprofit Clean Air Council condemned regulators’ issuance of the air permit, calling it a “death sentence.” Along with PennFuture and the Sierra Club, the Council appealed the permit in December.

The owners said the emissions from the new plant will result in a 35%-40% reduction in carbon dioxide compared to the old plant, but the calculation does not account for the new plant’s larger size. Instead, it is per-megawatt hour, meaning per unit of energy generated. Natural gas is less emissions-intensive than coal when burned, but because the Homer City plant will generate more than double the energy of its predecessor, its overall emissions profile is expected to be higher.

As the state grapples with extreme weather events such as flooding due to global warming, locking in carbon emissions is the wrong direction to go, the environmental nonprofits argue. On an annual basis, the plant will be permitted to emit hundreds of tons of respiratory irritants like particulate matter and nitrogen oxides, and dozens of tons of formaldehyde, a carcinogen. It will also emit health-harming compounds like toluene, xylene, and ethylbenzene.

Additional emissions are likely to come from the natural gas drilling that will be required to power the site.

In 2024, Nymick told Capital & Main that the borough was struggling to find a new economic engine. “We’re fighting for our survival,” he said at the time. Data center industry advocates contend that the data center gold rush will be a boon for communities like Homer City, where boarded-up storefronts line the main street.

“For every one job in a data center, six jobs are supported elsewhere in the economy,” said Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy for the Data Center Coalition, an industry trade group, at a hearing in the state Capitol in October.

Sean O’Leary, senior researcher at the nonprofit thinktank the Ohio River Valley Institute, said the reality isn’t that rosy. The average data center employs as few as 10 people and as many as 110, per his own calculations based in part on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The computers inside them can generally run on their own with limited maintenance.

Even in a rural county like Indiana, O’Leary said, “One hundred is a rounding error. It just doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter if they’re paid $200,000 a year. It’s not enough to make a significant change in the status of the local economy.”

In a recent report on the data center boom in natural gas economies in Appalachia, O’Leary said gas-powered data centers represent the combination of “three non-labor-intensive industries” — fracking, power plants and data centers. “Stacking [them] on top of each other does not alter the underlying dynamic which ties them together.”

Ron Airhart, a former coal miner and executive assistant to the secretary-treasurer of the United Mine Workers of America, is more optimistic about the economic potential of the new Homer City facility.

Still, he concedes that it will never be what the old plant was. “Yes, building a gas fired power plant is going to create a lot of construction jobs, there’s no doubt about that,” he said. “But once it’s done, how many actual employees are you going to have working there?”

He quickly added, “But, I’m glad they are doing something with the old power plant there.”

Gorman told Capital & Main that Homer City Redevelopment and its construction partner, Kiewit, are planning to hire from local unions and building trades. They foresee 10,000 construction jobs. They also anticipate the site will create 1,000 “direct and indirect” permanent jobs, including those hired at the facility itself and those brought aboard for supportive positions, such as suppliers.

“From start to finish, the Homer City Energy Campus will be developed in partnership with skilled local craftsmen and will bring quality, good-paying jobs back to the Homer City community,” Gorman said.

O’Leary said the jobs numbers such as those projected by the Data Center Coalition are inflated, similar to the employment projections made before the fracking boom in rural Appalachia. He said such projections are a detriment to communities, in part because taxpayers shoulder the cost of subsidies to attract the industry to the state, such as a sales and use tax exemption for data centers that Pennsylvania codified in 2021. Gov. Shapiro has estimatedthat the credit will expand to about $50 million per year for the next five years.

Local residents are also burdened with rising utility bills. The surging demand for electricity is straining the region’s power supplies, increasing what utilities pay for electricity. New power plants coming onto the grid must install transmission equipment, the costs of which they share with consumers. These economic factors, in sum, could outweigh the benefits of the new jobs the data center creates, O’Leary said.

Earlier this year, the grid operator for the region that encompasses Pennsylvania, PJM, saw electricity prices surge by roughly 1,000% from two years ago. Some of that cost is expected to be passed onto customers.

“We have a problem, and that problem is real, and it is exponential electricity load growth causing exponential price increases for consumers,” said Patrick Cicero, former consumer advocate for the state of Pennsylvania and now an attorney for the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project, at the October hearing in Harrisburg.

“In the context of Grandma versus Google,” Cicero said, referring to older residents faced with high bills, “Grandma should win every day. That should be the policy statement of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.”

Federal and state lawmakers are still determining how and whether to regulate the additional costs that data centers pass onto consumers, including for fees associated with transmission throughout the grid. A bill that would create such a process while establishing renewable energy mandates for data centers is now being weighed by Pennsylvania representatives.

Dennis Wamsted, energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, predicts such costs add complications for data centers, and has argued that their demand as a whole is overblown. Supply chain delays spurred by surging demand for turbines, including thosethat Homer City will be using, could also create additional costs and lag times, he said.

“If there is an AI bubble and it bursts,” he said, “you would have built all this capacity that wasn’t needed.”

Homer City’s owners said the plant is better positioned than others in the industry since it isn’t starting from scratch.

“Much of the critical infrastructure for the project is already in place from the legacy Homer City coal plant, including transmission lines connected to the PJM and NYISO power grids, substations and water access,” Gorman, the spokesperson, said.

Communities on the front lines of these projects would be the first hurt by a project that fails to materialize.

But in Homer City, it’s clear that there’s an appetite for the promise of a new, job-producing industry, regardless of hurdles.

At the September hearing, many in the crowd wore neon shirts with union logos — a signal of the region’s fierce pride in its industrial past, and deep thirst for an economic boon. After an evening peppered with skepticism over the plant, Shawn Steffee, a business agent at the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, stepped to the microphone.

“Everybody speaking about jobs,” he cried, “there will be jobs, and there will be local jobs.”

LONGi Green expects a loss of RMB6-6.5 billion in 2025, down 25-30% from the RMB8.618 billion loss recorded in 2024.
LONGi attributes this improvement to the advantages of its technological routes, which have become the core driver of the company’s loss reduction.
Meanwhile, it leads the industry in loss reduction, with its deficit narrowing by 64-77%, demonstrating the remarkable results of its technological upgrade.
Several companies disclosed that they had achieved varying degrees of loss reduction in the first three quarters of 2025.","While the industry’s deep adjustment continues, the loss amounts and trajectories of the five companies diverge significantly. Tongwei is expected to post the largest loss of the five, of RMB9-10 billion. Notably, it is the only company with a widening loss margin. Pressures across multiple business lines and asset impairments have emerged as the primary drag on its performance.

The announcement indicates that the company incurred an operating loss of RMB7.5-8 billion in 2025, representing a year-on-year increase in losses of RMB1.2-1.7 billion. Within this, losses from the industrial silicon business amounted to approximately RMB900 million, while losses from the cell and module segments grew by RMB1.2 billion compared to the previous year. Coupled with external factors such as the slowdown in new PV installations in H2 of the year and the sharp rise in silver prices, the loss range was further enlarged, along with an impairment provision for long-term assets of RMB1.5-2 billion.

TCL Zhonghuan follows with an estimated loss of RMB8.2-9.6 billion, representing a reduced deficit compared with 2024. However, the company continues to face significant operational challenges due to persistently low prices in the core PV industry chain, poor cost pass-through and mounting pressure from the rising prices of raw materials such as polysilicon and silver in Q4.

LONGi Green expects a loss of RMB6-6.5 billion in 2025, down 25-30% from the RMB8.618 billion loss recorded in 2024. LONGi attributes this improvement to the advantages of its technological routes, which have become the core driver of the company’s loss reduction. Through the cell technology upgrade and product structure optimisation, the company’s profit margins have been restored.

However, the significant price rise of core raw materials such as silver paste and polysilicon in Q4 somewhat weighed on performance, preventing a more substantial reduction in losses.

JA Solar expects a loss of RMB4.5-4.8 billion in 2025, roughly flat compared with the RMB4.65 billion loss in 2024 (representing a year-on-year change of -3.09% to +3.09%). In 2025, the supply-demand imbalance in the PV industry persisted, and end-market module prices remained depressed. JA Solar achieved a phased reduction in losses in the first three quarters, but the surge in raw material prices and pricing pressure in Q4 erased these gains, bringing the full-year performance back to the same loss level as last year.

Aiko Solar, with an estimated loss of RMB1.2-1.9 billion, emerges as the best performer among the five in terms of loss control. Meanwhile, it leads the industry in loss reduction, with its deficit narrowing by 64-77%, demonstrating the remarkable results of its technological upgrade. Focusing on ‘ABC ‘all back contact’ (ABC) cell technology, Aiko Solar saw its ABC module sales more than double in 2025 compared to the previous year, with its market share and brand recognition growing steadily both domestically and internationally. This has driven the optimisation of its shipment mix and improved profitability. Despite remaining in the red due to structural overcapacity in the industry and poor cost pass-through between upstream and downstream, the significant loss reduction validates the correctness of its technological route and lays a solid foundation for future profitability.

In addition to the supply-demand imbalance, cost pressure has emerged as the key factor behind the losses. Several companies disclosed that they had achieved varying degrees of loss reduction in the first three quarters of 2025. However, since Q4, the sustained rise in prices of core raw materials, such as silver and polysilicon, coupled with depressed end-product prices and slumping operating rates across the industry chain, has severely squeezed corporate profit margins.

Judging from the performance of the five companies, the PV industry has been mired in widespread losses for several consecutive quarters, with the cyclical supply-demand imbalance still not being alleviated. However, the trend of corporate divergence has further intensified. Tongwei and TCL Zhonghuan, which reported larger losses, are more directly affected by fierce upstream competition and inadequate cost pass-through in the wafer segment. In contrast, LONGi Green and Aiko Solar have achieved significant loss reduction thanks to their technological advantages.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Tongwei-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 18:00:15.974366

One of the key points of contention in these ongoing legal disputes is a fundamental jurisdictional question: should companies that acted under federal wartime authority be judged in federal court or state court?
If state courts can retroactively punish federal wartime operations, then any company assisting the government in a future crisis—from energy to defense manufacturing—faces enormous legal risk.
Wartime energy production is one integrated national operation—from crude extraction to refining and fuel delivery.
The state’s LNG export terminals at Sabine Pass and Calcasieu Pass, its offshore platforms supplying the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and its refineries stabilizing global markets are critical to national defense.","When America goes to war, its strength depends not only on soldiers and ships but on the partnership between government and private enterprise. From the refineries of Baton Rouge to the Gulf’s industrial corridors, civilian energy producers have long powered U.S. defense. However, that partnership is now threatened by a wave of lawsuits in Louisiana that could weaken wartime readiness and discourage the very companies America relies on in times of crisis.

Over 40 lawsuits – driven in large part by the Pelican State’s powerful trial lawyers – have been filed by several Louisiana parishes in an attempt to hold energy companies liable for coastal damage that is alleged to have arisen from a result of their oil and gas production. But much of the activity they target took place under federal orders during World War II, when Washington directed producers to extract crude oil for aviation fuel. These companies worked under federal authority and in service to the nation. Punishing them decades later for following lawful wartime directives sends a dangerous message: answering the call of duty can lead to financial ruin. This is a national-security risk we cannot afford—and one that must be avoided.

One of the key points of contention in these ongoing legal disputes is a fundamental jurisdictional question: should companies that acted under federal wartime authority be judged in federal court or state court? The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Monday January 12th about this very matter. It is important that they get this question right as the decision will have sweeping consequences for America’s national security.

Louisiana parishes want these cases heard in state court, where state-law claims and plaintiff-friendly procedures give them a strategic advantage. The companies argue that because the conduct occurred under federal direction and involved national wartime procurement, the cases belong in federal court, where questions of federal authority, national defense, and historical wartime directives can be properly evaluated.

This is not just a procedural dispute. If state courts can retroactively punish federal wartime operations, then any company assisting the government in a future crisis—from energy to defense manufacturing—faces enormous legal risk. That reality has alarmed senior American military leaders.

In an amicus brief to the Supreme Court, former Joint Chiefs of Staff General Richard Myers and Admiral Michael Mullen wrote, “From our perspective garnered through decades of service and leadership throughout all levels of our military, it seems obvious to us that suits relating to federally mandated and directed oil production must be adjudicated in a federal forum.” They warned that “the Fifth Circuit’s opinion entirely misses the mark when it holds that production of crude oil is separate from production of refined high-octane aviation gasoline.”

Their point is simple. Wartime energy production is one integrated national operation—from crude extraction to refining and fuel delivery. To suggest otherwise ignores the coordination between the Petroleum Administration for War (PAW), War Production Board (WPB), federal regulators, and private industry that made victory in World War II possible. As Myers and Mullen noted, “The Fifth Circuit ignored the circumstances in which the parties entered and fulfilled these contracts, including federal regulations, PAW and WPB demands, and the end-product contracts themselves.”

The findings of the courts may very well decide the future energy course America will chart. Energy abundance allows the United States to sustain allies, impose sanctions on adversaries, and act without fear of shortages. Louisiana remains central to America’s energy security. The state’s LNG export terminals at Sabine Pass and Calcasieu Pass, its offshore platforms supplying the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and its refineries stabilizing global markets are critical to national defense. But litigation like Louisiana’s coastal erosion lawsuits threaten to curb domestic production, strengthening OPEC’s leverage and giving regimes like Iran and Russia greater control over global energy flows.

The contradiction is clear. While Washington works to rebuild the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and expand LNG exports to Europe, Louisiana’s leadership is suing the very companies making those efforts possible. Potential future conflicts in the Indo-Pacific or Middle East will demand vast quantities of jet fuel and diesel but every dollar spent on litigation is a dollar not invested in new LNG capacity, refinery upgrades, or hardened infrastructure that would be needed to support that effort.

The Supreme Court now has an opportunity to restore balance. As Myers and Mullen warned, “Remanding to state court creates a serious risk that, in the future, private industry will not readily answer the federal government’s call when the nation needs it most.” Confirming that federally directed wartime operations belong in federal court is more than procedural—it is essential to strengthening our readiness.

As Myers and Mullins concluded in their brief “our nation needs private parties to answer the call when asked to use their expertise to assist our national defense.” From the Liberty ships of World War II to the LNG tankers supplying allies today, America’s strength has always depended on its ability to produce energy at home. Louisiana’s lawsuits threaten to break that link. Protecting our future means protecting those who power it.

The funds were originally part of the 2021 Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act signed by former President Joe Biden.

The Trump administration previously attempted to suspend the program but was blocked by a federal court.

Congress is considering legislation that would eliminate $879 million that has been appropriated for electric vehicle chargers, and EV supporters say that will make things worse for drivers who are already anxious about range.

The charger money, which was originally included in the 2021 Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act that was a signature law signed by former President Joe Biden, is part of $2.3 billion in ""wasteful Democrat priorities"" that would be redirected to another priorities, according to Republican leaders on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.

The Biden-era EV charger money has been at the center of legal fights since the start of the second Trump administration in January 2025. The Trump administration initially attempted to eliminate the funding unilaterally, but a court ordered the U.S. Department of Transportation to move forward with the funding that was previously appropriated.

What will the elimination of charger money mean for EV drivers?

Car buyers have been telling pollsters for years that they have major concerns about the battery range of electric cars. The concern has bubbled so often that it has been dubbed ""range anxiety.""

According to new poll released on Monday, Jan. 12 by the EVs for All America group, which is an advocacy group that works with car manufacturers to push U.S. and state lawmakers to adopt EV-friendly policies, 20% of 600 respondents to a poll intended to survey potential EV buyers in 2025 said their top concern about plug-in models is the charger networks being unreliable.

The same poll showed 65% of respondents said they would rather charge their batteries at home for a seven-to-eight-hour period to achieve a full charge, while only 29% said they would rather opt for a 30-minute charge at a public facility that would achieve 80% battery life.

The funding in the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program that was included in the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law that is now on the chopping block was supposed to help fix that. The law included $5 billion in funding for states to boost U.S. charging infrastructure that is set to wind down in 2026. The law also included another $2.5 billion that was set aside for competitive grants that would allow states to build chargers in alternative fuel corridors and under privileged areas.

The funding was hailed at the time as a game changer for the task of building out a nationwide network of chargers that would be placed along federal highways as the Biden administration was trying to boost U.S. EV adoptions.

The U.S. Department of Transportation said in an August 2024 press release that was issued under Biden that the number of publicly available EV chargers had doubled under the previous administration.

The DOT said at that time there were ""over 192,000 publicly available charging ports with approximately 1,000 new public chargers being added each week.""

Will EV adoption suffer if the charger money is eliminated?

The charger money has long been a target of President Trump and Congressional Republicans, along with $7,500 tax credits for EV car buyers that were eliminated last year.

After the elimination of the $7,500 tax credit in September 2025, U.S. EV sales declined sharply.

Carmakers sold more than 1.2 million electric cars in 2025, despite major headwinds in the form of disappearing federal tax credits for plug-in models and tariffs imposed on imported cars and parts.

According to new data released on Tuesday, Jan. 13 by Cox Automotive, carmakers sold 1,275,714 electric cars in 2025, which was good enough to compose nearly 8% of overall U.S. auto sales for the year. But the industry-wide EV sales number was also down 2% from the 1,301,441 electric cars that auto manufacturers sold in 2024.

Cox said the overall EV sales number for 2025 was padded by a rush among car buyers to buy electric models in the third quarter of 2025 before the expiration of the popular $7,500 tax credit. Carmakers sold 365,830 EVs in the third quarter, compared to just 234,171 in the fourth quarter.

What people are saying about the potential charger funding cut

Republican leaders have said all the Biden-era moves to boost plug-in cars amounted to an ""EV mandate"" that Trump promised to repeal on the first day of his second presidency.

Once it was under Trump's control, the Federal Highway Administration in February 2025 suspended the program in one of several actions directed by President Donald Trump to eliminate federal support for wider adoption of EVs by consumers. A federal court in June 2025 blocked the suspension, ruling that the Transportation Department’s move overstepped its authority and attempted to override the will of Congress.

Congress is now attempting to codify the elimination of the EV charger funding in the new funding bill for the Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development.

The Sierra Club environmental group countered that the move to eliminate the federal charger money would imperil efforts to build out the promise nationwide charger network that EV manufacturers have said they desperately need to convince more Americans to consider buying plug-in models.

“Americans shouldn’t be punished for the Trump administration’s attempts to rob states of reliable electric vehicle charging that will benefit our wallets, air, and climate,"" Sierra Club Clean Transportation for All Director Katherine García said in a statement.

""We urge members of Congress to leave this funding alone,"" García continued. ""States must be able to access the full amount they were promised and are relying on as they work to build essential infrastructure in our communities.”","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/NRRS/86751583007-2177843462.jpg?crop=7738,4354,x0,y402&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-21 14:00:40.110462

It’s a huge, lucrative market — comprising around half of new-car sales in the U.S. — but one that few electric vehicles have managed to enter. In 2026, however, that will change. Carmakers are planning to roll out at least six new electric SUVs in the U.S. this year with price tags at or below $35,000, products that could help a ease a slowdown in EV sales.

“EVs have to move more into the mass market and there are launches that are now squarely hitting that,” said Nathan Niese, Boston Consulting Group’s global lead for electric vehicles. “It’s what’s going to prop up what otherwise would be a down year.”

EV sales have surged in recent years, as carmakers improved range and charging speed, while federal incentives helped entice buyers. Relatively high costs, however, remained the last speed bump to mass adoption. Of the roughly 60 electric cars and trucks for sale in the U.S. last year, only three could be had for less than $35,000; the median starting sticker price was $59,100, nearly $10,000 higher than the average price for all vehicles.

When federal subsidies disappeared in September, EV sales swooned. The message for the c-suites of Detroit was clear: Price is at least as important as powertrain preference, if not more. Many auto executives have since slowed their EV plans and shifted some production back to gas-powered models that they can build (and price) more affordably.

“Anything you can do to make a customer feel you’ve given them a more affordable product is an advantage to them right now,” said Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas Public Policy.

The good news for auto executives: a steady drop in battery prices has improved the economics of EVs, opening a lane for small new models.

“The end of the EV subsidies does not necessarily spell bad news across the board,” BloombergNEF analyst Huiling Zhou wrote in a recent report. “Carmakers that can cut costs and offer affordable models in the most desirable vehicle segments are likely to see sustained sales growth.”

Here’s a look at the EVs that will likely find plenty of interest in 2026.

Nissan Leaf

Nissan has long known the sales magic of an affordable EV. Since its debut 15 years ago, the Leaf has parked itself in nearly 1 million households’ driveways and garages, despite its modest range and quirky, hatchback design. For the 2026 iteration, Nissan overhauled the car for the first time in nearly eight years, upsizing it to the SUV category. The end result seems to have shed many of the model’s quirks and compromises.

For one, the new Leaf no longer looks “cartoonish”, according to reviewers. Gone is the near-obsolete CHAdeMo charging port that’s akin to a Betamax videotape, replaced by a traditional CCS charging receptacle on the driver’s side and a NACS port (better known as the Tesla plug) on the passenger’s side. It does retain one important feature of past Leafs: The new model still slips under the $30,000 threshold.

Chevrolet Bolt

General Motors has a similar overhaul in the works for its Chevrolet Bolt, another affordable machine that won a crowd of buyers right up until the company pulled the plug on the model in 2023. Chevy revealed the resurrected iteration of the small SUV in October and it’s set to go on sale early this year. The car looks pretty much the same and the driving range is similar, but the reborn Bolt is powered by a new battery that will cost far less and charge far more quickly than the previous version. The Bolt also has GM’s hands-free driving system — dubbed Super Cruise — and is now capable of bidirectional charging, which means it can provide power in a blackout or whenever else you need it.

Toyota C-HR BEV

The company calls the coming C-HR a “coupe-like SUV.” While the description reads like an oxymoron, it’s one that plays well with US tastes in car design. The machine is big enough for a hefty Costco run, but small enough to park in a compact space. And the new Toyota ride offers nearly 300 miles of range while coming with standard all-wheel drive, which typically compromises efficiency. Toyota teamed up with Subaru to develop the platform for this new small electric SUV, a bit of cost-sharing that will help keep the sticker price around $35,000.

Subaru Uncharted

The Subaru side of the Toyota partnership is the Uncharted, an SUV that will be a little smaller than the brand’s other electric offering, the Solterra. With the base model — starting around $35,000 — buyers can forgo all-wheel drive for about 15 more miles between charges. Among SUV owners, Subaru ranks second in brand loyalty, meaning Crosstrek and Outback drivers waiting to go electric will finally have more than one option.

Kia EV3

Kia has already checked the “medium” and “large” boxes in its EV product line; now, it’s steering for small. The EV3, which is expected to sell for about $35,000, will slide just behind the brand’s EV6 size-wise even as its boxy design echoes the EV9, a bulky, three-row SUV. Kia is also planning to give buyers some unique color choices, from “shale grey” to “frost clue.”

Slate

Cheap EVs aren’t just the realm of incumbents. Startup Slate is swooping in with plans to deliver its first machine by year-end. The company’s first vehicle, which can be converted from pickup to SUV, is to a Ford F-150 what an Ikea futon is to a Pottery Barn sectional. The base version — the company calls it “the blank Slate” — is best described by what it isn’t. It lacks a touchscreen, cooled seats, all-wheel drive and a stereo. What Slate promises in return is a sticker price in the mid-$20,000s.

At the company’s launch event last year, Chief Executive Officer Chris Barman delivered what has since become a bit of a stump speech for cheap EVs. “The definition of what’s affordable is broken,” she said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a7141db/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6548x3438+0+464/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F67%2F05%2Fd6e89b3741ada602592b1fe2bec3%2F1523819-fi-oc-auto-show-ev-demand-gxc-0480.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 13:01:59.710197

Policy makers at the US Department of Energy have their hearts set on restoring coal to a commanding place in the nation’s power generation profile, but the effort is doomed to fail. The domestic coal industry took a hit from natural gas in the early 2000s, followed by a fresh round of competition from low-cost wind and solar, and now it is about to get a drubbing from geothermal energy.

The US Geothermal Industry Is Beginning To Spread Its Wings

If you don’t have a geothermal power plant in your part of the US, join the club. Until recent years, geothermal energy was limited to just a handful of locations concentrated in the Western states, where nature provides economical combinations of heat, rock, and water.

New drilling technology is beginning to open up new territories for geothermal exploitation, and the US startup Zanskar has come up with another way to tease more renewable energy from deep within the Earth. The company has developed its own custom-built AI to find new fields.

Identifying previously unknown fields is just one part of a broader challenge. The other part is to find them efficiently and economically, and that’s where AI comes in.

“We started Zanskar with the belief that AI would have as profound an impact on geothermal cost and scalability as modern drilling technologies have,” explains Zanskar co-founder and CEO Carl Hoiland. “It would do so by enabling us to find more hidden geothermal systems, and to produce more power from each of those systems, than legacy models assumed.”

Follow The Money To The Geothermal Anomolies

Zanskar surfaced briefly on the CleanTechnica radar in 2024, as part of a suite of startups engaged by the US Air Force to plumb for renewable energy on its facilities.

In the latest development, earlier today Zanskar announced a new round of Series C funding to the tune of $115 million, with Spring Lane Capital taking the lead.

“Zanskar is unique in that they have identified more geothermal anomalies in North America than any other company in decades,” Spring Lane Partner Jason Scott says of the company’s AI-driven business model.

In a show of confidence, Series B leader Obvious Ventures also participated in Round C, as did Series A co-leader Lowercarbon Capital.

“While other more costly approaches dig deep enough until heat is hopefully found, Zanskar can efficiently identify and unlock the more than 40 GW of untapped geothermal potential in the US much closer to the surface,” Lowercarbon Capital explains.

“Their precise subsurface vision halves the failure rate and drops drilling costs to $2m per well. Their suite of tools can be used for failing wells (repower), new wells at existing sites (brownfield), and new wells at new sites,” the firm adds.

The list of Round C participants also includes Munich Re Ventures, Susquehanna Sustainable Investments, Clearvision Ventures, Orion Industrial Ventures, Safar Partners, Imperative Ventures, StepStone Group, University Growth Fund, Cross Creek, GVP Climate, Tranquillion, Carica Sustainable Investments, UP.Partners, and All Aboard Fund, among others.

Regardless of the abrupt U-turn in federal energy policy, Zanskar plans to leverage its Series C haul to expand its current operations to multiple locations in the Western US, with the aim of delivering the clean kilowatts before 2030. That easily beats the timeline for constructing new coal, gas, and nuclear power plants.

“This Series C positions Zanskar for rapid growth by enabling the company to advance its gigawatt-scale pipeline through a historic geothermal exploration and development campaign,” Zanskar emphasizes, adding that plans for engaging additional strategic partners and customers are also in the works.

US Air Force Hearts Geothermal Energy

It’s no surprise to see the US Air Force emerge as a geothermal energy supporter. They have been on the prowl for energy resources that can be harvested on site, reducing their reliance on outside resources, including grid-supplied electricity as well as the fossil fuels needed for on-site power and heating systems. The Air Force was an early adopter of solar energy, and now attention has turned to geothermal.

In 2023 the Air Force began planning for two prototype-level projects at Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho and Joint Base San Antonio in Texas, with Zanskar assigned to Mountain Home and the Canadian firm Eavor taking Joint Base San Antonio.

“We are in an era of strategic competition with China, which means that our installations are no longer a sanctuary from the full spectrum of threats,” observed Dr. Ravi Chaudhary, who served as Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Energy, Installations, and Environment at the time.

“We need to ruggedize our installations with redundant energy systems and make use of clean energy sources that reduce our fuel demands,” Chaudhary added. “Geothermal sources strengthen our energy grids and give us the ability to isolate threats before they impact our operations. This type of capability will translate into victory in a high-end fight.”

From The US Air Force To Your Backyard

As of 2023, both the Zanskar and Eavor projects had a long way to go, with feasibility studies to be conducted before construction. In the meantime, though, the Air Force was already anticipating that its early-adopter status would help support a broader uptake of new geothermal systems across the US.

“The use of these technologies has the potential to expand beyond Air Force and Department of Defense installations to benefit communities across the United States,” the Air Force stated.

I’m reaching out to Zanskar to see if any updates are available on the Mountain Home project. In the meantime, the company emphasizes that its new system can also give existing geothermal facilities a fresh shot of adrenaline, as illustrated by the Lightning Dock project in New Mexico.

“We’ve already confirmed multiple large, previously unknown geothermal resources across the Western U.S., and deeper drilling has validated that these systems can produce far more energy than expected,” Hoiland adds.

What’s Next For Geothermal Energy

If you’re wondering how all this comports with the current US focus on fossil energy, that’s a good question. Despite the insistence on “beautiful” coal, in January of 2025, the White House announced that biomass and hydropower are also deserving of federal support, alongside fossil and nuclear energy. In February, Energy Secretary Chris Wright added geothermal energy to the list.

That’s not just Wright’s lips moving. On January 7 of this year, the Energy Department announced its intention to ramp up geothermal activity in Western states and help the geothermal industry expand eastward, with an initial focus on Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawai’i, Idaho, Louisiana, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, and West Virginia.

Last year, El Paso Electric quietly submitted paperwork to the PUC to build the natural gas power plant for Meta.
The Meta power plant would increase the share of natural gas in El Paso Electric’s portfolio.
El Paso Electric CEO Kelly Tomblin told the El Paso Times in 2024 that Meta requires its data center to be powered by solar or other renewables.
“Meta’s Data Center in El Paso, Texas is not obligated to protect local residents,” a Sembrando Esperanza handout states.","EL PASO—In October 2025, local officials celebrated the groundbreaking of a 1-gigawatt, $1.5 billion data center for the tech giant Meta.

El Paso Electric had previously stated that existing infrastructure would support the data center and that Meta was looking to tap into a new solar farm. El Paso gets more than 300 days a year of sun, hence its nickname, the Sun City.

So it came as a shock to many El Pasoans that the electric utility is instead seeking approval for a 366-megawatt natural gas plant, called the McCloud facility, to power the data center. Advocates in El Paso worry that a new gas plant could drive up utility rates, worsen the region’s air pollution problem and set back efforts to transition to renewable energy.

The Sembrando Esperanza Coalition, an El Paso economic and environmental justice group, is calling for the city, county and utilities to terminate their contracts with Meta.

“We were not told that El Paso Electric would be building a power plant powered by fossil fuels,” said Coalition organizer Verónica Carbajal. “To the contrary, we were told that Meta is going green and would rely on renewable energy. When we looked at the contracts ourselves, we realized that was an illusion.”

El Paso, population 700,000, is consistently ranked among the worst cities for ozone, or smog, in the nation. Existing water sources in the desert city are already stretched thin. Another data center, called Project Jupiter, is being developed across the state line in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, and will be fueled by natural gas. Taiwan-based Wiwynn Corp. has also announced a data center in the nearby town of Socorro, Texas. The data center build-out comes as both El Paso Electric and the city water utility are seeking rate increases.

“El Paso Electric’s obligation is to reliably serve every customer who requests service, including large employers bringing jobs and economic activity to the region,” said utility spokesperson Jacob Reyes. “In this case, the customer requested and is funding a natural gas resource as the fastest available option to meet a large, time-sensitive power need. At the same time, Meta has stated that its data center will be matched with 100 percent clean and renewable energy, consistent with its public sustainability commitments.”

Meta has invested in renewable energy projects in states where it operates data centers, including Texas. Meta did not respond to questions and El Paso Electric did not respond to questions about how energy will be “matched” for the new data center.

The data center is expected to employ about 100 people after construction is complete. Agreements with the city only require 50 full-time jobs.

The city has intervened to weigh in on the utility’s application to the Public Utility Commission (PUC) for the power plant. As an intervenor, the city will be able to make legal arguments and file testimony during PUC proceedings for the application. A city spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.

“The company has made public commitments to power their project with renewable energy sources including on-site solar generation, and I think they need to be held to those commitments,” El Paso Councilman Chris Canales told Inside Climate News. “As the data center industry has shifted over the last few years toward larger and more intensive projects, I have definitely started to have a lot more concerns, as I think the public has as well.”

City Deal with Meta Face Scrutiny

The City of El Paso entered an agreement with Wurldwide LLC, a Meta affiliate, in December 2023 to provide financial incentives for a data center on a 1,000-acre property in Northeast El Paso.

The incentive package would abate city property taxes to entice the company to build in El Paso. Under the agreement, if the company invested $800 million, the city would abate up to 80 percent of property taxes for 15 years. El Paso County also offered property tax abatement. The El Paso Times reported these incentives could be worth up to $110 million.

The deal also stated that while the company was exploring alternative energy sources, including solar, it “shall not be obligated to pursue” these energy sources.

Meta subsequently decided to increase its investment to $1.5 billion as the AI industry grew. The tech giant officially announced the deal in October 2025. Once operational, the data center would be the largest power user in El Paso.

Last year, El Paso Electric quietly submitted paperwork to the PUC to build the natural gas power plant for Meta. The McCloud gas plant will be exclusively connected to the data center for the first five years, according to regulatory filings. Then it would be connected to the broader El Paso Electric transmission system. Meta would be responsible for all the costs during the first five years.

The regulatory filing states that large-scale solar and battery storage could “theoretically” supply the data center’s power, but “such an installation would require thousands of acres adjacent to the Data Center site which are not available.”

The filing goes on to say that larger-frame gas turbines could also supply the site but would take too long to procure.

The plant will require approvals from both the PUC and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. If approved, it is expected to be operational by 2027.

The Meta power plant would increase the share of natural gas in El Paso Electric’s portfolio. El Paso Electric has committed to 80 percent carbon-free energy by 2035 and 100 percent by 2045. El Paso Electric did not respond to questions about how it would achieve its carbon-free energy targets while expanding natural gas generation.

As of 2024, the utility supplied 41.7 percent carbon-free energy. Nuclear power, which is non-renewable, makes up 37 percent of that share, while solar contributed only 4.7 percent, according to the utility’s 2024 sustainability report.

“El Paso Electric continues to expand renewable generation, electrification programs, load management efforts and community solar while responding to rapid load growth, evolving policy conditions and customer priorities, particularly affordability and reliability,” the spokesperson said.

While El Paso receives abundant sunshine, the city is connected by pipelines to the Permian Basin oil and gas fields, some 200 miles east. Gas producers see a potential bonanza in the energy demand from data centers.

Matthew Rodriguez, an organizer with the El Paso environmental justice organization Amanecer People’s Project, said that the power demands of the Meta data center represent a “massive step backward” for El Paso Electric’s sustainability commitments.

“This basically wipes out all the progress [El Paso Electric] has supposedly made in the last five years,” he said.

The City of El Paso also submitted a climate action plan to the Environmental Protection Agency in December aiming to cut emissions 50 percent by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050.

Councilman Canales said that the city did not anticipate the utility’s application to build a new gas power plant. “As such, the impact of this newly proposed gas plant is not considered in the Climate Action Plan, and in my opinion it would run contrary to the City’s goals,” he said.

Local advocates are angered by the mixed messages about the data center.

“What’s really distressing about the Meta power plant is the lack of transparency, both from Meta, El Paso Electric and our elected officials,” said Carbajal of Sembrando Esperanza. “We suspected that this would happen, but we’re disappointed that no one notified the community” about the power plant.

El Paso Electric CEO Kelly Tomblin told the El Paso Times in 2024 that Meta requires its data center to be powered by solar or other renewables. Then during a rate case hearing before the Public Utility Commission of Texas in 2025, an El Paso Electric representative said that the Meta data center would likely be powered by solar, according to El Paso Matters.

At an industry conference in Las Cruces this month, CEO Tomblin struck a different tone. She questioned the efficacy of renewables to power data centers.

“Unfortunately, it wants power around the clock, and it’s hard to do that with just renewables and storage,” she said, according to Albuquerque Business First.

Carbajal said the Sembrando Esperanza Coalition has repeatedly asked for assurances that data centers would not drive up electric rates for El Pasoans. The group intervened in El Paso Electric’s rate case and is now calling for the city and utilities to terminate contracts with Meta.

Councilman Canales said that he doubts the majority of the council would be interested in terminating the contract “given the massive amount of tax revenue that the project will bring in.”

“That said, if we continue to see deviations from Meta’s public commitments, then I hope the City Council will take notice,” he said.

Carjabal is also concerned about water consumption at the proposed power plant. El Paso Electric is already one of the city’s biggest water consumers at its existing power plants.

“Meta’s Data Center in El Paso, Texas is not obligated to protect local residents,” a Sembrando Esperanza handout states. “To the contrary, El Pasoans will be subsidizing one of the richest companies in the world.”

Amanecer’s Rodriguez called the city’s agreements with Meta “a bad deal.”

“This is not benefitting anybody in El Paso,” Rodriguez said. “Only Meta benefits.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ElPasoMeta.jpeg,N,,2026-01-21 13:02:03.399046

Hellbenders, giant salamanders that can reach more than two feet long in adulthood, have lived in Appalachia’s mountain streams for more than 150 million years. No one knows for sure how they earned their name, but folklore says early colonists believed the creatures were “from hell where they’re bent on returning.”

My favorite thing about hellbenders is that they are ugly.

On a chilly Saturday in October, I met hellbender researcher Hutch Whitman at a church parking lot in western North Carolina. Whitman is a graduate student in Appalachian State University’s Aquatic Conservation Research Lab, where his master’s thesis focuses on freshwater ecology. We came to the Nolichucky River watershed to study environmental DNA, biological material that organisms shed into their environment through things like skin cells and fecal matter. Environmental DNA helps researchers collect evidence for an animal without having to disturb the creature. It can be especially useful for studying species, like hellbenders, that are hard to find. It’s like forensics for ecosystems.

Ostensibly, I joined Whitman to collect water samples. But I had an ulterior motive. I wanted to see my first wild hellbender. I’d learned about the species the summer before my senior year of college, when I worked at a nature center in Banner Elk, North Carolina. In the back office there was a large poster of a lizard with his tail curved into the shape of a U. The tips of his toes were bulbous and white. When I asked my supervisor what it was, he told me all about hellbenders—how the giant salamanders are elusive, primordial, and breathe through their skin. These creatures are right here, he said, nearly in disbelief himself, in these mountains.

The word ‘giant’ stuck with me because I thought the poster was life-sized. When I think back on that summer, I picture monster lizards as long as my leg and almost as thick. I’m embarrassed to admit that this image, though false, stayed with me for years; I didn’t research hellbenders because I thought it might ruin the mystery. I liked the idea that Appalachian rivers were so wild and unmapped that they could hide salamanders almost as large as alligators.

After nearly a decade of clinging to my belief in the improbable, a friend popped my hellbender bubble. While explaining hellbenders to an acquaintance, she held her hands about two and a half feet apart. They can get this long, she said. But even after I understood that hellbenders weren’t alligator-sized, they still occupied mythic proportions in my mind.

By my late-October excursion with Whitman, the traditional sampling method of removing large rocks from rivers to find the salamanders was already over for the year. Autumn is breeding season for hellbenders and agitating them during this time can disrupt their reproductive cycle. Even so, sometimes people get lucky. That’s what I kept telling myself.

My second favorite thing about hellbenders is that they are elusive.

We started the day in Whitman’s Honda CR-V, a rolling zoo with plastic amphibians, reptiles, and birds plastered to the inside. A stuffed hellbender, bleached from the sun, rested on the dashboard.

One of our sampling sites was near a gravel pit on the North Toe River in Penland, North Carolina. In September of 2024, Hurricane Helene dumped over thirty inches of rain in the region, causing catastrophic flooding and more than a hundred fatalities across North Carolina. Helene widened the channel width of the North Toe River and washed sediment into the watershed; an orange, slimy silt now covers the banks. Whitman’s research examines how Helene may have damaged hellbender populations there.

Whitman handed me three plastic bags labeled with the day’s date in black Sharpie: 10/25. Decked in gaiters, he waded into the middle of the North Toe, opened one of the bags, and dunked it into the river facing the current. We sampled ten sites in his area of interest, which included three watersheds of northwestern North Carolina.

Once, while standing in the North Toe, Whitman’s foot dislodged a pebble. It went rolling down the riverbed. For a moment I imagined that its movement, distorted by the reflection of the trees in the water, was a hellbender crawling to its den.

“It’s really crazy to me sometimes that this is my life now,” Whitman said. “I spent so much of my summers when I was a little kid just running around, snorkeling through random creeks, hoping to see [a hellbender].”

Whitman grew up in North Carolina, but he spent summer breaks with his great-grandmother Lucy in the Greenbrier River Valley of West Virginia. He never saw a hellbender in West Virginia, but not for lack of trying. By the time Whitman was born, hellbender populations were all but gone in the Greenbrier, a loss Whitman attributed to coal-mining pollution.

The historic range of the eastern hellbender, which spans from southern New York state to the northern tips of Georgia and Alabama, is shrinking. (There is a smaller, more vulnerable subspecies called the Ozark hellbender, which is federally endangered and can only be found in a pocket of southern Missouri and northern Arkansas.)

Researchers from Kentucky’s Department of Forestry and Natural Resources found that less than half of the streams that used to contain hellbenders still had environmental DNA in 2025. All amphibians are vulnerable to environmental change, but hellbenders are uniquely so because they breathe through their skin, spending their entire lives underwater. The sides of their bodies are frilly, like the edges of lasagna, an adaptation that increases surface area. “The more surface area, the more oxygen they’ll be able to intake,” Whitman said.

Cutaneous respiration, or breathing through the skin, allows hellbenders to stay underwater and thereby avoid predation from animals like birds. But a characteristic that helps them survive also makes them more susceptible to floods, which dump silt into watersheds. Whitman said siltation can “choke hellbenders to death.”

The Cherokee name for Tusquitee Bald, a mountain west of Franklin in Clay County, North Carolina, roughly translates to “where the water-dogs laughed.” On top of this mountain, water dogs, a common name for hellbenders, told each other jokes and walked on their hind legs, so the story goes. “Any time a group of people anthropomorphize an animal, they revere it,” said Caleb Hickman, supervisory fisheries and wildlife biologist for the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. Hickman, whose ancestors were forced west on the Trail of Tears, grew up as a member of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma.

Newcomers didn’t always have the same regard for hellbenders, however. A 1906 article in an Illinois newspaper called hellbenders “hideous enough to suggest all sorts of horrid dreams and nightmares.” Hellbenders have also been described as poisonous bait stealers, a myth that led one Pennsylvania reporter to refer to hellbenders as enemies of fishermen. In actuality, hellbenders are harmless.

Since the 1980s, the broad American perception of hellbenders “went from being this kind of gross ugly thing to this endearing ugly thing,” Hickman said. He told me that reverence for hellbenders emerged concomitant with increasing research budgets for previously persecuted species.

Western North Carolina is perhaps the best example of this shift in public perception. In August, downtown Boone unveiled a hellbender mural as part of the Endangered Species Mural Project, an art program through the Center for Biological Diversity. The mural, created by Appalachian State University alum Josh Johnston, immerses the viewer in the hellbender’s habitat, portraying kingfishers diving into a stream of salamanders and brook trout.

A week after the mural unveiling, Spruce Pine hosted the first annual Hellbender Festival, drawing a crowd of more than 5,000 and more than doubling the size of the town for the day. The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission displayed Rocky, a seventeen-year-old rescue hellbender. (Seventeen is not particularly old for hellbenders; they can live to be more than thirty years old.)

“I was a bouncer for Rocky at one point,” said Spencer Bost, executive director of Downtown Spruce Pine, the community development nonprofit that hosted the festival. Bost told me that Rocky will need a dedicated volunteer to manage the line to see him next year, the demand was so high. Artists from the nearby Penland School of Craft also created a larger-than-life hellbender sculpture—roughly five feet long—using kudzu and wisteria.

A gully leads down to the South Toe River at a sample site in Micaville, an unincorporated community in Yancey County. Whitman slid down a path of loose rock and clay, plastic water-sample bags in hand. Across the street was a pasture once inundated by Helene’s surge. Whitman told me that, shortly after the storm, he found dead hellbenders in fields like this one, hundreds of meters away from the actual river.

I began to wonder if I would find my first wild hellbender dried out in a pasture. I imagined a herd of Dexter cows circled around a sheet of decaying flesh. How many hellbenders were ploughed under hay fields last spring? Whitman speculated that some of the dead hellbenders might have originally come from several miles upstream but were washed down through the valleys by the storm.

“But right here in the South Toe, they’re doing just fine,” Whitman said. Whitman’s research team, which primarily consisted of other graduate students, was pleasantly surprised to find hellbenders in unexpected places, like near the downtown areas of Spruce Pine and Boone.

My third favorite thing about hellbenders is that they are resilient.

“If a cat has nine lives, then the hell-bender must surely have eighteen,” according to a 1903 Washington Post article. Spencer Bost of the Hellbender Festival said that, after the storm, resilience became the main message of the event. “If this weird, squishy lasagna amphibian can survive Hurricane Helene, surely we can, too,” Bost said.

Carter Norris, who also worked on the festival, said a hellbender recently visited her during a swim on the Davidson River near Brevard. She dunked her phone underwater to capture a video of the creature crawling along a sandy river bottom. “It was really exciting to see [a hellbender] because it is one of our indicator species,” Norris said.

Biologists refer to hellbenders as indicator species because their presence usually indicates high-quality water. “There’s an old saying in the mountains here that you don’t drink from a branch unless it’s rolled over five rocks and a lizard’s back,” said Hickman, the fisheries biologist.

Whitman taught me how to identify suitable hellbender habitat with my eyes. The next time you’re standing in an Appalachian river, ask yourself the following questions. Do I see lush vegetation on the riverbanks? Are there boulders large enough to host underwater caverns? Is the river flowing freely, unobstructed by dams? Is the water clear and rid of sedimentation? If you answered yes to these questions, you might be standing in prime hellbender habitat.

Many of our sample sites were also adjacent to one-room churches named after the closest body of water. When I pointed this out to Whitman, he told me, chuckling, that hellbenders love Jesus.

We concluded our excursion at a higher elevation near the headwaters. Here, the stream channels were narrower, the banks were steeper, and the water was cooler. As Whitman took his final sample, I watched a leaf float down the river.

I did not see a hellbender that day. To me, hellbenders are still as thick as my leg and almost as long. Maybe the not seeing lets the mystery stay with me. “I hope there’s an animal somewhere that nobody has ever seen,” said Wendell Berry’s daughter in the prelude to his poem, “To the Unseeable Animal.” “And I hope nobody ever sees it.”",https://oxfordamerican.org/media/pages/oa-now/from-hell-and-bent-on-returning/d1cdf25709-1768939983/hellbender-in-the-salamander-exhibit-of-the-tennessee-aquarium-600x-crop-52-6-50-5.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 15:04:38.583868

Ruhani Arya is the vice president of infrastructure and sustainable finance at Bank of America.

The world’s biggest energy challenge isn’t technological — it’s financial.

America knows how to build nuclear power plants. More than 400 commercial reactors operate globally, including proven Generation III+ designs like the AP1000. Yet not a single large-scale plant is under construction in the United States today.

The barrier is not safety, nor capability, but structure. Decades of on‑balance‑sheet nuclear investments delivered financial pain, regulatory paralysis and public skepticism. The next wave of nuclear must be financed differently — through project finance, not corporate balance sheets — if it is to scale fast enough to meet demand from data centers and other industries.

The coming demand shock

Under current policies, annual U.S. industrial electricity demand is forecasted to grow 13% from 2025 through 2050, according to an analysis by the Rocky Mountain Institute. Under a high emissions reduction scenario, total annual electricity demand is forecasted to grow 139% over the same period, it said.

AI and hyperscale data centers are already reshaping load growth curves. By 2030, those facilities could consume up to 12 percent of U.S. electricity, according to McKinsey.

Their demand is continuous and thus impossible to meet with wind and solar energy alone; they need baseload power. Enter nuclear: carbon‑free, 24/7 and grid‑stabilizing. But without a viable way to finance new reactors, this resurgence will stall before it starts.

What project finance solves

Traditional corporate financing concentrates exposure. If a nuclear plant’s cost doubles — as it did for Georgia Power’s Vogtle Units 3 and 4, rising from about $14 billion to more than $30 billion — shareholders and ratepayers, not the asset, take the hit, sometimes triggering credit downgrades and inflating utility debt borrowing costs.

Project finance addresses this issue. Each facility sits in a dedicated special‑purpose vehicle (SPV), separating debt and liabilities from the parent’s balance sheet. Investors fund an asset, not a utility. Lenders rely on contractual cash flows, not corporate guarantees. Project finance involves a risk allocation structure that disciplines cost estimation and aligns incentives among builders, operators and financiers.

This model fuels nearly every major energy infrastructure investment outside nuclear — from LNG export terminals to solar and wind projects. There is no reason nuclear should remain the exception.

Structuring nuclear project finance

A realistic approach would mirror today’s large‑scale data center development with a hybrid of project, infrastructure and real‑estate finance:

Reactor designer, developer and engineering, procurement and construction companies: Provide standardized designs and fixed‑price, turnkey construction.

Equity partners: Infrastructure funds, pension investors and sovereign capital contribute equity through construction, earning higher returns for assuming early‑stage risk. Private markets currently sit on $350 billion in dry powder — an enormous potential pool for nuclear. Upon commercial operation, utilities or long‑term asset owners/operators can potentially acquire the stabilized asset.

Debt providers: Banks and insurers lend long‑tenor debt, supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, which can guarantee up to 80% of eligible cost. Insurance capital, particularly from life insurers seeking duration‑matched assets, can provide supplemental debt tranches.

Offtakers: Tech or industrial companies sign long-term power purchase agreements for baseload nuclear power. As AI and cloud demand surge, three to five major offtakers could easily underwrite several reactors’ output, providing predictable revenue streams and unlocking cheaper financing.

Government incentives: The 30–40% tech-neutral investment tax credit established via the Inflation Reduction Act applies to the fair market value, not the initial cost estimate. This structure effectively provides a cushion against budget overruns, a feature that could boost confidence of nuclear investors to move forward with new projects.

This blend of stakeholders produces bankable capital structures and, crucially, decouples nuclear investment from utility risk.

Lessons from Vogtle

Vogtle’s difficulties stemmed from timing, rather than technology.

At financial close, the AP1000 design was incomplete, the U.S. supply chain immature and the workforce untrained. By 2017, after management reorganization, costs stabilized near ~$26 billion, roughly aligning with post‑COVID final numbers. If anything, Vogtle’s final price tag of $32–$36 billion confirms the need for project-level scrutiny, rather than discrediting the technology.

The upside: Vogtle created a trained workforce of 30,000 people and validated a now‑mature supply chain. The next series of reactors could capture at least 20% cost reduction and 30% higher efficiency through standardization — the same learning curve that was observed from Vogtle Unit 3 to 4.

Reforming regulation and capital costs

Cost escalation in nuclear has often stemmed from regulation. The ALARA (“as low as reasonably achievable”) principle, though well intentioned, has enforced excessive conservatism.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has a single mandate: safety. By contrast, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration balances safety with societal benefit. A similar dual mandate for the NRC could align nuclear policy with national economic and environmental goals, reducing investor risk premiums and project discount rates. Overregulation that ignores these realities deters capital, slowing progress toward environmental and industrial security.

A stable regulatory environment lowers project discount rates, directly improving competitiveness. Every 100‑basis‑point reduction in cost of capital cuts the levelized cost of electricity by roughly five to six dollars per megawatt‑hour. With available tax credits, government loans and standardized project financing, nuclear LCOE could approach $60–$70 per MWh, putting it well within commercial viability.

Why it matters now

America’s grid faces booming demand. Nuclear energy can be part of the answer — and project finance is the key to building more reactors. It allows capital markets, not utilities, to shoulder construction risk and aligns modern investors’ appetite for long‑duration, asset‑backed returns with national industrial and environmental goals.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/sU1ZMAwrikwcMogub6zfUmxib8fAdBd6IrRpoUQ1Jms/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9NaWNvcnNvZnRfYW5kX0NvbnN0ZWxsYXRpb25fbnVjbGVhci5qcGc=.webp,N,,2026-01-21 14:01:32.754643

“No state in the union can match California’s five-year growth in ZEV sales,” California Energy Commissioner Nancy Skinner said in a statement.
In the latest Clean Transportation Program Investment Plan Update, the California Energy Commission allocated $98.5 million for light-duty, zero-emission vehicle infrastructure for fiscal year 2025-26.
In 2023 the state was powered by two-thirds clean energy, the largest economy in the world to achieve that level.
California has also run on 100% clean electricity for part of the day almost every day last year, officials said.","During his visit to this year’s World Economic Forum in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland, Gov. Gavin Newsom emphasized California’s stability “amid federal chaos” as he announced a benchmark in electric vehicle sales.

According to the governor’s office, California has surpassed 2.5 million cumulative new sales of zero-emission vehicles, or ZEVs — far exceeding the state’s goal of 1.5 million ZEVs by 2025.

“California didn’t reach 2.5 million zero-emission vehicles by accident — we invested in this future when others said it was impossible,” Newsom said in a statement. “While Washington now cedes the global clean vehicle market to China, California is ensuring American workers and manufacturers can compete and win in the industries that will define this century.”

Officials said the sales milestone is the result of decades of California pioneering the clean-car market, leading to a solid foundation that continues to drive electric-vehicle sales and the world’s fourth-largest economy, “despite the Trump administration’s efforts to derail our clean transportation future.”

Since the end of 2019, cumulative new ZEV sales in California have increased more than 300%, driven by effective clean transportation policy and various ZEV incentives, according to Newsom’s office. California stands as the nation’s undisputed leader in emission-free transportation, proving that consumer demand for electric vehicles remains strong despite federal headwinds.

“No state in the union can match California’s five-year growth in ZEV sales,” California Energy Commissioner Nancy Skinner said in a statement. “This serves as a reminder of how far we’ve come thanks to historic levels of state investment and Californians’ strong demand for clean cars. Each quarter, even in the face of increasing federal headwinds, tens of thousands of consumers are purchasing a ZEV in the Golden State, enjoying a great driving experience, and knowing they never have to go to a gas station again.”

Officials noted the state’s commitment to establishing a robust network of ZEV infrastructure.

“While the federal government reversed and put up roadblocks, the global zero-emission vehicle market surged ahead last year,” California Air Resources Board Chair Lauren Sanchez said in a statement. “Governor Newsom’s new rebate proposal sends a clear message: California isn’t slowing down, we’re still leading the pack. It’s not just about clean air, it’s smart economic policy.”

ZEV market resilience

During last year’s fourth quarter after federal tax credits expired Sept. 30, Californians bought 79,066 new ZEVs, which was 18.9% of new car sales statewide, according to the governor’s office. Prior to the tax credit expiration, sales surged in the third quarter of 2025 to 29.1% of new car sales, “likely softening sales in the fourth quarter as a result,” officials said.

As the loss of federal support set off a nationwide decline in EV sales — from 10.5% in Q3 to 5.8% in Q4, according to Cox Automotive — California’s market stayed resilient.

“This resilience reflects a market turning point,” according to Newsom’s office. “After decades of strategic state investment in charging infrastructure, consumer incentives, and manufacturer standards, California has built a strong, mature, resilient ZEV ecosystem grounded in policy certainty and sustained investment. Consumers are buying electric vehicles in part because the technology works, the vehicles perform, and the charging infrastructure continues to grow rapidly.”

Despite the lack of financial incentives from federal government, ZEV sales were strong in Q4. Officials noted the ZEV market’s diversity, and electric vehicles’ cost-effectiveness.

“With 149 ZEV models available in California in Q4 of 2025, consumers are buoyed by the diversity in the ZEV market,” according to the governor’s office. “Not only do ZEVs produce zero tailpipe pollution, but they are also fun and powerful to drive, and cost less to operate and maintain compared to gas-powered vehicles.”

Officials suggested this website for prospective ZEV buyers: ElectricForAll.org.

Clean transportation spending

State officials are “doubling down” on clean transportation spending.

In his Jan. 9 budget, Newsom proposed launching a $200 million incentive program to accelerate ZEV adoption and respond to the loss of the federal tax credit. According to the governor’s office, the move would support “American automotive innovation at a critical moment — just as the Trump administration has abandoned the good-paying jobs of this global market.”

According to Newsom, after ess than a year in office President Donald Trump’s tariff policy has driven away the United States’ second-largest trading partner, pushing Canada toward deeper economic ties with China and surrendering America’s top global spot in electric vehicle manufacturing.

“Competing to win the future requires investing in clean energy technologies, strengthening partnerships with allies like Canada, and reducing dependence on China in critical sectors,” officials said.

“Instead, the Trump administration repealed key parts of the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and imposed broad tariffs that have raised costs for American consumers while straining relationships with close allies,” state officials continued. “Despite Donald Trump’s efforts to cede the clean energy economy to China, California is ensuring American workers and manufacturers can compete and win in the industries that will define this century.”

The Trump administration has said tariffs will bolster the nation’s global economic leadership.

“I always say ‘tariffs’ is the most beautiful word to me in the dictionary,” President Donald Trump said at a rally hours after his inauguration in January 2025. “Because tariffs are going to make us rich as hell. It’s going to bring our country’s businesses back that left us.”

In an interview with Time magazine, the president said, “We’re a department store, a giant department store, the biggest department store in history. Everybody wants to come in and take from us. They’re going to come in and they’re going to pay a price for taking our treasure, for taking our jobs, for doing all of these things.”

The state’s zero-emission commitment extends beyond consumer incentives, official said. In the latest Clean Transportation Program Investment Plan Update, the California Energy Commission allocated $98.5 million for light-duty, zero-emission vehicle infrastructure for fiscal year 2025-26. The funding will focus on Level 1 and Level 2 charging in locations with longer vehicle dwell times, including at-home charging with a focus on multifamily residences.

The Energy Commission is also continuing to study infrastructure needs statewide, officials said. The following is planned for release later this year:

New and ongoing ZEV infrastructure funding opportunities driven by the $98.5 million from the Clean Transportation Program;

The third Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure Assessment, as mandated by Assembly Bill 2127, which will assess the state’s infrastructure needs to meet EV demand; and

The next Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment Assessment, as mandated by Senate Bill 1000, to assess whether charging infrastructure is disproportionately deployed.

EV infrastructure

The governor’s office touted efforts to tear down barriers that keep ZEVs off the roadways, speeding up charging station installations and deploying infrastructure in difficult-to-reach and low-income areas.

“Becoming an EV driver in California is increasingly getting easier,” according to state officials. “There are now over 200,000 public and shared EV charging stations statewide. EV chargers can be found at grocery stores, park-and-ride lots, and even gas stations, whereas shared EV chargers can be found at apartment complexes, workplaces, doctors’ offices, sports facilities, and other parking areas with some level of restricted access. This statewide network of public and shared private chargers is in addition to the estimated 800,000 EV chargers installed in California homes.”

California’s climate leadership

Pollution is down and the economy is up, according to Newsom. Greenhouse gas emissions in California have dropped 21% since 2000 — even as the state’s GDP increased 81% in that same time period on the way to becoming the world’s fourth largest economy.

Officials also boasted about California’s clean energy records. In 2023 the state was powered by two-thirds clean energy, the largest economy in the world to achieve that level. California has also run on 100% clean electricity for part of the day almost every day last year, officials said.

Since the beginning of the Newsom administration in 2019, battery storage has surged to nearly 17,000 megawatts — a more than 2,100% increase, and over 30,000 megawatts of new resources have been added to the state’s electricity grid. California now has 33% of the storage capacity estimated to be needed by 2045 to reach 100% emission-free electricity.",https://heysocal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/logo-black.svg,N,,2026-01-21 13:01:31.825007

The affected workers include 16 engineers, five managers, three lab technicians and others. The cuts were made Jan. 6, according to a layoff notice to the state, a day before ONE announced a strategic transition and said the suspension of its EV efforts had resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately 45% to 100 employees.

The state got the company's WARN filing on Jan. 13. ONE said it was unable to provide the full 60 days of advance notice due to ""unforeseeable circumstances"" because its largest EV customer ""suddenly and unexpectedly"" canceled a contract.

It was not immediately clear if the 29 jobs were part of the 45% employee cut, though the timing suggests that was the case. Messages seeking comment were sent to ONE on Wednesday.

Founder and CEO Mujeeb Ijaz told Crain’s earlier this month that the plan is to produce a slower-moving, cash-generating company built less on a speculative market and more on traditional pathways. He declined to name new companies with which ONE has secured contracts but noted they are in three product lines: locomotive, defense and grid-scale energy storage systems.

""It's been tough, parting with our employees."" Ijaz said. ""We know every person and every name. But we have this really important job and it's generating a lot of hope, in my mind. What we are doing is going to result in a healthy business. We're not out of the woods, but moving in a direction that looks like a stable business.""

ONE, which has manufacturing facilities in Novi and Van Buren Township, made a splash in 2022 with plans to be the first U.S.-based company to establish a domestic lithium iron phosphate battery plant. The factory, backed by $237 million in taxpayer subsidies, was to feed EV-focused automakers with a less costly, more sustainable battery than the standard nickel-manganese-cobalt chemistry.

But demand for EVs failed to launch, automakers pulled back investment dramatically and the business case for battery plants imploded. The Trump administration's rollback of EV tax credits and fuel emission regulations has further chilled electrification in the auto industry.

In September, the company announced it planned to vacate part of its factory space in Van Buren Township in Wayne County, where it planned to invest $1.6 billion and create 2,112 jobs that did not come to fruition.

As of September, ONE employed 180 people in Novi. It had created about 70 jobs and invested $117.6 million in eligible costs under its deal with the state. It's unclear how many employees the company has now.

The Michigan Economic Development Corp., which had disbursed $70.2 million of public funds to the company, said no further payments would be made under its current agreement to support the project. Per terms of the contract, ONE has until December 2029 to meet its investment and jobs commitment.

The resolution disapproves of Public Land Order (PLO) 7917 to reverse the Biden Administration's mineral withdrawal decision in the Superior National Forest in Minnesota. This resolution is a critical step toward unlocking the vast potential of the Duluth Complex, which contains the largest untapped copper-nickel deposit in the world. The deposit is home to 95% of America's nickel, 88% of America's cobalt, 75% of America's platinum, and more than one-third of America's copper.

The previous Administration's decision to institute a 20-year mineral withdrawal on 225,504 acres in the Superior National Forest has effectively blocked the development of critical mineral resources in that region, including the Twin Metals project and other proposed hardrock mining and helium extraction projects. This withdrawal not only undermines our national and energy security but also hinders the ability to meet the U.S.'s ambitious infrastructure and clean energy goals.

H.J. Res. 140 does not immediately approve any specific project but instead reverses the mining ban, allowing proposed projects to proceed through the regulatory and permitting review process. This resolution ensures a level playing field, enabling projects to compete on their own merits while meeting strict permitting and environmental requirements at both the state and federal levels.

The Chamber supports H.J. Res. 140 and urges Congress to act swiftly to pass this resolution. Developing a strong, reliable domestic critical minerals supply chain is vital to America's future, and this resolution represents a necessary step in that direction.

The idea is for customers to have a fixed electricity bill to make budgeting expenses easier.
“This bill is a good start; we think it could be improved a bit along the way,” said Pierce, who is the ranking minority member on the House utilities committee.
The idea is to set electricity rates for three years at a time.","A proposal to revamp Indiana’s regulatory framework and affordability programs for electricity service providers is headed to the House floor.

A legislative priority for Republicans, House Bill 1002 requires the state’s investor-owned utilities to start low-income-customer assistance programs, bans service shutoffs in the summer and moves all customers to “levelized” billing plans.

The legislation would also see Indiana dip its toes into performance-based ratemaking—a new regulatory framework in which utilities are locked into rates for three-year periods.

After lengthy testimony and debate last week over how best to make sure low-income families would be protected from shutoffs in the summer and would understand their monthly utility bills, the legislation passed the House Committee on Utilities, Energy and Telecommunications on Tuesday with unanimous support.

“The goal … is to prioritize affordability for Hoosier ratepayers and ensure our utilities are maintaining transparent, cost-effective practices,” the bill’s author, Rep. Alaina Shonkwiler, R-Noblesville, said in committee testimony.

Gov. Mike Braun also signaled his support for the legislation in his State of the State address.

Levelized billing

A point of emphasis for the bill is to help for low-income customers amid price hikes caused by rising energy demand.

The bill would require utilities, starting July 1, to enroll all eligible customers in a low-income assistance program to help pay for monthly bills. Many utilities already offer such programs.

Debates in committee centered on how to pay for assistance programs. The original bill suggested utility companies fund the offerings from half of the amount they recovered from ratepayers under their IURC-approved energy-efficiency programs in the most recent year.

Danielle McGrath, president of the Indiana Energy Association, cautioned that using such a mechanism could lead to unpredictable spikes and dips in funding from year to year, while Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, questioned whether the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission should have a say in how to administer low-income programs.

An amendment from committee chair Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, on Tuesday changed funding for low-income programs to be at least 0.2% of a utility company’s total yearly revenue.

“They’re all going to have to do something and it’s going to cost them some money,” said Soliday about the funding mechanism. “Somebody’s going to have to pay to make this work.”

The bill attempts to prevent surprises when customers see their monthly utility bills. To that effect, the legislation requires all customers to go to what’s commonly known as “budget billing,” in which utility companies average a customer’s electricity usage for the past year and charge the monthly average cost of their usage for that period.

A few times a year, the customers must “true up” and pay for the actual amount of electricity they used. The idea is for customers to have a fixed electricity bill to make budgeting expenses easier.

But Rep. Cherish Pryor, D-Indianapolis, and Rep. Alex Burton, D-Evansville, said their constituents have been confused, saying the term “budget” implies customers are on a low-income assistance program.

Burton offered an amendment to change the term budget billing to “levelized” billing to make the process more clear. As written, HB 1001 requires all customers to have levelized billing, but users can opt out at any time.

Language was also added during Tuesday’s committee session to prevent power shutoffs from June 1 through Sept. 23, similar to existing prohibitions against shutoffs in the winter.

“This bill is a good start; we think it could be improved a bit along the way,” said Pierce, who is the ranking minority member on the House utilities committee.

Pierce offered an amendment Tuesday that would have eliminated the state’s 7% sales tax on utility bills, saying it would give ratepayers more immediate relief, but it was voted down by Republicans on the committee who worried about budgetary impacts.

Multiyear planning

HB 1001 also marks a significant change in how regulators set electric rates for monopoly utility providers.

For much of the past century, Indiana has used a “cost of service” model to determine rates, in which utilities calculate how much money it took to provide service, add on a rate of return for investors and submit their rate requests to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.

The IURC hears testimony and documentation from the utility and from other stakeholders, then decides what a “reasonable” amount of cost recovery includes and sets rates for customers accordingly.

But Shonkwiler’s bill shifts the state to a performance-based ratemaking model that involves multiyear rate plans. The idea is to set electricity rates for three years at a time. Knowing they can’t ask for rate increases for a prolonged period, utilities are incentivized to operate more efficiently in order to make a profit.

The proposed legislation outlines that the process for setting multiyear rate plans would look similar to current rate requests utilities make before the IURC.

Along with multiyear plans, the bill sets up performance-based metrics that utilities would be rewarded for meeting or penalized for falling short.

Specifically, providers would be incentivized to keep rates in line with the national electricity inflation average, as measured by the consumer price index. Regulators can also use service restoration times as an incentive, though some people who testified in committee questioned whether the one basis point of financial reward or penalty would be enough for utility companies to change their behavior.

The Indiana Energy Association, which represents utility providers, supported making multiyear rate plans optional for utilities, but the bill as written requires the new practice starting in 2027.

Ratepayers advocates like Kerwin Olson, the executive director of the Citizens Action Coalition, had technical concerns over what information electric providers had to submit for rate plans. Overall, he thinks the bill will be a welcome initiative for low-income families, but wouldn’t have much effect on most customers in the short term.

“I think this bill is conflating affordability with stability a little bit,” Olson said. “We don’t see anything in the bill that is going to reduce rates for customers going forward, unless you are a low-income customer.”

As trade policy and geopolitical dynamics continue to create economic uncertainty around the globe, a robust domestic biofuel market would provide much needed stability and market opportunities for U.S. soybean farmers.

Instead of continued imports of biofuel and biofuel feedstocks that leave our value chain vulnerable to supply chain manipulation, ASA is advocating for policy outcomes that strengthen domestic soy demand and support U.S. soybean farmers.

Biofuel is a broad term that includes biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, as well as the smaller markets of soy-derived naphtha, liquified petroleum gas and home heating oil.

The domestic biofuel industry can play a critical role in national security and economic stability – and biofuel is produced right here on U.S. soil. Roughly half of all U.S.-processed soybean oil is used in biomass-based diesel, making biofuel one of the most significant domestic markets for soybeans.

The Current State of Biofuel

Biofuel encompasses a wide range of fuels, feedstocks and policy frameworks, but ASA is currently focused on two specific policy issues – the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit and the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) renewable volume obligations (RVOs). Clear guidance aligning with recently enacted amendments to the 45Z tax credit will help determine the economics of producing low-carbon fuels, while RVOs for 2026 and 2027 will establish the level of biofuel blending required under the RFS. Both directly affect soybean oil utilization, domestic crush expansion and market certainty for farmers. When U.S.-grown soybean oil is used in domestic biofuel production, it strengthens rural economies, reduces greenhouse gas emissions and lowers reliance on finite energy sources. How these policies are structured ultimately determines whether American clean fuel policy delivers its intended economic and environmental benefits to U.S. farmers and consumers alike.

45Z Tax Credit

In July 2025, the 45Z tax credit was amended through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) to enhance benefits to soy-based biofuel, but final guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury has yet to be completed. ASA is advocating for swift draft guidance from the Treasury Department to ensure timely implementation. The tax credit is important to soybean farmers because it incentivizes fuel producers to purchase soybean oil for biodiesel and renewable diesel.

To qualify for the 45Z tax credit, fuel producers must utilize feedstocks produced in North America. Finalization of 45Z is critical because it will boost domestic feedstock demand and support stronger soybean prices. The tax credit also protects domestically grown agricultural feedstocks and removes incentives for imported waste feedstocks, which have exponentially increased market share in U.S. biofuel production over the past five years.

“We led advocacy efforts and did so in coordination with other ag commodity groups and soybean processors as Congress was developing tax code changes in the OBBBA,” said Alexa Combelic, executive director of government affairs for ASA. “These advocacy efforts led to an incredible win for ASA in relation to the 45Z tax credits. We were able to remove the indirect land use change penalty on agricultural biofuel feedstocks, which effectively doubles the value of the tax credit for soy biofuel. In addition, we were able to address the surge of imported feedstocks entering our biofuel production value chain through new limitations on tax credit eligibility.”

Up until the week before the OBBBA was passed, Combelic said it wasn’t clear if the North American feedstock “ringfence” would be included in the final bill. Through significant grassroots stakeholder mobilization and advocacy leadership, ASA was able to ensure the tax credit would focus on biofuel feedstocks grown and produced in North America rather than overseas.

Additionally, through months of education on the impacts of agricultural indirect land use change (ILUC) penalties, ASA was able to double the 45Z credit rate for soy-based biofuel. The ILUC penalty was an arbitrary tax on U.S. farmers, and its removal means the carbon intensity of soy is based on its direct impacts and not tied to a calculation model that penalizes U.S. grown crops for farming behavior in South America.

This win was not only the product of the hard work of ASA Government Affairs, but also of the efforts by farmers who helped ensure lawmakers were hearing directly from their constituents about the importance of the tax credit amendments to the soybean industry. The 45Z credit was first established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which restructured biofuel tax credits based on carbon intensity and initially disadvantaged agricultural feedstocks. Through mechanisms like ILUC, the IRA policy created an incentive for imported waste feedstocks like tallow, primarily from Brazil, and used cooking oil, primarily from China. Now, the 45Z tax credit as updated by the OBBBA disincentivizes those imports by prioritizing feedstocks available at home through a North American ringfence of eligibility and by removing arbitrary credit reductions for agricultural products.

The next step to ensure utilization of 45Z is for the Treasury Department to develop tax guidance that outlines how biofuel producers can utilize this tax credit after the statutory changes enacted through OBBBA. At this time, ASA is continuing to engage with the Treasury Department and administration to highlight the sense of urgency. While interim or draft guidance is expected this winter, final guidance will only be published after a public comment period and agency review.

“We anticipate full final guidance by spring or summer,” Combelic said.

RVOs

The RVO rule for compliance years 2026 and 2027 as proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will lead to an increase in blending volumes for biomass-based diesel – a policy that supports soybean farmers, soybean processors and biofuel producers. Released by EPA in June 2025, this was the strongest proposed RVO rule ever published. It was the direct result of continued advocacy with this administration.

“The previous Trump administration was not the biggest advocate for biofuel, so we were thrilled to see this change in tune,” Combelic said. It shows a clear focus on wanting to be a partner as we seek to increase domestic markets for soybean oil. Based on the two-year draft rule, if finalized, the biofuel value chain would absorb 10% of the average soybean sales to China in the first year and 20% of soybean sales to China in the second year.

The current RVOs, released under the Biden Administration EPA in 2023, underestimated industry capacity, weakening demand for soybean oil. The 2023-2025 RVOs did not reflect the expansion of the biofuel value chain – production and soybean crush. At that time, ASA was disappointed that blending volumes were not higher. The 2026 volumes versus the 2025 volumes shows an increase of over 2 billion gallons. This is a historic increase in volume requirements for biomass-based diesel. ASA applauded the proposal but continues to push for higher volume targets going forward in order to stabilize the market and secure long-term growth.

2025 marked the 20th anniversary of the RFS, and the EPA proposal in June marked a perfect reason for ASA to celebrate the program. The RFS program was enacted in 2005 through the passage of the Energy Policy Act and has been improved over the years, resulting in a new era that puts farmers first and strengthens the domestic biofuel industry. When President Trump began his term, he signed an Executive Order that created policy in support of American energy dominance. Domestic biofuel production fits right into that idea as from soil to final fuel production, it can be produced exclusively within the United States.

While soybean farmers have struggled to maintain biofuel feedstock market share amid the rapidly surging flood of cheap, foreign feedstocks, the proposed 2026-2027 RVO rule addresses concerns of fraudulent used cooking oil coming into the United States through a novel proposal to reduce Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credit values by 50% for imported biofuel and biofuel made from imported feedstocks. It encourages domestic biofuel production, strengthening domestic soybean markets and making domestic feedstocks more competitive. The 50% RIN credit reduction proposed by EPA is yet another opportunity to continue disincentivizing foreign feedstocks from being imported into the U.S.

A Bipartisan Issue

Because domestic biofuel creates a market for farmers and provides a boon for rural communities, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle support biofuel policies which increase domestic production, making it a true bipartisan issue. Domestic biofuel production creates jobs, opens a market for soybean farmers and bolsters the use of a product planted, harvested, created and consumed all within the United States. Biofuel policy is a flexible issue that supports the values of both political parties – a win-win for all.

ASA saw additional success on Capitol Hill last year as there was a strong coalition of advocates who helped them see bipartisan caucus support using agriculture feedstocks. When the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit was first released, the North American ringfence was only included in the House of Representatives, with the Senate later striking the measure. However, through ASA’s targeted and continued engagement, an ad hoc coalition of biofuel producers, soybean processors and farmers from a variety of commodities advocated for the ringfence to be reinstated, and it was restored in an updated version of the text released by the Senate the week of passage, ensuring eligible feedstocks will be permanently limited to North American origin points for the life of the 45Z tax credit.

The Future of Biofuel

Looking to the future of biofuel, ASA is calling for the completion of EPA’s proposed 2026-2027 Renewable Fuel Standard renewable volume obligations and issuing timely Treasury guidance for the revised 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit to reflect enacted changes that prioritize domestic agricultural feedstocks. On Nov. 12, 2025, ASA and the National Oilseed Processors Association (NOPA) sent a letter to President Trump urging swift finalization of these key federal biofuel policies which are critical to strengthen domestic demand and support farmers who are facing continued market pressure.

As ASA continues to advocate for the good of the soy community, the Association is continuously engaging with USDA, EPA, Treasury, the U.S. Trade Representative and additional senior staff at the White House. Biofuel policy is an issue that spans beyond one agency. It takes a team effort to make a difference, and ASA is focused on coalition building, legislative education and advocacy at the highest level of government.",https://soygrowers.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CAM36806-lower-res-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 15:04:16.801046

“The fundamental challenge of delivering heat is that the higher your heat pump is raising the air temperature, the lower your maximum efficiency.
Many other electric boilers rely on waste heat, but Stark thinks that adds too much complexity to installation and operations.","More than 200 years ago, the steam boiler helped spark the Industrial Revolution. Since then, steam has been the lifeblood of industrial activity around the world. Today the production of steam — created by burning gas, oil, or coal to boil water — accounts for a significant percentage of global energy use in manufacturing, powering the creation of paper, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, food, and more.

Now, the startup AtmosZero, founded by Addison Stark SM ’10, PhD ’14; Todd Bandhauer; and Ashwin Salvi, is taking a new approach to electrify the centuries-old steam boiler. The company has developed a modular heat pump capable of delivering industrial steam at temperatures up to 150 degrees Celsius to serve as a drop-in replacement for combustion boilers.

The company says its first 1-megawatt steam system is far cheaper to operate than commercially available electric solutions thanks to ultra-efficient compressor technology, which uses 50 percent less electricity than electric resistive boilers. The founders are hoping that’s enough to make decarbonized steam boilers drive the next industrial revolution.

“Steam is the most important working fluid ever,” says Stark, who serves as AtmosZero’s CEO. “Today everything is built around the ubiquitous availability of steam. Cost-effectively electrifying that requires innovation that can scale. In other words, it requires a mass-produced product — not one-off projects.”

Tapping into steam

Stark joined the Technology and Policy Program when he came to MIT in 2007. He ultimately completed a dual master’s degree by adding mechanical engineering to his studies.

“I was interested in the energy transition and in accelerating solutions to enable that,” Stark says. “The transition isn’t happening in a vacuum. You need to align economics, policy, and technology to drive that change.”

Stark stayed at MIT to earn his PhD in mechanical engineering, studying thermochemical biofuels.

After MIT, Stark began working on early-stage energy technologies with the Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency— Energy (ARPA-E), with a focus on manufacturing efficiency, the energy-water nexus, and electrification.

“Part of that work involved applying my training at MIT to things that hadn’t really been innovated on for 50 years,” Stark says. “I was looking at the heat exchanger. It’s so fundamental. I thought, ‘How might we reimagine it in the context of modern advances in manufacturing technology?’”

The problem is as difficult as it is consequential, touching nearly every corner of the global industrial economy. More than 2.2 gigatons of CO2 emissions are generated each year to turn water into steam — accounting for more than 5 percent of global energy-related emissions.

In 2020, Stark co-authored an article in the journal Joule with Gregory Thiel SM ’12, PhD ’15 titled, “To decarbonize industry, we must decarbonize heat.” The article examined opportunities for industrial heat decarbonization, and it got Stark excited about the potential impact of a standardized, scalable electric heat pump.

Most electric boiler options today bring huge increases in operating costs. Many also make use of factory waste heat, which requires pricey retrofits. Stark never imagined he’d become an entrepreneur, but he soon realized no one was going to act on his findings for him.

“The only path to seeing this invention brought out into the world was to found and run the company,” Stark says. “It’s something I didn’t anticipate or necessarily want, but here I am.”

Stark partnered with former ARPA-E awardee Todd Bandhauer, who had been inventing new refrigerant compressor technology in his lab at Colorado State University, and former ARPA-E colleague Ashwin Salvi. The team officially founded AtmosZero in 2022.

“The compressor is the engine of the heat pump and defines the efficiency, cost, and performance,” Stark says. “The fundamental challenge of delivering heat is that the higher your heat pump is raising the air temperature, the lower your maximum efficiency. It runs into thermodynamic limitations. By designing for optimum efficiency in the operational windows that matter for the refrigerants we’re using, and for the precision manufacturing of our compressors, we’re able to maximize the individual stages of compression to maximize operational efficiency.”

The system can work with waste heat from air or water, but it doesn’t need waste heat to work. Many other electric boilers rely on waste heat, but Stark thinks that adds too much complexity to installation and operations.

Instead, in AtmosZero’s novel heat pump cycle, heat from ambient-temperature air is used to warm a liquid heat transfer material, which evaporates a refrigerant so it flows into the system’s series of compressors and heat exchangers, reaching high enough temperatures to boil water while recovering heat from the refrigerant once it reaches lower temperatures. The system can be ramped up and down to seamlessly fit into existing industrial processes.

“We can work just like a combustion boiler,” Stark says. “At the end of the day, customers don’t want to change how their manufacturing facilities operate in order to electrify. You can’t change or increase complexity on-site.”

That approach means the boiler can be deployed in a range of industrial contexts without unique project costs or other changes.

“What we really offer is flexibility and something that can drop in with ease and minimize total capital costs,” Stark says.

From 1 to 1,000

AtmosZero already has a pilot 650 kilowatt system operating at a customer facility near its headquarters in Loveland, Colorado. The company is currently focused on demonstrating year-round durability and reliability of the system as they work to build out their backlog of orders and prepare to scale.

Stark says once the system is brought to a customer’s facility, it can be installed in an afternoon and deployed in a matter of days, with zero downtime.

AtmosZero is aiming to deliver a handful of units to customers over the next year or two, with plans to deploy hundreds of units a year after that. The company is currently targeting manufacturing plants using under 10 megawatts of thermal energy at peak demand, which represents most U.S. manufacturing facilities.

Stark is proud to be part of a growing group of MIT-affiliated decarbonization startups, some of which are targeting specific verticals, like Boston Metal for steel and Sublime Systems for cement. But he says beyond the most common materials, the industry gets very fragmented, with one of the only common threads being the use of steam.

“If we look across industrial segments, we see the ubiquity of steam,” Stark says. “It’s a tremendously ripe opportunity to have impact at scale. Steam cannot be removed from industry. So much of every industrial process that we’ve designed over the last 160 years has been around the availability of steam. So, we need to focus on ways to deliver low-emissions steam rather than removing it from the equation.”",https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/images/202601/MIT_AtmosZero-01-press.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 15:59:21.406950

Zanskar expects initial projects to begin delivering electricity before 2030.

Scaling geothermal discovery and development

Zanskar positions its platform as a unified operating system for geothermal discovery and development, combining field-based geoscience with custom-built software and artificial intelligence tools. The company says this approach reduces exploration timelines and costs while increasing the size and productivity of geothermal fields.

“This Series C positions Zanskar for rapid growth by enabling the company to advance its gigawatt-scale pipeline through a historic geothermal exploration and development campaign,” the company said in its announcement.

Carl Hoiland, CEO and co-founder of Zanskar, said the company was founded on the belief that artificial intelligence could significantly reduce geothermal discovery risk and improve project economics.

“We’ve already confirmed multiple large, previously unknown geothermal resources across the Western U.S., and deeper drilling has validated that these systems can produce far more energy than expected,” Hoiland said.

Investor confidence in geothermal exploration

The funding round represents one of the largest venture investments to date in AI-enabled geothermal resource discovery. Investors highlighted geothermal’s role in providing firm, low-carbon power amid rising electricity demand from industry and data centers.

“Geothermal energy is one of the only immediate ways to serve the enormous and growing demand for firm, clean power,” said Jason Scott, Partner at Spring Lane Capital, who will join Zanskar’s board.

Obvious Ventures Managing Director Andrew Beebe described Zanskar’s team as “fast, disciplined and very effective,” noting that geothermal is gaining renewed attention as a scalable and dependable energy source in the US power mix.

From discovery to power generation

Zanskar states that it has identified more geothermal anomalies in North America than any other company in recent decades, including projects such as Lightning Dock in New Mexico and exploration successes at Pumpernickel and Big Blind in Nevada. We previously reported on Zanskar and you can find a list of news here.

As the company transitions from exploration into construction and operations, it plans to build, own, and operate geothermal power plants as long-term infrastructure assets. Zanskar also noted that it is actively recruiting engineers, developers, and finance professionals to support its expansion.",https://www.thinkgeoenergy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Zanskar-LDG-rig-and-plant-scaled.png,N,,2026-01-21 15:03:42.548217

Canada and Qatar have built strong economic ties over nearly five decades, and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s visit to Doha on January 17, 2026, culminated with the announcement of significant investment by Qatar towards major Canadian infrastructure projects.

Joint statement on infrastructure investments

Following discussions with His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the Prime Minister of Canada and the Amir of Qatar issued a joint statement committing Qatar to strategic investments in large-scale Canadian infrastructure projects. The agreement is intended to accelerate the delivery of major initiatives in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, aerospace, defence, advanced manufacturing, agriculture and agri-food, while strengthening Canada’s industrial capacity and creating thousands of high-quality jobs.

Toward a new investment framework

This summer, Canada and Qatar plan to finalize a Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement (FIPA), providing Canadian companies with greater legal certainty and making it easier to operate in Qatar. The negotiation of FIPA has been stalled between the two nations for several years; the commitment to imminently conclude the agreement will also position Canada favourably to attract investment from Qatar, whose economy is valued at nearly CA$290 billion.

Expanding cooperation across sectors

The two countries also agreed to expand cooperation on trade and investment through a Joint Canada–Qatar Commission on Economic, Commercial, and Technical Cooperation, alongside collaboration in information technology, artificial intelligence, defence and security. Negotiations toward a double-taxation agreement were also announced by the two countries, while Canada will also expand air services, establish a Defence Attaché office in Doha, and cooperate with Qatar on security-related best practices in preparation for the FIFA World Cup 2026.

Strengthening strategic partnerships

During his visit, Prime Minister Carney met with Qatari officials, business leaders and the Qatar Investment Authority to notably advance collaboration in health, biotechnology, AI and technology. Canada and Qatar’s complementary strengths in technology, security and resources were framed as natural synergies that may support major projects in energy, defence and innovation.

While no estimated dollar value of these investments has been released as of yet, such initiative could significantly accelerate Canadian clean energy projects and the development of high-tech infrastructure hubs.

Key takeaways

For businesses and investors, the growing Canada-Qatar partnership presents significant opportunities in large-scale infrastructure and technology projects. Strategic investments are expected to accelerate energy, healthcare, AI and defence initiatives while creating long-term high-quality jobs. The upcoming FIPA and related agreements will provide a legal framework for seamless cross-border investment, reducing barriers for both Canadian and Qatari companies. Clients should monitor developments closely, as the partnership could influence project timelines, investment flows and opportunities to participate in nation-building initiatives across Canada’s priority sectors.

Through the Texas Electricity Power Pulse, TXOGA will continue to deliver fact-based insights on how natural gas and electricity work together to power growth, innovation and environmental progress across the state’s industrial landscape.","The O&G industry is the heart of American energy. It powers value chains that support millions of jobs, drive exports, and keep Texas globally competitive.

Quietly behind the flow of energy products is another critical input: electricity. As operations increasingly electrify to raise efficiency, improve safety, and reduce emissions, dependable electricity is essential.

From drilling sites and pipeline compressor stations to refineries, petrochemical plants and export terminals, electricity powers the systems that keep energy moving. That’s why the Texas Oil & Gas Association (TXOGA) launched the Texas Electricity Power Pulse, a quarterly report tracking trends in the ERCOT power market and spotlighting how natural gas underpins reliability, affordability and growth across the state.

Electricity demand in Texas continues to rise faster than anywhere else in the nation. Strong population growth, industrial expansion and rapid data center additions have driven a 25% increase in total electricity use since 2020. In the third quarter of 2025, ERCOT’s load reached 141,232 GWh, which is equivalent to an average demand of 64 GW, exceeding use in California and Florida combined over the period. This scale reflects the magnitude of Texas’ growth and the challenge to maintain reliability in a system without capacity markets.

For industrial users, a litmus test for reliability comes during periods of ""net peak load,"" that is, electricity demand less the output from intermittent sources. This is a demand that must be met by dispatchable generation, primarily natural gas, nuclear and coal, for the grid to remain stable. In Q3 2025, ERCOT’s net peak load reached as high as 70 GW. Meeting a 70-GW net peak requires instantaneous generation equivalent to powering every refinery, petrochemical complex and LNG terminal along the Gulf Coast, plus every home and business in Houston and Dallas, at the same time.

For the Texas industry, maintaining this level of dependable power requires resources that can ramp quickly and perform under pressure, making natural gas indispensable to ERCOT’s reliability.

Despite Texas’ nation-leading growth of wind and solar, natural gas remains the largest and most reliable power source. In Q3 2025, gas generation supplied 47.6% of total electricity, which was more than all renewable sources combined.

In fact, thermal and other dispatchable units provided at least half of the region’s power over 90% of the time during the quarter, stabilizing the grid whenever renewable output declined and demand rose.

Natural gas and electricity reliability are directly linked. As Texas industries electrify and expand, gas plants deliver the flexibility, speed and scale that renewable resources alone cannot provide. They enable refineries, chemical plants, data centers and manufacturers to operate continuously and safely, even as weather or market conditions shift.

Thanks to record-high production in Q3 2025, Texas produced about four times more natural gas than it required for power generation. TXOGA estimates that Texas averaged 28.2 bcf/d of dry natural gas in Q3 2025, compared with total in-state use of 15.6 bcf/d, including 7.6 bcf/d for industry and 7.3 bcf/d for power generation. Since 2020, as Texas has deployed the most renewable energy sources in the nation, natural gas use in the power sector increased 15%, reflecting its flexible ramping capability, local abundance and cost-effectiveness. Leveraging Texasproduced natural gas supports billions of dollars in industrial investment through cogeneration, combined-cycle plants and on-site power systems that enhance efficiency and resilience for manufacturers, refiners and high-tech industries alike.

Simply put, it’s often underappreciated how important reliable natural gas is to ensuring process safety, operational continuity and the global competitiveness of the facilities that anchor Texas’ economy. Through the Texas Electricity Power Pulse, TXOGA will continue to deliver fact-based insights on how natural gas and electricity work together to power growth, innovation and environmental progress across the state’s industrial landscape.",https://www.bicmagazine.com/downloads/28828/download/Plant%20Stock.png?cb=c9d9803cc749180f1a366dc61687141a&w=1200,N,,2026-01-21 15:59:45.917605

How you can take action for clean energy and clean air Clean energy transitions happen at every level—from households to governments.","Solar energy is the most abundant of all energy resources on planet Earth. Solar energy is also one of the most powerful tools available to reduce air pollution and cut greenhouse gas emissions at their source. Unlike coal, oil, and gas, solar energy generates electricity without releasing fine particulate matter (PM2.5) or nitrogen oxides into the air. This makes it uniquely important not only for climate action, but for protecting public health—especially in communities burdened by pollution.

Yet despite its promise, solar energy is often misunderstood. Persistent myths about cost, reliability, and feasibility have slowed adoption, even as technology improves and prices fall. Understanding what’s fact, what’s fiction, and what challenges remain is key to scaling solar responsibly and equitably.

What is solar energy and why is it better for air quality?

Solar energy is a form of renewable energy that comes from naturally replenished sunlight and generates electricity without releasing harmful air pollutants, like PM2.5, that are linked to asthma, heart disease, and premature death.

Solar and other clean energy solutions are becoming increasingly accessible. Today, renewable power is the most affordable source of electricity in much of the world, with over 90% of new renewable projects costing less than fossil fuel alternatives. Because renewable resources are available in every country, they reduce dependence on imported fuels and help protect communities from volatile energy prices and supply disruptions.

Most importantly, solar energy directly improves air quality. By replacing fossil fuel combustion with clean power, communities cut pollution at the source—reducing exposure, improving public health, and lowering healthcare costs. This is why clean energy plays a critical role not only in addressing climate change, but in helping people breathe cleaner air every day (1).

Among all clean energy sources, solar power offers one of the most scalable and widely accessible paths to cleaner air.

Solar energy: Myths

Solar energy is still surrounded by misconceptions such as how it actually works—and what challenges remain.

Myth: Solar power is unreliable or too expensive

Though global solar capacity is growing, a persistent myth has slowed adoption: that solar power is unreliable or prohibitively expensive (2).

In reality, solar energy is now the cheapest source of electricity in most regions of the world. Advances in technology and sharp declines in cost have made solar more efficient and accessible than ever. Between 2021 and 2025, solar capacity grew faster than any other renewable source, with costs now lower than coal or natural gas in many markets (3).

Myth: Solar power only works when it’s sunny

It’s true that solar panels produce the most electricity under direct sunlight—but solar doesn’t stop working when clouds roll in. Because panels generate power from light, not heat, they can still produce electricity on cloudy, rainy, or snowy days, just at reduced output. In fact, solar panels often perform efficiently in cooler conditions, since excessive heat can reduce performance.

For times when the sun isn’t shining, batteries can store excess energy generated during the day and provide backup power. And for most households, rooftop solar is still connected to the electric grid, meaning the home can draw power from the grid when solar production is low. Together, these systems help make solar a reliable part of everyday energy use, even when the weather isn’t perfect. (4).

Solar energy: Facts

Fact: Solar is the most abundant energy source on Earth

Solar energy is by far the most abundant source of energy on the planet (5). The amount of solar energy reaching Earth in one hour exceeds global energy demand for an entire year.

This abundance, combined with falling costs, makes solar a cornerstone of clean energy transitions worldwide—especially in regions seeking affordable, locally available power.

Fact: Solar is inexpensive and generates zero air pollution emissions

Solar energy often delivers electricity at a lower cost than new coal or natural gas plants—even without subsidies—according to annual analyses (6).

And once installed, solar panels generate electricity without releasing PM2.5, nitrogen oxides, or other harmful air pollutants. This means solar cuts pollution at its source while providing affordable power over decades.

While manufacturing solar panels requires energy and materials, multiple lifecycle analyses show that most systems produce the energy used in their manufacture within one to four years.

As solar technology scales and recycling programs expand, both costs and environmental impacts continue to decline—making solar not only one of the cleanest energy sources, but also one of the most affordable paths to reducing air pollution and protecting public health (7).

Solar energy: Challenges

Challenge: Energy storage and responsible battery supply chains

One key challenge for solar energy is storage. Supplying electricity when the sun isn’t shining requires hybrid systems that rely on batteries to store excess energy generated during the day.

Battery production relies on mining materials such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel, raising concerns about environmental impacts and labor conditions in mining regions (8). Meeting these challenges will require responsible sourcing, improved recycling, and stronger labor protections—so solar’s clean-air benefits are not achieved at the expense of people or ecosystems elsewhere.

Challenge: Land use and wildlife impacts

Large solar facilities can require significant land area, and poorly sited projects may fragment habitats or disrupt local wildlife—especially in sensitive ecosystems. These risks can be reduced through careful siting (such as on already disturbed land, rooftops, or parking structures), strong environmental assessments, and mitigation measures like wildlife-friendly fencing, bird deterrents, and vegetation planning.

Done responsibly, solar can scale while minimizing harm to biodiversity (9).

Dual benefits: Climate action and cleaner air

Solar power—often deployed alongside wind—cuts greenhouse gas emissions and reduces air pollutants linked to respiratory and cardiovascular disease.

These reductions deliver real-world benefits. Uruguay, for example, now generates nearly 99% of its electricity from renewables, stabilizing energy costs and sharply reducing fossil fuel pollution—while creating tens of thousands of clean energy jobs (10).

How much has the air quality in Uruguay’s capital city, Montevideo, improved? PM2.5 noticeably decreased from an average concentration of 14.2 µg/m3 in 2021 to 11.5 µg/m3 in 2024.

Uruguay is far from alone. China has significantly reduced its PM2.5 concentrations over a decade, in part through clean energy policies (11)(12). As one example, Beijing’s average concentration of 58.8 µg/m3 in 2017 declined to 30.9 µg/m3 in 2024.

In April 2025, wind and solar power generated more than a quarter of the country’s electricity for the first time on record (13). Solar’s capacity has rapidly risen from a mere 4.1% share of China’s electrical mix in April 2020 to 12.4% by April 2025.

How you can take action for clean energy and clean air

Clean energy transitions happen at every level—from households to governments.

Here are ways different groups can take meaningful action:

Individuals

Reduce home energy use and choose energy-efficient appliances.

Support renewable energy providers or community solar programs where available.

Stay informed about local air quality and energy sources to make healthier daily decisions.

Communities

Advocate for clean cooking programs, electrification, and renewable energy access.

Support local initiatives that reduce fossil fuel dependence and air pollution.

Encourage air quality monitoring to make pollution visible and actionable.

Businesses

Commit to renewable energy sourcing and improved energy efficiency.

Install elevated solar canopies over parking lots to both cool off vehicles and reduce building energy costs.

Reduce emissions across operations, logistics, and supply chains.

Invest in clean technologies that protect workers, customers, and surrounding communities.

Governments

Expand renewable energy investment and grid access (with shorter distances).

Accelerate clean cooking and electrification programs in underserved regions.

Align energy and air quality policies to protect vulnerable populations.

Together, these actions help ensure that the transition to clean energy delivers cleaner air, healthier communities, and a more equitable future.

Clean energy and clean air are deeply connected—and progress on one strengthens progress on the other.

Conclusion

Reducing reliance on fossil fuels cuts pollution at its source—helping people breathe cleaner air while protecting the planet. Solar energy, in particular, offers a powerful path forward by delivering clean electricity without the air pollutants that harm health, while expanding access to affordable energy.

And PJM Interconnection, which manages the grid from the Mid-Atlantic to the Midwest, has said Dominion's offshore wind project is a critical source of new electricity.","Late last month, the Trump administration halted construction on billions of dollars worth of offshore wind projects after the Defense Department allegedly raised new national security concerns about the facilities. But no one outside the federal government seems to know what sort of threats the administration has found. So far, the government has been unwilling to release that information even to the companies building the projects.

The Interior Department sent stop-work orders on December 22 to the developers of five wind projects off the East Coast. The orders were based on classified reports recently completed by the Defense Department. The Interior Department said pausing construction would give federal agencies time to work with project developers to try to mitigate potential risks.

Companies building infrastructure projects routinely work with the federal government to deal with issues that regulators raise, including around national security. Without information about newly-discovered threats, companies building the wind projects have said in court filings that they can't address the government's concerns. They said the lack of transparency suggests the administration's goal is to block wind projects, rather than to deal with legitimate national security issues.

Dominion Energy, which is building a wind project off the Virginia coast, said in a court filing that the government's unspecified national security concerns are ""pretext for this Administration's purely political and irrational campaign against wind energy.""

A White House spokesperson, Taylor Rogers, said in a statement that U.S. industries, including the defense sector, ""cannot depend on the most expensive and unreliable form of energy."" The Interior and Justice departments declined to comment. The Defense Department didn't respond to messages seeking comment.

Blocking offshore wind could drive up power prices by restricting new sources of electricity at a time when demand is expected to soar. Trying to kill federally-permitted projects also risks stifling business investment in the United States, across industries.

""It's a big problem, and it impacts the ability of companies to have confidence to invest in the United States,"" says Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, which represents the offshore oil, gas and wind industries.

Security claims are the administration's latest move against wind energy

The projects targeted by the stop-work orders are Vineyard Wind off the coast of Massachusetts; Revolution Wind offshore Rhode Island; Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind off the coast of New York; and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind. All of the wind farms are far along in construction, with Vineyard Wind 95% complete. Together, the projects would generate enough electricity to power more than 2.5 million homes.

The companies have argued that the government's stop-work orders were ""arbitrary and capricious,"" among other alleged violations of federal law. So far, federal judges have ruled that three of the wind farms targeted by the Trump administration — projects off the coasts of Rhode Island, New York and Virginia — can resume construction while their lawsuits against the government continue.

It's not unusual for presidents to intervene in energy markets. The fossil fuel industry has long complained that it's been targeted by Democrats. Former President Joe Biden, for example, revoked a key permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline as part of his administration's efforts to limit climate change.

However, the Trump administration's latest moves seem more extreme than what presidents have done in the past, according to energy analysts and stakeholders.

Trump has railed against wind energy after he lost a fight with an offshore project near one of his golf courses in Scotland more than a decade ago. ""My goal is to not let any windmills be built,"" President Trump said at a recent White House meeting with oil executives.

The stop-work orders that the Interior Department sent out in December are the administration's latest effort to hobble the industry in the U.S.

Over the past year, the government has refused to issue new permits and has cancelled hundreds of millions in federal funding for ports that serve as assembly and staging areas for offshore projects. And over the summer, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum directed his staff to examine the impact that offshore wind farms could have on ""military readiness."" About a month later, in August, the Interior Department tried, unsuccessfully, to stop construction of a wind project off the coast of Rhode Island based on alleged national security concerns.

It's long been known that the spinning turbines of a wind farm can interfere with radar, obscuring legitimate targets and creating the appearance of false ones. But projects face extensive vetting by federal regulators, including military officials. And there are ways to limit the risk. Dominion Energy, for example, which is building the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project, agreed to pay for radar upgrades at the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). And Sunrise Wind has agreed to curtail operations at NORAD's request.

However, in November, the Defense Department shared new classified information with the Interior Department about security risks surrounding offshore wind, said Matthew Giacona, principal deputy director of the Interior Department's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, in a recent court filing.

It's unclear what the Defense Department found. Giacona said the assessment included ""a discussion of the rapid evolution of relevant adversarial technologies and the direct impacts to national security that arise from the construction and operation of offshore wind projects"" near early-warning and radar systems.

In a separate court filing that was heavily redacted, Dale Marks, a deputy undersecretary in the Defense Department, said the classified material related to an updated assessment of how offshore wind turbines could interfere with military radar.

The stakes are high for regions slated to get electricity from offshore wind

Companies building the wind farms have said in lawsuits that the government has blocked their efforts to get more information. A week after the Trump administration paused construction, a team from Sunrise Wind, including employees with security clearances, met with BOEM officials to try to resolve the government's concerns, according to the company's lawsuit. However, BOEM failed to arrange a classified briefing, Sunrise Wind said, adding that the government ""has taken no real steps"" to share details about alleged security risks. Other companies have described similar interactions with the government.

The administration ""can't just say 'national security,' file a secret report and call it a day,"" James Auslander, a lawyer for Dominion, told a federal judge at a hearing on Friday.

A DOJ lawyer, Stanley Woodward, said at the Friday hearing that the department hasn't politicized the process. The DOJ doesn't plan to share classified information with Dominion or Sunrise Wind during litigation, according to court filings.

""It would appear, when you see the sequencing of events, that [the stop-work orders are] more related to an administration agenda that doesn't want to see offshore wind move forward"" rather than to national security risks, says Milito of the National Ocean Industries Association.

ISO New England, which manages the electric grid across six northeastern states, has said cancelling or delaying two offshore wind farms in the area would drive up power costs by an unspecified amount and jeopardize electric reliability. And PJM Interconnection, which manages the grid from the Mid-Atlantic to the Midwest, has said Dominion's offshore wind project is a critical source of new electricity.

The stakes are also high for companies that have invested billions into projects that now face an uncertain future.

""It's no secret the president has a personal animus toward wind farms,"" Auslander, the Dominion lawyer, said at the Friday hearing. Now, he said, Dominion's project is ""caught in that net.""

By signing CRGA, Illinois aims to address “rising electricity costs driven by private grid operators,” expand cost-saving energy resources, and advance the state’s clean energy economy.
The energy storage target is to have resources deployed or contracted by December 31, 2030.
Illinois is a leader in community solar installations, ranking fifth among states for community solar development.
JB Pritzker stated, “The Clean Reliable Grid Affordability Act sets a national standard for efforts to lower energy costs and marks a historic advancement of our clean energy vision.","Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has signed a clean energy bill that will promote investment in solar photovoltaic and energy storage, among other initiatives, in the state.

This new legislation, titled the Clean Reliable Grid Affordability Act (CRGA, SB 25), builds upon two prior pieces of legislation supporting renewable energy: the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA) passed in 2021, which aims for 100% clean energy by 2050. Since CEJA’s passage, Illinois has supported the deployment of over 6 GW of renewable energy, with an additional 6 GW under development.

By signing CRGA, Illinois aims to address “rising electricity costs driven by private grid operators,” expand cost-saving energy resources, and advance the state’s clean energy economy. The legislation will take effect on June 1, 2026.

To reduce energy costs, the law sets targets, including establishing a state procurement of 3 GW of grid-scale battery storage by 2030; creating virtual power plant (VPP) programs by utilities, enabling households with solar panels, batteries, and electric vehicles to participate; and launching an integrated resource planning (IRP) process designed to identify cost-effective ways to keep energy bills low and make necessary adjustments to state-level programs.

These measures aim to lower energy costs. Programs within the legislation will also require utilities to promote energy equity for low-income households.

Furthermore, CRGA seeks to drive the clean energy economy, create new jobs, and accelerate the construction of new energy projects across the state.

This will be achieved by exploring new clean energy opportunities, such as directing the Illinois Power Agency (IPA) to propose long-term procurement agreements; enacting a Solar Bill of Rights to ensure residents served by municipal and cooperative utilities can install rooftop solar panels; and reforming clean energy siting to facilitate the expansion of energy storage projects.

The Illinois General Assembly passed the bill in October last year, after which it was sent to Pritzker to be signed into law. The energy storage target is to have resources deployed or contracted by December 31, 2030. The bill also directs the state to undertake energy storage procurements for electric companies. As reported by Energy-Storage.news, the bill includes energy storage targets and was warmly welcomed by consumer and environmental advocacy groups as well as clean energy industry organizations when it passed the state legislature.

The legislation will also benefit community solar development in Illinois by raising the maximum project size to 10 MW. According to the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, the state passed its first community solar legislation in 2016. Since then, as of the third quarter of 2025, Illinois has added 444 MW of community solar capacity. Illinois is a leader in community solar installations, ranking fifth among states for community solar development.

JB Pritzker stated, “The Clean Reliable Grid Affordability Act sets a national standard for efforts to lower energy costs and marks a historic advancement of our clean energy vision. Once again, Illinois is stepping up where the federal government has not.”

According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), Illinois is one of the top U.S. states for projected growth in the coming years. SEIA forecasts 14.6 GW of new solar photovoltaic capacity over the next five years, ranking fourth nationally. This would more than double the state’s current installed solar PV, which stood at 6.5 GW by the end of the third quarter of 2025.",https://www.solarbeglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/5.png,N,,2026-01-21 14:01:11.280418

The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) is hosting a virtual meeting series about ongoing actions and efforts to protect, educate, and assist New York communities in addressing the ubiquitous threat of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The webinars will focus on the PFAS Rural Background Study, treatment of landfill leachate, wastewater treatment guidance, sampling of PFAS in biosolids, and drinking water policy.

“Governor Kathy Hochul’s State of the State outlined a number of key priorities for protecting New York’s environment, including the development of new regulations to address PFAS contamination and protect New York communities,” DEC Commissioner Amanda Lefton said. “Public input is critical to the success of the State’s ongoing progress, and we encourage New Yorkers to participate in upcoming opportunities to help guide these important efforts forward.”

Governor Kathy Hochul’s 2026 State of the State directed DEC to develop draft regulations to instruct landfills to treat leachate for harmful contaminants at the source before discharge and provide funding for local governments to comply (more information is available on page 65 (PDF)). Development of regulations to treat landfill leachate at the source will better protect the environment, drinking water sources, and save taxpayers millions in future cleanup costs. DEC is drafting regulations that will instruct landfills to treat leachate for harmful contaminants at the source before discharge to wastewater treatment plants and will provide funding for local governments to comply. Information sessions specifically about the leachate initiative are scheduled for January 27 and February 11, 2026.

In December, DEC issued a suite of significant new actions and helpful resources to protect, educate, and assist New York communities in addressing the ubiquitous threat of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) contamination. This includes a new progress report detailing New York State’s leadership in addressing PFAS; released a new study detailing the widespread presence of PFAS on the landscape; finalized important wastewater treatment plant guidance that protects drinking water and other surface waters; proposed new policies directing DEC’s actions in PFAS investigations and sampling of biosolids products; and launched a new webpage – dec.ny.gov/pfas – that provides a one-stop resource about these and other initiatives and information about DEC’s multifaceted efforts to address PFAS. These topics and the leachate initiative will be addressed at the January 29 information session being held in cooperation with the State Department of Health.

DEC is also hosting a virtual webinar on February 4 outlining the rulemaking process to draft a proposal regulating PFAS in recycled biosolids to determine the long-term management processes and standards related to biosolids-derived soil amendments.

Coal-fired power plants are the largest industrial source of toxic water pollution in the United States, releasing heavy metals like arsenic, lead, mercury, and selenium.
Toxic heavy metals from coal-fired power plant wastewater cause severe human health problems, including cancer, reproductive impacts and lowered IQ among children.","WASHINGTON— The Center for Biological Diversity sued the Trump Environmental Protection Agency over its final rule to weaken, and extend until 2035, national standards that limit or eliminate toxic water pollution from coal-fired power plants, including mercury, selenium, and arsenic.

The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, also contests the EPA’s decision to take no enforcement actions against coal-fired power plants that fail to come into compliance with deadlines set in the agency’s 2020 and 2024 Rules.

“This grotesque action by Administrator Zeldin and the Trump EPA will make polluting corporations richer and Americans sicker,” said Hannah Connor, a senior attorney at the Center. “It’s disgusting that coal power plants have the technology and money needed to clean up their act, but their quarterly profits are more important to them than children’s health. We won’t stand for this immoral and illegal maneuver.”

Beyond delaying compliance with pollution-elimination deadlines, the EPA rule allows power plants that had previously committed to closing down to remain operational without updating their pollution-control standards until the later compliance dates. During that time the coal plants will not be required to take additional action to reduce discharges of heavy metal water pollution into the nation’s waters. The EPA has halso signaled that the postponed deadline for updating the pollution limits could be extended further in the future or eliminated entirely.

Coal-fired power plants are the largest industrial source of toxic water pollution in the United States, releasing heavy metals like arsenic, lead, mercury, and selenium. These plants also discharge high levels of nutrients, bromide and other harmful pollutants.

Toxic heavy metals from coal-fired power plant wastewater cause severe human health problems, including cancer, reproductive impacts and lowered IQ among children.

Power-plant wastewater discharges have also damaged aquatic ecosystems, made it unsafe to eat fish from many rivers and streams, contaminated the lakes and rivers where people swim, and increased treatment costs for drinking-water systems.

Dozens of endangered species, including Atlantic sturgeon, hellbender salamanders, sea turtles, and freshwater mussels will also be harmed by increased heavy metal pollution.

“Trump and Zeldin’s outrageous push to turn our nation’s waterways into industrial sewers will poison thousands of miles of rivers with toxic heavy metals for another decade or more,” said Connor. “This blatant violation of the Endangered Species Act will be a disaster for bald eagles, hellbender salamanders, tiny crayfish, and countless other plants and animals.”

Under the Clean Water Act, coal plants are supposed to be required to use the most modern and effective pollution control technology available before discharging toxic wastewater. The Trump action delays a 2024 Biden-era rule that would have brought nearly all power plants into full compliance with the Act no later than 2029 or required retirement of coal plants that could not meet the standards of the Act.",https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/images/center-frog-logo-300.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 11:04:56.586156

The concession was granted by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources through a competitive tender process involving four qualified bidders. It provides Ormat with long-term rights to explore and develop the resource.

The Telaga Ranu project is located on the island of Halmahera in the province of North Maluku and lies within Indonesia’s highest government-approved feed-in tariff zone. According to the planning documents of the state-owned utility PT PLN (RUPTL), the area has a potential of up to 40 MW of baseload-capable geothermal capacity. Development by the end of 2030 is intended to help replace diesel-based power generation and strengthen energy security in the region.

Ormat views the award as a strategic expansion of its project pipeline in Indonesia. CEO Doron Blachar stated: “The award of the Telaga Ranu geothermal concession represents a significant step in strengthening our development pipeline and highlights our confidence in Indonesia’s long-term geothermal potential. We believe this site has the potential to add up to 40MW to our exploration pipeline, bringing the total to approximately 200MW, in addition to the 59MW associated with our operating asset.”

As part of its energy transition, Indonesia aims to significantly expand renewable energy and reduce emissions. Due to the country’s geological conditions, geothermal energy plays a central role in this strategy. Projects such as Telaga Ranu are considered key building blocks for supplying remote regions with reliable, renewable energy.

Ormat Technologies has more than 50 years of experience in the geothermal sector. The company has developed, manufactured, and built power plants with a total gross capacity of approximately 3,600 MW, which are either owned by Ormat or installed worldwide by utilities and project developers.

The company’s shares, listed in the renewable energy stock index RENIXX World, are currently trading at €100.10, continuing their upward trajectory. In 2025, Ormat’s share price has risen by a total of 47 percent.

It has twice been named the number one city in America for clean energy.

Yet in 2019 the federal Environmental Protection Agency ordered the city to take action to limit its alleged contamination of the Pacific Ocean. In oral arguments before the US Supreme Court, the EPA’s lawyer condemned the city’s ‘decades-long failure’ to update its sanitation systems. This order came on top of an existing mandate requiring San Francisco to spend almost $11 billion, or $13,000 for every man, woman, and child in the city, updating its sewage systems.

San Francisco and other cities in a similar situation are not delinquent on sanitation. Instead, the EPA is setting water mandates that far exceed what even the most progressive cities think is necessary. These mandates drive up the cost of water, stymie housing, and burden city budgets.

Americans open a tap and get water much like their parents and grandparents did, but the price of water and sewer for households has more than doubled since the early 1980s, adjusted for inflation. American households in large cities now spend about $1,300 a year on water and sewer charges, even though per-capita use has actually decreased.

The roots of America’s water problems lie in the 1970s. Since the Clean Water Act of 1972 and the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, federal environmental rules have ratcheted up. Although state and local water systems had spent the previous century implementing massive improvements in water quality, national regulators treated these systems, supervised by local voters, as delinquent and needing prodding to reform.

Water policy parallels nuclear power, similarly forcing operators to reduce risks, no matter how trivial, and increasing costs to the point where nuclear is expensive and seldom used. This is another example of ‘safetyism’, the tacit ideology that the government’s main goal should be to minimize risks rather than balance them against benefits.

The triumph of urban water

The broad-based provision of clean water in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is one of the great successes in the history of civilization. The US, as did many other countries, accomplished this primarily through local government.

For most of history, cities were demographic sinks. More people died in them than were born, so they needed constant replenishment by migrants from the countryside. Urban areas remained deadly even into the early twentieth century. In 1900, infectious disease death rates were 75 percent higher in the largest American cities than in rural areas. Pathogens, especially waterborne ones such as cholera, typhoid fever, and dysentery, caused 40 percent of these deaths. Yet just three decades later the largest urban areas had slightly lower death rates from infectious diseases than rural areas did, with infectious diseases now causing only 15 percent of deaths.

By the 1940s, infant mortality had collapsed, long before the massive scaleup of penicillin production during the Second World War. Researchers tried to tease out the different mortality rate impacts of introducing new water technologies, such as filtration and chlorination, by looking at how mortality rates dropped in different cities in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Different technologies were installed in different cities at different times, but waterborne disease mortality dropped in almost every city very soon after water treatment was installed. The researchers concluded that half the overall mortality, two thirds of the child mortality, and three quarters of the infant mortality reduction in the early twentieth century were down to clean water.

These clean water successes resulted from patient and dedicated work by policymakers and scientists. A few decades after cities began installing large, publicly owned water systems in the mid-nineteenth century, governments and private individuals made a concerted effort to clean them.

In 1872, Poughkeepsie, New York opened the nation’s first ‘slow sand’ or ‘English’ filter, which allowed water to trickle through fine-grain sand beds that absorbed most solids and many pollutants. Thirteen years later, Somerville, New Jersey created the first urban ‘rapid-sand’ or ‘American’, which pushed water through coarser sand and gravel for faster cleaning and allowed frequent backwashing to prevent the build-up of pollutants. In the early twentieth century the chlorination of water allowed water systems to use minute amounts of chemicals to kill massive amounts of bacteria.

Beginning around the time of the Civil War, cities such as Chicago started creating comprehensive sewers, with ‘intercepting’ sewer lines to collect dirty water from multiple places and drop it farther away from residents. Chicago’s downtown was raised an entire story with jackscrews to allow their installation. Chicago later took this further by building the Sanitary and Ship Canal, reversing the Chicago River’s flow to bring the sewage away from drinking water intake pipes in Lake Michigan.

In the early twentieth century, cities began creating sewage treatment plants, which used chemical coagulants, often from aluminum salts, to bind and settle solid contaminants like feces. These cities began to use ‘activated sludge’ treatment, employing bacteria to decompose feces and other organic matter. The treated water was then piped to a clarifying tank, to separate the clean water from the bacteria-laden sludge that settled at the bottom of the tank.

These modifications were driven primarily by local governments, but states also pushed for improved water quality. In 1878, Massachusetts passed a pioneering water control pollution law that forbade cities or industry from dumping human waste or pollutants into rivers and lakes and gave the state board of health authority to examine water quality and stop polluters. Nine years later, the board established the Lawrence Experiment Station, the world’s first water-pollution research center.

The growth of these local and state systems of water provision and pollution control was an unalloyed triumph that created our familiar urban world.

Nationalizing water problems

The original drive for cleaner water involved hundreds of cities and thousands of politicians, engineers, voters, and activists pushing to improve their systems while weighing the costs and benefits of new public works. This changed in the 1970s: the issue was centralized, and the locals who benefited from and paid for water improvements lost control.

In 1969, the oil-laden Cuyahoga River in Cleveland caught fire. This had happened repeatedly over the preceding decades, and this particular fire was extinguished in half an hour. But it received national media attention, including inspiring a popular Randy Newman song, ‘Burn On’. This event and others, including an oil spill that had coated beaches in Santa Barbara that year, convinced activists that state and local governments were derelict in their duty to protect their citizens’ water.

Two Senate staffers, Tom Jorling, a Republican, and Leon Billings, a Democrat, were concerned enough to seek the nationalization of America’s water policy. The bill they helped write turned water from a state and local concern into a federal one. As historian Terence Kehoe said, the ‘staff members who worked on the bill generally scorned state water pollution control officials’ and worked with activists around Ralph Nader to centralize policy in Washington. ‘These activists helped shape the bill.’

What became known as the Clean Water Act of 1972 mandated new pollutant standards for surface waters, such as rivers and lakes, enforceable through a national system that required permits for sewer or pollutant discharges into waters. Two years later, after an Environmental Defense Fund study using disputed methods claimed a ‘significant relationship’ between drinking water contaminants and cancer deaths around New Orleans, Congress passed the Safe Drinking Water Act to set the federal standards for drinking water. President Gerald Ford expressed concern about ‘extensive Federal involvement in what has traditionally been state and local regulatory matters’, but the weakened post-Watergate president signed the bill.

In economics textbooks, pollution is treated as the quintessential externality that the government needs to control. The goal of government pollution control is to force polluters to bear the costs and consequences of their behavior so that they will only pollute if it’s more valuable to them an than harmful to society.

Because nearly all benefits of clean water are local, and because local governments already supervised water, the argument for federal control was and remains weak. The EPA says that ‘the costs and benefits of cleaner water are realized initially at the local level’ and that ‘changes in the quality of water resources . . . occur in fairly localized areas’. One study found that an increase in biochemical oxygen demand, an indication of the decomposition of organic material, from industrial plant or sewage plant discharges, led to a reduction of just 0.001 milligrams per liter in dissolved oxygen several miles downstream, which the authors note is a small effect and reflects the extent of ‘natural attenuation with travel distance’. For comparison, typical dissolved oxygen levels are about eight milligrams per liter.

Previous state and local governments had voted to invest massive amounts in improved water quality and water safety. One year prior to the Cuyahoga fire, Cleveland voters had approved a $100 million bond to fund a cleanup of their waters. Even areas where water flowed between states, such as the Ohio River, were dealt with by interstate compacts – where states balanced costs and benefits. The federalization movement shifted the calculus so that many localities were forced to do things, supposedly for their own benefit, that they didn’t judge as worthwhile.

Dirty water seems to have an emotional impact other pollution issues don’t. While one would be hard pressed to name a single Hollywood motion picture about local air pollutants, since the 1990s there have been multiple blockbusters focused on local water pollution: Erin Brockovich, Promised Land, Dark Waters, A Civil Action, and so forth. The public has ranked the pollution of drinking water as their number one environmental concern for decades, higher than climate change, species extinction, or local air pollution. This concern has led federal politicians and regulators to impose water mandates on state and local governments that those same voters reject when asked to pay the costs from their own pocketbook.

The impact of new mandates

Today, the average urban household in America pays about $1,300 a year for water and sewers, close to the $1,600 they spend on electricity. In San Francisco, even before the new sewer mandates went into effect, water rates were about $3,600 a year. Local governments spend more on building and maintaining their water and sewer systems than they do on policing.

The main reason for high water charges is federal mandates. The US, largely through federal mandates and subsidies, has spent about $5 trillion, in contemporary dollars, to fight water pollution since 1970, about 0.8 percent of the annual GDP in that period. This effort makes clean water ‘arguably the most expensive environmental investment in US history’, according to one study, far more than air pollution regulations.

Yet the EPA finds that the one category of environmental regulation where estimated costs exceed benefits is surface water regulations. The EPA does say that most of its drinking water mandates have benefits that exceed the costs, but, as one study showed, ‘these determinations were unsupported by the Agency’s own regulatory impact analyses’. The EPA analyses found that for many of the regulated dangers ‘the risks may be as low as zero’, but argued that potential risks should be treated as probable ones.

EPA water mandates have had a massive impact on costs in many urban centers. New York City is famous for having the ‘champagne of drinking water’ due to its numerous reservoirs with surrounding green space. For almost all of its history, the city’s water was unfiltered. But the EPA sued the city in 1997 to force it to filter the water from its famous Croton aqueduct to reduce the prevalence of two minor parasites that could live in the water.

The city was required to build a new plant. By the time the plant opened in 2015, it had taken a decade longer than expected and its cost more than doubled from its original estimate, to $3.2 billion. The project was riddled with accusations of fraud and waste. A Democratic New York state assembly member said ‘one day the Croton Filtration Plant will be right up there with the Tweed courthouse as far as mammoth examples of municipal waste’. Other federal mandates on water also added up. By 2013, the Bloomberg administration announced that it had spent $20 billion on water projects in total over the previous decade.

It is not clear how much New York’s spending accomplished. The city’s Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection noted that although the investments were massive, to the public the water would basically be ‘the same’. Infections from the two microscopic parasites the EPA was attempting to address were higher after the plants opened. A review from The National Academies noted that it was hard to measure the effects because the parasites were so rare to begin with: in 2015 there were about one thousand reported cases across both parasites, from 360 billion gallons of drinking water serving eight million New Yorkers, two million commuters, and nearly 40 million tourists – and they typically resulted in minor gastrointestinal pain.

Despite the lack of clear health benefits, the new mandates help explain why the water rate in New York City rose from under $2 per 100 cubic feet in the mid-1990s to almost $4 per 100 cubic feet in 2015, both in inflation-adjusted dollars. New York City’s water debt had increased to 25 percent of all city debt by the time of the pandemic.

Other places found themselves in worse situations. Jefferson County, Alabama, was forced by the EPA in the 1990s to rework its sewer system and stop sewage overflows into nearby rivers during storms. The county’s sewer debt grew from $300 million to over $3 billion by 2004. In 2011, after some financial engineering attempts to escape the burden went awry, the county descended into bankruptcy, at that point the largest municipal bankruptcy in US history. The average household sewer bill had increased by over 350 percent even before the bankruptcy and has continued increasing since. The rapid increase in EPA sewer lawsuits against cities led the US Conference of Mayors to ask the Obama administration to halt enforcement.

The EPA keeps imposing new rules with questionable benefits. In 2009, it finalized the Aircraft Drinking Water rule, requiring airlines to spend millions of dollars a year treating their water systems despite not having received any reports of illness and having come up with no quantifiable benefits. It recently finalized a rule to require sewer plants that could accidentally emit waste to create ‘Facility Response Plans’. The EPA estimated the cost of this paperwork exercise at more than $100 million a year. The benefits, meanwhile, were only ‘assessed qualitatively’.

In April of last year, the EPA finalized a rule to limit PFAS, so-called ‘forever chemicals’, in drinking water, based on an estimate that it would benefit local consumers of water by $1,549.4 million and cost water systems $1,548.6 million. It may seem suspicious that EPA found benefits that just infinitesimally exceed costs. The American Water Works Association estimates the costs are twice as high.

In water, as in many other fields, such as the ‘As Low As Reasonably Achievable’ radiation standard in nuclear facilities, the federal government has attempted to eliminate almost any risk whatsoever, whatever the cost. The Clean Water Act aims to reduce pollutant discharges to the ‘maximum extent practicable’ and the EPA has continually increased the standard it judges to be practicable. In the Safe Drinking Water Act, the goal has been to reduce pollutants to the lowest extent ‘feasible’ given costs and technology, and again what is considered feasible has been continuously increased. The difference with water is that the federal government is imposing costs not on private parties who supposedly ignore the effects of externalities on fellow citizens, but on the locally accountable bodies that citizens elect.

How water regulation reshapes the landscape

When the Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water Acts passed, observers thought changes to the technology of sewer treatment and water filtering would solve most of the nation’s water problems. But soon environmental officials realized that technological mandates would not be enough to achieve their goals. Thus, courts and federal regulators have tried to limit the use of water.

The year after the Clean Water Act’s passage, a court in Virginia said that Fairfax County could not issue any building permits that would create new sewer flows that further impacted water quality. The judge said that ‘control over building permits is the safest and best way to prevent pollution’. The EPA in the 1970s referred to ‘the ubiquitous sewer moratorium’ spreading across the nation after the Clean Water Act. It issued guidelines that encouraged governments, at pain of losing their federal subsidies, to create schedules for water and sewer hookups that would ‘prevent [urban] growth from exceeding’ the capacity of the systems. These water and sewer moratoria were a major reason for the success of the anti-urban growth movement of that decade.

Today, the EPA or delegated state regulators can mandate complete moratoria on connections to sewer systems if they believe sewer services don’t meet their standards. For instance, Dunn in North Carolina remains under a sewer moratorium imposed in 2021 due to supposed sewer overflow issues. It will have to spend tens of millions of dollars on new sewer treatments to remove it. The town of Epping in New Hampshire also remains under a moratorium imposed in 2022 for similar issues.

Due to the EPA’s high thresholds, sewer and water quality mandates are effective curbs on growth because cities can’t meet the costs of water treatment that come from new residents. Water utilities and local governments often create ‘urban service boundaries’, beyond which new water and sewer hookups are not allowed.

EPA rules mandate certain water quality standards in watersheds, yet such standards are not typically adjusted for population. This means any amount of growth in an area can make it fail the standards, even if blocking growth would just push the population and pollution to other areas. Even inside watersheds, moratoria on hookups often result in lower density and more polluting development attached to well water and septic tanks. (The UK is struggling with a similar issue where a requirement that new developments add literally no nutrient levels in rivers is blocking hundreds of thousands of otherwise-permissioned homes.)

The federal government has come to see part of its environmental mandate as discouraging water use in general. As required by the 1996 Safe Drinking Water Amendments, the EPA issues water conservation ‘guidelines’ that can be incorporated into the mandates for utilities receiving federal assistance. As an EPA official wrote in 2006, ‘Recognizing the need to reduce water use is the first step in developing a strategic plan’ for water utilities.

The federal government has pushed water utilities to use what is known as increasing block pricing, where the first few thousand gallons of water consumed by a household cost the least, the next cost more, and so forth. The goal is conserving water use, since the assumption in many parts of the environmental community is that water is a limited resource that should be kept out of taps as much as possible. Although this rate structure may look like a classic economic way to reduce waste, it poorly reflects the true costs of water systems.

Hooking up and maintaining pipes to a single customer is costly, but a little extra water delivered each month usually isn’t. As one water company president told Congress, ‘the cost structures of utilities are usually inversely related to our revenue structures, and by that I mean that 70 percent of our costs are fixed, but usually 70 percent of the revenues are a risk on consumption. If you have inclining or increasing block rates . . . [that] represents a real threat to the utility recovering the true cost of delivering the water service’. The mismatch between federally encouraged prices and costs has made water systems more reluctant to expand.

Limiting household water consumption is necessary in the short-run during droughts, or in a few truly dry places, but that’s it. The proportion of America’s water use reserved for public drinking water systems is less than 15 percent, even though this kind of water is more valuable than others. The vast majority of the surface water Americans consume serves either irrigation or thermoelectric power, and water for the latter is usually returned directly to streams with minimal effects on downstream users. In the arid West, the proportion used for irrigation is even higher.

The supposed water wars can largely be solved by redirecting water from low-value irrigation to high-value urban uses. The cost of water is much higher for urban users than irrigators, sometimes by orders of magnitude. But trades are not happening. Right now, because of federal mandates, utility pricing structures, insufficient infrastructure, and a general belief that water is scarce and should therefore be squirreled away and not used, many utilities don’t want more water. Instead they are trying to drive up costs and limit use. As the San Antonio Water System says, ‘it’s important we do everything we can to decrease our water consumption’. Unlike most services or companies, which see their job as meeting consumer demand, utilities see their job as limiting it.

Who should balance costs and benefits?

Drinking water issues are already internalized by local communities. Insofar as there is a case for federal government intervention on surface water, it comes where states’ pollution affect one another. When the federal government intervenes, it could consider looking at cap-and-trade or pricing programs as is commonly done for air pollution, instead of using top-down mandates that, as the EPA says, ‘do not reflect considerations of economic impacts or the technological feasibility’ of meeting them. There are encouraging examples. The states around Chesapeake Bay have a limited cap-and-trade program for the nutrient runoffs that can spread algae and create oxygen-depleted dead-zones.

The federal government can also redirect some of its regulatory focus away from urban areas. The Clean Water Act makes a distinction between ‘point sources’ of pollution, such as from municipal sewage plants and factories, which are tightly regulated and require specific types of technological treatment, and ‘nonpoint sources’, especially the runoff of sediment, fertilizers, and pesticides from farms, which face much vaguer rules. The regulation of point sources means that, according to the EPA, ‘nonpoint source pollution is the leading remaining cause of water quality problems’ today. By one measure, preventing a pound of water pollutants coming from agricultural areas costs less than a tenth of what it costs to prevent it coming out of urban areas. A regulatory system that looked at overall surface water health would find more cost-effective reductions to water pollution.

There is an old joke about a boy who said that he knew how to spell the word ‘banana’ but that he didn’t know when to stop. Officials in control of water today know how to get cleaner water but don’t know when to stop. Local voters already face the problems of balancing costs and benefits and the more distant the regulators, the less likely they are to get the balance right themselves.

The money came through the Maine Department of Energy Resources’s Clean Energy Partnership.

“These investments will strengthen career pathways, support local businesses and ensure Maine has the skilled workforce needed to meet growing demand for energy efficiency services across the state,” said Dan Burgess, the department’s acting commissioner.

The goal is to expand the heating, ventilation and air conditioning workforce and up-skill incumbent workers. The programs are expected to serve as many as 1,200 total participants, including new and existing professionals in the field, while supporting 60 local Maine businesses.

HVAC technicians

The Maine Community College System received $317,000 to expand the pipeline of HVAC technicians through career exploration, pre-apprenticeship and short-term workforce training. The system will also offer heat pump installation training for existing HVAC professionals.

Programs will be offered at four community colleges in Bangor, Auburn, Calais and Presque Isle.

Maine is experiencing “incredible demand” for increased residential energy efficiency, said David Daigler, the system’s president. The system will work with industry partners to offer no-cost short-term heat pump installer training andHVAC pre-apprenticeship training, allowing skilled workers to jump into jobs.

“Maine’s employers have been clear about what they need: job-ready technicians with strong mechanical skills, safety credentials, and experience with today’s energy-efficient systems,” said Dan Belyea, the system’s chief workforce development officer. “By expanding pre-apprenticeship pathways and heat pump installer certification across rural Maine, we’re helping employers grow their workforce faster while giving learners the skills, credentials, and connections needed to enter an in-demand field.”

Clean energy training

The Association of Energy Services Professionals was awarded $449,052 to provide training and industry certifications for new and incumbent workers through virtual learning, eight statewide webinars and six in-person hands-on training sessions.

“This grant expands access to clean energy training that supports Maine’s existing workforce and opens new pathways into high-quality careers,” said Jen Szaro, the association’s president and CEO.

Building trades

The Maine Labor Climate Council and affiliated unions and registered apprenticeship programs received $447,500 to collaborate with the United Technologies Center-Region 4, Union Construction Academy of Maine pre-apprenticeship and the Penobscot Nation to train HVAC technicians.

The unions will also provide up-skilling for incumbent workers, including HVAC technicians, HVAC contractors, home performance contractors, electricians and plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters and other building trades professionals.

The grant could help some union members start their own contracting businesses and grow by serving customers in the residential energy efficiency market, said Francis Eanes, executive director of the Maine Labor Climate Council.

“This award will provide training, certifications, and avenues for Wabanaki tribal members to become certified contractors in the energy efficiency workforce,” said Kelsey Flores, Wabanaki sustainable energy coordinator. “Continuing to strengthen the relationship with Maine-based construction trade unions is essential for connecting Wabanaki tribal members to pathways into union careers, while expanding their existing skills.”

Growing workforce

In 2024, as more home heat pumps were installed, the portion of Maine households reliant on heating oil fell to 50%, down from 62% in 2018 and over 70% in 2010, according to a news release.

In July 2023, Maine surpassed its goal of installing 100,000 new heat pumps two years early. As of December 2025, the number of heat pumps installed in Maine has now surpassed 180,000.

Maine’s clean energy workforce has grown to employ nearly 15,600 people, growing at a rate nearly twice that of the state’s overall workforce and contributing nearly $3 billion to the state’s economy, according to the state Department of Energy Resources.

Subcommittee Chairman Jake Ellzey’s opening statement as prepared for delivery:

Welcome to today’s hearing, “Empowering Rural America Through Investment in Innovation.”

I want to say thanks to all of our witnesses for traveling to be here today and for taking the time to share your expertise with the Subcommittee.

As the demand for AI accelerates, America’s digital infrastructure is rapidly expanding into rural communities. This infrastructure consists of data centers being built far beyond traditional tech hubs, with many investments being made in rural areas, including my district. Our rural communities and small businesses are at the center of America’s AI-driven growth.

Texas is leading the charge in data center development because of our pro-growth, pro-energy, low regulatory environment that has minimized the hinderance of red-tape. We’ve placed a strong focus on developing the workforce for high-paying, new-collar jobs and data companies have recognized those benefits

The economic ripple effect from data centers can reinvigorate rural communities by creating high-paying trade careers and supporting long-term economic activity in rural small businesses. For every direct job created at a data center, up to seven jobs are supported in the surrounding community.

Small businesses are supplying, maintaining, and supporting these facilities. From construction to infrastructure upgrades, data centers open doors for Main Street entrepreneurs and trade workers to be part of the next generation of technological advances.

Meeting the workforce needs of data centers across the country will take a whole-of-community approach to attract and train the skilled workers needed to succeed. Many of our military veterans who return to civilian life already possess the skills desired in this industry.

As a veteran myself, I was proud to co-lead the bill that made the Boots to Business training program permanent alongside Chairman Williams, and Representatives McGarvey and Schneider. Through this effort, our returning service members can be trained to fully utilize their military skills in entrepreneurship opportunities, including those offered by the data center industry. This bill was passed in the FY25 NDAA and will continue to be a vital tool in meeting our workforce needs.

Building out this workforce is a crucial step in securing America’s energy dominance and supporting our National Security. At the same time, industry leaders, local partners, and educational institutions are already stepping up with investments in advanced energy solutions that not only strengthen local infrastructure, but keep us competitive in the AI race with China.

I look forward to hearing from today’s witnesses about how data centers can support local communities, strengthen the small business ecosystem, and help build a new middle class in rural areas across the country.

At least 3 in 5 voters say that the government is not investing enough money in housing (62%) and infrastructure projects, such as upgrading existing bridges or expanding the electric power grid (60%). Half of voters (50%) also say the same for transportation networks, including high-speed railways.

A plurality of voters say the government is investing too much money in electric vehicles and electric vehicle charging stations (38%) and artificial intelligence and data centers (38%).

At least 2 in 3 voters are supportive of the federal government taking a more active role in growing most of these key industries in their community, including infrastructure projects (81%), housing (80%), transportation networks (74%), clean energy projects (72%), and manufacturing facilities for new technologies, like advanced silicon chips or batteries (67%). For each of these industries, only 1 in 5 voters or less are opposed to the government taking a more active role.

However, voters are more divided on whether the federal government should take a more active role in growing electric vehicles and electric vehicle charging stations (50% support, 39% oppose) and artificial intelligence and data centers (48% support, 40% oppose).

Members of Congress are considering different policies that would make it faster to undergo the review and approval processes for different types of energy projects. A plurality of voters (43%) say “the government should speed up these processes only for renewable energy projects like wind and solar, but not for fossil fuel energy projects, like oil and gas,” while 38% say “the government should speed up these processes for all types of energy projects.” Only 12% of voters think “the government should not speed up these processes for any type of energy projects.”

Respondents were provided with a hypothetical about a new construction project being proposed in their area, such as a large new housing development or energy facility, and then were asked what would make them most supportive of the new development.

A plurality of voters (33%) say “job opportunities for my local community,” followed by “knowing the project will help lower the cost of living in my area” (22%). Only 8% of respondents say nothing would make them more supportive of a hypothetical project like this one.

The survey also asked voters whether they think the federal government, state governments, or private sector companies would be most capable of addressing several economic issues. Voters are relatively divided: Pluralities think the federal government is the most capable at “improving U.S. competitiveness in fast-growing global industries” (45%) while private companies are the most capable at “developing new technologies that can support emerging industries” (48%).

However, when the percentages of voters who choose the federal government or state governments are combined for each item, the findings demonstrate that voters perceive government as being more capable than private companies at improving U.S. competitiveness in global industries (+31), creating new jobs in the U.S. workforce (+17), and building or scaling U.S. manufacturing (+11). Conversely, voters are more trusting of the private sector (48%) than government (38%) to develop new technologies that can support emerging industries.

Furthermore, the survey asked voters about a range of policies that have been proposed or implemented by the federal government, and are often the subject of debate around development projects that use federal funding or tax credits.

For every policy tested, a majority of voters across party lines are supportive, except for “implementing tariffs on foreign goods to encourage consumers and businesses to purchase products made in the U.S.,” which is supported by 55% of voters overall but opposed by a majority of Democrats (54%).

These findings indicate that voters want the federal government to play a more active role in growing key industries, especially housing, infrastructure, and transportation. Voters also broadly want to speed up the review and approval processes for energy development, and perceive the government as being more capable than private sector companies for several key economic strategies.

While voters generally express high support for new industrial development, only 51% say they would be enthusiastic about a new construction project in their community, and voters are divided on whether the federal government should take a more active role in growing the electric vehicle and AI industries.

Survey Methodology

From December 13 to 15, 2025, Data for Progress conducted a survey of 1,145 U.S. likely voters nationally using web panel respondents. The sample was weighted to be representative of likely voters by age, gender, education, race, geography, and recalled presidential vote. The survey was conducted in English. The margin of error associated with the sample size is ±3 percentage points. Results for subgroups of the sample are subject to increased margins of error. Partisanship reflectedin tabulations is based on self-identified party affiliation, not partisan registration.

,Texas American Energy ,2026-01-21 15:00:26+00:00,Houston Public Media,The EPA is easing pollution rules under Trump. Here's how it's affecting Texas,"Alejandra Martinez, Texas Tribune, www.houstonpublicmedia.org",,,,,https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/energy-environment/2026/01/21/541179/texas-trump-epa-regulation-rollback/,"It accounts for roughly 16% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is a major driver of climate change.
In 2024, the Biden administration finalized long-anticipated rules requiring oil and gas operators to sharply reduce methane emissions from wells, pipelines, and storage facilities.
Shelley said uniform EPA rules provided regulatory certainty for changes operators saw as inevitable.
Colin Leyden, Texas state director and energy lead at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, said eliminating the program could hurt Texas industry.
Leyden said tallying up the dollar value of lives saved when evaluating pollution rules is a foundational principle of the EPA since its creation.","The first year of President Trump's second term has seen an aggressive rollback of federal environmental protections, which advocacy groups fear will bring more pollution, higher health risks, and less information and power for Texas communities, especially in heavily industrial and urban areas.

Within Trump's first 100 days in office, his new Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Lee Zeldin, announced a sweeping slate of 31 deregulatory actions. The list, which Zeldin called the agency's ""greatest day of deregulation,"" targeted everything from soot standards and power plant pollution rules to the Endangerment Finding, the legal and scientific foundation that obligates the EPA to regulate climate-changing pollution under the Clean Air Act.

Since then, the agency froze research grants, shrank its workforce, and removed some references to climate change and environmental justice from its website — moves that environmental advocates say send a clear signal: the EPA's new direction will come at the expense of public health.

Cyrus Reed, conservation director of the Lone Star Chapter of the Sierra Club, said Texas is one of the states that feels EPA policy changes directly because the state has shown little interest in stepping up its environmental enforcement as the federal government scales back.

""If we were a state that was open to doing our own regulations there'd be less impact from these rollbacks,"" Reed said. ""But we're not.""

""Now we have an EPA that isn’t interested in enforcing its own rules,"" he added.

Richard Richter, a spokesperson at the state's environmental agency, Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, said in a statement that the agency takes protecting public health and natural resources seriously and acts consistently and quickly to enforce federal and state environmental laws when they're violated.

Methane rules put on pause

A major EPA move centers on methane, a potent greenhouse gas that traps heat far more efficiently than carbon dioxide over the short term. It accounts for roughly 16% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is a major driver of climate change. In the U.S., the largest source of methane emissions is the energy sector, especially in Texas, the nation's top oil and gas producer.

In 2024, the Biden administration finalized long-anticipated rules requiring oil and gas operators to sharply reduce methane emissions from wells, pipelines, and storage facilities. The rule, developed with industry input, targeted leaks, equipment failures, and routine flaring, the burning off of excess natural gas at the wellhead.

Under the rule, operators would have been required to monitor emissions, inspect sites with gas-imaging cameras for leaks, and phase out routine flaring. States are required to come up with a plan to implement the rule, but Texas has yet to do so. Under Trump’s EPA, that deadline has been extended until January 2027 — an 18-month postponement.

Texas doesn't have a rule to capture escaping methane emissions from energy infrastructure. Richter, the TCEQ spokesperson, said the agency continues to work toward developing the state plan.

Adrian Shelley, Texas director of the watchdog group Public Citizen, said the rule represented a rare moment of alignment between environmentalists and major oil and gas producers.

""I think the fossil fuel industry generally understood that this was the direction the planet and their industry was moving,"" he said. Shelley said uniform EPA rules provided regulatory certainty for changes operators saw as inevitable.

Reed, the Sierra Club conservation director, said the delay of methane rules means Texas still has no plan to reduce emissions, while neighboring New Mexico already has imposed its own state methane emission rules that require the industry to detect and repair methane leaks and ban routine venting and flaring.

These regulations have cut methane emissions in the New Mexico portion of the Permian Basin — the oil-rich area that covers West Texas and southeast New Mexico — to half that of Texas, according to a recent data analysis by the Environmental Defense Fund. That's despite New Mexico doubling production since 2020.

A retreat from soot standards

Fine particulate matter or PM 2.5, one of six pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act, has been called by researchers the deadliest form of air pollution.

In 2024, the EPA under President Biden strengthened air rules for particulate matter by lowering the annual limit from 12 to 9 micrograms per cubic meter. It was the first update since 2012 and one of the most ambitious pieces of Biden's environmental agenda, driven by mounting evidence that particulate pollution is linked to premature death, heart disease, asthma, and other respiratory illnesses.

After the rule was issued, 24 Republican-led states, including Kentucky and West Virginia, sued to revert to the weaker standard. Texas filed a separate suit asking to block the rule's recent expansion.

State agencies are responsible for enforcing the federal standards. The TCEQ is charged with creating a list of counties that exceed the federal standard and submitting those recommendations to Gov. Greg Abbott, who then finalizes the designations and submits them to the EPA.

Under the 9 microgram standard, parts of Texas, including Dallas, Harris (which includes Houston), Tarrant (Fort Worth), and Bowie (Texarkana) counties, were in the process of being designated nonattainment areas — which, when finalized, would trigger a legal requirement for the state to develop a plan to clean up the air.

That process stalled after Trump returned to office. Gov. Greg Abbott submitted his designations to EPA last February, but EPA has not yet acted on his designations, according to Richter, the TCEQ spokesperson.

In a court filing last year, the Trump EPA asked a federal appeals court to vacate the stricter standard, bypassing the traditional notice and comment administrative process.

For now, the rule technically remains in effect, but environmental advocates say the EPA's retreat undermines enforcement of the rule and signals to polluters that it may be short-lived.

Shelley, with Public Citizen, believes the PM2.5 rule would have delivered the greatest health benefit of any EPA regulation affecting Texas, particularly through reductions in diesel pollution from trucks.

""I still hold out hope that it will come back,"" he said.

Unraveling the climate framework

Beyond individual pollutants, the Trump EPA has moved to dismantle the federal architecture for addressing climate change.

Among the proposals is eliminating the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which requires power plants, refineries, and oil and gas suppliers to report annual emissions. The proposal has drawn opposition from both environmental groups and industry, which relies on the data for planning and compliance.

Colin Leyden, Texas state director and energy lead at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund, said eliminating the program could hurt Texas industry. If methane emissions are no longer reported, then buyers and investors of natural gas, for example, won't have an official way to measure how much methane pollution is associated with that gas, according to Leyden. That makes it harder to judge how ""clean"" or ""climate-friendly"" the product is, which international buyers are increasingly demanding.

""This isn't just bad for the planet,"" he said. ""It makes the Texas industry less competitive.""

The administration also proposed last year rescinding the Endangerment Finding, issued in 2009, which obligates the EPA to regulate climate pollution. Most recently, the EPA said it will stop calculating how much money is saved in health care costs as a result of air pollution regulations that curb particulate matter 2.5 and ozone, a component of smog. Both can cause respiratory and health problems.

Leyden said tallying up the dollar value of lives saved when evaluating pollution rules is a foundational principle of the EPA since its creation.

""That really erodes the basic idea that [the EPA] protects health and safety and the environment,"" he said.

Some states continue to position themselves as places where ordinary people can still get ahead.
According to the recently released U-Haul Growth Index, which tracks the balance of inbound versus outbound one-way truck rentals, states with competitive tax policies that lead to more affordability continue to attract residents.
North Carolina ranks third, and Tennessee, another state without a personal income tax, ranks fourth.
While affordability challenges are real in many parts of the country, they are generally driven by failed big-government policies.","In the early weeks of 2026, what can we expect as it relates to the economy this year? Public debate remains focused on affordability. Americans are still absorbing the consequences of price increases that grew out of control during the Biden administration. In 2022, inflation never fell below 6.5% and peaked at an incredibly high 9.1% in June of that year. Americans noticed people balancing their budgets at their kitchen tables, watching groceries, rent, and utilities consume an ever-greater share of their income.

Yet our economy continues now to show indications of strength. Americans will see significant tax relief with the Working Family Tax Relief Act, which was signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2025. We will see gains in productivity, continued strong GDP growth in the last two quarters, and inflation that has cooled dramatically from its recent peaks during the Biden years.

However, what differs sharply across the country is not the national economy, of course, but state policies that have driven a wide economic divergence between rich states and poor states. Some states continue to position themselves as places where ordinary people can still get ahead. Others continue to enact policies that make basic necessities more expensive and economic mobility more difficult.

Of course, the most direct way for policymakers to leave more money in people’s pockets is to take less of it in the first place. That reality is reflected in human behavior. According to the recently released U-Haul Growth Index, which tracks the balance of inbound versus outbound one-way truck rentals, states with competitive tax policies that lead to more affordability continue to attract residents. Texas and Florida, two states without personal income taxes, again lead the nation in inbound movers. North Carolina ranks third, and Tennessee, another state without a personal income tax, ranks fourth.

At the other end of the list are California, Illinois, New Jersey, and New York. These four states, long committed to high taxes and heavy regulation, also lead the nation in outbound moves. This is not a coincidence. People respond to incentives, even when policymakers pretend otherwise. Such patterns are examples of Americans voting with their feet. Families and businesses migrate toward jurisdictions that allow them to keep more of what they earn and impose fewer regulatory obstacles. Human capital flows to where it can be used most productively, offering a clearer verdict on policy than any political talking point.

During the COVID period, when remote work expanded dramatically, many Americans discovered that moving could function as an immediate boost to affordability. Predictably, many did.

Affordability extends well beyond taxes. Consider even things like water and sewer costs, which are highest in states like Maryland, Washington, Hawaii, and Connecticut. Maryland residents pay, on average, more than three times what residents pay in the lowest-cost states: Alabama, Tennessee, South Carolina, and West Virginia. These differences do not arise from geography alone but from policy choices and regulatory structures at the state level.

Energy costs tell a similar story, depending on the choices of state policymakers. States that pursue government-directed ideas around energy as an overriding objective—through carbon taxes, cap-and-trade policies, or radical ESG ideology—have driven electricity prices sharply upward. California, Massachusetts, and Connecticut now charge more than 21 cents per kilowatt-hour for electricity. In contrast, states like Utah, Idaho, North Dakota, and Wyoming charge less than 9 cents, less than half as much. The consequences are borne not by slogans but by households paying monthly bills.

Housing costs are perhaps the most visible component of the affordability discussion. Prices have risen nationwide and strain household budgets. Some factors, like supply restrictions and property tax burdens, are driven by state and local government decisions, respectively. However, some cost drivers lie beyond state control. In much of the Western United States, large portions of land are federally owned and unavailable for development, creating supply constraints that no state legislature can easily overcome.

But state policy still matters greatly. Housing costs vary widely, even among states facing similar geographic limitations. California, again, stands out—and not in a good way. The average home price exceeds eight times the median personal income in the Golden State. While affordability challenges are real in many parts of the country, they are generally driven by failed big-government policies.

In contrast, we have some refreshing national tailwinds with federal tax relief and deregulation, driving costs lower. Free-market states are doubling down with policies that bring more affordability. As with our great experiment with federalism, Americans are free to choose—and they continue to choose states that value freedom.",https://alec.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/JW-ARJ-Affordability-Migration-Final-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 11:06:42.847801

This massive structural realignment was further bolstered by an $800 million federal award to accelerate the deployment of small modular reactors[2], moving the industry beyond policy talk and into direct capital deployment. As the market re-rates the entire fuel cycle, several key platforms are emerging as leaders in domestic energy security, including Eagle Energy Metals (OTC: SVIIF) (Soon-to-be under symbol ‘NUCLR’), Centrus Energy (NYSE: LEU), NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE: SMR), Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSE-A: UUUU) (TSX: EFR), and Canada Nickel Company (TSXV: CNC) (OTCQB: CNIKF).

Global investment in nuclear capacity is projected to triple by 2035, reaching approximately $210 billion as nations race toward ambitious 2050 power targets[3]. This secular transition is fueled by a new federal mandate that treats domestic critical minerals—from uranium to nickel—as vital national infrastructure[4]. In this unified industrial push, companies with execution-ready projects are being positioned to command the essential backbone of Western energy sovereignty.

Eagle Energy Metals (OTC: SVIIF) (Soon-to-be under symbol ‘NUCLR’) announced this week that it has engaged BBA USA Inc. , a consulting firm with over 45 years of energy sector experience, to design a targeted drilling campaign at its Aurora Uranium Project in support of an eventual Pre-Feasibility Study. The timing matters because the company is soon heading toward a NASDAQ listing under the ticker symbol NUCL through a business combination with Spring Valley Acquisition Corp. II (OTC: SVIIF), the same SPAC team that brought NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE: SMR) public in 2022.

Eagle Energy holds rights to what it describes as the largest open pit-constrained, measured and indicated uranium deposit in the United States. The Aurora deposit sits on the Oregon-Nevada border with 32.75 million pounds of indicated uranium and 4.98 million pounds inferred, based on over 500 drill holes. Adjacent to Aurora is the Cordex deposit, which has seen over 100 holes drilled and offers potential resource expansion as the company digitizes existing data.

""We're seeing sustained demand for nuclear power translate into real demand for uranium, particularly for projects located in the U.S.,"" said Mark Mukhija, CEO of Eagle Energy Metals. ""Advancing Aurora with BBA is about making sure this asset is ready to meet that demand as the market continues to tighten.""

The domestic supply situation provides context for the company's positioning. In 2023, U.S. utilities purchased more than 50 million pounds of uranium, with less than 5% obtained from limited domestic production and over 95% sourced from abroad, including significant amounts from Russia and Kazakhstan.

President Trump recently signed four executive orders aimed at removing regulatory barriers and quadrupling U.S. nuclear power over the next 25 years, while invoking the Defense Production Act to secure domestic uranium supply.

Meanwhile, electricity demand is accelerating as AI, quantum computing, and cryptocurrency operations strain global grids. Meta recently announced plans to build a $10 billion AI data center in Louisiana powered by nuclear energy from Constellation Energy , while Microsoft , Amazon , Oracle , and Nvidia have struck major deals to power their operations with nuclear.

Beyond uranium, Eagle Energy Metals also holds proprietary Small Modular Reactor (SMR) technology. With BBA's technical continuity (they authored Aurora's SK-1300 Technical Report Summary in August 2025), existing infrastructure, and access to low-cost hydropower in a mining-friendly jurisdiction, the company is advancing its asset as domestic uranium supply becomes increasingly prioritized.

Centrus Energy (NYSE: LEU) was awarded $900 million by the U.S. Department of Energy to expand its uranium enrichment facility in Piketon, Ohio, to include commercial-scale production of High-Assay, Low-Enriched Uranium. The competitively-awarded federal funding will support Centrus ' previously announced multi-billion dollar expansion that will also include additional Low-Enriched Uranium production to serve commercial utilities and the existing reactor fleet, with the project expected to support 1,000 construction jobs and 300 new operating jobs in Ohio while retaining 150 existing positions.

""This award represents a historic commitment to revitalizing America's nuclear fuel supply chain and reclaiming American nuclear leadership on the global stage,"" said Amir Vexler, President and CEO of Centrus Energy. ""I am grateful to the Trump Administration for making this commitment and to Republicans and Democrats in Congress who came together to provide this urgently needed funding.""

The fixed-price base task order amount is $900 million to bring new enrichment capacity online, with additional options for up to $170 million to produce and deliver HALEU to the Department. Centrus has already launched domestic centrifuge manufacturing at its Oak Ridge, Tennessee factory, with first new capacity expected online in 2029.

NuScale Power Corporation (NYSE: SMR) has released study results demonstrating that pairing its advanced small modular reactor nuclear technology with a heat augmentation system can provide both profitable and reliable power for commercial chemical plants. The techno-economic assessment conducted in collaboration with Oak Ridge National Laboratory examined the performance of coupling a NuScale Power Module with a U.S. chemical facility to provide nuclear-generated steam and electric power.

""As the first and only SMR to have our designs certified by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), NuScale continues to lead in the development of new technologies to provide process heat and electricity,"" said Dr. José Reyes, Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer at NuScale Power. ""As we saw in the results of this assessment, delivering high-temperature steam with NuScale's scalable architecture provides industrial users with unparalleled flexibility that can be integrated into their processes and offers a promising new path for them to explore. We are proud of the collaboration with our partners at ORNL and grateful for the support of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under the Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear (GAIN) initiative for this study.""

The study demonstrated that the NuScale integrated energy system could meet chemical plant requirements of 1.3 million kg/h of process steam at 400°C and 4.1 MPa while also providing 73 MW of electric power. The hybrid system's scalable architecture offers maximum flexibility for optimizing plant energy use and profitability across various configurations.

Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSE-A: UUUU) (TSX: EFR) exceeded FY-2025 guidance for finished uranium production, mined uranium ore production and uranium concentrate sales. The company's Pinyon Plain Mine in Arizona and La Sal Complex in Utah produced over 1.6 million pounds of uranium in 2025, exceeding the top end of guidance by approximately 11%, while the White Mesa Mill produced more than one million pounds of finished U₃O₈ during 2025 with over 350,000 pounds produced in December alone.

""These 2025 uranium metrics reinforce our reputation as, not only the country's lowest-cost and largest uranium producer, but as a company that delivers on its promises,"" said Mark S. Chalmers, CEO of Energy Fuels Inc. ""Nuclear energy powered by uranium is among the cleanest, least expensive, and most reliable ways to supply our nation's growing energy and electricity needs.""

The company expects to sell 360,000 pounds of U₃O₈ in Q4-2025 at a weighted average sales price of approximately $74.93 per pound, representing 50% growth over Q3-2025 sales volumes. Energy Fuels Inc. completed two new long-term uranium sales contracts with U.S. nuclear power generating companies adding deliveries for 2027 to 2032 utilizing hybrid pricing with exposure to uranium market upside.

Canada Nickel Company (TSXV: CNC) (OTCQB: CNIKF) was named as the second project to be advanced under Ontario's new One Project, One Process framework, reflecting the advanced state, scale, and strategic importance of the Crawford Nickel Project within Ontario's Critical Minerals Strategy. The 1P1P framework is designed to better coordinate Ontario's permitting and review processes for major mining developments by aligning timelines, responsibilities, and information sharing across provincial ministries.

""Ontario is moving at lightning speed to open this 100% Canadian owned mine to create 4,000 jobs for Canadian workers,"" said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Energy and Mines. ""In 2026, our government is going full-tilt to unlock one of the world's largest nickel deposits that will supercharge our economy and help end China's critical mineral dominance.""

Crawford is expected to be the largest nickel sulphide project in the western world and among the most economically significant mining developments in Canada, with independent analysis estimating the Project will generate more than $70 billion in GDP over its initial 40+ year mine life. Canada Nickel Company is targeting construction commencement by year-end 2026.

House Bill 1002 would require companies to make billing consistent and predictable for customers. Another provision would transition utility companies to three-year rate plans subject to state approval.

The bill's author, Rep. Alaina Shonkwiler (R-Noblesville), said the goal of the legislation is “modernizing” how Indiana regulates electric utilities to benefit residents.

""The multi-year rate planning provides greater rate stability and predictability for customers, improved regulatory efficiency … and continued oversight and flexibility, including periodic reviews, public input,"" Shonkwiler said.

After discussing and then voting on several amendments, the House utilities committee approved the bill unanimously. It joins other Statehouse efforts to address energy costs, including a bill on nuclear power regulations.

HB 1002 would also create a summer disconnection moratorium, which would prohibit companies from shutting off service during periods of extreme heat. But lawmakers disagree over whether the final rule should be a time-based period as state law mandates in winter, or whether it should be tied to National Weather Service-declared heat emergencies.

Utility companies would be required to submit regular reports to the Indiana Office of the Utility Consumer Counselor under the bill. It would also reign in the ability of the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission to freeze rates by calling an electric emergency. Instead, it allows the agency to request an emergency declaration from the governor.

In his State of the State address last week, Gov. Mike Braun said utility rates are too high and signaled support for Shonkwiler’s legislation.

“Affordability is why I support Rep. Alaina Shonkwiler’s bill to hold investor-owned utilities accountable to provide affordable energy before they can increase their profit margin,” Braun said.

Rep. Matt Pierce (D-Bloomington) appreciated a Republican amendment that addressed several concerns from Democrats, some of which he said could have prevented his caucus from voting on the bill.

“You’ll see from our amendments, we think that there are some other things that can be done to provide even more relief,” Pierce said Tuesday.

Some of their proposals failed, including amendments to prevent outstanding utility bills from impacting a person’s credit score, and to prohibit companies from charging disconnect and reconnect fees.

Committee chair Rep. Edmond Soliday (R-Valparaiso) directed two Democrats to work with Indiana Energy Association President Danielle McGrath on amendments that would require companies to share more information with customers on their bills. Those included a notice to customers when they hit 50% of their usage from the previous month and a provision for companies to include both the amount a customer owes for the month and the total outstanding balance on their bill.

A subsidiary of the German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp has agreed to buy a certain type of steel from Stegra’s plant in northern Sweden, which is set to start operations next year.
The plant will use green hydrogen — made with renewable energy — and clean electricity to produce iron and steel.

Construction on Stegra’s plant in northern Sweden was 60% complete as of late October, and the company continues to share snapshots of ongoing work at its snow-covered site on social media.","Stegra’s grand plan to build the first large green-steel mill in the world has recently hit a rough patch. Faced with increasing project costs and construction delays, the Swedish startup has been seeking to raise over $1 billion in additional financing since last fall to complete the flagship facility near the Arctic Circle.

Last week, though, Stegra shared some brighter news: The company landed a major new customer, marking a step forward for the beleaguered project.

A subsidiary of the German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp has agreed to buy a certain type of steel from Stegra’s plant in northern Sweden, which is set to start operations next year. The plant will use green hydrogen — made with renewable energy — and clean electricity to produce iron and steel. The sprawling facility is expected to initially produce 2.5 million metric tons of steel annually and eventually double its production of the metal.

Stegra, formerly H2 Green Steel, estimates that its process will slash carbon dioxide emissions by up to 95% compared with traditional coal-based methods, which account for up to 9% of global emissions.

Thyssenkrupp Materials Services said it would buy tonnages in the ​“high-six-digit range” of ​“non-prime” steel — metal that doesn’t meet the high-quality standards required for certain uses but that is still strong and durable enough for other applications. Steel mills typically produce a higher ratio of non-prime metal when they’re starting up, which decreases over time, according to Stegra. The deal should help the firm generate cash flow when the plant first opens.

“A partner for non-prime steel is important for the ramp up of our steel mill,” Stephan Flapper, head of commercial at Stegra, said in a Jan. 12 statement. ​“Together we can drive an even stronger pull for steel products made via the green hydrogen route.”

The deal is Stegra’s first for non-prime steel, though the startup has already inked agreements for prime steel with automakers such as Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, and Scania, as well as major companies including Cargill, Ikea, and Microsoft. The offtake contracts represent more than half the steel that will be produced during the plant’s first phase.

Notably, Thyssenkrupp Materials Services won’t count the carbon-emission reductions associated with the green steel toward its own climate targets. Instead, Stegra will separately sell the green credentials, in the form of environmental attribute certificates, to other customers in the prime steel market. Stegra previously struck a deal to sell certificates to Microsoft — which is an investor — to help offset emissions from conventionally made steel that the tech giant is using to build data centers outside Europe.

The startup’s announcement with the Thyssenkrupp subsidiary didn’t include details about the financial value or other parameters of the multiyear agreement. Stegra didn’t respond to Canary Media’s requests for comment.

Analysts said the lack of specifics makes it difficult to know exactly how meaningful this development is for the Swedish steelmaker as it works to address its financial challenges.

“This gives a positive signal … that they’re moving in the right direction,” said Anne-Sophie Corbeau, a Paris-based hydrogen analyst at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. ​“But it’s really complicated to quantify how significant this is.”

The new deal with Thyssenkrupp and the previous one with Microsoft ​“suggest Stegra has a technically sound product,” Brian Murphy, head of hydrogen and low-carbon gas for S&P Global Energy, said by email. He added that, in general, signing long-term offtake deals for clean-hydrogen projects has become ​“the key unlock” for developers to secure necessary financing.

Still, ​“more price information is required to assess the full impact on Stegra’s financial position,” he said.

Stegra is forging ahead with its multibillion-dollar project even as other European steelmakers put their hydrogen-fueled ambitions on ice.

Last year, Thyssenkrupp Steel and the industrial giant ArcelorMittal said they were canceling or postponing projects in Europe, citing the economic headwinds and uncertain market conditions facing green steel and hydrogen production. The setbacks come even as the European Union is increasing regulatory pressure on steelmakers inside the bloc and globally to curb CO2 emissions from industrial facilities. In the United States, meanwhile, plans for two marquee green-steel projects were shelved last year.

Construction on Stegra’s plant in northern Sweden was 60% complete as of late October, and the company continues to share snapshots of ongoing work at its snow-covered site on social media. Stegra’s success, if it comes, could reinvigorate green-steel efforts across the region, particularly if the company can sell its steel at prices that cover the higher costs of making low-carbon metal, Corbeau said.

“In the end, if the economics work and they manage to sell most of the steel at a premium, that will be a good signal for a lot of the other companies that have been hesitant,” she said.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Stegra-site-web5-copy.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=d641a8f58c85a67ba968113991691451,N,,2026-01-21 13:01:50.630964

It does similar work in its home country with National Grid Electricity Distribution, a subsidiary of the same firm that owns National Grid in Massachusetts.
But National Grid is seeking to solve grid problems at 23 locations, each with a distinct set of needs, Tom said.
Distributed energy resources can bridge the grid overloads until the necessary upgrades take place.
After all, a utility must pay the customers handing over the reins to their distributed energy resources.","As Massachusetts faces an energy-affordability crisis, one of the state’s biggest utilities is trying a new approach to satisfy growing power demand without blowing out its grid budget and further spiking residents’ bills.

Late last year, National Grid launched a marketplace in Massachusetts that, put simply, lets the utility shop for the best customer-owned solar and batteries, smart EV chargers and appliances, and other distributed energy resources to reduce strain on the grid in specific locations.

The idea is that National Grid can strategically deploy this existing, scattered energy equipment during periods of high demand — for example, drawing power from a home battery, dialing down a business’s air conditioning, or deferring EV charging.

This relief on the grid lets the utility defer or even fully avoid upgrading the wires, transformers, and other infrastructure that deliver power to households. Such costly upgrades are the single biggest driver of rising electricity bills in the U.S.

That’s why National Grid calls it a ​“non-wires alternative” program — it’s finding things that can defer and reduce the costs of those grid investments.

Unlike the ​non-wires alternative projects that utilities have been doing for at least the past decade, this one is designed to move much more quickly and cast a much wider net for resources that can stand in for grid upgrades.

“The 2010s version is, you’ve got big players, a single project for the entire need. It’s an old-school utility procurement,” said Josh Tom, National Grid’s director of energy transition solutions. ​“It’s a closed system, not accessible to everyone. And it can take a long time.”

These slow, burdensome, and costly approaches have yielded only a handful of successful projects over the years. National Grid’s new program, by contrast, is built around a marketplace platform into which companies can bid resources ranging from big batteries to lots of smart thermostats.

From there, National Grid can assess how they could be combined to solve particular grid challenges at different sites on the utility’s distribution network. That should allow it to move much more quickly to find, test, and potentially pay for resources that meet its grid needs, said Nick Watson, National Grid’s director of flexible resource engineering. ​“We see it as more of a dynamic process,” he said.

The utility’s bidding opportunity will be open through mid-February and target providing grid relief during the summer and winter seasons from 2026 to 2030, Watson said. ​“We’ll assess those bids, figure out the procurements that meet our needs, using tools we’re trying out for the first time.” Contracts with winning bidders will follow, and tests of the resources are expected to begin this spring, ahead of eligible assets being dispatched in the summer, he said.

Piclo: Making a market for grid flexibility

The company running National Grid’s new marketplace is the U.K.-based startup Piclo. It does similar work in its home country with National Grid Electricity Distribution, a subsidiary of the same firm that owns National Grid in Massachusetts.

Piclo is a major provider of flexibility-marketplace services in the U.K., a country that analysts say is far ahead of the U.S. on this front, and the company has expanded to mainland Europe and Australia in recent years. It’s also making inroads in the U.S. via its partnerships with Connecticut utilities and with National Grid, which has already used Piclo’s marketplace as part of its ​“dynamic load management” programs in New York for several years.

“We’ve done this for years in the U.K. and beyond,” said James Johnston, Piclo’s CEO. ​“But in a lot of the U.S., this hasn’t happened before.”

The potential could be huge, Johnston said. In September, Piclo announced that it had registered across the U.S. a combined 1 gigawatt of distributed energy resources — a term that includes batteries, EV fleets, grid-responsive appliances, and commercial and industrial buildings that can dial down energy use on demand. Companies registering with Piclo include major residential solar and battery installer Sunrun, demand-response provider Enel X, and energy-efficiency startup Budderfly.

Owners and managers of these distributed energy resources can share data on Piclo’s platform about how much power their devices can inject into the grid, store for later use, or put off consuming, Johnston said. The platform will connect those offers to entities — utilities, grid operators, and large customers like data centers that are looking for ways to mitigate their impact on the system — interested in tapping them to solve energy or grid challenges.

Unlike companies that aggregate distributed energy resources and manage them as virtual power plants, ​“we don’t take a position in the market,” Johnston said. ​“We’re that party that partners trust to share data with. We’re that matchmaker — we share the right data sets, end to end, across that entire journey. And we’re the adjudicator — whether you’re matched or not, whether you win a contract or not.”

Piclo has proved its bona fides in the U.K., where it has more than 60,000 registered distributed energy resources and has procured more than 2.6 gigawatts of flexible capacity to date.

For National Grid, Piclo’s marketplace opens up a world of possibilities, Tom said.

“They’re helping us communicate our needs to the market,” he said. ​“Their open marketplace is a new procurement approach.”

The current program round is looking to secure about 25 megawatts of flexibility, he said. That’s less than half the 52 megawatts secured by the largest non-wires alternative program in the country — the Brooklyn-Queens Demand Management program, launched in 2014 by utility Con Edison to relieve a congested New York City substation.

But National Grid is seeking to solve grid problems at 23 locations, each with a distinct set of needs, Tom said. Some sites require only a small amount of overload relief on a substation or circuit during a handful of hours in the summer or winter. Others may require non-wires alternatives that can be dispatched more frequently or that expand over time as new customers increase peak demands on a specific part of the grid.

One key benefit of working with Piclo’s marketplace is that it helps National Grid mix and match the capabilities of a number of different bidders, rather than forcing a single bidder to meet them all, Tom said. ​“What we’re really trying to do in this approach is open up the possibility for portfolios of bids that work alongside each other to meet the need in a couple of ways,” he said.

“Let’s say you have a 3-megawatt need for a summer season, a four-hour window or eight-hour window on certain days,” he said. ​“We want to open the possibility, even if you don’t have 3 megawatts, to bid in your 1 megawatt,” which the company will combine with megawatts from other providers to make up the difference. ​“That opens opportunities for those who can’t enter the market otherwise.”

Portfolios can be built across time as well as across scale, he added. ​“Let’s say it’s a four-hour window. If you can only provide 3 megawatts for the first two hours, someone else could provide the megawatt for hours three and four — and we have a complete portfolio.”

Proving out a new way to boost the grid

Once National Grid selects the distributed energy resources it wants to procure from the Piclo marketplace, the utility will have to run them through a gauntlet of tests to ensure they’re reliable enough to relieve grid stresses.

“There are a bunch of test dispatch requirements before we run a real event or renumerate a party for services provided,” Tom said. This spring and summer will be dedicated to running those tests and to fine-tuning the ​“contractual structures with the right characteristics to ensure we’re comfortable in the future.”

Regulator support has been critical in setting this up, he added. Massachusetts’ three major investor-owned utilities are required to develop grid-modernization plans under a 2022 energy and climate law that sets the state on a course to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. In approving those plans, the state let utilities create grid services compensation funds that can pay for non-wires alternative programs, he explained.

Launching Piclo’s marketplace isn’t National Grid’s only attempt at a non-wires alternative program in Massachusetts. The utility is also expanding a 7-year-old program called ConnectionSolutions, which regulators required all the state’s investor-owned utilities to deploy. This program is designed not to relieve local grid constraints but rather to reduce overall peak demands on power plants and transmission grids. In that role, it has delivered hundreds of megawatts of grid relief during summer heat waves and become a national model for virtual power plants.

Now, National Grid wants to see if the program can also help defer or avoid upgrades at specific grid substations and circuits. The expanded version, ConnectedSolutions+, offers customers incremental incentives to install and sign up resources in areas with local grid needs.

What distinguishes ConnectedSolutions+ from National Grid’s work with Piclo is that the latter program targets not just customers with smart thermostats, EV chargers, grid-responsive appliances, and battery storage but also larger grid-connected energy assets like community solar arrays and batteries, Tom noted. Massachusetts has a lot of community solar that’s been challenging to connect to the grid, and the state has been working for years to find a way to use those solar and battery systems to relieve grid stresses.

Importantly, National Grid’s first round of non-wires alternatives is targeting spots that aren’t in dire need of grid upgrades, Tom said. ​“We’re not putting at risk the safety and reliability of the network by doing this.”

Another key target for National Grid is for ​“bridge-to-wires” needs, Watson said — spots where new customers that use a lot of power want to plug into the grid and ​“you can’t build the infrastructure quickly enough” to accommodate them, he said. Distributed energy resources can bridge the grid overloads until the necessary upgrades take place.

One big question that utilities must grapple with is when a non-wires alternative makes financial sense. After all, a utility must pay the customers handing over the reins to their distributed energy resources. Utilities also can’t avoid upgrading their grids forever — and changing circumstances can wreak havoc on the assumptions that inform how much a non-wires alternative is worth.

Utilities must account for a ton of variables to determine the value of deferring grid investments versus biting the bullet and investing in must-have upgrades or expansions, Watson said. ​“We’ve been developing methodologies to help us do that over the course of this year,” he said. ​“It depends on what the use case is.”

But from Watson’s perspective, utilities will have to find better ways to manage their grids in the long run, as power demand grows, distributed solar and batteries proliferate, and electric vehicles and buildings add both new strains and new sources of flexibility to the system.

“Traditionally, it isn’t the business model of the investor-owned utility to leverage flexibility,” he said. But to meet state goals around electrification and emissions reductions, ​“we’re going to have to change the way we manage our network. We can’t just continue to build out the network in the traditional ways we have in the past.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-1260528106.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=d47453ead08f8ca6e86a1eb4ddb28bbb,N,,2026-01-21 13:02:13.798295

The elimination of the tax credit has raised questions about the long-term adoption rates of zero-emission vehicles across the nation’s auto sector.
Last month, Cox Automotive estimated that EV sales in the U.S. in November dropped 41.2% compared to one year earlier.
While sales of EVs and plug-ins have grown, the rate of adoption in California has slowed in the past couple of years, before the federal tax credit was abolished.
“If anybody thought that there would be a sustained level of sales, post-federal tax credit, they would have to be insane,” he said.","The recent termination of federal tax credits for zero-emission vehicles delivered a body blow to end-of-the-year sales across California.

According to figures released Tuesday by the California Energy Commission, registrations for electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles came to 79,066 in the fourth quarter of 2025.

That works out to a drop of 36.6% compared to 124,755 sold in the third quarter, when many Californians rushed to buy or lease EVs before the federal tax credit expired on Sept. 30.

State policymakers and Gov. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday emphasized the long-term expansion of zero-emission vehicles, pointing out that cumulative sales in California have surpassed 2.55 million and have grown 300% since the end of 2019.

“California didn’t reach 2.5 million zero-emission vehicles by accident — we invested in this future when others said it was impossible,” Newsom said in a statement while at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

Last year, the massive 940-page federal budget dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” backed by Republicans on Capitol Hill and signed into law by President Donald Trump included provisions that eliminated the federal tax credit of up to $7,500 on the purchase or lease of a new EV, or $4,000 for a used one.

The elimination of the tax credit has raised questions about the long-term adoption rates of zero-emission vehicles across the nation’s auto sector.

Last month, Cox Automotive estimated that EV sales in the U.S. in November dropped 41.2% compared to one year earlier.

Ford recently discontinued its all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck and Stellantis ceased production of its plug-in hybrid models of the Jeep Wrangler 4xe, Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe and Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid. Ford and GM also reported write-downs in the billions on its EV assets.

But California officials say they are undeterred.

“Each quarter, even in the face of increasing federal headwinds, tens of thousands of consumers are purchasing a (zero-emission vehicle) in the Golden State, enjoying a great driving experience, and knowing they never have to go to a gas station again,” California Energy Commissioner Nancy Skinner said in a statement.

California has more zero-emission vehicles on the road than any other state. In 2020, Newsom issued an executive order mandating the elimination of sales of all new gasoline-powered passenger vehicles throughout California by 2035.

While sales of EVs and plug-ins have grown, the rate of adoption in California has slowed in the past couple of years, before the federal tax credit was abolished.

Last June, Trump signed three Congressional Review Act resolutions that rescinded California’s electric vehicle rules — as well as mandates related to diesel engines.

California and 10 other states have responded by filing a lawsuit, arguing that Trump’s actions are unconstitutional and beyond the authority of Congress.

Newsom recently announced plans to set aside $200 million to bring back a rebate program for California drivers who buy zero-emission vehicles.

Specifics — including the size of the rebate and eligibility requirements — still need to be worked out, and the program will require approval by the Legislature in Sacramento.

“Gov. Newsom’s new rebate proposal sends a clear message,” California Air Resources Board Chair Lauren Sanchez said Tuesday. “California isn’t slowing down, we’re still leading the pack. It’s not just about clean air, it’s smart economic policy.”

Ivan Drury, senior manager of auto insights at Edmunds.com, said the state’s drop in fourth-quarter sales did not surprise him.

“If anybody thought that there would be a sustained level of sales, post-federal tax credit, they would have to be insane,” he said. “It was destined to happen.”

The 79,066 registrations of zero-emission vehicles in the last three months of 2025 represented the lowest number in California since the third quarter of 2022.

Drury and other auto analysts will keep a sharp eye on EV sales figures in the next few quarters to see if the numbers have bottomed out and then rebound or not.

“This consumer base wasn’t buying in the friendliest conditions” in the fourth quarter, Drury said, “and going forward it should get better. … If the numbers (in succeeding quarters) come back and they’re very high, fantastic. But if it’s kind of murky and it looks very similar to Q4, then yeah, there will be a lot of questions.”

But the story is more complicated than that.

I study emerging technologies and how their development and deployment influence economic, institutional and societal outcomes, including environmental sustainability. From my research, I see that even as AI uses a lot of energy, it can also make systems cleaner and smarter.

AI is already helping to save energy and water, cut emissions and make businesses more efficient in agriculture, data centers, the energy industry, building heating and cooling, and aviation.

Agriculture

Agriculture is responsible for nearly 70% of the world’s freshwater use, and competition for water is growing.

AI is helping farmers use water more efficiently. Argentinian climate tech startup Kilimo, for example, tackles water scarcity with an AI-powered irrigation platform. The software uses large amounts of data, machine learning, and weather and satellite measurements to determine when and how much to water which areas of fields, ensuring that only the plants that actually need water receive it.

Chile’s Ministry of Agriculture has found that in that country’s Biobío region, farms using Kilimo’s precision irrigation systems have reduced water use by up to 30% while avoiding overirrigation. Using less water also reduces the amount of energy needed to pump it from the ground and around a farm.

Kilimo is one example that shows how AI can create economic incentives for sustainability: The amount of water farmers save from precision irrigation is verified, and credits for those savings are sold to local companies that want to offset some of their water use. The farmers then earn a profit – often 20% to 40% above their initial investment.

Data centers

U.S. data centers consumed about 176 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2023, accounting for roughly 4.4% of total U.S. electricity use. This number increased to 183 TWh in 2024. This growing energy footprint has made improving data center efficiency a critical priority for the operators of the data centers themselves, as well as the companies that rely on them – including cloud providers, tech firms and large enterprises running AI workloads – both to reduce costs and meet sustainability and regulatory goals.

AI is helping data centers become more efficient. The number of global internet users grew from 1.9 billion in 2010 to 5.6 billion in 2025. Global internet traffic surged from 20.2 exabytes per month in 2010 to 521.9 exabytes per month in 2025 – a more than 25-fold increase.

Despite the surge in internet traffic and users, data center electricity consumption has grown more moderately, rising from 1% of global electricity use in 2010 to 2% in 2025. Much of this is thanks to efficiency gains, including those enabled by AI.

AI systems analyze operational data in data centers – including workloads, temperature, cooling efficiency and energy use – to spot energy-hungry tasks. It adjusts computing resources to match demand and optimizes cooling. This lets data centers run smoothly without wasting electricity.

At Microsoft, AI is improving energy efficiency by using predictive analytics to schedule computing tasks. This lets servers enter low-power modes during periods of low demand, saving electricity during slower times. Meta uses AI to control cooling and airflow in its data centers. The systems stay safe while using less energy than they might otherwise.

In Frankfurt, Germany, Equinix uses AI to manage cooling and adjust energy use at its data center based on real-time weather. This improved operational efficiency by 9%, The New York Times reported.

Energy and fuels

Energy companies are using AI to boost efficiency and cut emissions. They deploy drones with cameras to inspect pipelines. AI systems analyze the images to more quickly detect corrosion, cracks, dents and leaks, which allows problems to be addressed before they escalate, improving overall safety and reliability.

Shell has AI systems that monitor methane emissions from its facilities by analyzing methane concentrations and wind data, such as speed and direction. This helps the system track how methane disperses, enabling it to pinpoint emission sources and optimize energy use. By identifying the largest leaks quickly, the system allows targeted maintenance and operational adjustments to further reduce emissions. Using that technology, the company says it aims to nearly eliminate methane leaks by 2030.

AI could speed up innovation in clean energy by improving solar panels, batteries and carbon-capture systems. In the longer term, it could enable major breakthroughs, including advanced biofuels or even usable nuclear fusion, while helping track and manage carbon-absorbing resources such as forests, wetlands and carbon storage facilities.

Shell uses AI across its operations to cut emissions. Its process optimizer for liquefied natural gas analyzes sensor data to find more efficient equipment settings, boosting energy efficiency and reducing emissions.

Buildings and district heating

The energy needed to heat, cool and power buildings is responsible for roughly 28% of total global emissions. AI initiatives are starting to reduce building emissions through smart management and predictive optimization.

In downtown Copenhagen, for instance, the local utility company HOFOR deployed thousands of sensors tracking temperatures, humidity and building energy flows. The system uses information about each building to forecast heating needs 24 hours in advance and automatically adjust supply to match demand.

The Copenhagen system was first piloted in schools and multifamily housing, with support from the Nordic Smart City Network and climate-innovation grants. It has since expanded to dozens of sites. Results were clear: Across participating buildings, energy use fell 15% to 25%, peak heating demand dropped by up to 30%, and carbon dioxide emissions decreased by around 10,000 tonnes per year.

AI can also help households and offices save energy. Smart home systems optimize heating, cooling and appliance use. Researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that by adopting AI, medium-sized office buildings in the U.S. could reduce energy use by 21% and cut carbon dioxide emissions by 35%.

Aviation

About 2% of all human-caused carbon dioxide emissions in 2023 came from aviation, which emitted about 882 megatons of carbon dioxide.

Contrails, the thin ice clouds formed when aircraft exhaust freezes at cruising altitudes, contribute more than one-third of aviation’s overall warming effect by trapping heat in the atmosphere. AI can optimize flight routes and altitudes in real time to reduce contrail formation by avoiding areas where the air is more humid and therefore more likely to produce contrails.

Airlines have also used AI to improve fuel efficiency. In 2023, Alaska Airlines used 1.2 million gallons less fuel by using AI to analyze weather, wind, turbulence, airspace restrictions and traffic to recommend the most efficient routes, saving around 5% on fuel and emissions for longer flights.

In short, AI affects the environment in both positive and negative ways. Already, it has helped industries cut energy use, lower emissions and use water more efficiently. Expanding these solutions could drive a cleaner, more sustainable planet.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/712762/original/file-20260115-56-ppnyes.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C65%2C3898%2C1949&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-21 09:59:17.191965

""After so many lies, it would be nice for everyone to stop pushing this false narrative that they could find the truth behind by simply looking up one single number for once,"" Jameson Dow, who has been reporting on EVs for the last decade, wrote in a piece appearing in Elektrek.

Dow's criticism is aimed at headlines claiming that EV sales are somehow stalling or even declining when, in fact, the opposite has been true.

Dow made his case using data from Statista, which showed that the global market share of battery EVs has continued to grow every year since 2015. Based on current trends, Statista has projected that EVs will account for 44.8% of the global market by 2030.

While some years have seen slower EV market growth than others, Dow pointed out that this is hardly the same as sales declining. With EV sales having as much as doubled year-over-year in some instances, it would be mathematically impossible for such trends to continue indefinitely.

""To take an extreme example, it would be odd to say that sales are slumping in Norway, which just set a record at 98.3% BEV [Battery EV] market share in September with 14,329 units moved,"" Dow wrote for Elektrek.

This represented 14.6% growth, which is far lower than the previous September's astronomical 96.4% increase, per Elektrek. However, as Dow explained, because market share cannot exceed 100%, such rapid growth has its limits.

With drivers able to save thousands of dollars each year by driving an EV versus a gas-powered car, it is unsurprising that so many car owners continue to make the switch. Additionally, many EV owners have pushed those savings even further by charging their vehicles at home, which is cheaper and more convenient than using public charging stations.

While installing a home charging station might seem daunting, Qmerit simplifies that process with free estimates and other helpful information.

To save even more money on charging costs, many homeowners pair their home charging stations with solar panels. If you're interested in learning more about home solar, The Cool Down's Solar Explorer offers free, easy-to-use online tools that allow you to compare quotes from trusted partners, saving you up to $10,000 in the process.

One such longtime TCD solar partner, EnergySage, takes the complication out of home solar with its ability to view multiple bids from vetted local installers.

Combining home solar panels with a Level 2 charger from Qmerit can allow you to make the most of EVs' cost-saving benefits.

POWERGEN 2026 continues through Jan. 22 at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center, building on Monday’s technical foundation with a week of executive dialogue, technical sessions and networking for the power generation community.","With the U.S. energy sector in the middle of unprecedented load growth driven by data centers and industrialization, it would likely be unwise to turn your nose up at any specific generation source. But with everything changing so fast, and with remaining uncertainty about how much actual load growth we will experience, how can utilities know they’re adequately preparing without taking on unnecessary costs?

Those were the sentiments at POWERGEN 2026’s Opening Keynote, which brought together leaders from utilities, engineering firms, technology providers and the research community to examine how the industry is responding to rapid change.

‘We’ve got to have it all’

The opening keynote began with a session between Rudy Garza, President & CEO – CPS Energy; and Victor Suchodolski, Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer – Sargent & Lundy; moderated by Ahsan Yousufzai, Global Director Energy – NVIDIA. The trio discussed the unforeseen changes in the power industry that AI has stirred up; how to plan for uncertain projected load growth; how nuclear’s role will evolve in Texas; and pesky bottlenecks that can bring entire projects to a halt.

“The industry’s changing at a pace quicker than I think any any of us ever thought,” Garza said. “The pressure is exponentially changing on us in a way that is requiring us to really stretch every part of our business.”

There’s still plenty of uncertainty in the air surrounding the projected load growth the U.S. could experience. It’s currently unclear if all of the gigawatts of projected load growth will actually come to fruition, but utilities need to be prepared anyway, Garza argued. Otherwise, they may be blindsided by the lack of generation, transmission, and all of the components of these systems that can have large lead times.

“You’re going to have to teach an old dog new tricks, and the old dog is the utility industry,” Garza said. “We’re not used to changing the way we think about things. And if we don’t, the industry is going to go around us, and that’s not good for anybody.”

With so much on the line, the power industry doesn’t have much room to be picky. Nearly every existing form of generation will have a seat at the table – something Texas is already plenty familiar with: the state currently leads the nation in renewable and battery deployments.

“We’ve got to have it all,” Garza said. “And, you know, we don’t spend a lot of time here in San Antonio arguing over which resource is the right resource or the wrong resource.”

At Sargent & Lundy, Suchodolski is seeing firsthand how the markets are responding positively to more certainty – even gas and nuclear are both showing growth, when they have historically always run opposite to each other.

“With respect to bulk gas generation, regulatory and permitting are less of a driver now, and that’s primarily due to the longer lead time, so you can run in parallel with the permits,” Suchodolski said. “You also have partnerships with OEMs, and you can see there that there’s synergies with knowing what your air missions are going to look like, or what kind of designs you’re going to get. And you can design these projects a little bit more on the front end, you can buy equipment more on the front end.”

However, as some bottlenecks ease up, others become more prominent. Now, delays are being caused by power delivery center components, circuit breakers, and even emergency diesel generators, Suchodolski noted.

“This is really a power generation conference, but the grid is out there too,” Suchodolski said. “We are seeing transmission still having some issues with respect to the permitting process and getting things done as quickly as we want them. So it still takes time. There have been some strides here, but the transmission line projects are not going as quickly as we would hope that hope they would.”

Future nuclear deployments are going to look much different than what the U.S. saw in the 20th century. Garza argued that without state or federal incentives, new, large baseload nuclear generators like we built in the 70s will remain a relic of the past: there’s currently just too much risk and cost involved for that to be feasible. But next-gen nuclear reactors like SMRs, which have a much smaller footprint, could have a very promising future, especially for large loads like data centers, which are now required in Texas to have the ability to go off-grid on their own power sources if the grid gets squeezed.

At least one thing is clear though: the U.S. is going to have to build a lot of new generation, especially as older generating units are retiring. Many of those old units are on their last limbs already, being kept running now only out of necessity.

“ERCOT put one of our older units that we were trying to retire into what they call a reliability must run status, and it’s cost us millions of dollars trying to give that unit another three years of life,” Garza said. “So is that the most efficient, you know, use of our of our limited capital, or do we just need to build new stuff?”

How can AI help speed up new nuclear deployments?

In the next panel of Tuesday morning’s opening keynote, Raiford Smith, Global Market Lead for Power and Energy – Google Cloud; and Lou Martinez Sancho, CTO – Westinghouse Electric Company discussed a collaboration between Google and Westinghouse to create a custom AI-powered platform meant to assist and speed up reactor construction.

Westinghouse plans to have 10 of its AP1000 reactors under construction by 2030, and this platform is a key part of getting that plan into motion. The nuclear industry is notoriously heavily regulated, which can cause projects to take longer than some would like.

“We started this journey and needed to downsize basically the time to deliver new nuclear into market,” Sancho said. “But we needed also to utilize it to improve the way we are operating the current plants, [so] we can understand better how to do super power upgrades to deliver more.”

AI’s ability to learn and retain information has made it attractive to users like Westinghouse. The days of simple “if, then” statements may soon be behind us, Smith argued.

“Better yet, this is a solution that we collectively worked on for a work management problem for nuclear, but work management problems can be addressed using the same capabilities, as long as you have the foundational data and the frameworks – they can also be addressed the same way,” Smith said. “So the technology isn’t a one-off. The technology is not so bespoke that it cannot be applicable elsewhere.”

Details matter

In the final portion of Tuesday’s opening keynote, Mike Caravaggio, Vice President, Energy Supply, Fleet Reliability – EPRI painted a picture of the current moment the industry has unexpectedly found itself in, and what the coming years could look like.

Caravaggio echoed previous panelist arguments that each and every form of generation will have its own role to play, even though all gigawatts aren’t created equal.

“A gigawatt is not a gigawatt, is not a gigawatt,” Caravaggio said. “Our different technologies will fill this load growth void in different ways. A solar plant can’t do what a nuclear plant can’t can do. A gas turbine can move a lot faster than a combined cycle. We need to balance these technologies to meet the needs of these data centers.”

But that variance applies to the load side as well. Depending on their purpose, data centers can have vastly different load profiles from each other.

“These details are really going to matter,” Caravaggio said.

Seal the cracks Air seal your home.
Sealing these is a cost-effective way to retain heat and save money.
Air sealing costs about $500 but will save you about that amount in a year, Willman said.
“That has long-term impact and also has the added benefit of decreasing your energy bills.” IndyStar's environmental reporting is made possible through the generous support of the nonprofit Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust.","Residential electricity costs are rising faster than they have in years, but there are a few ways Hoosiers can take matters into their own hands to squeeze out some savings on their bills.

The historically high cost of electricity made headlines last summer when the Citizens Action Coalition analyzed statewide data and found residential bills saw the largest year-over-year increase since 2005.

This session some state lawmakers will consider a number of bills that make energy affordability a priority. But bills take time, the language in them can change and there is no guarantee any of the bills will become law.

Here are some tips that can help Hoosiers find relief now.

Get an energy audit

Get an energy audit of your home, says Christin Willman, the weatherization training director at the Indiana Community Action Association, which provides resources to help “low-income individuals attain self-sufficiency.”

An energy audit can identify how much energy the home uses, inefficiencies and where problems exist. Indiana utilities offer these audits to households of all incomes. People in lower income brackets may have access to free services.

Hoosiers willing to pay a bit for their services can go to Building Performance Institute to find a certified energy auditor to do the assessment.

“When it comes to saving energy, a certified energy auditor will tell you where to get biggest bang for buck,” Willman said.

Seal the cracks

Air seal your home. Sealing the cracks and openings in a home is like closing a pipe of hot air that funnels all that warmth outside. Every home has little cracks between where wires come out of drywall and other pathways where lights or junction boxes go. Sealing these is a cost-effective way to retain heat and save money.

Air sealing costs about $500 but will save you about that amount in a year, Willman said. Look for a contractor with a blower door. These devices are set up in the front door frame and find air leaks that come from everything from the space around wall outlets and light fixtures to leaky ducts and dryer vents.

One way to know your house is leaking air is to look at the roof after a snow or frost.

“If it snows an inch and the next day you still have snow over your whole roof, you’re probably OK,” Willman said. “But if you see big black patches of asphalt shingles, you know you’ve got a real big problem. You’re losing heat and paying utilities more than you should.”

A product called Mastic available at hardware stores can be used in a caulking gun to seal up ducts.

Also check furnace ducts for leaks. Follow the duct work and check for any air blowing out from the duct connections when the furnace is running.

Quick Tips to save money

There are also some simpler things Hoosiers can do to make their homes more energy efficient.Willman and her colleague Dan Phillips provided some quick tips for Hoosiers:

DO:

Replace indoor and outdoor lights with LEDs

Apply weather stripping around doors and windows

Install programmable thermostats

Clean the dryer’s lint trap after every use

Replace the furnace filter every month

DON'T:

Dress for warm weather inside when it’s cold outside

Keep blinds closed during winter days (sunlight provides free heat)

Seal a vent and shut the door to an unused room

Use furnace filters above MERV rating 8 unless directed by a medical professional

Prior to 2010, fewer than 600 zero-emission vehicles had been sold in the state, according to the California Energy Commission.
“California didn’t reach 2.5 million zero-emission vehicles by accident — we invested in this future when others said it was impossible,” Newsom said in a statement.
Nationwide, the share of electric vehicles sold among all new vehicles fell from 10.5% in the third quarter last year to 5.8% in the fourth quarter, according to Cox Automotive.
The Advanced Clean Cars II Rule requires 68% of new cars be zero-emission by 2030, and 100% by 2035.","More than 2.5 million electric vehicles have been sold in California since 2010, exceeding one of the state’s EV goals despite setbacks in clean energy brought on by the Trump administration.

This week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced that the Golden State surpassed a target to put 1.5 million zero-emission vehicles on the road by 2025.

Former Gov. Jerry Brown set the goal in 2012 with an executive order that also allocated $120 million for charging infrastructure. Prior to 2010, fewer than 600 zero-emission vehicles had been sold in the state, according to the California Energy Commission.

“California didn’t reach 2.5 million zero-emission vehicles by accident — we invested in this future when others said it was impossible,” Newsom said in a statement. “California is ensuring American workers and manufacturers can compete and win in the industries that will define this century.”

Shortly after taking office for the second time, President Trump signed an executive order that cut funding for charging infrastructure, eliminated a $7,500 EV tax incentive and abandoned an earlier goal that EVs make up half of new cars sold nationally by 2030.

Inflation and auto tariffs have also acted as boundaries to EV adoption as cash-strapped drivers aim to avoid the higher price of purchasing and insuring an EV.

Nearly 23% of new vehicles sold in California in 2025 were considered zero-emission vehicles, though EV sales were down in the state and across the U.S. compared to the year prior.

California counts plug-in hybrid vehicles as zero-emission even though PHEVs rely on a combination of gas and electricity.

EV sales jumped last year ahead of the expiration of the tax credit as consumers rushed to take advantage of the incentive. After the credit was eliminated on Sept. 30, sales declined sharply.

Nationwide, the share of electric vehicles sold among all new vehicles fell from 10.5% in the third quarter last year to 5.8% in the fourth quarter, according to Cox Automotive.

Despite the achievement touted in Davos, California failed to reach a separate goal approved by the California Air Resources Board in 2022 that 35% of new cars must be zero-emission by 2026. The Advanced Clean Cars II Rule requires 68% of new cars be zero-emission by 2030, and 100% by 2035.

In the fourth quarter of 2025, only 18% of new cars sold in the state were zero-emission.

California’s EV market has still proven resilient in the face of declining federal support.

The state leads the country in EV adoption and has a network of more than 200,000 public and shared charging stations, the governor’s office said.

In response to the loss of the federal EV tax credit, Newsom proposed a $200-million incentive program to accelerate EV adoption in his Jan. 9 budget. Private companies are creating their own incentives too, such as Costco, which offers members $1,000 off several electric Cadillac models.

In addition to consumer incentives, the California Energy Commission’s Clean Transportation Investment Plan includes a $98.5-million allocation for light-duty zero-emission vehicle infrastructure.

“While the federal government reversed and put up roadblocks, the global zero-emission vehicle market surged ahead last year,” said California Air Resources Board Chair Lauren Sanchez in a statement. “Governor Newsom’s new rebate proposal sends a clear message: California isn’t slowing down, we’re still leading the pack.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/165e9a4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1495x785+22+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3d%2Fc3%2Fd8afc603456c9d5e8b021d37ab91%2Fimg-0702-7.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 11:04:36.692119

Congress made $4.4 billion available to states under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, per official estimates. But so far, states have asked Uncle Sam to reimburse them for only $94 million, according to data from the Federal Highway Administration, which oversees the NEVI program.

Five states — Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Nevada and Wyoming — have spent no money.

The new data appeared in a legal filing last week in a lawsuit that Democratic states filed against the Trump administration for freezing their NEVI funds. It’s the latest sign that NEVI, an early part of the Biden administration’s push to accelerate EV adoption, is struggling to stand up charging stations on highways and build confidence in the EV future among road-trippers.

“That’s unfortunately not a very positive story,” said Loren McDonald, an EV-charging analyst who has closely tracked NEVI’s spending.

However, state officials and experts expressed confidence that NEVI’s roughest days are in the rear view mirror, and that the path seems clear for new charging plazas to steadily come online this year and into 2027 and 2028. The Trump administration ended its seven-month funding freeze in August, and states have plans in place to ramp up construction.

First, the program has to dodge cuts from Congress as lawmakers write a new surface-transportation bill. A bipartisan package announced Tuesday more than $500,000 from NEVI funds meant for states and puts it toward other purposes at FHWA — despite Democrats’ earlier insistence that EV chargers get more funding, not less. The Sierra Club said in a statement that the change “would sabotage states’ efforts to resume NEVI buildout.”

Hard from the start

The NEVI program has suffered the twin challenges of bureaucracy and political controversy.

NEVI is a creature of the bipartisan infrastructure law that Congress approved in 2021. It routed EV charging funds through traditional highway spending channels — a move that caused state departments of transportation to move cautiously because they didn’t know how to build charging stations.

Then President Donald Trump, who mocked NEVI’s slow rollout during the 2024 presidential campaign, paused the program last year, causing many station builders to slow down or back out.

Meanwhile, a somewhat rosier picture of NEVI’s progress can be found in a different number.

States have obligated $1.4 billion of funds. Money is considered obligated when the federal government believes a state has a clear enough plan that it approves the money to be spent. (States receive that obligated money only after they’ve paid their vendors and submitted their receipts to the federal government.)

These increasingly certain plans are creating confidence that more NEVI-funded EV stations are coming soon.

“Assuming no new political hurdles arise, it wouldn’t be a stretch to see the current open site count double by the end of the year,” wrote Steve Birkett, an independent EV-charging-station analyst, in a post on LinkedIn.

Estimates vary on the number of NEVI stations that are now open to serve the public.

One EV-data shop, Atlas Public Policy, counts 121 open NEVI locations. Birkett’s tally reaches 150.

NEVI aims to build an EV station every 50 miles on highways. That would mean roughly 1,600 stations once the network is fully built.

Ohio, which alongside Pennsylvania leads in NEVI station openings, said that both spending and new charging plazas are coming. The state currently has 19 stations open and 12 more slated to start construction this spring. Still, the state has spent only $8.3 million of the $140 million it has available.

“Some developers haven’t yet invoiced for completed work, so we expect that number to increase in the coming months as invoices continue to be received and paid,” said Breanna Badanes, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Transportation, in an email. “We anticipate a big uptick in spending in 2026.”

Trump’s freeze and a long thaw

The biggest and most recent speed bump for NEVI, some state officials said, was Trump’s funding freeze.

The freeze that Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy began last February ended in August, when the administration relented against legal challenges and offered new, simplified guidance. Those seven months threw carefully laid plans into limbo, said Jared Wiley, director of the Arkansas Department of Transportation.

Before the pause, Arkansas had awarded contracts for 19 sites, at a total cost of $15 million. Now, after the pause, nine station builders have backed out and others three are considering their next move. Only seven are still committed.

Arkansas is looking for new applicants for those idled sites, a process that may take another year.

“All that time was lost and we are now playing catch-up,” Wiley said.

Meanwhile, other states celebrated the resolution to Trump’s freeze — new guidance.

Wyoming had originally refused to build EV stations every 50 miles, as the Biden administration required. The state argued that no services or even buildings existed at some far-flung outposts.

But Trump’s new guidance erased that 50-mile rule, and Wyoming is doing what it has wanted to do all along: using the federal money to build charging stations on routes between Wyoming’s national parks and EV-loving California.

“Our goal is to use NEVI to help EV-driving tourists get from the interstate highways to popular destinations like Yellowstone National Park,” said Jordan Young, a spokeswoman for Wyoming’s Department of Transportation.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/d1/b4/a3392bd2436b8e6e7e5367a4b0e9/climate-electric-vehicles-64390.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 09:59:25.855432

Energy storage company NeoVolta announced its collaboration with BESS manufacturer PotisEdge and its majority owner, renewable energy giant LONGi to form NeoVolta Power, LLC.

The move represents NeoVolta’s first foray into domestic manufacturing and its expansion into utility-scale and commercial energy storage markets.

“I don’t see our move as a pivot, but rather a response to market needs and policy requirements,” said NeoVolta CEO Ardes Johnson. He told pv magazine USA that the policy changes of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) have created a “window of opportunity” to partner with manufacturing market leaders. “This move wasn’t about leaving residential behind.”

The facility, which will be based in Pendergrass, Georgia, and will support approximately 89 production personnel, is expected to begin mass production later this year with an initial production capacity of 2 GWh annually that’s scalable up to 8 GWh. Situated along the I-85 corridor, production will initially focus on prismatic-cell battery pack assembly and DC container integration for utility-scale applications.

“The Georgia facility is the beginning,” Johnson said, though NeoVolta’s goal is to keep growing once they have “demand, contracted backlog and the financing and policy environment [to] make the economics work.”

He expects part of that demand to arrive on NeoVolta’s doorstep due to the updated foreign entity of concern (FEOC) guidelines under the OBBBA, particularly as the company has structured their facility, partnerships and procurement structures around domestic content compliance. Initial funding for the joint venture comes in part from a $13 million private placement given to NeoVolta by Infinite Grid Capital. However, project-level debt financing and incentive monetization will provide long-term funding and enable manufacturing expansion.

“We want to avoid the classic over-capitalization for expanded manufacturing, only to have that equity sit in the form of inventory,” Johnson explained, noting that the company is being “very disciplined” in its approach.

60% of the joint venture will be held by NeoVolta, whose role will focus on product strategy, commercialization and customer engagement. PotisEdge, which owns 20% of NeoVolta Power, LLC., will bring its large-scale BESS manufacturing and production expertise. The final 20% will be split among a group of strategic investors that will provide technical and operational advising.

“Scaling at this level is really about certification, safety testing, software integration, quality control and financing confidence,” Johnson pointed out. “That’s why our partnership with PotisEdge and LONGi is so important.”

Global Supplier Targets 800K Units Annually at Chennai-Area Plant

The India market just became significantly more important for global brake system suppliers. ZF Group has commissioned an electric park brake production line at its Oragadam manufacturing complex near Chennai, signaling aggressive expansion into what company leadership is calling “the new China” for automotive growth.

The German supplier’s new facility will produce up to 800,000 EPB units annually at peak capacity, with systems already shipping to domestic automakers for integration into recently launched battery electric vehicles. For brake industry suppliers and aftermarket distributors watching Asian market developments, this move underscores India’s emergence as both a consumption market and a strategic global supply hub for advanced braking technology.

Localization Strategy Reshapes Supply Chain

The Oragadam line represents more than capacity expansion—it’s a deliberate restructuring of ZF’s supply chain architecture in the region. Currently, approximately 40 percent of EPB components are sourced from Indian suppliers. ZF India President Akash Passey indicated plans to push local content to 80-90 percent within two years.

That localization trajectory creates substantial opportunities for friction material suppliers, caliper component manufacturers, and actuator specialists operating in India. Tier-two and tier-three suppliers capable of meeting ZF’s quality specifications could find themselves integrated into a supply chain serving both domestic OEMs and global export programs.

The investment falls within ZF’s previously announced $200-250 million India commitment, though specific EPB line capital expenditure was not disclosed. What’s the potential ripple effect for regional brake component suppliers as localization targets climb?

India as Global Brake Technology Hub

ZF Board Member Peter Holdmann drew direct comparisons between India’s current growth trajectory and China’s automotive expansion, citing infrastructure development as a key catalyst. The company’s dual technical centers in Hyderabad and Chennai now support engineering work for both passenger and commercial vehicle applications across multiple markets.

This “engineering for the world” approach positions India beyond simple low-cost manufacturing. Advanced development work—including potential ADAS integration with braking systems—is increasingly occurring domestically. Board Member Andreas Moser confirmed ZF is evaluating advanced driver assistance system deployment in the Indian market, which would create new integration requirements with foundation and park brake systems.

The Oragadam facility represents ZF’s tenth manufacturing location in Tamil Nadu alone, making the state a concentrated center for the supplier’s India operations. Globally, ZF has produced over 250 million EPB calipers, giving the company substantial scale advantages as electric park brake adoption accelerates across vehicle segments.

Regulatory Tailwinds Support Growth

Indian regulatory frameworks increasingly mandate advanced safety systems, creating sustained demand for technologies like EPB. OEMs serving the market are investing heavily in safety and quality systems regardless of powertrain type—both EV and ICE platforms are driving brake technology upgrades.

For aftermarket stakeholders, the growing EPB installed base in India will eventually create service and replacement demand, though the relatively young vehicle parc means meaningful aftermarket volumes remain years away.

The Bottom Line

ZF’s Oragadam EPB line positions India as a critical node in global brake system supply chains, with aggressive localization targets creating opportunities for regional component suppliers. As EPB adoption grows across Indian-market vehicles, brake industry professionals should monitor both OE supply dynamics and the long-term aftermarket implications of this expanding installed base.",https://thebrakereport.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ZF-in-India_Teaser_3_2_748px.webp,N,,2026-01-21 08:58:34.852483

And that growth means Michigan likely faces a challenge meeting its clean energy goals without further state action.

Those conclusions come from a new report from the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Data Center Power Play in Michigan” models possible growth scenarios for data centers in the state, as well as possible ways to meet their growing demands for energy.

Data centers are the technological backbone of artificial intelligence. Michigan has seen an explosion in the proposed number of data centers in recent months, after the state implemented tax credits meant to lure them here.

Those facilities are notoriously power hungry. The report’s mid-range model suggests they will make up 40% of the state’s energy demand growth by 2030, and that “over the next 25 years, such data center growth could put Michiganders at financial risk of $18 billion in additional electricity systems costs.""

Report author and Union of Concerned Scientists senior energy analyst Lee Shaver said that under any scenario, energy costs will go up. The real question, Shaver said, is who will pay for that.

“The really important thing is that just because costs increase does not mean that those costs have to be passed on to residents,” said Shaver.

But to prevent that from happening, Shaver said state lawmakers and the Michigan Public Service Commission must take steps to protect residential ratepayers, and to make sure the companies behind data centers foot the bill for their energy needs.

On the environmental side, Shaver noted that Michigan has set targets of reaching 80% power from renewable sources by 2035, and 100% by 2040. But with the growth of data centers, “What we see is that the amount of growth from data centers is so significant that even with those policies, carbon emissions in Michigan will still increase.”

Shaver said that if Michigan hopes to reach those targets, “there needs to be additional policy in the power sector to in order to make that happen.” The report recommends a carbon reduction strategy, which would involve putting stricter limits on carbon emissions. It also suggests that bringing back renewable energy tax credits put in place by the Biden Administration, but rescinded by President Donald Trump’s, would encourage the energy and industrial sectors to adopt renewables on a larger scale more quickly.

But the report stresses that the time for policymakers to act is now. The Michigan Public Service Commission recently approved contracts with DTE Energy to power the state’s first massive “hyperscale” data center in Washtenaw County’s Saline Township, which included some level of protections for residential ratepayers. But Shaver said much about the terms of those contracts either still remain obscure, or will be determined by future utility filings, and “we don’t think they’re going far enough” to ensure that data centers bear the burden of their energy requirements.

And with new proposed data centers entering the pipeline almost constantly, Shaver stressed that citizen input is also vital. “None of these hyperscale data centers have been built in Michigan yet,” he said. “So now is really an important time to make your voice heard. Because if we wait until they've been built, it's going to be too late to do anything about it.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d9373b8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3984x2092+0+282/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8f%2Fa0%2F0e566eea46138a4f6074319486bb%2Fimg-0133.JPG,N,,2026-01-21 08:58:30.304748

Electricity demand is increasing, and so are electricity costs for households and businesses across the United States. After more than two decades of relatively flat electricity demand growth, the near-term surge in new demand from “hyperscale” AI data centers is poised to send electricity prices through the roof without strong ratepayer protections and other policy interventions.

Addressing these new threats from data centers—alongside existing price drivers such as increasing fossil gas prices and the high upfront cost of necessary infrastructure upgrades in the face of climate-fueled extreme weather—will require concerted efforts to address both electricity demand and supply. Unfortunately, actions taken during the first year of the Trump administration are moving us in the wrong direction and could result in much greater increases in electricity costs, while also risking more outages, more pollution, and more climate-damaging emissions. A new analysis from the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), Data Center Power Play, makes clear just how much is at stake, finding that:

Data center demand is highly uncertain, but will be the greatest near-term driver of load growth

Current policies risk putting the United States on a path to meet much of this demand with fossil fuels

Stronger policies can shift our path to running primarily on renewables without sacrificing reliability, while also bringing important health and climate benefits

The looming data center-driven demand surge comes with significant costs across all scenarios, and policymakers must take steps to ensure that these costs are not passed on to consumers

Overall, our modeling demonstrates that clean and renewable energy can meet the challenge of load growth from data centers, but policymakers must be proactive to protect our health, environment, and financial interests.

Trump admin sidelines clean energy amid rising electricity demand

Even as the Trump administration boasts of leading the global AI race, it is sidelining the clean, plentiful, affordable, and efficient energy technologies that are best poised to power such a future.

Even with investments in energy efficiency—which the Trump administration is aggressively undermining—we will still need to significantly increase electricity generation to meet surging demand growth from data centers and electrification. This will require building as much new, low-cost capacity as quickly as possible, and making it as clean as possible to avoid negative climate, health, and environmental impacts. Here, renewable energy technologies, especially solar and wind combined with energy storage, check all the boxes. They have a distinct advantage over fossil fuels and low carbon technologies such as new nuclear and carbon capture and storage (CCS), which have long lead times, high costs, and are largely unproven technologies.

Combining wind and solar with battery storage, while requiring greater data center flexibility, offers a promising solution for powering data centers and meeting overall electricity demand. Over the past few years, the vast majority of new capacity additions in the United States, and globally, have been wind, solar, and battery storage. These technologies also dominate new capacity waiting to be developed in transmission interconnection queues.

Further, the costs for wind and solar have fallen 70 to 90% over the last 15 years, making them cheaper in many cases than new gas and existing coal plants, even without subsidies and before factoring in environmental and health benefits. The lead time to plan and build wind and solar projects is also much shorter than it is for new gas or nuclear plants. In addition, recent studies have identified demand-side flexibility at data centers as an important strategy for reducing peak demand and lowering costs.

In striking contrast to this forward momentum is the Trump administration’s stated preference for using dirty, outdated fossil fuel generation to power emerging technology. At the same time, it has created significant headwinds for wind, solar, and storage, including rolling back federal tax credits, illegally rescinding clean energy grants and financing approved by Congress and under contract, illegally halting offshore wind and other renewable energy projects that are either under construction or fully permitted after lengthy reviews, blocking new wind and solar permitting from moving forward, and more.

The stakes are high. The path that states and the nation choose on how to power data centers has wide-ranging implications for energy affordability, reliability, public health, the climate, and the economy as a whole.

Powering data centers with clean energy vs. fossil fuels

To better understand the potential impacts of meeting US electricity demand growth from AI data centers, UCS’s new analysis highlights the consequences of data centers’ growing electricity demand on the US power grid and how decisionmakers can mitigate harmful economic, climate, and health impacts through clean energy deployment and strong ratepayer protections.

Using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (which the Trump Administration recently renamed the National Laboratory of the Rockies) open-source Regional Energy Deployment System’s (ReEDS) power sector model, we analyzed the impacts of meeting electricity demand growth from AI data centers on electricity generation, electricity costs, and the health and climate costs of emissions from using fossil fuels—as well as the avoided health and climate costs of emissions from using clean energy instead. Since future data center demand growth and the policy landscape are highly uncertain, we modeled multiple demand growth and energy policy scenarios.

Data center demand is surging—and highly uncertain

We project overall US electricity demand to increase 62% between 2025 and 2050 under a “mid-level” data center demand growth scenario, and as much as 79% under a “high” data center demand growth scenario (Figure 1). Data centers account for about half of total demand growth over the next five years, but this share falls over time as electrification increases in other sectors (especially transportation). While we vary the amount of data center demand growth, we assumed the same level of demand growth in other sectors under all scenarios. Studies by UCS and others show that higher levels of electrification of other sectors would likely be needed to achieve economy-wide net zero emissions by 2050.

The number of data centers anticipated to be built in the United States and how much

electricity they will need are both highly uncertain. Recent actions by electric

utilities and regional transmission organizations indicate that many proposals to build data centers are redundant. In addition, utilities, which earn a guaranteed return on investment, have an incentive to overestimate future demand. This could lead to overbuilding the electricity system, higher costs, and stranded assets. A lack of transparency compounds the uncertainties, as proposals to build data centers and the power plants to serve them, are typically confidential.

Current policies increase reliance on fossil fuels

Under current state and federal climate and energy policies, our analysis finds that the United States is likely to increase its reliance on fossil fuels as electricity demand grows due to data centers and electrification of other sectors. We found that gas generation could increase 23% between 2026 and 2035 and 77% by 2050, with 90 gigawatts (GW) of new gas capacity added by 2035 and a whopping 335 GW by 2050. (One gigawatt is enough to power about 750,000 average US homes per year and could be supplied by 294 utility-scale land based wind turbines, according to DOE)

While our analysis projects coal generation to continue to decline in response to planned retirements, remaining coal plants are dispatched more to help meet the growth in demand. While the model includes the Trump administration’s rollbacks of EPA power plant carbon standards, we didn’t account for other regulatory rollbacks and subsidies that could further boost coal generation. For example, we didn’t model recent Trump Administration actions to use emergency powers to prevent at least six uneconomic coal plants from retiring, which are expected to increase electricity costs for consumers.

Even with these caveats, we found that the additional fossil fuels burned to power data centers could increase power plant carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 19% and result in $1.6 trillion in climate and health damages over the next decade, growing to $4.5 trillion by 2050, under our mid-level data center demand growth scenario. We expect that recent actions not included in the model would only increase these costs compared to our results.

Stronger policies ensure that clean energy powers data centers

Restoring federal clean energy tax credits accelerates the deployment of wind and solar to power data centers. It also reduces reliance on gas and coal generation to meet the growth in electricity demand.

Adopting policies to reduce US power sector emissions of CO2 would go even further, facilitating the clean energy transition to help meet economywide emission reduction targets. With a target of a 95% reduction in CO2 below 2026 levels by 2050, wind and solar generation nearly triple between 2026 and 2035 and increase five-fold by 2050 to replace coal and gas. Combined, all renewable energy sources provide more than 60% of total US electricity generation by 2035 and 81% by 2050.

Data centers put ratepayers at risk of higher electricity costs

Rapid data center growth results in more than $500 billion in cumulative electricity costs nationally by 2035 and nearly $1 trillion by 2050 across our three policy scenarios and assuming mid-level demand growth. This represents 18-24 percent of total US wholesale electricity costs over the same period (see Figure 5). Without strong ratepayer protections requiring Big Tech companies to pay their fair share, these costs could get passed onto households and other businesses.

Restoring federal clean energy tax credits to the timelines and phaseouts that were included in the Inflation Reduction Act results in cumulative savings of $248 billion (4 percent) through 2050 compared with the “Current Policies” scenario. This underscores that recent actions by Congress and President Trump to rollback tax credits for solar and wind as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) will make electricity less affordable, which is consistent with other recent studies.

Restoring the tax credits and adopting more ambitious climate and clean energy policies that nearly decarbonize the power sector by 2050 (the Low-Carbon Policy scenario) results in higher costs of $291 billion (12 percent) from 2026 to 2035 and $412 billion (7 percent) through 2050 compared with Current Policies. But these costs of transitioning to clean, low carbon energy sources are far outweighed by the avoided climate and health damages from burning fossil fuels, reaching more than $1.6 trillion between 2026 and 2035 and $13.3 trillion by 2050. Additional interventions, such as using clean electricity to replace fossil fuel use in other sectors, investing in energy efficiency, and increasing data center flexibility, could significantly lower overall energy bills.

We can avoid the health and environmental harms associated with unmitigated growth of data centers

Ensuring that data centers are efficient, flexible, and powered with clean energy requires stronger state and federal policies. Policymakers and regulators should require utilities and data center developers to be more transparent and accountable, improve long-term planning for meeting data center demand, and protect other customers from cost increases and negative health impacts.

They should also require utilities and data center developers to meet demand growth with new low carbon or zero carbon generation and prioritize energy storage instead over diesel or gas generation for back-up power. Policies supporting the development of data centers should include standards and guardrails that protect public health while reducing emissions, energy and water use, and other environmental impacts.

Only bold action will ensure that the nation meets electricity demand growth with clean energy, achieves its climate goals, and protects consumers from added costs brought on by the growth of data centers. Unmitigated data center growth should not continue in the absence of stronger policies and guardrails, given that the consequences for energy affordability, reliability, public health and the climate are so high. The path for the United States to achieve these benefits is clear.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Blog-Thumbnail-Solar-and-Battery-Storage.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 07:58:36.284888

Those who navigate policy complexity and secure compliant supply chains early, and strike a balance between resilience and cost, will be at an advantage.

Decisions taken in 2026, particularly around manufacturing sourcing and critical mineral processing, will determine the scale, cost and feasibility of clean technology deployment through the 2030s.

That in mind, we’ve drawn on unique insight from Wood Mackenzie Lens Power & Renewables and Supply Chain Analytics to compile our pick of the key themes to watch in the year ahead – and the policy signposts to look out for.

Fill in the form to access Global cleantech supply chain: key themes in 2026, or read on for a brief introduction to some of the topics explored.

Policy-driven supply chain localisation will be a defining theme of 2026

The push for supply chain resilience continues. While China consolidates manufacturing to institute growth discipline, Southeast Asia’s role will wane due to trade barriers. Capacity localisation will intensify with India and the Middle East emerging as new hubs for solar manufacturing.

Europe continues to pursue domestically produced Made in EU PV modules, albeit at a limited scale. In contrast, the US is aggressively reshaping its procurement regulations for foreign suppliers and tariff regimes across technologies, which could lead to a supply gap in 2026 between existing projects entering construction and domestic demand, especially for battery storage.

Is supply adequacy achievable by 2030? For more on this, read the full report.

Technology pivots toward efficiency, integration and standardisation

Expect to see solar players focus on incremental efficiency and integrated systems with improved utilisation and cost stability. By late 2026, competitive advantage in PV will hinge on delivering fully integrated module–inverter–tracker ecosystems with advanced digital monitoring and grid-support capabilities.

Energy storage is set to see early commercialisation of sodium-ion batteries, riven by concerns over lithium-ion supply chain resilience. In parallel, leading suppliers of lithium-ion batteries are advancing towards higher energy density, improved safety and smaller land footprint, with new battery cell capacities.

Meanwhile, wind original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) will shift away from size escalation towards performance and manufacturing discipline.

Even 5 GW of additional demand could combine with increases in electric transportation and building electrification to double the state’s energy consumption by 2050, the nonprofit said.

In addition to the energy export loophole identified in the UCS report, Michigan’s climate law contains an “off ramp” provision that allows utilities to keep fossil fuel generation online if there’s not enough capacity to meet demand.

Consumers Energy didn’t respond to a question about emissions from electricity exports.

The company will address state climate goals in its upcoming Integrated Resource Plan, which the company will file later this year, said spokesperson Matt Johnson.

DTE Energy did not answer questions about the potential impact of data centers on the utility’s emissions.

Data center-driven pollution could add to growing health risk: Nonprofit

Controlling carbon dioxide pollution would help rein in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide pollution, which natural gas generation emits in direct proportion to CO2, said Lee Shaver, senior energy analyst for the UCS.

Nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide are precursors to fine particulate matter, or PM 2.5, a pollutant linked to cardiopulmonary problems and premature death. Nitrogen oxides also contribute to ozone formation, which can cause respiratory problems and increase the frequency of asthma attacks.

Shaver praised Michigan’s renewable energy and clean energy standards, but said the buildout of data centers could threaten the state’s clean energy progress.

“But what we see is that, due to the load growth from data centers, even with those policies, carbon emissions and health damages from air pollution are going to continue to increase,” he said.

This pollution would come as climate change and climate-driven wildfires contribute to a deterioration in U.S. air quality.

In 2025, The American Lung Association gave the Detroit area an “F” rating for air quality in its annual State of the Air Report.

Science group: Michigan Legislature should close loophole

The Union of Concerned Scientists’ proposed CO2 reduction policy would create a hard limit on how much gas Michigan utilities can burn, Shaver said. The report calls on the Michigan legislature to enact this policy.

By closing the loophole that allows Michigan utilities to burn fossil fuels for energy exports, the policy would achieve net zero emissions by 2050, the UCS said.

UCS projects that fossil fuel emissions by Michigan utilities will otherwise rise by 26% between 2023 and 2050.

UCS proposes a phased policy, with an 80% emission reductions for out-of-state sales by 2040 and a 100% reduction by 2045.

Michigan exports minimal energy to other states, the USC report said. Demand from data centers in Illinois combined with increased transmission capacity will contribute to higher exports of electricity from Michigan in the future, Shaver said.

Adopting a CO2 reduction strategy in Michigan would also help limit the damage from climate change in the state, including rising temperatures and more intense storms, the report said. Deaths related to increased heat are already on the rise, Shaver said.

“If carbon emissions continue, that trend is going to continue.”",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/iStock-90386346.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 09:59:13.217628

Establishing a robust, domestic battery manufacturing ecosystem will create thousands of high-skilled, well-paid jobs, support regional growth and secure the long-term future of the UK’s automotive sector.
Gigafactories – large-scale battery manufacturing plants – should be recognised not merely as individual industrial projects, but as elements of strategic national infrastructure.
A named Cabinet minister should be given personal accountability for delivering a package of investments in EV, battery and active material manufacturing.
The UK Battery Strategy, the Modern Industrial Strategy, DRIVE35, the Battery Innovation Programme and recent gigafactory investments in Sunderland and Bridgwater all represent important steps forward.","Governments across the world are racing to secure leadership in EV and battery manufacturing. Europe, the United States and Asia are deploying substantial incentives and aggressive investment strategies, cutting planning times and lowering energy costs. The UK is in this race – but unless firm and coordinated action is taken, it risks falling behind.

Set against these challenges, however, lies a significant opportunity. Establishing a robust, domestic battery manufacturing ecosystem will create thousands of high-skilled, well-paid jobs, support regional growth and secure the long-term future of the UK’s automotive sector. It offers a route to link industrial competitiveness with net zero ambitions, demonstrating that economic resilience and environmental sustainability can – and must – go hand in hand.

Gigafactories – large-scale battery manufacturing plants – should be recognised not merely as individual industrial projects, but as elements of strategic national infrastructure. Countries that succeed in co-locating EV manufacturing with gigafactories will determine where future automotive platforms are allocated, where new EV models are built, and which nations retain volume automotive production. In short, decisions taken over the next few years will determine whether the UK remains a serious player in global automotive manufacturing or sees production and investment move offshore.

Against this backdrop, the UK cannot afford a passive “open for business” stance. It needs a more interventionalist mindset: one that combines financial incentives, site readiness and proactive ministerial engagement to prioritise attracting a major global OEM as demand anchor and secure investment in gigafactories and their supply chains. The question is no longer whether government should act, but how quickly and how decisively.

That is why the policy commission on gigafactories – bringing together senior cross-party figures and experts from industry, policy, academia and public service – has set out a clear, practical roadmap in its report, The UK Gigafactory Commission: Britain’s Battery Future. Its recommendations rest on three pillars: proactive government leadership, strengthened domestic capabilities and capacities and targeted policy and regulatory reform. These are not abstract policy ambitions. They are the conditions that global automotive and battery investors now expect as standard.

Government leadership must be central. Attracting gigafactory investment and securing long-term commitments from automotive manufacturers as a demand anchor requires decisive, top-level engagement. A named Cabinet minister should be given personal accountability for delivering a package of investments in EV, battery and active material manufacturing. That minister, supported by a small but empowered secretariat, should have the authority to convene departments, remove barriers – on grid, planning and skills – and lead senior-level negotiations with prospective investors.

Capabilities and capacity on the ground are equally critical. Investor-ready sites with pre-secured grid, water and transport infrastructure, coupled with predictable, competitive energy costs, are now a basic requirement if the UK is to compete with rival locations. In parallel, the UK must close persistent supply chain gaps by attracting investment in cathode and anode active materials and recycling, alongside development and scale up of next-generation chemistries.

Skills must be treated as strategic infrastructure as well. Gigafactories and active materials plans will require a steady pipeline of technicians and engineers. A coordinated national approach to skills – including apprenticeships specific to battery manufacturing, reskilling programmes drawing from adjacent industries and curriculum reform in colleges and universities – will be needed to build the skilled workforce required to be in place at the right scale and time.

Policy and regulatory interventions must underpin this strategy. The Zero Emission Vehicle mandate should be reviewed to align with market realities. Relief for energy-intensive industries relief must be broadened across the EV and battery supply chain on a predictable, long-term footing. A deferral or phased transition for post-2027 rules of origin deadlines should be pursued with EU partners to protect UK exporters from tariffs while domestic battery and materials capacity is built up.

There has been significant progress. The UK Battery Strategy, the Modern Industrial Strategy, DRIVE35, the Battery Innovation Programme and recent gigafactory investments in Sunderland and Bridgwater all represent important steps forward. The UK retains strong research and engineering capabilities and an established automotive base. But the Commission’s conclusion is clear: on their own, these initiatives are not yet sufficient to make the UK genuinely competitive. Without more proactive and coordinated intervention, the UK risks losing momentum at a critical time – with global firms committing capital elsewhere.

The Commission has therefore set out 10 priority recommendations that together provide a coherent roadmap. This represents a significant but achievable agenda. The next 12–18 months will be decisive. What is required is the political will, industry focus and collective resolve to turn ambition into delivery.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/89ea5bfdd8971598726906c5c381681a:8e09850a7cb8c223d24e8f4c10d9832a/matt-aug-2.jpg.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 04:59:26.401631

“CUB is disappointed to see ComEd come in with another bloated, expensive grid plan,” Moskowitz said.
In addition to increased delivery charges, ComEd customers have seen electricity supply charges skyrocket over the past year, in large part due to increased demand from the proliferation of data centers.
PJM Interconnection manages the electricity supply grid for 13 states, including ComEd’s 4.1 million customers in northern Illinois.","Also driving demand is the adoption of electric vehicles and building out the state’s charging infrastructure. In Illinois, Gov. JB Pritzker has set the goal of having 1 million electric vehicles on the road by 2030, but the state has a long way to go.

There are 164,000 EVs registered in the state as of January, according to data posted online by the secretary of state’s office. The vast majority are registered in ComEd’s service territory.

“There are over 10,000 charging ports just in ComEd service territory,” Quiniones said. “It’s still growing.”

Other system upgrades proposed for the new grid plan include refreshing the current meter fleet, developing flexible interconnections to incorporate more renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, and “hardening” substations to withstand the increasing frequency of severe weather events.

The ICC is expected to rule on the new grid plan by December, with ComEd then submitting a multiyear rate filing in 2027. If approved, the grid plan and subsequent rate impacts would be implemented beginning in 2028.

Sarah Moskowitz, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board, said in a statement Tuesday that the nonprofit consumer group plans to analyze the proposal to identify and push back on wasteful spending by the utility.

“CUB is disappointed to see ComEd come in with another bloated, expensive grid plan,” Moskowitz said. “Everyone supports a strong distribution system, but ComEd has a responsibility to maintain its grid in a way that benefits customers and doesn’t bankrupt them.”

Last month, the ICC sliced $25.4 million from ComEd’s $268.5 million annual rate reconciliation request. The approved $243 million rate adjustment will add an average of $3.10 per month to the average residential customers bill beginning in January, the utility said. ComEd customers are already dealing with higher delivery charges after the ICC approved a four-year, $606 million rate hike in December 2024 as part of the utility’s first power grid improvement plan, increasing average residential customer bills by $1.84 per month through 2027.

ComEd will file for a 2025 rate reconciliation in April, which if approved would raise delivery rates again in 2027.

In addition to increased delivery charges, ComEd customers have seen electricity supply charges skyrocket over the past year, in large part due to increased demand from the proliferation of data centers.

PJM Interconnection manages the electricity supply grid for 13 states, including ComEd’s 4.1 million customers in northern Illinois. In July, an annual capacity auction for expected reserve electricity needed during peak demand jumped 22% to a then-record $329.17 per Megawatt-day, meaning even higher supply prices for ComEd and its customers beginning in June 2026.

Those supply charges could go up even more down the road after PJM released the results of a new auction last month, setting the capacity price at a record $333.44 per Megawatt-day beginning in June 2027.

In December, ComEd announced it would be rebating $803 million as part of the state’s Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, which requires nuclear plants to issue customers a Carbon Mitigation Credit when energy prices are high.

The credits are a pass-through from Constellation, the former power generation subsidiary of Exelon that spun off as a stand-alone company in February 2022. The average ComEd customer can expect to receive about $13 per month in carbon credits on their electric bills over the first five months of 2026, the utility said.

But during the darkest, coldest days of the year, energy demand spikes while weather-dependent sources such as wind and solar often bottom out.
That’s the equivalent of the energy demand of the entire state of Oregon.
Smaller shortfalls are possible as soon as 2026, making the need for the UO’s generator units especially acute.","Oregon public power utility Eugene Water & Electric Board and the University of Oregon (UO) are launching a pilot project to better understand if running UO’s on-site natural gas generator in the coldest winter months can bolster grid reliability when demand for energy across the region is high.

EWEB predicts that running the generator during the winter will provide an essential source of reliable energy at times of high demand, while also reducing costs for both organizations and displacing less efficient and more carbon-intensive natural gas generators elsewhere in the region.

The pilot project will give EWEB and the UO the data needed to assess those predictions. The pilot project will also help the two organizations to develop workflows, processes and protocols for operating the generator, including assessing how quickly it can ramp up, the utility said.

The UO’s Central Power Station has a highly efficient combined heat and power plant. UO will use the steam to heat campus buildings and EWEB will purchase the electricity.

The generator can produce up to 10.6 megawatts of energy, or about 2% of EWEB customers’ energy demand during the highest hour of demand of the whole year. That’s roughly enough to power about 2,000 homes during a winter cold snap.

The UO’s gas generator is more efficient than many other gas plants in the region. Plus, it produces steam, which is used to heat buildings on campus.

“Because the UO generators can create both electricity and heat, it’s essentially a buy-one-get-one deal,” said EWEB Chief Energy Resources Officer Brian Booth. “That kind of efficiency is unique. If we can run the UO’s generators rather than purchase energy from a less efficient, more polluting power plant elsewhere, we view that as a smart climate move for our community.”

The current UO generator was installed in 2011. Since 2016, due to changing energy market conditions, UO has positioned it as a backup to EWEB power.

The pilot project grants EWEB the right to run the generator on and off in January and February, the coldest months of the year when energy demand is highest.

To determine when to turn the generator on and off, EWEB will assess regional power supply conditions.

Over the course of the year, hydropower supplies approximately half of the energy in the region, and 80% of EWEB’s energy. Nuclear, biomass, wind, natural gas, coal and smaller amounts of other resources also contribute.

But during the darkest, coldest days of the year, energy demand spikes while weather-dependent sources such as wind and solar often bottom out. On those days, grid operators turn to gas plants to fill the gap.

As a local power source that is not dependent on fickle weather conditions, the UO generators can also help keep the lights on when regional energy shortages threaten the grid, EWEB noted.

Initial results from a 2025 study conducted by the consulting firm Energy and Environmental Economics (E3) have found that the Greater Northwest -- a region that includes Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and parts of a couple other states -- could face a shortfall of 9 gigawatts of electricity during extreme conditions by 2030. That’s the equivalent of the energy demand of the entire state of Oregon.

The shortfalls could occur if an extended, days-long cold snap strikes during a dry year in which river flows are low, constraining the region’s hydropower resources. Smaller shortfalls are possible as soon as 2026, making the need for the UO’s generator units especially acute.

“The key to fighting the climate crisis is to electrify as many energy uses as possible, including home heating and transportation. But for customers to feel confident switching from fossil fuels to clean electricity, that electricity needs to be reliable and affordable,” Booth said. “By making the UO’s generators available to the grid, Eugene can help maintain regional reliability and affordability as the electric sector continues to decarbonize.”",https://www.publicpower.org/themes/custom/appa_foundation/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-21 07:58:40.801883

Without shareholders, the responsibility to question its decision-making falls on local power companies that operate without “any substantial leverage” from constituents.","Scholars assess the TVA as a blueprint for publicly owned utilities in the green energy transition.

As the effects of climate change become more severe, experts recognize the need to accelerate the transition to carbon-free energy. Some scholars argue that publicly owned utilities could “rapidly, affordably, and reliably” decarbonize energy production. But others point to the shortcomings of the United States’ largest publicly owned power company—the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)—and claim that utilities that follow the TVA’s public ownership model are “historical relics” destined to fail.

In a recent article, three energy policy experts argue that the TVA’s “decidedly mixed” record is the result of fixable institutional design choices rather than failures intrinsic to public ownership. Shelley Welton and Levi Phillips of the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School and Nikki Luke of the University of Tennessee contend that the TVA mixes organizational elements from federal agencies and corporate boardrooms, creating a “hodgepodge” that is “incoherent, ineffective, and deficient” at guiding climate-resilient development in the Tennessee Valley. But with targeted reforms, they suggest the TVA could become a blueprint for public utility ownership in the green energy transition.

Welton, Phillips, and Luke argue that “corporatization”—the inclusion of corporate governance mechanisms into the TVA—has eroded its accountability to the U.S. Congress, President, and local stakeholders, creating an institutional identity crisis given the agency’s public roots. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt envisioned the TVA as the gold standard “yardstick” by which private utilities would be measured, ensuring that electrification served the public.

Congress gave the TVA the authority and funding to drive development in the Southeast, with a mandate to control flooding, improve navigable waterways, and address poverty stemming from the Great Depression. From 1933 to 1953, the TVA fulfilled this mission by building dams and electrifying the region.

Welton, Phillips, and Luke contend that the TVA’s accountability to public officials decreased when legislation in 1959 and 1998 made it financially independent from Congress. The TVA no longer received federal funds and was prohibited from selling energy outside the Tennessee Valley. Yet, it was required to fulfill its non-energy obligations—such as flood control—using only revenue.

In 2005, Congress converted the TVA’s full-time three-member board into a part-time nine-member board and required that it appoint a CEO to oversee operations. Welton, Phillips, and Luke claim that the TVA’s lack of federal funding, combined with its corporate governance structure, made it akin to a private utility and created an impossible obligation in the process.

Welton, Phillips, and Luke argue that despite a complex mandate to fund public works through private energy sales, the TVA has “performed reasonably well” in comparison with private utilities by slashing debt, maintaining competitive rates, and generating 53 percent of its power from carbon-free sources. But they also note that the TVA is “not just another utility”—it was created to serve the Tennessee Valley while remaining democratically accountable to residents. Democratic accountability through congressional funding and presidential board appointments was limited by Congress’s amendments, and in recent years, opportunities for local engagement with the TVA have also declined.

Most public utility planning involves extensive stakeholder input. But Welton, Phillips, and Luke describe how the TVA excludes discussion of ratepayer issues, such as reliability and affordability, by accepting public feedback only when it relates to potential environmental impacts. Discretionary public hearings on the TVA’s proposed decisions supplement limited comment opportunities, although greater access to information requires that the public file a request under the federal Freedom of Information Act. And recent proceedings show that the TVA’s nine-member board is willing to delegate important, locally relevant decisions—such as how to phase out coal plants—entirely to its CEO, with no outside input.

Welton, Phillips, and Luke argue that the TVA’s lack of shareholders exacerbates some of the issues that stem from its quasi-corporate structure. Without shareholders, the responsibility to question its decision-making falls on local power companies that operate without “any substantial leverage” from constituents. This lack of leverage stems from the TVA’s regional monopoly—its ability to legally exclude competitors from its transmission lines weakens local power companies and leaves little room for pushback.

Local power companies, which are the TVA’s primary customers, allege that this monopoly also encourages unfair business practices and forces them to forgo cleaner, cheaper energy options.

Welton, Phillips, and Luke cite data showing that the TVA lags behind privately owned utilities in adopting solar power, ignores the economic benefits of clean energy, and performs poorly on energy-efficiency metrics. In addition, nearly all of the 153 local power companies that do business with TVA have signed “never ending” contracts with a 20-year term and a 20-year cancellation notice, which require them to source 95 percent of all of their energy needs from the TVA.

But Welton, Phillips, and Luke contend that with targeted reforms, the TVA could still become a “clean energy laboratory and yardstick” that could influence a “national decarbonization strategy.” They identify the need for a more engaged and politically accountable board with its own dedicated staff, increased transparency in decision-making, and a clear congressional mandate. To transform the TVA into a cutting-edge public energy laboratory, the authors argue that federal funding is necessary to insulate local ratepayers from the economic risks associated with untested technology.",https://www.theregreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Botchev1.21.2026-1348129059.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 11:04:50.434860

Honda 0 Series: An All-New Platform

The Saloon, which debuted as a concept car in 2024, will ride on Honda’s new in-house platform. It’s a vertically integrated architecture that the automaker can have full control over, allowing it to make quick changes to the hardware and patch software issues with over-the-air updates without having to wait on third-party suppliers and developers.

Honda has gone to great lengths to integrate light materials into the cars’ construction, and is betting big on megacasting technology and a new, AI-enabled software suite that can integrate lidar sensors and ultimately offer Level 3 ""eyes-off"" driving capabilities.

Honda's 0 Series platform revolves around three key words: Thin, Light and Wise.

Photo by: Honda

The platform itself can accept battery packs rated at 800 volts, which enables them to charge faster than more mainstream 400-volt alternatives, as we have seen with 800-volt cars like the Kia EV9 and Porsche Macan. Honda has not yet offered official specifications for charging power and charging session times, but it’s aiming for a 15% to 80% top-up in 15 minutes or less.

It’s also worth noting that some 0 Series-based models could get a 400-volt battery system to keep costs down, but that’s unlikely to happen with the flagship Saloon.

Honda said that it would offer two versions of its e-axle motor: one with 241 horsepower (180 kilowatts), and the other with 67 hp (50 kW). In other words, the most powerful version of the 0 Series Saloon would have a total of 482 hp, which is not record-breaking by any stretch of the imagination. But if Honda manages to keep the weight down as it promises, it should be enough for any driving scenario.

Honda 0 Series Saloon: Design

There’s no way around this: the Honda 0 Series Saloon is a head-turner. The four-door EV is low to the ground, thanks to the slim battery pack nestled inside the floor, and looks like something out of a futuristic cartoon.

It’s a razor-shaped sedan that’s bound to get everybody’s attention once it hits the streets, but there’s no guarantee that Honda will stay true to the concept’s looks once the production version rolls off the assembly line.

The original show car did go through some modifications for its second public appearance, with the huge double doors being replaced with a set of more conventional four doors. Inside, everything screams “future,” from the profiled seats to the full-width screen and massive panoramic roof.

Asimo OS, a brand-new operating system that gives a nod to the cool and quirky Honda humanoid robot, powers it all. That too is a big deal. It lays the groundwork for future software-defined vehicles at Honda, future connected cars, autonomous driving, over-the-air updates and more. Like its Japanese rival Toyota, Honda is behind new players like Rivian, Tesla and the Chinese automakers at software, and Asimo OS represents the brand's attempts to hit back.

Honda 0 Series Saloon: Availability

The Honda 0 Series Saloon was initially scheduled to go into production in Ohio this year, as the first model based on the 0 Series platform. However, after several setbacks, including the cancellation of the $7,500 federal tax credit, Honda has decided to postpone the launch of the 0 Series Saloon to 2027.

The company is still moving forward with its 0 Series-based models, but the first models to roll off the assembly line this year will be the Honda 0 Series SUV and Acura RSX crossovers. The Japanese automaker also cut its investment plans for new EVs, going from $69 billion to roughly $48 billion until 2030.

Honda 0 Series Saloon: Price

Although Honda has not publicized a figure yet, the 0 Series Saloon is widely expected to start around $50,000. That doesn't make it a cheap new EV, but it does put it around the average newcar price in the U.S. If it can deliver on these specs, then Honda fans are getting a lot of car for the money.

But given the current softening of EV demand in the U.S., and the American market largely souring on sedans in recent years, the delay to 2027 makes sense—especially if Honda ends up leading with the 0 Series SUV. Either way, the 0 Series platform should be the start of something big from this manufacturer. Let's hope it finds a way to production, and wins hearts and minds with EV fans and newcomers everywhere.

Households will be eligible for thousands of pounds' worth of solar panels and other green tech to lower their energy bills, the government has announced.

The long-awaited Warm Homes Plan promises to provide £15bn to households across the UK over the next five years, as well as introducing new rights for renters.

The government has said it wants to create a ""rooftop revolution"", tripling the number of homes with solar, and lifting one million people out of fuel poverty.

The plan has been strongly welcomed by the energy and finance industry, but the Conservative Party said the scheme will ""saddle households with high ongoing running costs"".

First touted back in 2024, the Warm Homes Plan promised to tackle the ""national emergency"" of rising energy bills, but it has taken two years for the final detail to be published.

The government announced that the plan, published on Wednesday, will focus on funding solar panels, heat pumps and batteries for households across the UK via low-interest loans and grants.

For able-to-pay households even with the grants there are likely to be additional costs of installing the technologies. For a heat pump after the subsidy households pay on average £5,000.

But for an average three bedroom semi-detached home, installing these three technologies, could save £500 annually on energy bills, it estimates.

Although social charity Nesta, and green energy charity, MCS Foundation, have estimated it could be more than £1000.

""A warm home shouldn't be a privilege, it should be a basic guarantee for every family in Britain,"" said Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.

Ed Miliband said the ""cost of living crisis is the biggest issue the country faces"" and that ""upgrading homes is a crucial part of getting bills down"".

Speaking to BBC Breakfast on Wednesday, the Energy Secretary said the move was aimed at ""expanding the choices that people have, so something like a heat pump or a solar panel isn't just in the reach of the wealthiest"".

Measures in the plan include:

Extending the Boiler Upgrade Scheme by a further year to 2029/30, offering £7,500 grants for air source heat pumps

Additional £600m for low-income households to receive funding for the full cost of solar panels and batteries taking the total available to £5bn

Low and zero-interest loans for households irrespective of income

The plan has been strongly welcomed by the energy industry, workers' unions, and the finance sector, who see the long-term financial commitment by the government as crucial for driving private investment into green technologies.

""£15 billion is a substantial commitment, it provides certainty to investors and businesses in the energy market,"" said Dhara Vyas, chief executive of trade body Energy UK.

Camilla Born, CEO of Electrify Britain - a joint campaign group from Octopus and EDF to encourage switching to electric heating - also welcomed the announcement and said it will help cut bills long-term but said ""the bad side is that it is a plan, and we need delivery"".

Some of the schemes are already distributing grants, but for new funding the government has yet to decide how or when households will receive the money. It said that ""further engagement with the finance sector"" is needed this year.

Richard Tice, Reform deputy leader, strongly criticised the plan and said it was: ""A scandalous waste of up to £15bn of taxpayers' cash primarily buying Chinese made solar panels, batteries and heat pumps, that is bad for British industry.""

Two thirds (68%) of the solar panels imported by the UK came from China in 2024, according to HMRC trade data.

Miliband told the BBC that work was underway to ""diversify"" supply chains and that the government was seeking to ""unwind that concentration"" through investments in the UK.

The government has said the scheme would contribute to 180,000 new jobs in the clean heating sector - although some of these are likely to be from retraining existing engineers.

Insulation funding downgraded

The original plan had focused on ramping up installation of insulation in homes which was considered a cost-effective way to reduce heat loss from the UK's leaky housing stock.

But ongoing controversy with a government-funded insulation scheme, ECO, involving botch installations, has led to the scheme not being extended.

Aadil Qureshi, CEO of Heat Geek, which retrains heating engineers to install heat pumps, said it was the right decision and a refocus on green tech was better value for government money.

Unlike insulation, he said heat pumps are a technology in its infancy, and needed government support to catalyse the industry.

""[The plan] allows the industry to commit, to double down - it allows investors, manufacturers to say let's keep investing to get to a certain point where it is equal with the hydrocarbon alternative,"" he said.

By switching households away from oil heaters and gas boilers to electrical heat pumps, powered by renewable energy, the government hopes it will cut the country's planet warming emissions, of which around 18% come from home heating.

Dozens of people have got in contact with BBC Your Voice about their experience installing low-carbon technologies like heat pumps.

One retired couple Chris and Penny Harcourt, living in Stowmarket, got a heat pump two years ago and said it was the ""best update we have done in our house for 20 years"".

But they said that with current electricity prices it was expensive to run and it was only when they got solar panels did they see the costs fall.

You can watch a conversation BBC Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt had with Penny below.

Heat pumps can be three to four times more efficient than gas boilers, but higher electricity prices mean that they can end up being the same or more expensive to run.

But moving households off gas heating has been a priority for the government.

Miliband has previously said the UK's dependence on fossil fuels was its ""Achilles heel"" - after significant fluctuations in prices - and clean power was the only way to lower energy bills.

Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday he said the rise in gas prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine demonstrated why the ""mission for clean power is so important"".

He added: ""We are swapping reliance on imported gas... for homegrown clean power where we control the price"".

But the UK has some of the highest electricity bills in Europe due to upgrades to the network, government taxes and the impact of wholesale prices driven by the gas price.

Claire Coutinho, shadow energy secretary said: ""Unless the Government gets serious about cutting electricity bills now, many of these taxpayer-funded schemes will saddle households with high ongoing running costs every single year.""

And the Liberal Democrats said the plan did not go far enough and it means there is ""no effective fuel poverty programme in place this winter"".

The government hopes that ramping up solar panels will be the answer.

The Warm Homes Plan will encourage households to opt for the trio of low carbon technologies - heat pumps, solar panels and batteries.

This will see more of the electricity demand of heat pumps met by home-generated solar energy rather than from the grid; thus driving down prices.

Not everyone in the green industry is supportive of all the measures. Dale Vince, CEO of energy company Ecotricity, praised the new funding for solar but criticised the high level of subsidy for heat pumps.

Although he said they had a role to play, he said they weren't the national answer for lowering heating costs and greenhouse gas emissions.

""Solar panels give us the biggest bang for buck there is no doubt about that - cheapest to install and most productive in terms of bringing down energy bills. Heat pumps sit at the other end of that scale,"" Vince said.

""We could put solar panels on 10 million rooftops or heat pumps in one million homes.""

Renters' rights reforms

The installation of low carbon tech will only be available to those who are homeowners or in social housing, but the Warm Homes Plan also includes recent announcements to changes in renters' rights.

From 2030, landlords will need to make sure rental properties have a minimum energy efficiency score of EPC C - up from E.

But currently the way that a home is awarded an EPC score is based on estimated running costs rather than energy efficiency, which can mean the score is downgraded following a heat pump installation.

In the plan, the government has said it intends to announce changes to the assessment process later this year.

The industry was also hoping that the Warm Homes Plan would set out updated efficiency requirements for new builds - the Future Homes Standard - but it said these would be published in the next few months.

There had been concern amongst environmentalists that the requirement for solar panels on new homes was to be dropped.

But the plan said: ""We have confirmed that under these standards, new homes will have low-carbon heating, high levels of energy efficiency and solar panels by default.""

Jess Ralston, Energy Analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), said that these decisions have been a long time coming.

""That timelines are being pushed back is likely to be frustrating for those who are still colder and poorer in shoddy rental homes, but the public overwhelmingly back better standards for new builds so should be encouraged to see new requirements on the house builders at long last,"" she said.

Leveraging core equipment for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) combined-cycle and nuclear power, the company is pursuing a strategy that covers both local production and maintenance, and is seen as having entered the heart of the U.S. energy market.

SNT Energy announced on the 21st that it is participating in POWERGEN International 2026, held in San Antonio, State of Texas, for three days from the 20th (local time).

POWERGEN International is the world’s largest power generation exhibition, covering the full spectrum of the power industry, including LNG power generation, nuclear power, and renewable energy. More than 500 companies from over 80 countries took part, including power producers, Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) firms, energy consumers, and equipment manufacturers.

At this exhibition, SNT Energy focused on building a global cooperation network around HRSG, a core facility for LNG combined-cycle power plants, and surface condensers, essential auxiliary equipment for nuclear power generation. The company noted that, as AI data centers proliferate and stable power supply becomes a top priority for many countries, interest has concentrated on high-efficiency, high-reliability power generation equipment.

In 1990, SNT Energy became the first company in Korea to localize high-frequency finned tubes, a key component of HRSG, and has since led the domestic HRSG industry. Building on its own design capabilities and manufacturing technology, the company has strengthened its market competitiveness, and in 2014 it supplied HRSG using the supermodule method for the first time in Korea to the Ichthys LNG Project in Australia, proving its technological prowess on the international stage.

The supermodule method involves fully assembling the entire HRSG at the factory, transporting it, and installing it immediately on site. This approach can significantly reduce both construction time and costs for power plants, which is why it has attracted strong interest from global EPC contractors. It is regarded as a competitive technology in the North American market, where large-scale projects continue to roll out.

SNT Energy is going further by ramping up its local production strategy, using the SNT Energy Louisiana plant established last year as a base. The company plans to expand its business portfolio by not only producing HRSG and surface condensers in the United States, but also linking this with maintenance and after-sales services for existing power plants. Its aim is to move beyond simple exports and establish itself as a true local player in the U.S. market.

A representative of SNT Energy said, ""Through the POWERGEN exhibition, we were able to see firsthand how the power generation industry is responding to the global challenge of power shortages in the AI era,"" adding, ""We will diversify our HRSG market strategy, not only in the United States but also in Japan, Poland, Vietnam, Taiwan, the Middle East, and Central Asia.""

The report, “Data Center Power Play,” projects U.S. electricity needs increasing more than 60% by 2050 in its mid-level data center demand growth scenario.

Stronger ratepayer protections can also prohibit utilities from passing on the costs from data centers through higher prices.
“With surging demand from data centers, the need for plentiful, affordable power has never been higher.","CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (January 21, 2026)—Electricity demand is up and so are household bills across the country. More energy is needed to bolster the U.S. electricity grid as the addition of data centers is widely expected to reshape the energy landscape in coming years. A new report released today by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) highlights the projected consequences of data centers’ growing electricity demand on the U.S. power grid and how decisionmakers can mitigate harmful economic, climate, and health impacts through clean energy development and strong ratepayer protections.

Since future data center demand growth is highly uncertain, largely due to a lack of transparency from utilities and Big Tech companies, UCS modeled multiple demand growth scenarios as well as energy policy scenarios for how that demand is met. The report, “Data Center Power Play,” projects U.S. electricity needs increasing more than 60% by 2050 in its mid-level data center demand growth scenario. In the next five years, data centers were projected to account for nearly half of total electricity demand growth nationally.

Without strong ratepayer protections, such rapid data center growth could put households and businesses at risk of more than $500 billion in cumulative electricity costs nationally by 2035 and nearly $1 trillion by 2050, UCS reports. Absent ambitious climate and clean energy policies, additional fossil fuels burned to power data centers could increase carbon dioxide emissions from power plants by 19% and result in a further $1.6 trillion in climate and health damages over the next decade, growing to $4.5 trillion by 2050.

“Frenzied data center growth with little transparency or guardrails puts the public at risk of massive cost increases,” said Steve Clemmer, director of energy research at UCS and lead report author. “The climate and health benefits and net cost savings of building clean energy to meet future electricity needs are obvious and enormous, but they will not materialize without political support and responsible management of data center load growth.”

Amid the rapidly escalating and costly impacts of fossil fuel-driven climate change and an affordability crisis nationwide, state and federal support for affordable clean energy paired with substantive ratepayer protections is the smartest and quickest way to meet growing electricity demand while protecting people’s health, wallets and the climate.

Key report findings, which assume mid-level demand growth for data centers:

$248 billion in wholesale electricity costs could be avoided by 2050 by restoring federal clean energy tax credits slashed by the Trump administration.

Reducing U.S. power sector CO2 emissions 70% by 2035 and 95% by 2050 would result in more than $1.6 trillion in avoided global climate damages by 2035 and $13 trillion by 2050.

Such power sector decarbonization would also dramatically reduce air pollution from fossil fuels, resulting in $40 billion in avoided health costs nationally by 2035 and $220 billion by 2050.

Decarbonizing the power sector would come with modest increases in wholesale electricity costs, but those costs would be far outweighed by the avoided health and climate damages from reducing fossil fuel use. Stronger ratepayer protections can also prohibit utilities from passing on the costs from data centers through higher prices.

“Data centers are already secretly increasing peoples’ electricity bills,” said Mike Jacobs, senior energy analyst at UCS and author of a recent UCS report on loopholes exploited by data center developers to push their costs onto the public. “While some utility companies and data center developers are intentionally misdirecting scrutiny, others are willfully ignorant about their roles in passing costs onto consumers. In a future with immense data center growth, ratepayers shouldn’t be forced to subsidize Big Tech’s profits at the expense of their own health, climate and pocketbooks. State utility regulators have clear authority to assign costs to those that cause them—it’s time they require data center developers to pay their fair share for energy needs that can dwarf that of entire cities.”

This latest UCS report recommends stronger policies to accelerate the clean energy transition while creating guardrails to protect people and communities from the harms and costs of meeting data centers’ electricity demands. It also calls out the Trump administration’s prioritization of fossil fuel polluters that put people, the environment, and electricity affordability and reliability at risk.

“The Trump administration has repeatedly worked to derail clean energy deployment precisely when we need it most,” said Julie McNamara, associate policy director for the Climate and Energy Program at UCS. “With surging demand from data centers, the need for plentiful, affordable power has never been higher. Yet instead of clearing the path for the fastest, cheapest, cleanest resources to deploy, President Trump is sidelining renewables just to boost the interests of the fossil fuel industry. People will pay the price: in higher bills, in dirtier air, in lost local investments and in worsened climate impacts.”",https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/2021-05/media-release-image.png,N,,2026-01-21 00:58:41.478240

(WOOD) — An investigation of Climax-Scotts High School’s athletic director and head football coach Tyler Langs found examples of player mistreatment, nepotism and a lack of oversight in his roles, the school board says.

In a letter to the school community posted online Monday, the Board of Education said that an investigator interviewed multiple parent and student witnesses, along with “additional individuals” who had been contacted by students or parents.

From Oct. 21 to Nov. 18, the board said that Langs “refused to meet with the investigator to discuss the allegations,” which delayed the investigative process. On Nov. 18, “a targeted set of specific questions — a snapshot of allegations from the report” were sent to Langs, the letter said. He submitted written responses on Nov. 24.

A 40-page investigation report that was released by the district listed several findings, including a point that stated: “In his role as football coach, Tyler Langs has engaged in conduct and speech over a period of at least three years that violates Board Policy 4201, has negatively impacted students, created a toxic environment, and cast aspersion on the District.”

The final of eight points listed said: “The employment of Langs as coach, athletic director, and dean of students gives the appearances of nepotism, including favoritism, to the detriment of the District.”

An additional point listed that in his role as athletic director, “Tyler Langs has not communicated promptly and appropriately with students, parents, or the community.”

The board acknowledged that while playing time caused speculation, none of the issues brought to administration were directly related to it.

On Jan. 16, the district said that the superintendent reached out to Langs “to try to reach an amicable agreement that would maintain his employment with the District as Dean of Students,” while adding that Langs has a contract to remain employed for the 2026-27 school year. The district said it is waiting on his response.",https://www.woodtv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2021/08/1-35.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-21 02:57:36.589836

Following up on the counterproductive decision to pull the plug on the US EV tax credit, Republicans in Congress are now looking to kill the giant US EV charging program that was created by Democrats during the Biden administration.

Yes, this is the program Donald Trump tried to halt in early 2025 before a federal judge determined that was illegal. Projects connected to the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Charging (NEVI) Formula program are all across the country, but Republicans apparently want to bring them to a screeching halt.

“Today, the Senate and House of Representatives released a series of appropriation bills. The draft fiscal year 2026 transportation bill would strip away more than $875 million in funds for EV charging infrastructure, including roughly $500 million already apportioned to all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico to build essential EV charging infrastructure along the nation’s highways under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Charging (NEVI) Formula program,” the Sierra Club shares. “This proposal would sabotage states’ efforts to resume NEVI buildout after the Trump administration unlawfully froze the program in February 2025. Although the U.S. Department of Transportation later lifted the freeze following an adverse court ruling, it continued to impede implementation by imposing unnecessary planning requirements and blocking some states’ access to funds they are legally entitled to use.”

Yes, indeed, it seems the whole Republican Party in Congress and the White House is eager to kill projects that create tens of thousands of jobs and support a transition to clean electric transport. This is despite some of them cutting ribbons to open such projects and claiming responsibilities for ones in their districts. Is it to support the oil and gas industry a little while longer? Is it to get in line behind Donald Trump and his vendetta against cleantech? Who knows, but either way, it’s not good for the country.

“Despite those hurdles, every state is moving forward. All states submitted new implementation plans within just 30 days and have resumed NEVI deployment. Since the freeze was lifted in August, states have obligated $895 million in NEVI funds to new projects,” the Sierra Club adds. “NEVI is delivering real results. In total, 48 states have committed over $1.4 billion to a reliable, nationwide EV charging network that lowers driving costs and expands access to electric vehicles across the country.

“Before the program was frozen, 39 states had issued solicitations, awards, or contracts, with $526 million committed to charging projects. After the freeze was lifted and states regained access to funds following submission of new (and unnecessary) plans, states have been actively advancing projects: Texas is restarting station construction; Alabama just closed a new application round; Indiana is resuming contracting; and Georgia is resuming procurement.”

Apparently, the Republican Party mantra is that we can’t have good things. While China surges far ahead in the EV transition and reaps the rewards, the GOP is intent on slowing us down even further and trying to pretend we’re back in the 20th century. Whatever it takes to prolong the burning of fossil fuels. Why? Because that helps some of their billionaire and millionaire friends.

“Americans shouldn’t be punished for the Trump administration’s attempts to rob states of reliable electric vehicle charging that will benefit our wallets, air, and climate. Following Trump’s unlawful funding freeze, we have seen the NEVI program restart successfully and overwhelming support across states. We urge Members of Congress to leave this funding alone. States must be able to access the full amount they were promised and are relying on as they work to build essential infrastructure in our communities,” Sierra Club Clean Transportation for All Director Katherine García declares. Ah, if only common sense like that would prevail.

One thing is clear: the Republican Party continues to be the party that is anti-progress, anti-cleantech, and anti-blue collar jobs.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/NEVI.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 03:58:49.024440

ODA and DEQ must limit waste disposal to put water quality and public health first.
Monitoring is key to the effectiveness of the Clean Water Act’s permit program, because it provides transparency and allows for accountability.","Late last year, the Oregon Departments of Agriculture and Environmental Quality proposed the long-overdue renewal of a permit that regulates how hundreds of the state’s factory farms manage their mountains of livestock waste. Unfortunately, their draft falls seriously short.

Factory farms are well known for dumping massive amounts of pollution into the environment, which can have disastrous impacts on our communities and our water. In 2022, milk cows on Oregon’s mega-dairies alone produced over 4 billion pounds of manure — or enough to overflow two-and-a-half Olympic swimming pools each day.

Much of this manure is then over-applied to agricultural land, where it can run off into streams and leach into drinking water — contributing significantly to Eastern Oregon’s three-decade-long nitrate contamination crisis. Oregon only updates the permit every five years at most, so it is critical to get this renewal right.

The federal Clean Water Act requires these permits be strong enough to protect Oregon’s waterways. Specifically, Clean Water Act permits require dischargers to restrict their pollution by using the best available control technology and management practices, and to monitor those discharges to show they are not violating the law. But for decades, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Oregon regulators have let factory farms off the hook on both counts — and this permit proposes to continue that trend.

First, the permit does not go far enough to protect Oregon’s waterways. It allows factory farms to spread waste on cropland according to plans that prioritize maximizing crop production, not protecting water quality.

It lacks common-sense provisions like strong liner standards for all waste impoundments and a prohibition on spreading waste on frozen ground, where it is likely to run off into nearby streams. These inadequate plans can allow cancer-causing nitrates to leach into groundwater, contributing to drinking water crises in the Lower Umatilla Basin and elsewhere. ODA and DEQ must limit waste disposal to put water quality and public health first.

Second, the permit leaves Oregonians and regulators in the dark about pollution because it does not require adequate monitoring. Monitoring is key to the effectiveness of the Clean Water Act’s permit program, because it provides transparency and allows for accountability.

Food & Water Watch won an important Ninth Circuit lawsuit in 2021 confirming that monitoring is required for factory farms — just like it is for factories and wastewater treatment plants. But despite this and a similar, recent decision from Washington, ODA and DEQ have doubled down on the permit’s ‘see no evil’ approach.

The factory farm industry has long benefited from special treatment and governments allowing these facilities to pollute our water without meaningful oversight. Now, as the Trump administration seeks to limit the scope of the Clean Water Act and attack all of our bedrock environmental laws, Oregon regulators can go above and beyond and use every authority to protect Oregonians and our waterways. ODA and DEQ’s draft factory farm permit falls short of what the law requires and what Oregonians deserve, but it is not too late for the agencies to make critical improvements.",https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSC00276-2-2048x1440.jpeg,N,,2026-01-20 22:59:38.506793

Why Indiana University wants you to trade your space heater this winter

""With these four options, you're putting the heat directly onto the person instead of the air, so it's a more efficient way for you to get warmer,"" said Jessica Davis, Associate Vice President for Sustainability with Indiana University.

Davis went on to explain how these swaps have saved energy around Indiana University's campuses.

""If you happen to be in a location that's near the building's thermostat, the building may start reading that your space is hotter than it truly is,"" Davis continued. ""You're kind of creating an artificial environment; the building may actually start cooling down your space.""

Stacy Lozer is the Director of Career Services for the O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs.

Lozer recently took advantage of the trade-in program.

""We had this really unique and amazing opportunity to take those old space heaters that eat up a lot of energy, that quite often smell and aren't as effective, and trade them in for a nice warm fuzzy blanket,"" Lozer said, while covering up with her new heated blanket. ""In my office, I have a lot of windows. It's a great way to stay warm and just not waste kind of that space heater air that's just circulating around.""

The 96 space heaters that have been traded in (including Lozer's) will save energy and money for the university.

""About 48,000 kilowatt hours of energy a year, and that's about $12,000 worth of financial savings,"" Davis stated.

""If you make little changes, it makes a huge difference,"" said Lozer.

The Office of Sustainability works with Circle City Mutual Aid to find new off-campus homes for the space heaters traded in during this initiative.

While the exchange program is only offered to those at IU, Davis hopes the public will consider switching their own space heaters for greener alternatives, similar to the ones offered in the campus program.

""The same learnings here at IU can apply at home as well,"" Davis said.

If a space heater makes the most sense to use to keep your space warm, make sure you use it safely.

""Only use space heaters when you're in the room,"" says Tim Griffin with the Carmel Fire Department. ""Don't leave the house. Don't leave it plugged in, and if you are going to have it plugged in, have it plugged directly to the wall. Don't use an extension cord.""

Griffin went on to say that extension cords can use too much power with a space heater, and cause it to overheat.

""Make sure that it's three feet away from anything,"" Griffin continued.

Keeping the space heater in an open area on top of stable ground could prevent you, your pets, and your kids from knocking the space heater over, which could start a fire.

""I know we're talking about the extreme temperatures, but if something does happen because of the extreme cold, those working smoke detectors are going to make a difference in early detection, so we can get there and stop that fire before it spreads,"" Griffin said.

What else would Griffin avoid to keep warm?

""Leaving your stove on,"" Griffin said. ""Having it open like that, if you have any small children, again, pets, animals that could burn themselves, you know, it's never a good idea to try to heat the house with the stove.""

""If you've got a blanket or clothes, shove them in the base of your door, shove them around your window,"" Davis recommended. ""Hopefully, we just try to make it through this, these couple of weeks that are really cold.""

The engine whir reminds us of family BBQs, swinging on a Hills Hoist, and sinking back a cold one. But that familiar sound also means trips to the servo, buying two-stroke oil, cleaning and sharpening, and changing the air filter.

The tide of electrification has hit the gardening equipment department. Bunnings now has a full aisle dedicated to electric alternatives from lawnmowers to hedge trimmers, brush cutters to blowers. Whether it’s time to upgrade or curiosity has you perusing, we’ll take a look at whether the investment in electric gardening equipment is worth it.

Point of difference: Comparing petrol and electric gardening equipment

Most people switch for one of three reasons: less hassle, less noise, and fewer fumes. Petrol still wins for raw grunt and endless runtime. Battery wins for convenience, cleaner storage, and easy starting.

Here’s the practical comparison that matters in a normal Aussie backyard. Note that we have compared petrol and electric lawnmowers below, but the same applies to every garden power tool with electric alternatives.

Starting and day-to-day ease

Electric mowers start with a button and go. Petrol mowers can demand priming, pulling, and occasional colourful language. If you mow often, that convenience adds up fast.

Noise and neighbour friendliness

Battery mowers generally run quieter than petrol options. That matters if you mow early, live on a small block, or just like staying on speaking terms with the neighbours.

Maintenance and ongoing fuss

Petrol mowers need ongoing care, like filters, plugs, fuel, oil mixing for two-strokes, and off-season fuel management. Battery mowers skip most of that, because they have fewer moving parts. You still sharpen blades and keep the deck clean, but the routine feels lighter.

Running costs

With petrol, you pay every mow. With battery, you mostly pay upfront, then charge at home. If you already own batteries and chargers in a tool platform, the upgrade can be cheaper than you think.

Power and performance

For small to medium lawns, modern battery mowers do the job well. For thick kikuyu, long wet growth, or big blocks, petrol can still be the path of least resistance. Some brands also say battery will not replace petrol for every heavy duty use case, at least not yet.

What you will actually pay in Australia

At Bunnings, cordless mower kits can sit around the mid hundreds, and climb higher for self propelled, wider decks, or premium brands. Petrol mowers also span a wide range, from budget to “this will outlive me” territory.

The hidden cost is the ecosystem. If you buy into a battery platform, you can run a trimmer, blower, hedger, and chainsaw off the same batteries. That can make the numbers stack up, especially if your shed currently holds three half-working petrol tools.

Apples for apples, the prices can be quite even. A petrol 18-inch Victa will set you back about $409 to $509. A battery-powered 18-inch Victa kit with 2 batteries is about $415.

You will need to factor in whether you require additional batteries. That’s the kicker, as batteries can cost a few hundred dollars on their own.

The electrification bonus: One battery, many tools

Battery platforms are the quiet achievers here. If you already own compatible batteries, “skin only” tools can be great value. If you do not, starter kits cost more, but they set you up for the rest of your garden gear.

A simple approach works best: pick one platform you can stick with. Then add tools as your petrol gear retires.

Emissions and air quality: The bit we do not smell until we do

Petrol mowers emit exhaust at ground level, right where you stand. Australian research has measured emissions from in-use lawn mowers, with attention on pollutants like hydrocarbons from small engines.

Electric mowers shift emissions to the electricity source instead of the backyard. Several life cycle studies have compared petrol and electric mowers, and generally find petrol models have higher emissions during use, with battery manufacturing impacts sitting on the other side of the ledger.

If your home runs on solar, your mower can too. That is about as neat as it gets.

Robot lawnmowers: Are they worth it?

Many of us enjoy the set-and-forget ease of robovacs, but robot lawnmowers are the next “big thing”. They operate almost exactly the same as your Roomba, but do they actually do the job?

The short answer is yes – but they have specific use cases.

If you have a small backyard with minimal obstacles, then it might be the perfect fit. They mow often enough that the grass never grows long enough to be an issue for it. You might find that your edges are lacking, but the trade-off for the convenience may be worth it.

When upgrading makes sense

Upgrading usually makes sense if you tick a few of these boxes:

Your lawn is small to medium, and you mow regularly.

You want less maintenance, less storage hassle, and easier starts.

You already own batteries in a tool platform.

You dislike fumes, noise, or keeping fuel around the house.

When petrol still earns its keep

You might stick with petrol, or delay the switch, if:

You mow a large block, or you need a long runtime without swapping batteries.

Your lawn grows thick and fast, and you often mow it long or wet.

You need maximum cutting power for tough conditions, every time.

A simple decision checklist

If you want a quick call, use this:

Under 300 square metres and mowed often: Battery will likely feel like an upgrade.

Already on a battery platform: Battery almost always wins on convenience and value.

Big block, thick grass, infrequent mowing: Petrol may stay the safer bet.

Battery-powered gardening tools have earned their place

For most suburban Aussie yards, a modern battery mower is a genuine quality of life upgrade. You ditch fuel runs, reduce maintenance, and keep the peace with the neighbours. Petrol still has a place for bigger, tougher jobs, but for the average weekend mow, battery gear has well and truly arrived.",https://www.energymatters.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Energy-Matters-Electrifying-Australia.png,N,,2026-01-20 21:58:48.505484

Business groups believe a proposed Senate bill would lower their energy costs through the basic principle of supply and demand.
House Utilities, Energy and Telecommunications Committee Chair Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, said he has no plans to schedule Ledbetter’s bill for a hearing.
“‘Should we expand in Indiana?’ ‘What’s the cost of electricity in Indiana?’” Becker said at the event.
What portion of those costs are they going to be responsible for moving forward?” Indiana Energy Association President McGrath agreed, saying energy-choice policies create volatility.","For decades, Indiana’s energy landscape has operated under a vertically integrated system with state-regulated utilities generating and distributing electricity to customers in their assigned regions.

But two bills from Republican lawmakers could change that dynamic by allowing businesses, and potentially individual households, to get their electricity from a provider other than their local utility company.

Consumer control over buying or producing power—sometimes called energy choice or energy deregulation—is not new, but it’s not been widely discussed in Indiana so far.

And it’s not clear whether it will be this year, either. Neither bill has been scheduled for a hearing in what is expected to be an unusually short session. But advocates of the legislation aren’t likely to give up, even if the bills don’t move over the next six weeks or so.

Business groups believe a proposed Senate bill would lower their energy costs through the basic principle of supply and demand. If businesses have more options for buying energy, competition will lower prices, they say.

And large users, such as advanced manufacturers and data centers, say if they’re able to bypass the state-regulated—or incumbent—utility in their assigned service area to buy power, that utility won’t need to invest in big infrastructure builds, keeping prices lower for everyone else.

Abby Foster is vice president for policy and advocacy for the Retail Energy Advancement League, or REAL, which represents a collection of energy companies that work in natural gas, nuclear and renewables. She said the Northern Indiana Public Service Co. has allowed large users to shop for their own power in some cases, but codifying such agreements is the next step.

“This is already happening in Indiana,” Foster said. “But our members would like more certainty than what the regulatory process can offer. So in order for this to truly be enough certainty for them to come and invest and build and serve these customers, it really needs to be in statute.”

The Indiana Energy Association, which represents the state’s investor-owned utilities, has a different take. IEA President Danielle McGrath said energy-choice policies can lead to unpredictability for companies and utilities alike.

“It definitely is creating more risk and uncertainty when we really need a period of stability,” McGrath said.

Wholesale energy

Language outlining energy-choice policy sits in Senate Bill 272 and House Bill 1276, carried by Sen. Stacey Donato, R-Logansport, and Rep. Cindy Ledbetter, R-Newburgh, respectively.

Donato’s bill would allow businesses that use more than 1 megawatt of power a year to buy energy from a “competitive electricity supplier,” beginning in July 2027. The utility managing that service area would have to distribute the purchased electricity through its transmission lines with no added fees.

The bill would cap the percentage of third-party energy sales allowed within an incumbent utility’s territory. It would set an initial cap of 20% of the utility’s sales from the prior year, excluding any sales for customers using more than 75 megawatts, but allow the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission to amend the cap.

The proposed legislation mirrors an energy-choice law Michigan passed in 2008 where, according to Foster, demand for wholesale energy purchases reached the state’s 10% cap within two years.

Data from the Michigan Public Services Commission shows 5,514 customers took part in the energy-choice program in 2024, and all of Michigan’s regulated utilities were at or near their 10% cap for alternative electric sales that year.

“If Michigan’s any story of what we can expect, customers are going to want to avail themselves of this,” Foster said. “And for every megawatt that’s procured from a third party, that’s one less megawatt that the utility, who gets to charge all ratepayers, has to build.”

If energy demand for outside power supplies exceeds the state’s cap, a queue system would kick in, and third-party electricity suppliers would have to register with the IURC.

Legislation from Ledbetter goes even further, allowing residential customers to also seek electric service on the open market.

Ledbetter’s House Bill 1276 would require investor-owned utilities to decouple their costs of generation from the costs of distributing electricity and charge customers only for what they use. Customers who don’t want to shop around would stay with their default utility.

Ledbetter said the intent of her bill is to drive down costs with a free-market approach.

“With us shutting down coal and converting everything to natural gas and going to renewables, the consumer has to pay for those costs, and those costs are getting high,” she said. “So if we go to free-market electricity, much like with cellphones, we will see those costs eventually come down.”

Both bills have been sent to their respective utility committees. Senate Utility Chair Eric Koch, R-Bedford, wouldn’t tell IBJ what bills will be scheduled yet this session. House Utilities, Energy and Telecommunications Committee Chair Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, said he has no plans to schedule Ledbetter’s bill for a hearing.

New energy paradigm

Anne Becker, a director at Indianapolis-based law firm Lewis Kappes, said during the IBJ’s Future of Energy Summit on Nov. 21 that businesses she works with are constantly thinking about their energy costs.

“‘Should we expand in Indiana?’ ‘What’s the cost of electricity in Indiana?’” Becker said at the event. “It’s a huge component to their costs. ‘Can we put something behind the meter on our property?’ All this stuff goes into the equation.”

Data from the Indiana Office of Energy Development shows Indiana’s electricity costs rose higher than the national average from 2002-2016 but below the national average from 2017-2023. A Lawrence Berkeley study published in December found Indiana’s electricity prices decreased from 2019 through 2024 when inflation is not considered.

But cost isn’t the only factor. Many large ratepayers are looking for “bespoke” energy plans that are diversified for resiliency or to meet environmental goals.

Foster, the vice president of REAL, said the proposed new model is a win for ratepayers large and small. With utilities building power plants to serve the demand of large manufacturers and data centers, the cost of that infrastructure investment can be passed on to consumers. But if those large users were responsible for their own power needs, utilities—and remaining ratepayers—would be off the hook, Foster said.

Under the current structure, she said, “If these data centers at the end of their power-purchase agreements with the utilities no longer need this generation, or say, new technology comes out that makes data centers super-efficient, and they don’t need the amount of capacity, the ratepayers in Indiana are the ones that pick up that bill.”

Foster and Becker pointed to NIPSCO, which created the subsidiary GenCo last year to facilitate large-load customers in its service area exploring their own energy options.

Kristina Wheeler, a partner at business law firm Bose McKinney & Evans, said that arrangement helped one of the biggest companies in Indiana.

“Kudos to NIPSCO for allowing their customers above 10 megawatts to go to the market for power. It kept our client, U.S. Steel, operating in Gary, Indiana,” Wheeler said at the IBJ Future of Energy Summit. “It was beneficial to a lot of other major users and existing businesses in northern Indiana.”

A spokeswoman for NIPSCO declined to comment for this story.

Not that simple

But Indiana’s regulated utilities and consumer advocacy groups say deregulation legislation will raise rates for most customers.

Citizens Action Coalition Executive Director Kerwin Olson said it takes years to plan and hundreds of millions of dollars for utilities to build their energy grid to serve their territories, meaning individual businesses packing up and leaving the grid is “just not as simple as people want it to be.”

Olson said that if large users don’t have to pay for electricity through their area utility, the cost of a power plant that was built 15 years ago to serve that very customer could then be passed along to everyone else.

“You build these massive systems to serve all of your customers, and then with 30 days’ notice, a huge customer can just leave that system and not pay anything,” Olson said of the proposed legislation. “They’re still using the grid. They’re still connected to the system. What portion of those costs are they going to be responsible for moving forward?”

Indiana Energy Association President McGrath agreed, saying energy-choice policies create volatility. Because regulated utilities are required by law to serve customers in their territories, she said, businesses buying energy on the wholesale market but still connected to the existing grid would still need to be served in an emergency.

“If something does go wrong, those businesses are still going to count on us to meet their needs, but that comes at a cost,” McGrath said. “If you don’t have the appropriate parameters in place and that customer comes to us, but there isn’t sufficient capacity, what do they do? What do we do?”

McGrath said Illinois and Ohio have both adopted energy-choice programs for residential ratepayers, but prices haven’t come down. She cited a study conducted by Ohio State University in 2024 that found 72% of offers for electricity on the residential retail market were more expensive than if the household had stuck with their default utility.

In Illinois, she said, the state’s Office of Attorney General has filed a string of lawsuits against retailer energy providers that the state says have used deceptive marketing practices to sign people up for their more expensive rates.

In 2021, when Beijing finally pledged to stop building and financing new coal power plants overseas, Western governments and climate advocates rejoiced. John Kerry, US climate envoy at the time, said he was “absolutely delighted to hear” of the decision.

It is “a key topic of my discussions during my visit to China”, Alok Sharma, a member of the British House of Lords, wrote on social media, suggesting it was a result of pressure from the West.

But now, from Chile to Spain to Portugal, country after country is grappling with major blackouts. A troubling question is emerging: has this major climate victory over China backfired?

Because while China agreed to halt coal power exports under intense international pressure, at home it took the opposite approach.

Far from abandoning coal, China doubled down on advanced, ultra-efficient coal units that acted as grid stabilisers, backing up its massive expansion of wind and solar power.

In effect, China developed a dual strategy: export pure green energy to the world while keeping the stabilising backup systems and tech largely for itself.

Today, as renewable-heavy grids in Europe and Latin America face strain, and extreme weather exposes the vulnerabilities of intermittent power sources, the irony is hard to ignore: while nations are embracing that green future, they are confronting power failures that may have been tempered with the very technologies that they asked China not to export.

Commitments that they largely would not have needed if they had access to global supply chains.","Support CleanTechnica's work through a Substack subscription or on Stripe.

At CES, I didn’t get the chance to attend as many panels and discussions as I had hoped. When I made it, I was often pulled away partway through by another commitment. However, I had the chance to attend “Competing in a Trade-Disrupted World,” moderated by Ed Brzytwa, Vice President of International Trade for CTA, which produces CES. The panel included diverse perspectives, including Dan Anthony, who runs the website WePayTheTariffs.com, and Robin Liss, CEO of Suvie, who explained her challenges as a SMB. As clean technology has been hardest hit due to a combination of politically connected legacy interests, trade was already on my mind. Listening to the conversations, reading the stories and seeing the diverse inputs into the technology ecosystem, I gained a new appreciation for how it is not just one sector or the consumer paying the price for protectionism. We all pay.

People Pay In Different Ways

Consumers paying the price should be obvious. Increasing taxes and blocking competition distorts markets. In most cases, the hours of work wasted to earn money to overpay for products are more than the net hours of work preserved at uncompetitive companies. If we blocked TVs when Zenith went bankrupt to prop them up in the 90s, we might still be looking at months of pay for a product that underperforms what people can now buy with a few hours of pay.

But small businesses also pay in many ways. Retailers faced with increased costs on goods, often beyond what their customers are willing or able to spend, clearly pay price for protectionism. Sales go down while margins squeeze, making viability a challenge.

Entrepreneurial innovators and manufacturers also suffer. We simply do not have the industrial capability to do everything on our own, and small companies do not have the capital to reinvent the wheel. When I spoke to several US-based entrepeneurs about it, they mentioned that they can use a Chinese company to produce a prototype part and have it in weeks, instead of months. They mentioned that they could have the product manufactured and in market faster than they could build the prototype in the US. Even if they could build it here, competitors would be generations ahead of them by the time it hits the market. And then, when it gets to market, the cost is often too high, especially if they are cut off from imported components and materials.

China has massive industrial supply chains and a well-developed technology ecosystem. They also add the equivalent of the US engineering workforce to their workforce roughly every year. Many of these engineers are focused on the essential but less exciting parts of the project, like DFM and injection mold tooling, rather than focusing on creating the next attention-grabbing breakthrough. They have the talent to do much of the “99% perspiration” that turns the “1% inspiration” into a viable product. That is undoubtedly one of their greatest advantages. Other countries seeking to compete with China need to offer their own advantages. We simply do not have the population or education system needed to match global capabilities internally. Those global capabilities can be utilized to help our companies, if we let it happen. When we stand in the way of it happening, we pay the price.

In addition, if you have ever taken apart an electronic product, you will see things like capacitors from Japan, memory chips from Arizona, processors from Taiwan, batteries from China, displays from Korea… no one country makes everything, regardless of where final assembly and packaging takes place. The South Hall at CES especially was filled with these types of manufacturers and suppliers. No one country is going to be good at everything, and the more options that are available, the better cost/performance of the product. Isolating any country weakens the entire technology ecosystem. The overall collaboration is less productive. Cutting off the supply of individual components, software, or technologies makes creating innovative products more difficult. This is especially the case for startups and small businesses that can’t pay for custom-made chips or to build their own factories. They can’t afford to order a spool of custom-alloyed stainless steel. They have to use largely off-the-shelf parts and materials, and we just made that shelf smaller and more expensive.

Even large companies with the capital to build factories to supply their operations have to pay the price. Some may look at the tens of billions of dollars that Detroit is writing off on scaled back EV plans and think it is just about EVs. But much of those write-downs and penalties are for supply commitments and capacity being built that they do not need now. Commitments that they largely would not have needed if they had access to global supply chains. That added cost, and now cancellation cost, sets EV adoption back. With access to global supply chains, EV adoption could have accelerated, and localization of the heavy, highly automated battery production would happen with the market scale that comes from increased adoption. Now, with that market scale postponed and isolation from global markets, US EV adoption is set back further.

We also pay the price for isolation from their consumers. In the US, the average new car buyer is in their 50s, over two decades older than the average new car buyer in China. While China may be aging and shrinking overall, their wealth is much younger and growing faster, largely driven by technology. The gap is expanded due to our education system, the debt loads our education system puts on young people, and our elevated prices. Young people in tech-focused careers who grew up with smartphones have different perspectives and expectations on technology than their parents. The early adopter market is much larger. The adoption curve is different. As such, some Chinese companies are moving to smartphone-like technology iteration, accelerating progress. In many ways, the consumer is just as important to technology adoption as the producer.

Even Legacy Pays Eventually

In the end, legacy industry also pays the price. Like the overprotective parent coddling a whiney child, our government has enabled underperformers. Initially, it may look like they are being protected from competition. But they also are not growing, evolving, gaining perspective, or making connections. As that kid becomes an adult still living with their parents, surrounded by participation trophies in a state of persistent dependency, were they really being helped?

As I mentioned to Tom and Riz on Ludicrous Feed, US legacy automakers have already lost on EVs in an “us versus them” adversarial contest. But there is hope in collaboration. Many people still have love for the brands. However, the longer we isolate our country from global competition and global collaboration, the farther behind we will fall. And the less relevant the US part of the collaboration will become.

Eventually, the walls politicians put up around their people and industry will come down. When they do, the artificially propped up and isolated industries tend to fall with them. Trabant no longer makes cars. Its fellow Soviet Bloc Dacia and Skoda brands still exist through the involvement of Western automakers, but they now have little to do with their closed market predecessors.

Innovation Is A Team Sport

There are no completely new ideas. All ideas build on other ideas. No single country has a monopoly. It makes no sense to go back to prehistoric understandings of the world in order to rediscover fire and reinvent the wheel over and over again. The larger the pool of ideas people get exposed to, the better the ideas they can come up with.

Some will say that others are just copying, but that is a cop-out. Otto, Diesel, Volta, Faraday, Newton… were not American. But it would be dishonest to say that a modern automobile is just copying them. People also said Harry A. Miller was just copying European engines when his company developed what would become the most successful racing engine in American history. But that misconstrues the progress of ideas building on other ideas and the hard work needed to realize the potential of those ideas.

It is easy to put one person on a pedestal as the key to innovation in the technology sector. It makes a good story. But the reality is that it takes a wide range of people with different capabilities and talents to make a technology succeed. The larger the potential talent and supply pool, the better.

Segregating teams by skin color didn’t make baseball better. Segregating technology teams by lines on a map doesn’t make those teams better either.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PXL_20260109_005851221.MP1_-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 22:59:46.757298

Today's Big Stories

1. Trump has promised cheaper oil. Texas’ economy could pay a price

After COVID-19 tanked oil prices, Texas’ oil and gas industry rebounded. By 2024, operators were drilling record amounts of oil. Each barrel sold for at least $70, bringing profits and momentum that enriched the state’s coffers, school districts and local government budgets with billions in tax revenue.

Now, President Donald Trump’s pledge to bring oil prices down to $50 a barrel could decimate that momentum, making trouble — even if temporarily — for the Lone Star State.

2. TxDOT rejects bid to keep rainbow, Black Lives Matter crosswalks in Dallas

Dallas is the latest Texas city to be denied an exemption request to keep pavement markings during the state’s recent push to ban politically-charged messaging from streets.

According to a report from the Dallas Morning News, the request was for 30 markings, including rainbow LBGTQ+ Pride, Black Lives Matter and other custom designs. This comes after Gov. Greg Abbott in October banned cities from displaying street markings that convey “social, political or ideological messages” or risk losing state funding.

3. Houston-based Francesca's reportedly closing all stores nationwide

Francesca’s, an apparel boutique chain that was founded in Houston, is planning to close all of its stores across the country, according to reports.

According to Women’s Wear Daily, the shopping mall chain began liquidating its inventory on Friday, a customer service representative told the outlet.

The “new world disorder” is reshaping global priorities, and renewable energy is at the heart of this transformation.","Global stability is fracturing. Economic realignments, geopolitical rivalries, and technological disruption are reshaping the international order. North America—long a pillar of global leadership—now faces pressures to make sustainable, strategic decisions. The clean energy transition is not just environmental—it’s geopolitical, economic, and technological.

Traditional energy markets have long underpinned global stability, but geopolitical shocks—from Middle East tensions to Europe’s reliance on Russian gas—underscore the need for energy resilience. The Trump administration has successfully issued swathes of executive orders and federal directives to support domestication of natural resource supply chains, while limiting reliance and relations with international markets.

Key legislative and executive restrictions that impact renewable energy:

In July 2025, Trump signed an executive order and “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” that terminated clean electricity production and investment tax credits for wind and solar projects, and directed federal agencies to eliminate preferential treatment for renewables compared to traditional energy sources

The Treasury Department was instructed to implement stricter eligibility rules for tax credits, requiring projects to show significant physical construction progress and limiting safe harbor provisions, making it much harder for developers to qualify

Enhanced Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) rules target supply chains connected to China, further complicating access to subsidies for solar and wind developers reliant on imported technologies

Tariffs have promoted increased domestic oil, gas, coal, and nuclear production, and onshoring of manufacturing, merging domestic and foreign policy

The headlines are overwhelming the wider narrative. Although incentives and support for clean energy technologies have been repealed, renewable energy offers North America a pathway to resilience.

“

Despite shifting geopolitical dynamics, renewable energy projects in North America remain active and robust in the near term. Although the long-term outlook is less certain, the current ecosystem—including insurance—continues to experience strong activity”

Andrew Rubin | Director, Tax Insurance Practice, Alternative Asset Insurance Solutions

How the One Big Beautiful Bill could accelerate pockets of growth for clean technologies

Pre- and post-the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) predictions for renewable generation index drops from 190 to 140 by 2035 . The speed of growth for renewable energy generation is limited under new regulations, but opportunities endure. “Despite shifting geopolitical dynamics, renewable energy projects in North America remain active and robust in the near term. Although the long-term outlook is less certain, the current ecosystem—including insurance—continues to experience strong activity”, Andrew Rubin, Director, Tax Insurance Practice, Alternative Asset Insurance Solutions.

Despite the loss of tax credits to solar and wind projects which signal that renewable energy in the U.S. is in a consolidation period, tax credits remain available to emerging renewable technologies.

“Tax credits are available for renewable natural gas, where an uptick in investment is making the technology a competitive opportunity for companies keen to diversify their energy mix”, Alex Forand, North America Renewable Energy Leader, Natural Resources. For business leaders, these opportunities are driving a rethink of procurement strategies and capital allocation. “Previously, the security of government backing gave companies opportunities to invest in clean technologies, but now, profitability is at the top of the agenda and investors and stakeholders are more cautious to spend capital on unknown technologies”, Andreea Merewitz, Managing Director, Resilience Practice, BDO.

Capital-heavy developers will have opportunities to acquire assets—such as wind and solar—that are now less profitable under the OBBBA. Although cutting tax credits could signal less room for innovation, renewable energy remains a way to anchor a strategic advantage. There’s scope for innovation, but the goal posts have moved. Business leaders will need to rethink and realign their strategies.

“As North America reduces reliance on imported oil and gas, renewable infrastructure becomes a strategic asset, particularly as the investment in data centers continues to increase exponentially. Investment in in grids and power will be non-negotiable, it’s inevitable”, Daisy McAndrew, freelance geopolitical and economic radio and TV presenter, reporter and writer.

The accelerator for electrification in North America: Data centers

Renewable energy is a technology race. Advances in battery storage and smart grids will define the next era of economic leadership. While China maintains its position as the renewable manufacturing major, adding over 212 GW of new solar and 51 GW of new wind capacity while the U.S. will add less than 100 GW combined, all while the U.S. is jostling to be the world leader in data centers.

By the numbers: The data center boom in the U.S.

Projections show the U.S. will continue to expand its capacity and market share, with electricity consumption by U.S. data centers set to more than double by 2030. The continued growth of data centers will need powering, suggesting the renewable energy agenda isn’t entirely off the cards.

The future of data centers: Beware the brain drain

The Trump administration’s approach to immigration could reduce the pool of workers available to support the ongoing growth of data centers. “AI isn’t just the tail that’s wagging the dog, it’s the dog. Technology companies are the wealth of the American economy. While data centers are primarily at risk of falling down the brain drain, natural resources companies will need to prepare for escalating demand.

Business leaders will need to bolster their workforce to prepare for the uptick in power demand. Will the tech center burst its bubble? Certainly, we’re poised for corrective measures, but how domestic and foreign policy will adapt, is something to watch”, Daisy McAndrew.

Looking ahead: Building certainty in the new world disorder

Political polarization complicates climate policy, but societal pressure for sustainability is intensifying. The “new world disorder” is reshaping global priorities, and renewable energy is at the heart of this transformation. For North American businesses, the green transition is not off the table. There are pockets of opportunity for emerging renewable technologies, particularly for power generation to support the growth of data centers. While geopolitical headwinds continue to blow, building resilience will be critical to withstand political and economic volatility. Risk management is at the core.

“Over the long term, tax insurance and renewable energy in the U.S. remain interconnected and resilient. Regulatory changes, statutory adjustments, and industry headwinds may pose challenges, but they are unlikely to halt investment, with tax insurance continuing to play a vital role” Andrew Rubin, Director, Tax Insurance Practice, Alternative Asset Insurance Solutions. Tax insurance covers losses from disallowed credits, penalties, interest, and legal costs, giving investors and developers confidence that expected tax benefits will materialize. By reducing counterparty risk and providing certainty, tax insurance has a role in facilitating project financing and supporting cash flow for renewable energy projects.

But more broadly, tax insurance can support the growing renewable energy sector through intricate partnership structures and evolving tax laws—a critical asset in risk managers’ toolkits in North America for the foreseeable future.

That reality makes one thing clear: grid planning matters more than ever.

Over the past year, state regulators have taken a series of important actions to modernize how the state’s large electric utilities forecast demand and plans to upgrade the grid. Taken together, these decisions move California away from reactive, worst-case planning and toward a smarter, more flexible approach that can support rapid electrification while protecting customers’ bills.

The work is not finished. But the direction is right – and now it is incumbent on the regulators and electric utilities to carry it through.

California is getting grid planning right – now we actually need to build it Share on X

Planning for electric demand that is actually coming

For years, the electric utilities have systematically understated future electricity demand and corresponding grid upgrade needs. That was not because electrification was not happening – it was because the antiquated rules only allowed utilities to plan for loads that were already firmly in hand. Everything else, including electrification projects still under development, was largely invisible to planners.

In December 2025, state regulators addressed this problem by allowing utilities to include pending electric demand in their forecasts – including customer electrification plans that are still being developed and credible, third-party electrification studies. The electric utilities can now plan for electric demand when supported by real-world data. This includes EV charging, building electrification, and other loads connecting to the distribution grid, rather than data centers and other large customers that connect to the higher-voltage transmission system.

In their action, regulators introduced a critical new concept: electrification hot spots. In areas in California where electrification of our buildings and transportation is clearly emerging, the electric utilities now have more discretion to proactively incorporate diverse data sources into their forecasts. That means fewer surprises, fewer last-minute upgrades, and better alignment between grid investments and customer needs. In effect, the regulators are directing the state’s electric utilities to plan for the future that is actually being built.

Moving beyond a single guess about the future

Just as important, California regulators are pushing the electric utilities to confront uncertainty head-on by directing them to adopt scenario-based load forecasting. Rather than anchoring grid plans to a single “best guess,” utilities must now evaluate at least three futures: low, mid and high load growth scenarios.

The electric utilities will pair this scenario planning with innovative decision-tree framework that guides how they should act under different outcomes – when to invest early, when to wait, and how to manage the uncertainty of their load forecasts. For example, California utilities plan for both high and low demand futures, so they can invest early when risks are high and hold back when demand may not actually happen.

This approach reflects a basic reality: overbuilding the grid is expensive but underbuilding it can be even more costly – missing opportunities to connect clean energy and locking in fossil dependence, emissions and reliability risks. Scenario planning, especially when combined with the new pending-loads framework, gives electric utilities a more disciplined way to strike that balance.

Integrating grid work to save money

Forecasting improvements alone are not enough. Execution matters just as much. Last month, the utilities filed a Commission-required proposal describing how they will better integrate capacity-driven grid upgrades with other distribution work. The concept is straightforward but powerful: when utilities are already replacing aging equipment or addressing safety needs, they should evaluate whether modestly upsizing that equipment today can avoid a second, more expensive project tomorrow.

For example, replacing a transformer at the end of its useful life without considering future load growth almost guarantees that ratepayers will pay twice – once now, and again when electrification demand materializes. This kind of integrated planning can reduce duplicative construction, lower costs and make better use of limited utility workforce resources. It also aligns closely with EDF-commissioned research from Black & Veatch showing that proactive grid planning is often the most cost-effective option.

While Environmental Defense Fund is not satisfied with the utilities’ initial proposal – and is actively engaging at the Commission to improve it – the CPUC’s underlying directive is well designed and worth supporting.

Electrification can lower bills if utilities plan for flexibility

In October 2025, Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric released draft studies examining how electrification will affect the electric grid – and how much electric demand flexibility can change the outcome. While this work will continue into 2026, the early results are striking.

PG&E’s analysis finds that while enabling electrification will require tens of billions of dollars in distribution investments through 2040, that same electrification could also save customers up to 25% by putting downward pressure on electric rates by improving system utilization. The takeaway is clear: electrification does not have to result in runaway costs to the customer’s electric bill.

When electric utilities actively plan for flexible demand – including managed EV charging, building electrification paired with demand response, and distributed energy resources – the grid can be used more efficiently, spreading the fixed costs of grid investments over more kilowatt-hours, and lowering costs for all ratepayers.

Turning planning into practice

None of these reforms will matter if they remain on paper. California’s regulators have laid out a thoughtful, forward-looking framework for electric demand forecasting and grid planning – one that supports electrification, improves affordability, and manages uncertainty instead of ignoring it. Now the hard(er) work begins.

The electric utilities must implement these tools rigorously and transparently.",https://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/wp-content/blogs.dir/38/files//CA-blog.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 00:58:45.618969

The plants would supply electricity to these growing industrial areas, without requiring miles of new transmission lines to deliver the power.

PUD Commissioners received the update at their first workshop of the year.

PUD Staff is focusing on generation technologies that could eventually be converted from natural gas, which produces a relatively small amount of carbon, to a non-carbon-generating fuel, such as hydrogen, to comply with state’s 2045 deadline to remove carbon-producing fuels from the state’s energy supply.

Additional analysis is underway to determine if an investment in an out-of-state natural gas plant, in a state that doesn’t have emissions-free policies, could supply power at a lower cost to Grant PUD customers.

In addition to natural gas generation, staff continues to research investments in battery energy storage systems, geothermal and small modular nuclear reactors to supplement Grant PUD’s portfolio of hydropower, solar and wind energy.

Work also continues to integrate the utility into a new western energy market -- the Southwest Power Pool’s “Markets +” -– that would help Grant PUD get the most value from the surplus power it sells beyond the county’s needs.

Commissioners also reviewed public input received on the proposed 2026 rate package during their workshop on Jan. 13.

Commissioners asked the public for their comments on a proposed increase of 3.5% for residential, general service/small business, and ag customers (core customers). A 9.5% increase is proposed for Tier 1 and Tier 2 (noncore) customers.

The rate adjustment is intended to balance affordability for core customers while ensuring financial stability in a high-inflation environment.

Grant PUD gathered feedback through multiple channels including a Dec. 9 public hearing, Grant PUD's website and social media.

For cattlemen who have access to cropland, winter annuals are a great way to extend the grazing season.
Planning is key for successful grazing at the farm that is located about 60 miles south of the Canadian border.
“We use both unrolling hay and bale grazing in the winter.” A lot of bedding is also provided for the cattle in the pastures.
“The next winter we had snow so deep that we had a terrible time bale grazing,” she said.","RALEIGH, N.C. — Managing an adaptive grazing management system is a thinking person’s game.

“You have to think to do this,” said Johnny Rogers, coordinator of the Amazing Grazing Program at North Carolina State University, during a webinar organized by the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association.

“Carrying capacity is the maximum stocking rate that our land will support to get good performance out of our animals and maintain that grazing resource, good soil health and good water cycle,” said Rogers, who owns Rogers Cattle Company in Roxboro in north-central North Carolina.

Stocking rate is the number of animals that cattlemen put on their land.

“I find it beneficial to stock our land slightly below the carrying capacity because things happen,” Rogers said. “The challenge with carrying capacity is that it changes every couple of weeks.”

Part of finding the correct stocking rate, he said, is stocking the land with the most appropriate beef cattle enterprise.

“Make sure you have the right class and type of cattle that fits your operation and lifestyle,” said Rogers, who owns a Red Angus seedstock herd.

Cattlemen can use a variety of measures to find functional cows.

“You can look at average weaning weight which will give you a picture of milking ability and growth rate of calves,” Rogers said. “Pounds of wean per cow exposed is kind of the gold standard and it pulls in some of the reproductive performance of the cows.”

Another measurement is pounds of calf weaned per pound of female exposed.

“Not every size and not every cow weans the same weight of calves, so this ties in a little bit of efficiency,” Rogers said.

At North Carolina State, researchers weighed calves at weaning and calculated the adjusted 205-day weight and determined the percentage of the cow’s body weight that she weaned in her calf.

“As the cows get bigger, they wean a lower percentage of their body weight,” said Rogers about the study that included seven to eight herds and about 200 cows.

The average cow in the survey weighed 1,380 pounds.

“We talk about 1,200-pound cows, but there is a higher percentage of cows that weigh over 1,400 pounds than under 1,300 pounds in this survey,” Rogers said. “So, know how big your cows are because that affects your stocking rate that you are trying to marry with the carrying capacity.”

In North Carolina, cattlemen are challenged with mud in the winter.

“Our ground can be frozen, but it does not stay frozen like it does in many parts of the U.S.,” the researcher said.

One way to address this, Rogers said, is to unroll hay in the pasture.

“I think that spreads out the impact of the cattle, and to me the hay that is not eaten, there is carbon added back to your farm, so it is not really wasted,” he said.

“I will acknowledge that when it is raining a lot and you unroll hay, especially with younger cattle, they tend to want to just walk through the hay and look for something better,” the cattleman said. “But a brood cow will stop and start eating.”

Bale grazing is an option, where cattlemen place bales in the pasture weeks or maybe months ahead of winter.

“When you are grazing the cattle, you put up a temporary electric fence and as the cows eat the hay, you move the poly wire,” Rogers said.

“One of the advantages is that instead of taking round bales out every day to unroll, you place those ahead of time,” he said. “So, you don’t have the equipment traffic on your fields on a daily basis.”

Rogers’ favorite way to extend the grazing season is stockpiled forage.

“You can stockpile any type of forage, but tall fescue is very special because it is a tough grass that takes the freezing and thawing and holds its quality through the winter,” he said.

For cattlemen who have access to cropland, winter annuals are a great way to extend the grazing season.

“Those are very high-quality crops and the cattle will eat them pretty quick,” Rogers said. “We like to use temporary fence to get the most out of that resource.

“For every $1 that the cow consumes in her mouth, she will deposit about 85 cents of that somewhere on your farm,” he said. “So, the more we can keep the cattle out on the land and grazing, that helps the nutrient distribution on our farms.”

Little Timber Farm

Rachel Gray owns Little Timber Farm near Blackduck in northern Minnesota.

“We are fifth generation here and we started as a dairy farm,” said Gray during the webinar. “My mom and dad were dairy farmers until the early 2000s when they transitioned to beef.”

When Gray took over the operation in 2012, the cow/calf herd included about 180 head of cattle.

“Now we rotationally graze about 500 heifers and a few cow/calf pairs that belong to my son,” she said. “We have small cattle feedlot and we sell some freezer beef.”

In the winter, the Gray family custom calve for some of their customers that purchase heifers from Little Timber Farm.

“We calve about 150 heifers per year, so we bump up to about 700 head in the winter,” the cattlewoman said.

Planning is key for successful grazing at the farm that is located about 60 miles south of the Canadian border.

“If you are going to keep cattle out on pasture in the winter, you have to have a plan and we find a good plan starts in the summer,” Gray said.

“When we develop a winter plan, we find areas that need nutrients and monitor those pastures throughout the summer,” she said. “We use both unrolling hay and bale grazing in the winter.”

A lot of bedding is also provided for the cattle in the pastures.

“We get a lot of wind and we also get very cold,” the cattlewoman said. “November is great, December is nice and in January we are often dipping into 20 to 25 degrees below zero nights, so we want to make sure these cattle are nicely bedded.”

Gray uses portable windbreaks and the bedding pack is placed in front of them.

“We build the bedding pack throughout the winter, so the cattle always know to go to that area,” she explained.

“When we are done in the field for the winter, we pile the bedding pack and let it compost down,” she said. “We spread that out and sometimes we will put that on our corn ground.”

Making grazing plans is important, Gray said, and she always has a Plan B.

“The summer of 2021, we were burning up because it was the driest summer on record,” she recalled. “We had no hay crop, so we had some cake brought in.”

That provided enough feed until Aug. 20, when Gray shipped 600 head of her cattle six hours south so they could stay fed and Little Timber Farm could stay in business.

“That was the Plan B for that year,” she noted.

“The next winter we had snow so deep that we had a terrible time bale grazing,” she said. “All we could do was take equipment out and move snow, so we were breaking trail for most of the winter so the cattle could get to water.”

Gray uses the Pasture Map app daily as a planning tool for her cattle operation.

“I have our permanent waterers marked, it shows where the cattle are right now and I can also add where the hay bales are placed,” she said. “It is really nice because it keeps track of how many days the cattle have been out of a pasture.”",https://www.agrinews-pubs.com/resizer/nzsdRV5BXeBNJKjXmNNnRZ7Qafc=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70):focal(435x472:445x482)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/shawmedia/QGQJUSULMZBBJBOQQIOWFIPYFQ.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 19:01:02.672920

It's not necessarily a question of full Chinese production in Canada or not.
The investment potential in Canada comes as Chinese firms have increasingly been building capacity outside of their home market.
Speaking in Doha, Qatar, on the weekend, Carney said there is interest in Chinese companies producing “affordable” electric vehicles in Canada.
Fiorani said that while investment in Canada is possible, it's unlikely Chinese firms would partner with the Detroit Three, as they're all unionized and Chinese producers will be looking to be union-free.","TORONTO — The trade deal between Canada and China has experts saying it could lead to Chinese electric vehicle firms producing vehicles in Canada, but much depends on the trade talks ahead with the United States.

Critics including Ontario Premier Doug Ford and Unifor leader Lana Payne panned the deal as an attack on workers and Canadian manufacturing, while Prime Minister Mark Carney said the government has already spoken with Chinese companies interested in investing in Canada.

The deal has the federal government lowering tariffs to 6.1 per cent from 100 per cent on 49,000 Chinese EVs a year, with a ramp-up to 70,000 within five years, while China has agreed to reduce tariffs on a range of Canadian goods.

It comes as Chinese manufacturers are already adapting globally to trade restrictions and are moving toward local production where they sell, said automotive consultant Sam Fiorani in an interview.

""Once they get a foothold in Canada, the idea that they could build plants locally, the odds of that jump dramatically.""

Fiorani, vice-president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, said Chinese firms need to test the waters first, but once they establish a brand, they look to invest where they sell.

""Build locally is the long-term plan for any Chinese automaker.""

China has been ramping up exports, estimated at around 6.5 million units lasts year, as its domestic industry has capacity to produce millions of more vehicles than it can sell locally, but firms have still been investing heavily abroad, said a report out last November from S&P Global Mobility.

“Along with avoiding tariffs and shipping costs, building close to where you sell improves market potential inherently,"" said S&P analyst Abby Chun Tu in the report.

""In most cases, consumers are more open to automakers who invest locally, regardless of where a brand’s home market is.""

However the chances Chinses firms will set up shop in Canada with out guaranteed access to the U.S. market is unrealistic, said Andrew King, managing partner of DesRosiers Automotive Consultants Inc.

""The Canadian market itself is just too small to justify an assembly plant – which is why the auto industry established an efficient North American assembly system – a system that the current U.S. administration seems determined to destroy,"" he said by email.

It's not necessarily a question of full Chinese production in Canada or not.

Chinese firms could do a less costly modular production, putting together pre-assembled pieces in Canada, if access to the U.S. becomes unlikely, said Ryan Robinson, automotive research lead at Deloitte Canada, but some form of investment is possible.

""I think there's a potential for it, for sure,"" said Robinson.

There's certainly demand potential on the consumer side as buyers confront the reality of current vehicle prices, he said, while noting the policy could also help Canada get closer to emission reduction goals.

The investment potential in Canada comes as Chinese firms have increasingly been building capacity outside of their home market. Chinese EV producers have built at least 15 facilities across Southeast and Central Asia since 2022, the S&P report noted, including in countries like Malaysia that has a vehicle market less than half the size of Canada's.

The wave of investments come as Chinese firms look to expand from an already saturated domestic market, leading to them collectively spend more abroad than at home in 2024 for the first time, according to a report out last year from the Rhodium Group.

Europe has also seen a jump in manufacturing capacity with Chinese giant BYD building plants in Hungary and Turkey, while Chery has entered a joint venture with Spanish automaker Ebro-EV Motors.

Stellantis, meanwhile, has partnered with Leapmotor for the Chinese to firm build its vehicles at Stellantis' Poland plant, and was set to start producing in Malaysia at Stellantis's Gurun facility at the end of 2025, the report noted.

Meanwhile, the future of the Stellantis plant in Brampton, Ont., remains an open question after the automaker moved production slated for it to the U.S. last year.

The Canadian government said in announcing the deal with China that it expects within three years it will ""drive considerable new Chinese joint-venture investment in Canada,"" creating new auto manufacturing career for Canadian workers.

TD chief economist Beata Caranci said in a report last September that Chinese EV production in Canada is unlikely given concerns about market access to the U.S., but that there are still areas for partnership.

""Given the EV technology gaps that remain between China and other nations and China’s desire to expand globally, some form of partnership could aid Canada in improving its EV ecosystem,"" she said in the report.

Speaking in Doha, Qatar, on the weekend, Carney said there is interest in Chinese companies producing “affordable” electric vehicles in Canada.

“We’ve had direct conversations directly from the Chinese companies ... with explicit interest and intention to partner with Canadian companies.""

Ford said it was terrible deal for the auto sector and a miscalculated decision by the Prime Minister, while Unifor national president Lana Payne said it was a self-inflicted wound to an already injured Canadian auto industry.

Fiorani said that while investment in Canada is possible, it's unlikely Chinese firms would partner with the Detroit Three, as they're all unionized and Chinese producers will be looking to be union-free.

He said the small volume of low-tariff vehicles will mean producers will, however, want to find some way to invest in Canada if they want to grow in the market.

""It should not take very long for some of those brands to become accepted in the Canadian market, and that will lead to local production of those vehicles as the manufacturers want to expand beyond the current limits.""

With the final sales numbers tallied for 2025, more than 2.5 million electric vehicles have been sold in the state since 2012, according to data released Tuesday by the California Energy Commission.

“We invested in this future when others said it was impossible,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement.

Newsom highlighted the number — 2,551,121 to be exact — during his appearance Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

For the past two decades, California has led the nation in electric vehicle sales. The state has provided rebates, tax credits and other incentives as part of its efforts to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases.

As technology has improved, allowing much farther battery range — with many models able to travel more than 300 miles when fully charged — EV sales now make up 22.9% of all new car sales in California. Santa Clara County has the highest rate in the state, with 41.1% of all new vehicles sold being electric in 2025.

But electric vehicles face major headwinds. President Donald Trump has reversed or blocked many of the federal incentives put in place by former President Joe Biden.

This past year, Trump and Republicans in Congress eliminated the federal tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of new electric vehicles. They let a law expire that allowed states to permit solo EV drivers in carpool lanes on federally funded highways, ending that perk nationwide.

And in June, Trump signed a resolution blocking California’s first-in-the-nation regulations banning the sale of new gasoline-powered passenger vehicles by 2035, which Newsom had put in place in 2020.

Trump held a White House ceremony June 12, saying California’s rules limited consumer choice. He revoked federal permission for the ban, called a “waiver,” that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had given to the state when Biden was in office.

“We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating the California electric vehicle mandate once and for all,” Trump said. “They said it couldn’t be done. It’s had us tied in knots for years. They passed these crazy rules.”

Republicans said California’s rules were overly broad and would effectively set a national standard because the state is the largest car market in the United States and, under the Clean Air Act, other states are allowed to copy its rules.

Environmental groups and Democratic leaders said Trump’s rollbacks will lead to more air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and health problems for Californian residents.

Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit over the issue minutes after Trump acted. California was joined by 10 other states — Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. The lawsuit is pending.

In the months since, several large automakers have pulled back on some EV models. In December, Ford announced it would cease production of its all-electric F-150 pickup truck, and would focus instead on hybrid vehicles and a new line of smaller, cheaper EVs.

“When the market really changed over the last couple of months, that was really the impetus for us to make the call,” Ford CEO Jim Farley told Reuters in an interview.

In California, 408,731 EVs sold in 2025. That’s double the number from 2022, but down 8% from 2024, when 443,374 sold.

Sales surged in the weeks before Sept. 30, when the federal tax credits expired, and then dropped off in October, November, and December.

Even though two of the top three highest-selling vehicles of all types in California last year were the Tesla Model Y and the Model 3, the other being the gas-powered Toyota Camry, Tesla has seen some softening of sales in the state. Some residents of the blue state, angry that Tesla CEO Elon Musk contributed $250 million to Trump’s re-election campaign and led an effort called DOGE to reduce federal staffing through firings and early retirements, have resisted buying Teslas, put stickers on the vehicles denouncing Musk, or purchased other EVs, like Hyundais, Hondas or Rivians instead.

The Trump administration’s fight over electric vehicle rules stands as one of the major environmental clashes between his administration and California during the first year of his second term, along with Trump’s proposal to allow new offshore oil drilling along the state’s coastline.

Trump similarly tried to curb California’s electric vehicle rules and allow new offshore oil drilling in his first term from 2017 to 2021. But California sued in both cases. The lawsuits were pending when Biden took office, and he reversed Trump’s positions.

On Tuesday, Newsom, who is considering a run for president in 2028, cast Trump’s resistance to electric vehicles as putting the United States at a competitive disadvantage in a world where Europe, Japan, Canada, China, and other countries have passed similar laws to encourage the sale of electric vehicles, reduce oil consumption and phase out the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035 or 2040.

“While Washington now cedes the global clean vehicle market to China, California is ensuring American workers and manufacturers can compete and win in the industries that will define this century,” Newsom said.

Two weeks ago, Newsom announced in his state budget proposal that he would allocate $200 million to a new electric vehicle rebate program. Details, including how much motorists will receive, which cars are eligible and what income limits may apply, have not yet been finalized.

“California isn’t slowing down, we’re still leading the pack,” said California Air Resources Board Chair Lauren Sanchez. “It’s not just about clean air, it’s smart economic policy.”",https://www.siliconvalley.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/LDN-L-TESLA-DINER-0725-DC-4.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2026-01-20 21:58:53.250940

Lately, President Trump has been talking about making sure that AI data centers pay their fair share for electricity costs.","On the campaign trail, President Trump promised to cut Americans' energy bills in half — cheaper gasoline, cheaper electricity. He also said he'd ""unleash"" American energy production, often repeating the catchphrase ""Drill, baby, drill.""

One year in, the price of gasoline is down about 10%. But the U.S. oil industry is definitely not drilling, baby, drilling. The price of oil is just too low to justify more of it — although within the last year, companies have won major lobbying victories that soothe that sting. Meanwhile, electricity costs are rising and expected to rise more.

Cheap gasoline: check

The U.S. benchmark price for oil is down about 20% from where it was a year ago, and the average retail gasoline price — the price drivers pay at the pump — is down nearly 10%.

Now, presidents — whoever they are — do not get to decide the price of gasoline. The price of crude oil is the biggest factor, and crude prices are set in a complex global marketplace that responds to a number of factors.

In the past year, cheaper crude has been largely driven by a global oversupply of oil, which in turn was largely driven by a series of decisions by the oil cartel OPEC+. The cartel repeatedly put more barrels on the market, depressing global prices but seizing more market share for its members.

However, Dan Pickering, the chief investment officer at Pickering Energy Partners, says the president also put significant pressure on OPEC to bring down global crude prices. As a result, he gives Trump partial credit for today's low prices.

""I think if we look at oil down 20% in 2025, that you have to say that political dynamics drove at least half of that,"" he says. ""And as we go into 2026, I think those dynamics will still be at play.""

Moving forward, the president's push to produce more oil from Venezuela could also help keep global crude prices lower for longer — if he persuades companies to invest.

Analysts with the gas prices app GasBuddy found that U.S. households spent, on average, $177 less on gasoline in 2025 than 2024, thanks to lower prices, and they predict that expenditures will continue to fall in 2026, saving Americans a collective $11 billion next year.

Drill, baby, drill? Not so much.

Those lower oil prices are exactly why ""Drill, baby, drill"" didn't happen.

The number of active drilling rigs in the U.S., the largest oil producer in the world, has dropped by more than 6% year-over-year, at last count. That means fewer new wells are being drilled. And that's true even as the Trump administration has made it easier for companies to start new projects, including by making more federal lands and waters available for leases.

With U.S. oil prices under $60 a barrel and the global market generally oversupplied with crude, it's just not profitable for companies to drill a bunch of new wells right now.

The Trump administration has many close allies in the U.S. oil industry. But this is a perennial point of disagreement between them: The president loves cheap oil, while companies would prefer prices to be higher than they are today.

This disagreement was actually called out by Secretary of Energy Chris Wright — a former fracking executive. Speaking to CBS News' Face the Nation this month, he called President Trump ""no helper to the oil and gas industry"" because ""he's driven down the price of oil.""

It's true that many U.S. oil workers wince every time the president talks about $50 crude or pushes for more production from OPEC. But it's not quite fair to call the administration ""no helper.""

The American Petroleum Institute, or API, is the most powerful lobbying arm of the U.S. oil and gas industry. Before Trump was reelected, the group laid out a dozen different policy priorities — a wish list. Tax policy changes that would help oil companies; more access to drilling in the Gulf; a boost in exports of liquefied natural gas; the repeal of requirements for cleaner and more efficient cars, which would have pushed down oil demand over time; the elimination of a fee for releasing planet-warming methane.

""By our count, every single one of them was completed in 2025, with the exception of legislative permitting reform,"" Mike Sommers, the president and CEO of API, said on a recent call with reporters. (""Permitting reform"" refers to a series of changes to federal laws that would make it easier for companies to build things like pipelines and other large projects that often face local opposition. It's been a hot topic in Congress for years.)

Sommers says U.S. companies can weather low oil prices in the short term and make business decisions with an eye toward the future.

And in the long term, the administration's policy changes support higher oil demand for years to come by doing things like slowing down the shift toward electric vehicles, while also cutting the costs of oil production, including by easing environmental rules.

Electricity costs are rising

Electricity prices have been increasing for years now, and 2025 was more of the same.

""Across most states and in most markets, what we see is that prices have gone up,"" says Helen Kou, an analyst with BloombergNEF.

Based on trends in wholesale power markets — where your local electric company buys its power, an expense they pass on to you — that's likely to continue. Kou said that in New York and New England, wholesale prices are up more than 60%, and in the mid-Atlantic they're up 45%.

""Almost 1 in 3 households, or over 80 million Americans, are struggling to pay their utility bills,"" says Charles Hua, who runs Powerlines, a national energy consumer education nonprofit that encourages people to get more involved in their public utility commissions.

Why are costs going up? Hua points to three primary reasons: an aging power grid, the cost of natural disasters, and higher fuel costs, especially natural gas.

Kou says that for 2025, natural gas prices were the clear driver of increases. While oil and gasoline are cheap, natural gas — which is used for home heating and power plants — has gone up more than 50% from last year's annual average. U.S. exports of natural gas have increased (one of API's requests), and sending more natural gas overseas means less is available domestically.

Natural gas prices have been up and down over the past few years. They spiked in 2022, after Russia invaded Ukraine. And they were unusually cheap in 2024 before rising again in 2025. While they're far from record highs, the increase has been enough to significantly shift electricity markets.

These causes are complex and date back years before Trump's return to office. But experts say the Trump administration's electricity policy has not focused on lowering natural gas costs, improving the grid or mitigating the effects of natural disasters. Instead, it has aligned with his goal of reversing Biden-era climate policies. The White House has ordered coal-powered power plants to stay open for longer. Those power plants are typically expensive to operate, raising concerns about prices. Kou says keeping them online could hypothetically help meet rising demand, but only if those plants are located where demand is growing.

The administration is also investing in nuclear power — that, too, could potentially help with costs, but only in the long term, Kou says, because nuclear plants take so long to approve and build.

Some of the administration's moves could actually increase electricity bills in the future.

Large solar and wind projects provide more cost-competitive energy than natural gas, nuclear and coal projects, according to financial services firm Lazard. But the Trump administration has ended federal tax credits for solar and wind projects early, and canceled more than $13 billion in funds for green energy projects

Trump has also said he won't permit any new wind projects, and the administration has attempted to stop offshore wind projects that are already under construction, leading to court battles. That's been criticized not just by renewable energy advocates, but by many business groups, because it creates uncertainty and discourages investments in projects that could be supplying more energy into the grid.

""As a general matter, the thing that you can do that most clearly helps reduce prices is to remove barriers to new energy investment,"" says James Coleman, a nonresident senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""And the thing that basically just increases prices is increasing uncertainty or barriers to energy.""

The administration is also rolling back efficiency standards for appliances. Those standards actually cut consumer bills by reducing energy use, Hua notes.

Meanwhile, some things that could meaningfully cut costs have simply not been prioritized by this administration. ""There are solutions that are available today that can be put on the grid that would meaningfully resolve a lot of these solutions,"" Hua says, pointing to technologies that allow more power to be moved on the existing grid, or better match supply and demand. ""It doesn't solve everything, but it provides some immediate relief … and that just has not been as much of a focus"" for the Trump administration, he says.

Lately, President Trump has been talking about making sure that AI data centers pay their fair share for electricity costs. Hua says there is a genuine opportunity to cut energy bills for ordinary Americans as data center demand for electricity goes up, depending on how costs are spread out.

But for now, the Trump administration's pledge to cut utility bills remains an unmet promise.

“The Toxic Substances Control Act is the country’s bedrock chemical safety law, and it keeps dangerous chemicals out of our homes, workplaces and communities.
Americans don’t want potentially toxic chemicals fast-tracked into their lives,” said Slaney.
The discussion draft would make sweeping changes to the Toxic Substances Control Act that threaten the public’s health.
This would severely undermine EPA’s ability to protect Americans from the worst toxic chemicals already in use, like cancer-causing formaldehyde and vinyl chloride.","The Toxic Substances Control Act – the primary U.S. chemical safety law – gives the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the authority and responsibility to review chemicals for safety, both before and after they enter the market. The law was significantly strengthened in 2016 when Congress passed a bipartisan overhaul of the law. In managing the safety of chemicals, the Toxic Substances Control Act requires EPA to take steps to protect the people most at risk from exposure to toxic chemicals, like children, pregnant women, workers and people living near chemical facilities.

American families should be able to trust that the chemicals in their everyday products have been assessed for safety and won’t cause them serious health problems.

New polling from EDF shows overwhelming support across party lines for the Toxic Substances Control Act. The law is universally popular, with more than four-in-five (82%) favoring it. That support is consistent regardless of gender, race, age, education level or party affiliation.

Despite this popularity, this week, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives introduced a discussion draft bill that would fundamentally dismantle the core responsibility for EPA to ensure the safety of chemicals in our economy and everyday lives.

“The Toxic Substances Control Act is the country’s bedrock chemical safety law, and it keeps dangerous chemicals out of our homes, workplaces and communities. Americans don’t want potentially toxic chemicals fast-tracked into their lives,” said Slaney.

The discussion draft would make sweeping changes to the Toxic Substances Control Act that threaten the public’s health.

No more scientific process for new chemicals

The proposal to reform the Toxic Substances Control Act would remove the requirement for EPA to follow an independent, scientific process to determine if a chemical can be used safely before it can come onto the market.

In addition to eliminating this requirement, the bill would proactively invite industry to participate in reviewing their own products. This would dramatically undermine EPA’s responsibility and authority to protect Americans from the most toxic chemicals and to adhere to a scientifically robust, independent process that Americans can trust.

Sets up a rubber stamp approval process for new chemicals

Many dangerous chemicals, including many PFAS, or “forever chemicals,” entered the market before a bipartisan Congress strengthened the law in 2016. The current proposal would bring back this process that allowed forever chemicals into the market by flipping the safety standard on its head.

Instead of requiring EPA to prove a chemical doesn’t pose an unreasonable risk as is required under the current law, the proposal makes it EPA’s responsibility to prove that a chemical would likely pose an unreasonable risk. This small distinction would have major impacts – it would shift the burden of proof away from safety, effectively turning EPA’s safety review into a rubber stamp for any chemical the industry wants to bring to market.

Blanket approvals for most uses

In this proposal, once a chemical is rubber stamped for one use, it could more easily be used in additional unapproved ways. In practice, this could lead to a chemical that was approved for use in industrial settings – with proper worker protections in place – potentially being used in homes, schools and daycares.

Puts industry profits over our health

Republicans’ proposal would severely weaken EPA’s ability to regulate existing chemicals that we know are toxic. The Republicans’ proposed requirement that EPA prove a chemical is likely to pose an unreasonable risk to public health is intended to set a nearly unreachable standard for addressing the risks from dangerous chemicals. The discussion draft bill also diminishes what EPA can consider harmful in the first place when evaluating toxic chemicals, requiring EPA to apply a vague and difficult standard of proof, making it harder to regulate toxic chemicals. It minimizes the estimates of the risks to those living near chemical plants, workers, children and pregnant people by failing to consider their full chemical exposure.

This proposal would also limit the tools EPA can use to eliminate unreasonable risks, putting industry profits ahead of people’s health. This would severely undermine EPA’s ability to protect Americans from the worst toxic chemicals already in use, like cancer-causing formaldehyde and vinyl chloride. These chemicals have long devastated the health of workers and communities on the fenceline of industrial facilities.

The bill also allows the chemical industry and manufacturers to delay for months or years the regulation of existing toxic chemicals by challenging in court any scientific finding by EPA that a chemical is harmful. The proposed process changes would prevent EPA from taking actions to reduce the risks to consumers until after the industry litigation is over.

Limits the information that can be required on dangerous chemicals

The proposal would make it significantly more difficult to produce key information on the hazards of chemicals, how people are exposed to them, and how they harm the environment. It even prohibits EPA from requiring testing for whole groups of chemicals, including highly toxic chemicals. This information is key to properly characterizing the risks we face from groups of toxic chemicals, such as PFAS or “forever chemicals.”

Hazardous loophole

This proposal creates a loophole for so-called advanced or chemical recycling – essentially the burning of plastic waste. It would allow harmful products produced through this process to be considered “equivalent” to chemicals already on the market without undergoing a safety review. Despite the fact that the products are contaminated with plastic’s toxic additives and harmful byproducts such as dioxins, these false equivalents would be rubberstamped as safe.

Why now?

The chemicals industry and manufacturers have advocated for most of the proposals in this bill, and according to news reports EPA “keeps adding former industry lobbyists to the office that manages TSCA.” The Trump EPA has made moves to roll back numerous essential Toxic Substances Control Act protections against toxic chemicals, including altering the way the agency evaluates chemical risk and lowballing the risks from cancer-causing formaldehyde.",https://blogs.edf.org/health/wp-content/blogs.dir/11/files//getty-image-room-TSCA-chemicals.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 17:59:48.034180

Trump’s edicts, signed in March and August, cited a seldom-used provision of the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act to exclude most federal agencies from federal sector labor law under the auspices of national security. A federal judge in California in June issued a preliminary injunction blocking the orders’ implementation, but a three-judge panel on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed that decision last summer, finding that the lower court did not adequately consider whether the president would have taken the same action against labor organizations absent their various legal challenges against the president’s personnel policies.”

Labor advocates and businesses had warned of devastating consequences after the government moved to eliminate most of NIOSH’s staff last year.”

U.S. Teachers Union Says It Is Leaving X Over Sexualized AI Images of Children: “The American Federation of Teachers says it is leaving X, citing the social media site's creation and dissemination of ‘sickening’ images of children in various states of undress. In an interview with Reuters, AFT President Randi Weingarten said that the site had already been degraded by extremists and trolls since Elon Musk's 2022 takeover, before which the platform was known as Twitter. But the recent proliferation of nonconsensual images of women and children in bikinis or underwear generated by X's artificial intelligence chatbot, Grok, had made the site unusable, she said.”

Maine Med Nurses Ratify Union Contract with 21% Pay Increase, Workplace Protections: “Nurses at MaineHealth Maine Medical Center in Portland recently ratified a new contract that includes a 21% pay increase over three years and measures to guard against workplace violence. The contract, which runs through the end of 2028, is the second contract for nurses at the state’s largest hospital since they voted in 2021 to join the Maine State Nurses Association and National Nurses Organizing Committee. Nurses at the hospital, MMC nurses, signed their first contract in September 2022 and secured the latest contract after four months of bargaining.”

Streetcar Operators Finalize First Union Contract: “After successfully unionizing in 2024, streetcar workers are close to finalizing a contract. In February 2024, more than two dozen workers who operate and maintain the city of Milwaukee’s streetcar, called The Hop, organized a union with the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 998 (ATU), which also represents Milwaukee County Transit System (MCTS) workers.”

How Vets in Labor Have Joined the Fight Against Trump: “The U.S. is home to 17 million military veterans. About 1.3 million of them currently work in union jobs, with women and people of color making up the fastest-growing cohorts. Veterans are more likely to join a union than non-veterans, according to the AFL-CIO. In half a dozen states, 25% or more of all actively employed veterans belong to unions. In the heyday of industrial unionism in the decades following World War II, hundreds of thousands of former soldiers could be found on the front lines of labor struggles in auto, steel, meatpacking, electrical equipment manufacturing, mining, trucking, and the telephone industry. Many World War II vets became militant stewards, local union officers, and, in some cases, well-known union reformers in the United Mine Workers and Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers.”

Springfield's 3M Workers Vote to Unionize Under United Steelworkers: “Springfield's 3M plant has been a major employer in the city since 1967. Now, the plant's 370 employees will be represented by a union following a successful organization effort. On December 20, workers elected to be represented by the United Steelworkers union, the nation's largest industrial labor union, joining a coalition of employees at other 3M plants across the country in seeking union representation. According to the National Labor Relations Board election results, there were 370 eligible voters, though 332 ballots were counted. Out of those, 233 votes were cast for the labor union and 99 against.”

Kaldi’s Coffee Workers Vote to Form Union, Accuse St. Louis Chain of Union-Busting: “Workers at Kaldi’s Skinker Boulevard location appear headed to unionization. On Friday, workers at the St. Louis specialty coffee chain location voted 7-2 in favor of unionization with the National Labor Relations Board. The results are not yet certified, however, and the union is challenging multiple ballots that it said were from employees who shouldn’t have been eligible to vote. The NLRB and Unite Here Local 74 are accusing Kaldi's of anti-union actions, including bringing in new or transferred employees in order to sway the outcome of the vote.”

Graduate Student Workers Secure First Contract with University of Maine System: “After more than 700 days of negotiations, the University of Maine System reached a tentative agreement with the graduate student workers union for its first-ever contract. ‘It took lot of organizing power for years. Hundreds of grad workers came together for each of the issues, and we fought really hard,’ Andrea Tirrell, a bargaining committee member for the University of Maine Graduate Workers Union, said.”

Science News Media Guild Ratifies First Contract, Securing Major Gains in Pay and Leave: “85% of the 27 members in the Science News Media Guild, workers who publish Science News and Science News Explores, have voted to ratify their first collective bargaining agreement. The historic contract establishes increases in pay, including cost of living raises and equity raises, sick and parental leave and importantly, codifes just-cause protections. The union launched on November 14, 2023, after more than 80% of non-management employees voted to unionize with the Washington-Baltimore News Guild. The ratification follows 625 days of negotiating with the Society for Science, which included a successful 24-hour walkout on November 5, 2025.”

SAG-AFTRA Leaders Sean Astin and Duncan Crabtree-Ireland on Their Negotiating Approach, Disney-Open AI Deal, Chance of Longer Contract Term & More: “The Hollywood labor landscape will have different contours this year as above-the-line guilds try to reach deals with the studios and streamers and avoid a repeat of the damaging strikes of 2023. For one thing, SAG-AFTRA will be the first union to negotiate, taking the spot normally occupied by the Directors Guild. SAG-AFTRA President Sean Astin and Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the union’s national executive director and chief negotiator, have confidence that their early start (talks kick off February 9) will be a difference-maker. The current contract won’t expire until June 30. ‘Part of the reason we wanted to go first is that we wanted to be able to have the time we feel is necessary,’ Astin told Deadline in an interview during CES in Las Vegas. ‘We appreciate that [AMPTP members] are willing to engage early in order to properly examine each item.’”",https://aflcio.org/sites/default/files/2026-01/working-people-weekly-list.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 17:59:31.279846

EPA’s proposal seeks to limit the scope of state-issued water quality certifications (WQCs) under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) to water quality impacts associated with discharges authorized by federal agency actions. The Proposed Rule also addresses concerns raised by applicants for federal licenses and permits (including for hydroelectric projects, natural gas pipelines, and other energy and infrastructure projects) that certain states have overstepped their Section 401 authority to impose onerous terms and conditions unrelated to water quality and artificially extended the statutory time limits for issuing WQCs.

CWA Section 401 requires any applicant for a federal license or permit that may result in any discharge to waters of the United States (WOTUS) to obtain a state certification that “any such discharge will comply with the applicable provisions” of sections 301, 302, 303, 306, and 307 of the CWA — all of which relate to effluent limitations. States may impose conditions on such certifications, including to comply with “any other appropriate requirement of State law” as provided in CWA Section 401(d). Over time, however, many states have used this conditioning authority to address issues unrelated to water quality.

EPA’s Proposed Rule, similar to the 2020 Rule, would narrow the scope of WQC conditions and provide predictable timelines for projects to receive their WQCs. In so doing, the Proposed Rule rolls back significant portions of the current rule, issued in 2023 under the Biden administration (2023 Rule).

Following is an overview of key changes in the Proposed Rule:

Scope of Certification – EPA notes the current 2023 Rule “provides States with sweeping authority to decide the fate of nationally important infrastructure projects, such as natural gas pipelines and hydropower dams, based on potentially speculative water quality impacts not linked to a point source discharge into waters of the United States.” To correct this, and consistent with the 2020 Rule, the Proposed Rule would scrap the 2023 Rule’s provision that the WQC can relate to the “activity as a whole” and instead limit state certifications to addressing discharges “from a point source into waters of the United States.” This, in turn, would prevent states from using Section 401 to address nonpoint source impacts, impacts to purely state waters that are not considered WOTUS, and non-water quality policy concerns such as land use, endangered species, and climate change. The preamble to the Proposed Rule describes in detail how limiting WQCs in this way is consistent with the legislative history and plain language of the CWA, relying heavily on the Supreme Court’s landmark 2024 decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo curtailing judicial deference to agencies’ statutory interpretations.

Request for Certification – The Proposed Rule would create a uniform, national standard for what a permit applicant must submit in a “request for certification” to establish, with certainty, the start of the one-year statutory period for states to act on a WQC request. Conversely, the Proposed Rule would bar states from imposing their own “completeness” criteria that control when the clock starts — although they may still request additional information from applicants.

Timing of Review – The Proposed Rule reiterates that the failure of a state to act on a WQC request within one year results in a waiver, while imposing several restrictions on states’ ability to extend the one-year certification deadline. Extensions would require the approval of the federal agency and only be allowed for specified reasons, and state certifying authorities would be barred from orchestrating withdrawal and resubmittal of requests to extend the one-year “reasonable period of time” cap — a maneuver that has long been criticized by applicants as gamesmanship that further facilitates the injection of non-water quality policy priorities into the certification process. Notably, the Proposed Rule does not foreclose another form of gamesmanship: denial of WQC applications without prejudice.

Contents of Certifications – Among other changes, the Proposed Rule would require states to explain how each condition of a certification relates to a CWA effluent limitation and would mandate any WQC denial to cite the specific water quality requirement at issue, which may deter certain states’ efforts to prolong the WQC process by denying applications without prejudice. Notably, EPA explains that WQC conditions should be limited to “water quality requirements” defined as applicable provisions of sections 301, 302, 303, 306 and 307 of the CWA, and any applicable and appropriate state water quality-related regulatory requirements for discharges. In explaining what water quality-related requirements are “applicable and appropriate,” EPA expressly provides that it is not limiting state regulatory provisions to only EPA-approved provisions — although it requests comment on this point. The Proposed Rule continues to allow states to incorporate narrative water quality standards and other regulatory requirements that apply to point source discharges, declining to limit conditions to just “numeric water quality criteria.”

Modifications – The Proposed Rule would allow states to modify a previously granted WQC only when the federal permitting agency and the applicant agree to the modification, including the content of that modification.

Neighboring Jurisdictions – The Proposed Rule would streamline the process by which other states may object to a discharge that “may affect” their water quality under CWA Section 401(a)(2), including establishing a 60-day deadline for the other state to file an objection and a 90-day deadline for the permitting agency to act on a valid state objection.

In aggregate, the proposed amendments would create a WQC process that is more predictable, provides long-term certainty for WQC holders, and significantly constrains states’ ability to bootstrap other policy concerns onto their Section 401 authority. However, EPA notes in the preamble that if a state imposes conditions in a WQC that exceed the scope outlined in the 401 Rule, the remedy would be found in court. This means litigation of both the Proposed Rule and individual WQCs is likely to continue.

EPA did not include several regulatory changes suggested by industry during past comment periods in the Proposed Rule, indicating that there are still opportunities for further improvement before EPA adopts a final rule. For example, the Proposed Rule is silent on the issue of who (states and/or action agencies) has the authority to enforce WQC conditions incorporated into the federal license or permit, as well as the extent to which EPA or the federal permitting agencies can serve as a “gatekeeper” for WQC conditions that exceed the scope of CWA Section 401.

They spend on average 20 percent of their income on energy bills — more than three times the average for households above 200 percent FPL spend on energy bills (on average, these households spend 4 percent of their income on energy bills).","Everyone deserves affordable, reliable, safe, and clean energy to meet their everyday needs. But rising energy costs threaten energy access, especially for low-income people and people of color, who experience the highest energy burdens and are also struggling with rising food, health care, and housing costs. Rising energy costs are due in large part to construction cost spikes, reflecting factors like supply chain bottlenecks and tariffs on building materials, and to natural gas price changes as well as increased energy demand, to which data centers are a heavy contributor.

It is clear that capital investments are needed to meet the rising demand for energy. In the face of this, we must find ways to build more resources to reduce energy costs, or at a minimum slow their growth. With the right incentives, investment strategies, and policies, states can harness cleaner energy sources that are less expensive for households and improve people’s health, while helping to ensure the cost of energy is more fairly shared between household and non-household users. This paper describes a range of steps states can take to meet our growing energy needs in a way that works for consumers and helps facilitate the continued transition to clean energy.

States seeking to address energy affordability during 2026 legislative sessions should:

provide direct energy assistance to low- and moderate-income households for short-term relief;

better manage how costs are incurred and allocated to control the rate of medium-term increases; and

facilitate the continued transition to an energy system dominated by clean and renewable sources for long-term affordability and safety for everyone.

The energy transition is necessary, inevitable, and underway. 2025 saw the U.S.’s first month in which clean energy sources surpassed fossil fuels in electricity generation, driven in large part by the increasing availability of low-cost solar and wind. This energy transition, if done right, will create not just cleaner air and a healthier climate, but lower bills for everyone. States should make smart, informed choices to reduce known challenges and speed up the transition to a system that is affordable, safe, and reliable for all.

Rising Energy Bills Are Driven by Higher Demand, Construction Costs, and the Price of Natural Gas

Solar and wind energy generation is cheaper to build and run than fossil fuels, a trend that will likely only continue as renewables technology continues to improve. What’s more, with the energy transition already in progress, infrastructure and fuel from the fossil energy system are becoming more expensive or obsolete.

But to fully reap the cost benefits of clean energy, electric grid infrastructure and state regulatory and policy systems must be optimized for its use. This will create some short-term costs, and it’s important that states implement measures to mitigate those costs when households are already experiencing rising energy prices due to other factors.

Average U.S. electricity prices are rising faster than overall inflation for the first time in 15 years — and are expected to increase by 7.6 percent this winter. While electricity prices are rising, currently the average price is similar to those experienced in 2010 in inflation-adjusted terms. Some families are already experiencing affordability challenges, and if prices continue to rise, more will strain to afford their energy bills.

The Republican budget reconciliation megabill enacted in July 2025 dismantled key policies that would have mitigated some of these increasing bills for households. The megabill made over $300 billion in cuts to clean energy tax credits and rescinded close to $8 billion in funding for grants and loans for clean energy, energy waste reduction, improvements to the electric grid, and energy upgrades in affordable housing enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. These investments had been designed to cover some of the transition costs to cleaner and less expensive energy. Some models project that these cuts will translate into higher energy bills for consumers.

Many households were already struggling to pay their utility bills before the megabill was enacted. Our analysis finds that 6.5 percent of households indicated being behind on utility bills in 2023. For renters, the rate was higher, at 10 percent of households. Analysis from the Century Foundation finds that nearly 1 in 20 households have severe past-due utility debt, meaning their accounts were sent to collections or have been delinquent for more than 89 days and will soon be sent to collections. It also finds the average overdue balance on utility bills has increased .

The national average electricity price rose between 2021 and 2024, driven by large increases in California; the Northeast, and Maine in particular; and the Mid-Atlantic. Prices in many Central, Southeast, and Mountain region states remained flat or fell, but experts predict further increases in all regions in 2026. Key factors behind these increases: rising construction costs for maintaining the electric grid and building new energy generation facilities, increased electricity demand, and natural gas price increases, with households served by for-profit utilities experiencing higher increases.

Rising construction costs: Rising construction costs, due to supply chain bottlenecks, permitting delays, and tariffs on building materials, increase the cost of needed upgrades to the electric grid. These upgrades, which are the most significant contributor to rising energy bills, are necessary to protect against climate change-fueled extreme weather events like wildfires and hurricane-force winds; accommodate new demand from data centers and electrification of transportation, heating and cooling, and appliances; and make it possible to connect new resources like wind, solar, and batteries to the grid. The problem exists nationwide but is more acute in places with higher construction costs, like New York and California. It may also be worse in places where investor-owned utilities (IOUs) are responsible for grid upgrades. IOUs receive a guaranteed rate of return for capital investments and are therefore incentivized to increase capital expenditures.

Increased demand: According to an analysis by ICF, after two decades of mostly flat demand growth, U.S. electricity demand is expected to grow 25 percent by 2030 and 78 percent by 2050. Current demand increases are being driven largely by data centers and manufacturing in certain sectors like semiconductors; in the future, building and vehicle electrification are expected to become significant drivers as well, though the Trump Administration has taken steps to slow vehicle electrification by cutting tax credits and withholding electric vehicle charging funding from states. As electric utilities prepare to meet increased demand, they must expand and improve the electric grid, including by building and connecting new sources of energy to it. Backlogs for connecting these new sources are one reason the Northeast, in particular, is experiencing challenges meeting electricity demand, though these challenges aren’t unique to that region. In an ideal scenario, large electricity users like data centers and manufacturing facilities can drive down prices by helping pay for the cost of upgrades. In reality, households and small businesses often get saddled with financially burdensome infrastructure investments. That is because utility companies may offer deals to large users, resulting in those users not paying their fair share, or a new large energy load may so far outstrip current demand that new infrastructure investments can’t be absorbed at a reasonable price. In some cases utility companies may build in anticipation of demand that fails to materialize, with households left to foot much of the bill

Natural gas (also known as methane gas): Over 40 percent of U.S. electricity is powered by natural gas. In contrast to renewables which have no fuel costs, natural gas is subject to price spikes, like the one caused by the Russia-Ukraine war. High natural gas prices are the leading cause of high energy bills in several states, including Maine, where electricity prices are growing at the third fastest rate in the nation. Natural gas prices are rising and are expected to rise further due to increased exports, which increase international demand for U.S. gas, driving up the price for domestic consumers.

Higher Energy Bills Hurt Low-Income People and People of Color Most

Low- and moderate-income households and households of color are disproportionately feeling these rising energy bills. These households are more likely than others to live in homes that are not energy efficient, either because of lack of insulation or inefficient heating and cooling systems, increasing energy costs. Households whose incomes are below the federal poverty level (FPL) are more likely than others to face severe energy burden. They spend on average 20 percent of their income on energy bills — more than three times the average for households above 200 percent FPL spend on energy bills (on average, these households spend 4 percent of their income on energy bills).

Looking regionally, low-income households in the Northeast and Midwest tend to spend the largest share of their income on energy bills. (See Figure 2.) In Maine and Connecticut, for example, low-income households spend an average of 31 percent of their income on energy bills.

Black, Indigenous, and Hispanic households face significantly higher energy burdens than white households, driven by income inequities and the older housing stock and lower homeownership rates in communities of color that are often the result of past and present discrimination in the economy and housing market.

Our analysis finds that 31 percent of Black households, 31 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN), and 27 percent of Hispanic households have high energy burdens (energy costs above 6 percent), compared to 24 percent of white households that do so. AIAN households also face the highest frequency of severe energy burden, with 1 in 5 households spending more than 10 percent of their income on energy bills. (See Figure 3.)

Immediate Action: Expand Energy Assistance for Low- and Moderate-Income Households

Low- and moderate-income households have the highest energy burdens and are least able to afford high electricity prices. Energy assistance is a targeted, cost-effective intervention that helps people stay safe in their homes and meet their everyday needs. Energy assistance can be monetary or take the form of prohibitions against shutting off vulnerable households’ electricity.

States can take steps to enact or expand these kinds of vital assistance. Recent threats to federal benefits — like the Trump Administration’s moves to eliminate funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) — make state actions even more important.

Expanding eligibility and enrollment: Energy assistance programs, like LIHEAP, are funded primarily through federal block grants and supplemented by state funds or utility ratepayers. But chronic underfunding, apart from even the Administration’s current funding threats, means these programs only serve roughly 18 percent of eligible households. In some states, like California and Texas, LIHEAP serves only about 5 percent of eligible households. Additionally, enrollment barriers and income thresholds for eligibility mean the program isn’t always serving those with the greatest energy burdens. States can expand supplemental funding, advocate for increased federal funding, and streamline enrollment and documentation processes. For example, a 2024 Michigan law assesses a utility surcharge to expand funding for the state’s program and extends eligibility to over 300,000 additional households.

Enacting moratoriums on utility shutoffs: Many, but not all, states have policies that protect vulnerable households from utility disconnection. States can expand these protections. In particular, they can add hot weather disconnection protections — like those they have for cold — as New Jersey did in 2025.

Some states are providing energy bill rebates to all ratepayers, which can be meaningful for some households. But these small, one- or two-time payments aren’t a reliable source of relief for residents who most need it. Additionally, some states are funding these payments using money allocated to vital clean energy and climate resilience projects, potentially delaying the work needed to move to cleaner, less expensive energy sources and forgoing resilience upgrades that would bring down the cost of future infrastructure repairs. If states do offer these payments, they should look to New Jersey, which provided larger payments for low-income households, and Maryland, which secured the funding from utility companies instead of reallocating state funds.

Short- and Medium-Term Action: Change Utility Incentives, Manage Utility Spending, and Assign Costs Equitably

While energy assistance is important to address immediate needs, states should also enact legislation that helps bring down the cost of household energy bills. Doing so requires that states change regulations so that, as utilities make needed investments, they do so in a cost-effective manner that prioritizes safety and affordability. States should also ensure that equity guides how costs are distributed among ratepayers.

States can achieve this by:

Including affordability in utility regulator mandates. State legislatures have the power to mandate that Public Utility Commissions (PUCs), which regulate utility companies in each state, include affordability as a goal in their regulatory actions. In 2021 Maine tasked its utility commission with mitigating disproportionate energy burdens, and in 2024 Minnesota mandated that its PUC establish standards to fairly share the cost of utility system upgrades between, among other things, residential and non-residential energy users and increase low-income households’ access to energy efficiency programs.

Considering regulatory structures based on utility performance. Performance-based ratemaking (PBR) is the practice of compensating utilities based on their performance against target outcomes — including cost effectiveness and reliability — instead of solely the cost of service, while minimizing the perverse incentive utilities have to overbuild capital-intensive systems. For example, following the 2018 Camp Fire in California, the state and the utility company underwent protracted negotiations to create a grid upgrade plan that balanced effective wildfire protections and consumer protections from rising energy costs. PBR is gaining traction in several states, such as Connecticut, which passed a comprehensive PBR package in 2023 that included social equity and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in its target outcomes.

Making it easier to install and use the lowest-cost sources of energy. Although transmission and distribution costs are the biggest drivers of increased electricity prices, the price of electric generation plays a role as well. Solar and wind are cheaper to run than fossil fuels, a cost advantage that’s likely to only grow as the technology continues to improve and fossil fuels are phased out for economic and environmental reasons. To increase large-scale solar and wind projects, states should:

Remove barriers to building large renewable energy facilities by streamlining siting and permitting processes, creating state-backed project financing such as revolving loans, and upgrading technology and processes for adding energy sources to the electric grid. California, Illinois, Michigan, New York, and Washington all recently overhauled their permitting systems for clean energy.

Enable more residents to benefit from renewable energy sources by enacting and protecting “net metering” policies and community choice aggregation. Net metering allows residential and commercial customers who generate their own electricity from solar power to sell the electricity they aren’t using back into the grid, significantly improving the economic case for switching to renewable energy. Community choice aggregation (CCA) allows local governments to procure power for residents and businesses from sources outside their utility company. The utility continues to provide energy transmission and distribution services and CCA participants get cheaper, cleaner power.

Require the cheapest sources of energy to provide power first, a practice known as “economic dispatch.” Utilities that own power generation resources sometimes run coal plants even when cheaper power is available because they earn profit not from minimizing fuel costs, but from keeping the plants they own in the rate base, that is, the value of property owned by the utility company on which it is permitted to earn a specific rate of return. If the utility company doesn’t operate the coal plant regularly, regulators may deem it no longer “used and useful,” which can force its retirement and reduce the utility’s earnings. But by running the plant — even at a loss — the utility helps justify keeping it in the rate base, while the higher fuel costs are passed on to customers. Utilities may also run coal plants to satisfy minimum purchase requirements in coal supply contracts, even when doing so is more expensive. State regulators can help end this practice by disallowing utilities from recovering costs that result from uneconomic dispatch, and by rejecting inefficient fuel supply contract terms.

Shifting power from corporations to consumers. Many aspects of utility spending lack transparency. And corporations often have outsized influence in regulatory proceedings due to their large financial, political, and legal resources, resulting in high corporate profits and contributing to inequitable utility rates. Six states have implemented intervenor compensation programs — which compensate consumer advocates for their time and expertise when intervening in electricity rate cases — to level the playing field between investor-owned utilities and consumers. Also, at least seven states have implemented laws prohibiting utilities from recovering lobbying costs from ratepayers. Some, like Maryland, also enhance accountability by requiring utilities to disclose their votes in regional electric grid proceedings.

Regulate data centers and other large energy users. States can study the costs these users impose on the electric grid; enact surcharges on them and use the revenue for electric bill assistance; or direct regulators to require that utility companies more equitably allocate the costs of energy system upgrades that serve them. States can also pass laws requiring large energy users to disclose their energy use, enabling regulators, utilities, and grid operators to better plan for their needs and help avoid price shocks. Requiring aspects of data center deals to be made public helps utilities avoid pursuing upgrades for loads — and paying customers — that ultimately don’t materialize. Texas SB6, enacted in 2025, seeks to protect residential and small business customers from subsidizing speculative large-load developments by increasing visibility into large-load proposals and requiring upfront financial commitments from developers.

States should also be wary of arguments that giving more power to IOUs will lower electricity prices. Measures to avoid include the practice known as “Construction Work in Progress,” which allows utilities to begin recovering construction costs of new energy generation facilities from ratepayers while they are still under construction. This exposes ratepayers to the risk of paying for new energy buildout with long timelines and no guarantee that the project will be completed. This was the case in Georgia, where ratepayers began paying for the Votgle Plant upgrade in 2010, which was $23 billion over budget and didn’t begin coming online until 2023, resulting in the biggest rate hikes in the state’s history. States where the utility industry is “deregulated,” that is, where utility companies are only allowed to own transmission and distribution infrastructure, should avoid “re-regulation,” because allowing utilities to own energy generation infrastructure in addition to transmission and distribution increases their monopoly power and results in poor outcomes for ratepayers.

Positioning For Long-Term Success: Plan for a Phased Energy Transition That Works for Everyone

The energy transition is necessary, inevitable, and underway. If done right, it will create cleaner air, a healthier climate, and lower bills for everyone. However, during the middle of this transition, with fossil and clean energy operating simultaneously, infrastructure and regulatory systems are not optimized for either system. Smart planning to guide the choices states make regarding energy technology, siting, and operations can address the near-term challenges and speed up the energy transition.

The following are some best practices that states can follow:

Accurately forecast energy demand to adequately plan for grid upgrades. By supporting utility companies and grid operators to more accurately forecast demand, states can help create the conditions for adequate generation buildout and grid upgrades, thus avoiding price shocks. States can pass laws that promote the forecasts’ robustness and accuracy by requiring use of multiple forecast timelines and scenarios; consideration of new technologies and policies that may affect demand (such as heat pumps, electric vehicles, and electrified buildings); and estimates for peak capacity. As the energy transition brings more distributed energy resources such as rooftop solar and battery storage online, states should ensure their energy demand forecasts account for how these new, flexible resources impact the electric grid.

Address stranded fossil energy assets. As the energy transition progresses, infrastructure and fuel from the fossil energy system is becoming more expensive or obsolete. This results in utility companies passing on to consumers associated higher operating costs and debt recovery.

For example, many coal plants are no longer economical to run, but utility companies are still using them because it’s easier to pass those costs to customers than replace the asset. New gas plants and gas distribution network upgrades are incurring upfront costs now that corporations will expect to recoup from ratepayers regardless of how much longer those systems remain operational, meaning whoever stays on gas (likely lower-income households that can’t electrify without financial assistance) will experience astronomical prices.

To address these problems, states need to implement a set of policies – ranging from future energy system planning to banning fossil fuel use altogether — to limit or prevent utility companies from building out fossil fuel assets. Several states have begun proceedings to plan for a phased, equitable transition off the natural gas system. And, once implemented, New York’s law requiring new buildings to be all-electric (that is, no oil or gas) will slow the buildout of the fossil gas distribution system. States should also help utility companies responsibly retire existing assets faster, such as by providing low-cost refinancing so they can more quickly pay off the remaining cost of the asset.

Unfortunately, many states are pursuing short-sighted policies that prolong existing — or even build new — fossil fuel infrastructure. These policies are often advanced by groups with ties to fossil fuel corporations, lean on outdated assumptions about the energy system, and ultimately will burden ratepayers with stranded asset costs. The same groups often work to block state progress on this issue. New York paused implementation of its all-electric buildings law in a deal to end litigation brought by industry groups, and the Trump Administration has issued stay-open orders for coal plants in four states, in a questionable use of its power to alleviate electric grid emergencies and at a high cost to ratepayers. States should push back against these challenges and continue to use their authority to halt fossil fuel buildout to avoid even higher future energy costs, to say nothing of the severe impacts to health, safety, and the climate. More than that, states can proactively advance racial, economic, and health justice through climate action.

“We are committed to protecting and preserving our natural resources — and the waterbodies on Cape Cod are some of Massachusetts’ finest,” said Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper. “Cape residents deserve clean and healthy water, and these grants are essential to addressing nitrogen pollution once and for all.”

The Natural Resource Nitrogen Sensitive Areas (NRNSA) Grant Program, administered by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP), helps communities develop plans to comprehensively address wastewater and other sources of nitrogen pollution. Excess nitrogen has been an ongoing problem in Cape Cod, where it has fueled the growth of nuisance plants, weeds, and algae that use up much of the oxygen in the water — harming water quality and forcing out indigenous fish and plant species.

“When people are on the Cape, they want to experience the fresh salt air and enjoy time on the water.” said MassDEP Commissioner Bonnie Heiple. “This funding is a critical step in reversing decades of nitrogen pollution and protecting what makes the Cape so special.”

State regulations allow Cape communities to choose a watershed-wide solution to mitigate nitrogen pollution by applying for a Watershed Permit. Alternatively, a Town may choose to address wastewater solutions, via Title 5, by using improved septic technologies for new construction in areas heavily impacted by nitrogen. MassDEP is supporting the work of towns that choose the comprehensive Watershed Permit solution by providing both technical and financial assistance.

The nine Cape Cod towns receiving NRNSA grants are:

Barnstable — $137,719

Brewster — $ 58,680

Statement of Support:

State Senator Julian Cyr (D-Truro):

""Nitrogen pollution remains one of the most urgent environmental and public health challenges facing Cape Cod, threatening our estuaries, shellfisheries, and the long-term vitality of our tourism-based economy. These grants will directly benefit towns in my district — Barnstable, Brewster, Dennis, Truro, Wellfleet, and Yarmouth — as they work to meet updated Title 5 requirements and advance smart solutions tailored to local conditions. I'm grateful to the Healey-Driscoll Administration and MassDEP for investing in practical, science-driven tools that help Cape communities protect water quality, comply with state standards, and safeguard the natural resources that define this special region.""

One early sign that things might not go so smoothly for the U.S. in its quest for Venezuelan oil was how American energy companies responded.

In a meeting between oil executives and President Trump this month at the White House, Darren Woods, head of Exxon Mobil, called Venezuela “uninvestable.” Another oil magnate and Trump ally, Harold Hamm, was more diplomatic, but not exactly enthusiastic. Venezuela has “its challenges,” Hamm said.

Trump has made it clear that he wants to move fast. At that meeting, which he called less than a week after U.S. troops captured the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, Trump told oil executives to “rapidly rebuild” the South American country’s oil industry.

Last week, exclusive reporting by my colleague Anatoly Kurmanaev found that the U.S. has already begun selling 50 million barrels of the Venezuelan oil that had previously been trapped by a partial U.S. blockade.

There are good reasons for the U.S. administration to prioritize speed, Anatoly told me. The Venezuelan economy was days from collapsing. Oil storage was near capacity. The currency was in free fall. Officials had to get that trapped oil out and dollars in as soon as possible.

“It was a race against time,” Anatoly said. “Trump has no interest in a collapsed Venezuela right now.”

In the longer term, Trump has bigger ambitions. He wants what he calls “energy dominance” — enough weight in the global oil market to curb the power of OPEC countries and gain leverage over China. Venezuela is part of that plan.

But in the weeks since the invasion, these longer-term ambitions to gain effective control of Venezuela’s oil industry have “run headlong into reality,” my colleague Anton Troianovski wrote last week.

Slow and expensive

One problem for Trump is that the U.S. doesn’t have a national oil company. Exxon, Chevron and the like are private corporations that will start projects only when they see a good business opportunity. When they look at Venezuela, they don’t like what they see.

The case for investing in Venezuelan oil isn’t straightforward. The country has a lot of oil, but gaining access to it and turning it into a profitable business would take a lot of time and upfront investment, as my colleague Peter Coy writes. That’s the kind of thing that U.S. oil companies, which have recently sought to economize on investments and cut risk, don’t like.

Low oil prices mean the incentive to invest is limited. “Many analysts believe that a vast oversupply of oil is already sloshing around global markets,” Anton wrote.

Another problem: The U.S. may have removed Maduro, and achieved seeming compliance from his successor, for now, but it’s far from clear that it has achieved long-term political stability in Venezuela. A history of political turmoil, which led to the assets of U.S. oil companies being nationalized in the first place, is part of why executives view the country as “uninvestable” today.

And, as some of my colleagues have been reporting, there are signs that cracks have already begun appearing.

‘Zero oil’

For all the discontent many Venezuelans feel toward their government, oil has been an integral part of the country’s opposition to the U.S.

“For the last three decades, they have been fed an ideology of ‘Chavismo,’ with its goal of harnessing oil wealth to transform the country, empower the poor and stand up to the United States and its imperial ambitions,” writes my colleague Maria Abi-Habib.

And so some Venezuelans find it hard to swallow their new status as a country willing to cooperate — and share oil wealth — with the Americans who just invaded them.

“At this point, we should have cut off the oil, we shouldn’t have sold any oil to the United States. Zero oil, zero oil!” one Venezuelan told Maria.

It’s not clear how long the new government will manage to stave off these forces in order to continue cooperation with the United States. Even if it does, other ingredients for instability abound: The country remains filled with paramilitary groups, Colombian guerrillas and gangs.

It’s not the kind of environment that looks tempting to an oil executive watching from Texas. But Trump is also willing to strong-arm them into submission. “I’ll probably be inclined to keep Exxon out,” the president told reporters after the White House meeting. “I didn’t like their response.” Exxon’s stock slipped in the aftermath, though it has since recovered.

It has overtaken nickel-based packs to become the dominant battery chemistry in the world.

China spearheaded this growth, followed by Europe and some Asian countries.

The rollout of low-cost lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) batteries surpassed deployments of traditional nickel-based chemistries in electric vehicles in 2025 for the very first time, EV Magazine reported, citing data from the research firm RhoMotion. That marks a significant shift for the global battery industry, and its yet another sign of China's continued dominance here.

For years, automakers leaned heavily on nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) batteries, largely because they benefited from a mature supply chain and higher energy density that delivered desirable driving range on EVs. (Most U.S.-market EVs use NMC batteries.)

But those advantages have come at a cost. Nickel- and cobalt-heavy batteries are expensive to mine, they’re environmentally intensive and remain tied to controversial supply chains that involve labor and human rights violations, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Ford LFP battery cells

As a result, battery makers have been accelerating their shift toward nickel-free chemistries such as LFP.

Chinese automakers and battery companies have been leading that shift, thanks to LFP’s lower costs, reduced dependence on troubled materials and a narrowing energy-density gap with NMC batteries.

By last year, LFP batteries accounted for more than half of global EV battery deployments, RhoMotion said. NMC batteries still retain an edge on energy density, but automakers have found ways to offset that disadvantage. Cell-to-pack and cell-to-chassis designs allow more cells to be squeezed into similar spaces. Optimized anode and cathode materials are helping close that performance gap even further.

And China is absolutely crushing it when it comes to LFP adoption. Between January and November last year, more than 80% of EVs sold in the country were equipped with LFP batteries. And that dominance is also spilling overseas.

BYD Seagull (China Spec)

Europe and Asia (excluding China) accounted for roughly 75% of last year’s global LFP growth, driven largely by a surge of Chinese EVs entering overseas markets. In Europe, Chinese automakers accounted for a record 12.8% of the EV market in November, more than doubling their share from a year earlier, Bloomberg reported, citing numbers from Dataforce. BYD, Leapmotor and Chery all posted strong growth across the region in 2025. China's CATL is by far the leading company in the LFP market, and last year, about one-third of all EVs sold had CATL battery cells. You do the math.

Chinese battery giants are pushing aggressively into local LFP production in Europe, both to reduce their exposure to tariffs and also to stay close to automakers. Both BYD and CATL are building battery factories in Hungary. CATL already operates a plant in Germany and has another one planned in Spain in partnership with Stellantis.

North America was the only region to see LFP deployments decline in 2025. The U.S. has effectively blocked China-made batteries from entering the country through tariffs and strict sourcing rules under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, leaving only a handful of LFP-equipped EVs on the U.S. market.

Tesla briefly offered LFP batteries on the base Model 3 in the U.S., but discontinued that trim in 2024 due to tariffs. Rivian and Ford still use LFP packs on base versions of the R1S, R1T and Mustang Mach-E. However, LFP is expected to undergo somewhat of a resurgence in the U.S. thanks to more affordable EVs like the new Chevrolet Bolt and Ford’s upcoming $30,000 electric truck.

LFP is still poised to grow in the U.S., but the path will look different from what’s happening in Europe and China. Much of that momentum is expected to come from domestic production of battery energy storage systems (BESS), rather than passenger EVs alone.

After the end of the $7,500 federal tax credit, several battery makers in the U.S., including LG Energy Solution, Tesla and SK On, adjusted their battery manufacturing capacity for the ESS market, which is growing much faster than EVs.

Last year, Detroiters received hundreds of millions in tax credits through the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit

Increase to Michigan EITC means more money for residents this year

All the information needed is available at getthetaxfacts.org

Today, Mayor Mary Sheffield joined with a coalition of community partners to announce a campaign to help all Detroiters access every dollar of federal and state tax credits they are eligible for by scheduling an appointment for best-in-the-nation, no-cost tax preparation. Through last year’s coordinated outreach in the City of Detroit, thousands of Detroit families were able to take advantage of the Earned Income and Child Tax Credit, bringing millions into their homes. This year, even more money is available in state credits thanks to 2023 legislation that increased the Michigan EITC five-fold.

Mayor Sheffield was joined by United Way for Southeastern Michigan, Accounting Aid Society, and Wayne Metropolitan Community Action Agency as they kicked off the 2026 income tax season today and outlined efforts to urge residents to claim their credits.

“My administration is intensely focused on getting more Detroit families and children out of poverty and making sure they receive the valuable tax credits is a very easy way to do that,” said Mayor Mary Sheffield. “Through our partners, we have volunteers ready to help residents claim and receive the tax returns they are entitled to, so they can have the money they need to support their families.”

All residents with income less than $69,000 qualify for an expert tax preparation appointment at no cost to them. Last year the coalition partners filed more than 26,000 tax returns in the region. Audits by the IRS find they achieve better than a 98% accuracy rate, making them a leader in the nation. An IRS study of paid tax preparers found they achieve a 40% accuracy rate, meaning that Detroit’s coalition of no-cost tax preparers are far more accurate and their returns are at far less risk of penalties or audit.

As a result of the coalition’s work in 2024, Detroiters claimed more than $450 million in EITC refunds for tax year 2023, plus many millions more in Child Tax Credits. Prior to 2017, EITC-eligible Detroiters left an estimated $80 million of potential tax refunds unclaimed each year.

There are several cash payments available to low-income, working Detroit families, including the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, but you’ve got to file your taxes to claim these credits. Even if you don’t typically file your taxes or didn’t earn much in 2024, you may qualify for these payments.

Eligible Detroiters to receive text message reminders

The City of Detroit and its no-cost tax prep partners are using nation-leading strategies to communicate with low-income families who may be eligible for large tax refunds. This includes evidence-based text messages delivered in partnership with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS). Analysis by the United Way of Southeastern Michigan finds that on days when text messages go out, use of its online tax prep appointment scheduling tool triples and online bookings jump by 2.25 times. Today MDHHS partnered with the City of Detroit to send a text message about the availability of no-cost, highly accurate tax prep services to over 70,000 Detroit households on food aid.

“Too often, people miss out on tax refunds simply because they can’t afford professional tax prep help,” said Elizabeth Hertel, Michigan Department of Health and Human Services director. “This free service offered by the United Way of Southeastern Michigan and the city of Detroit will help put money back into the pockets of those who need it most. MDHHS is helping to ensure eligible families in Detroit are aware of this opportunity available to them at no cost.”

Starting today, residents can call 2-1-1 or visit getthetaxfacts.org to learn more and schedule an appointment.

EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT – Who is eligible?

For more than 50 years, the Earned Income Tax credit has been providing much-needed extra cash to hard-working families. The EITC is available to working families and individuals who meet certain income requirements. There are actually two EITC credits – a main credit when you file your federal tax return, and an additional credit when you file your state of Michigan tax return. This year is the third year of new state legislation in which the Michigan credit is worth 5 times what it used to be. That means more money in Detroiters’ pockets.

If you worked at all in 2025, you may be eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit. The Earned Income Tax Credit provides extra income to workers with low to moderate incomes, up to $69,000. The amount of the refund depends on income, filing status, and number of qualifying children claimed on tax returns. For example, a single individual with no children who works and makes less than $19,104 could get back as much as $844. A married couple with three or more children who files a joint return, with a combined income of less than $68,675 could receive the maximum EITC of $10,460 between the federal and state credits. Adults and children must have a Social Security Number to claim the EITC.

MICHIGAN EITC – 5X INCREASE

The Michigan EITC uses the same eligibility criteria as the federal EITC. The amount of the Michigan credit is calculated as a percentage of the amount the family or individual receives from the federal EITC. Previously, the Michigan EITC was calculated as 6% of the federal EITC. For example, if a family qualified for a $3000 federal EITC refund, they received an additional $180 ($3000 x 6%) from the state of Michigan when filing their state taxes.

Under the new law, now in its third year of implementation, the Michigan credit was increased to 30% of the federal credit. In the same example, a family qualifying for a $3000 federal EITC refund will now receive an additional $900 ($3000 x 30%) from the state of Michigan.

CHILD TAX CREDIT – Who is eligible?

The Child Tax Credit provides $1700-2200 per child for qualifying families.

Children under age 17 living in your home.

If you are the child’s primary caregiver, you are likely eligible. You don’t need to be the child’s biological parent to qualify.

You earned at least $2500 from working in 2025.

You (or your spouse, if filing jointly) and the child(ren) must have a valid Social Security Number to claim the Child Tax Credit.

EXPERT TAX PREP AVAILABLE AT NO COST:

All residents with income less than $69,000 qualify for an expert tax preparation appointment at no cost to them. For the 2026 tax season, Accounting Aid Society and Wayne Metro will offer primarily in-person tax prep services. Drop-and-go and all-virtual appointments will also still be available.

""The Earned Income Tax Credit remains one of the most powerful tools for helping families build financial stability, and with Michigan’s 30% state match, it continues to create meaningful opportunities for working households,” said Priscilla Perkins, President and CEO of Accounting Aid Society. “As we enter the 2026 tax season, we are grateful for the continued partnership and support of the Mayor’s Office as we work together to provide no-cost tax preparation services and ensure every eligible family receives the credits they have earned. Together, we are strengthening Detroit - one family at a time.""

A communitywide coalition of partners last year helped Detroiters receive more than $450 million in earned income tax credits alone. Detroiter Tiffany Thomas (far right) used her Child Care Tax Credit checks over the years to help put her son through school.

SPREADING THE WORD:

This coalition is working to spread the word to those who are at the greatest risk of missing out, such as first-time parents who may not know they are eligible, non-traditional families where the biological parents are not the primary caregivers, families that don’t make much money and don’t normally file taxes, and families with limited English, limited education, and limited connections to social services.

We are working with community-based organizations to meet families where they are with in-person outreach at community events, flyers at community locations, direct outreach to neighborhood residents, and more. These efforts receive additional funding and support through the generosity of funding partners including Kresge Foundation, Ballmer Group, and Comerica.

The most important thing to know is that most Detroiters are eligible for expert tax preparation at no-cost, thanks to the help of hundreds of staff and volunteers from Accounting Aid Society and Wayne Metro. These IRS-certified non-profit partners specialize in helping low- and moderate-income individuals claim the credits they are entitled to. They have a higher accuracy rate than most for-profit tax filing companies.

“Too many Wayne County households miss out on tax refunds simply because they don't know they qualify or they don't have access to trusted tax preparation services,” said Louis D. Piszker, Chief Executive Officer of Wayne Metropolitan Community Action Agency. “Wayne Metro’s free certified tax services help remove those barriers and ensure that residents receive the full tax credits they’ve earned, putting real dollars back into the family budget.”

Through its extensive network of community resources, United Way will again lead this coalition - making sure Detroiters are connected to the help they need.

“At a time when families are feeling the pressure of rising costs and reduced federal supports, the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit are more important than ever,” said Darienne Hudson, president and CEO of United Way for Southeastern Michigan. “These credits provide real relief—helping families afford basic necessities, catch up on overdue bills, and regain financial stability while building a pathway to economic mobility. Alongside our partners at the City of Detroit, Accounting Aid Society, Wayne Metro, and others, we’re committed to ensuring every eligible household can access the full refund they deserve.”",https://detroitmi.gov/themes/custom/detroitminew/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-20 16:00:41.260252

The West Concord, Massachusetts-based circular economy company said the capital will support expanding operations and deploying additional wasted-food solutions, with a particular focus on completing Integrated Diversion & Energy Facilities in Longview, Washington and Lexington, North Carolina, which are expected to begin operating later this year. Divert converts unsold, non-donatable food into beneficial outputs using anaerobic digestion, producing carbon-negative renewable energy as well as soil amendment and nitrogen-rich fertilizer, while also helping customers comply with organic waste mandates and reduce costs through improved purchasing and merchandising.

Divert highlighted its existing facility in Turlock, California, which it said can process 100,000 tons of unsold food annually, as an example of the infrastructure model it is replicating in new markets. The company framed the expansion against the broader scale of the problem, citing nearly 74 million tons of surplus food generated in the U.S. in 2023 and noting that more than 46% of food is wasted each year in Canada.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – JANUARY 20, 2026 — Today, Congresswoman Summer L. Lee (PA-12) alongside Representatives Ro Khanna (CA-17), Mark Takano (CA-39), and Jill Tokuda (HI-02), reintroduced the Stop Wall Street Landlords Act, legislation aimed at ending large institutional investors’ ability to use taxpayer dollars to subsidize the acquisition of single-family homes and drive up housing costs for working families.

Since the 2008 housing crash and subsequent foreclosure crisis, increased investor activity in America’s housing market has normalized excessive fees and abusive practices while artificially driving up housing and rent prices. In Pennsylvania and across the country—particularly in states like California, Nevada, Florida, and Georgia where corporate landlords own large concentrations(link is external) of single-family rental homes—investors are driving up rents and pricing families out of stable housing and homeownership opportunities.

“Here in Pittsburgh and across Western Pennsylvania, I’ve seen too many families living in homes owned by some distant investor who treats them like a paycheck instead of people,” said Rep. Summer Lee. “Investors are buying up single-family homes and affordable buildings and squeezing our communities, leaving families to live in conditions no one should ever have to endure. This is the result of a system that subsidizes corporate landlords while everyday people struggle to find a safe, stable place to call home. The Stop Wall Street Landlords Act is about stopping that exploitation, so homes belong to the people who live in them, not wealthy investors driving up costs and pushing families out of their own neighborhoods.”

“Homes should be owned by people, not wealthy corporate landlords who are buying up single-family homes and pushing the dream of homeownership out of reach for too many Americans,” said Rep. Ro Khanna. “I’m proud to lead this effort to put affordable housing for families first. If President Trump is serious about taking on Wall Street landlords, Congress should pass my bill and he should sign it into law.”

Big investors have spent years driving up housing costs,” said Rep. Mark Takano. “I’ve heard from countless constituents who feel the dream of homeownership is now permanently out of reach. I’m proud to co-lead this bill with Reps. Khanna, Lee, and Tokuda to put people over profits and keep corporations out of the single-family housing market while ensuring those creating affordable housing can continue their work.”

“In Hawaiʻi, too many hardworking families are getting priced out of paradise,” said Rep. Jill Tokuda. “They're barely staying afloat working numerous jobs and living in multigenerational homes, but still can’t afford to stay in the communities they grew up in, while Wall Street investors and billionaires buy houses and land they’ll never live in. That's why I’m proud to co-lead the Stop Wall Street Landlords Act with Representatives Khanna, Takano, and Lee because housing should work for people, not corporate profits. This bill takes real steps to keep large investors out of our neighborhoods and make homeownership more affordable so families can stay, put down roots, and thrive.”

“Corporate landlords have priced out an entire generation,"" said Rep. Maxwell Frost. ""The Stop Wall Street Landlords Act is a real step toward restoring fairness in our housing market and making sure families, not Wall Street, shape our communities.”

“For far too long, the American dream has been confined to wishful thinking for millions of hard-working people,” said Watson Coleman. “No one trying to build a life for themselves and their families should suffer from housing instability while corporations monopolize the market. Democrats have been hard at work fighting for solutions to solve the affordability crisis. It’s time for Republicans to step up and work with us to pass this legislation.”

“As people in my district and around the country already know, the rent is too damn high,” said Congressman Jesús “Chuy” García. “Renters are already facing the destabilizing effects of algorithmic pricing schemes, gentrification, and now, here come the Wall Street companies scooping up all the housing stock to jack prices up even higher. I’m proud to co-sponsor the Stop Wall Street Landlords Act because the U.S. government should not subsidize Wall Street landlords, and because we need to invest in affordable housing for those who need it most.”

Specifically, the Stop Wall Street Landlords Act will:

End large institutional investors’ ability to benefit from tax breaks reserved for homeowners – namely mortgage interest, insurance, and depreciation deductions.

Direct the Federal Housing Financial Agency (FHFA) and related agencies Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae to (a) prohibit large institutional investors from purchasing mortgages on single-family residential (SFR) homes – or any interest in such a mortgage – and (b) from newly lending on a security or securitizing any SFR mortgage under which the mortgagee meets the bill definition of a specified large investor.

Legislate a federal real estate transfer tax of 100% of the sale value of each SFR in the possession of a specified large investor if SFRs are not sold within 18 months of bill enactment.

Promote the use of transfer tax revenue and deduction tax savings to fund the Housing Trust Fund, which enables affordable housing construction and preservation.

The bill makes exceptions for mom-and-pop landlords, housing providers that participate in federal affordable housing programs, nonprofits and developers committed to building and supplying affordable single-family homes to owner occupiers in the American housing market.

Cosponsors: Representatives Summer Lee, Mark Takano, Jill Tokuda, Maxwell Frost, Bonnie Watson Coleman, Jonathan L. Jackson, Chris Deluzio, Jesús “Chuy” García, Rashida Tlaib, Lateefah Simon, Robin Kelly, Shri Thanedar.

WASHINGTON — U.S. Representative Greg Steube (R Fla.) introduced today the Worldwide Animal Testing Compliance and Harmonization Act or WATCH Act. This bill would prohibit federal funding for foreign laboratories found to be in violation of animal welfare protections.

“Torturing animals in the name of science is both morally wrong and wholly unnecessary,” said Rep. Steube. “The fact that the United States continues to fund foreign laboratories that engage in animal cruelty is indefensible—especially considering the NIH has set clear guidelines for domestic laboratories to follow. Any scientific research involving animals demands proper care and a humane environment for God’s creatures. That is why I am introducing the bipartisan WATCH Act to bar the NIH from funding studies in foreign countries that fail to protect the welfare of innocent animals.”

“American taxpayer dollars should never fund inhumane animal testing in unregulated laboratories around the world,” said Rep. Susie Lee. “This bipartisan bill requires foreign laboratories to meet the same animal welfare standards American-based labs must follow, ensuring animals are treated humanely and strengthening the integrity of U.S.-funded research.”

This bill serves as the House companion to legislation introduced by Senators Eric Schmitt (R-Mo.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.).

“Despite what Communist China may say, it has become clear that the COVID pandemic was the result of risky animal experiments by an unregulated lab in Wuhan that received U.S. taxpayer dollars,” said Senator Schmitt. “Outsourcing animal testing and research to foreign laboratories that do not comply with U.S. standards is dangerous, inhumane, and puts America, and the world, at risk. This bipartisan WATCH Act puts in place strong guardrails to ensure humane and safe research by requiring that foreign NIH-funded studies are subject to the same standards and animal welfare requirements as studies in the U.S.”

“American taxpayers shouldn’t fund animal cruelty, and the WATCH Act puts in place common-sense guardrails to ensure federal funds only go to organizations upholding strong animal welfare standards,” said Senator Jeff Merkley. “Our bipartisan bill is an important step forward to make sure NIH-funded studies meet consistent and enforceable animal welfare protections, regardless of where they are conducted.”

With this grant funding, the Port of Cleveland will implement the next phase of the Electrification and Net Zero Emissions Master Plan by deploying electric cargo handling equipment (including scrapping a portion of the existing diesel fleet), zero-emission vessels, and associated charging infrastructure and battery energy storage systems. Infrastructure for vessel shore power is included as well. The project also includes community outreach activities and workforce development through increased equipment and infrastructure maintenance jobs.

Ports are vital to the U.S. economy and are responsible for moving goods and people throughout the country. At the same time, the port and freight equipment responsible for moving goods including trucks, locomotives, marine vessels, and cargo-handling equipment contribute to significant levels of diesel air pollution at and near port facilities. This pollution is especially harmful to nearby communities’ health and contributes to climate change. These funds will improve air quality at the Port of Cleveland by installing clean, zero-emission freight and ferry technologies along with associated infrastructure.

The Port of Cleveland is one of the largest ports on the Great Lakes. Over 23,000 jobs are tied to the roughly 13 million tons of cargo that move through Cleveland Harbor each year. The Port of Cleveland is the only local government agency whose sole mission is to spur job creation and economic vitality in Cuyahoga County. The Port is an economic engine for our community, a key to Northeast Ohio’s global competitiveness, and a crucial partner in building Cuyahoga County’s future.

The funding for this project is anticipated to replace thirteen pieces of cargo handling equipment, two older generation diesel tugboats, add EV charging equipment and a new Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) with complimentary solar and shore power.

In conjunction with the development of the Master Plan, the Port has invested over $93.8M in infrastructure since 2015, with 75%+ of the cost covered by state and federal grants. Grant funds have supported various projects aimed at modernization, sustainability, and infrastructure development, which align with the broader program goals of reducing Port emissions and transitioning to ZE operations. Several recent coordination efforts are as follows:

The Port has secured $32M+ in federal and state grants for the rehabilitation and modernization of a key warehouse and electrical infrastructure upgrade at its General Cargo Terminal. This project included the development of the Master Plan, which developed the roadmap and project planning for the elements of this application. The grants for this project include $27.2M from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Maritime Administration (MARAD)’s PIDP and $4.9M from the Ohio DOT’s MAP.

In 2021, the Port completed improvements at its main gate to improve the security clearance process and truck turn time via U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Earmark OH302.

In collaboration with the Port, Omnitrax, the provider of switching rail services at the terminal, will deploy a fully Battery Electric (BE) locomotive later this year using Ohio EPA Diesel Mitigation Trust Fund funding. The new locomotive will reduce fuel consumption by 50% and Particulate Matter (PM) pollution by 77%.

In 2020, the Port received a grant from the U.S. DOT Maritime Administration (MARAD) to rehabilitate and improve two cargo docks at the Port on Lake Erie. This project helped improve the efficiency of port operations.

The Port has received two Diesel Emissions Reduction Act (DERA) grants to date, one in 2021 to replace tugboats and one in 2017 to replace a loader at the Port’s Cleveland Bulk Terminal. These grants amount to just under $1M.

During the Port’s Strategic Plan development, the Port conducted interviews with over 40 local stakeholder organizations, with specific questions regarding the Port’s community, social, and environmental impacts, as well as its communication regarding issues or concerns. Several themes arose from responses, including the need for additional equipment, namely another crane and reach stacker, concerns over the cost and reliability of electrified equipment, the desire for shore power infrastructure, and the pressure to reduce emissions to aid in companies’ Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) and Climate Action goals. The Project is expected to address all these themes.

To ensure the voices of all County residents are incorporated within the Project design, the Port has conducted engagement that has consisted of a public board meeting, as well as the distribution of a Project fact sheet through Port newsletters and social media. Additional community engagement will occur throughout Project delivery that will entail regular community updates and opportunities to provide feedback.",https://www.portofcleveland.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/favicon-16x16-1.png,N,,2026-01-20 17:59:57.802271

This review examines recent technological, regulatory, and market-driven developments in corn- and sugarcane-based ethanol production, with emphasis on advances realised between 2023 and 2025.

In corn ethanol systems, enzyme-enabled process enhancements have improved starch and fibre conversion efficiency, increasing ethanol yields without additional land use while simultaneously strengthening coproduct markets such as distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) and biochar. Parallel progress in carbon capture and storage has enabled ethanol producers to enter voluntary carbon markets, reducing lifecycle carbon intensity and improving economic resilience.

In sugarcane ethanol, the integration of second-generation (2G) pathways using agricultural residues has expanded operational windows and improved overall resource efficiency, while advances in genetic improvement techniques have accelerated yield gains and climate adaptability.

These technological developments have been reinforced by evolving blending mandates and renewable fuel policies in major markets, including Brazil, the European Union, and emerging aviation and marine fuel sectors.

Collectively, these changes explain the surge in investment and capacity expansion observed globally and signal a transition of ethanol from a compliance fuel towards a strategically optimised, low-carbon energy carrier. Understanding these converging drivers is essential for guiding future research, industrial deployment, and policy design in biofuel systems.

Introduction

The transport industry produces significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, such as CO₂ and methane.

These gases absorb and re-emit infrared radiation, trapping heat in the atmosphere and contributing to global warming and climate change. As a result, renewable and environmentally sustainable fuels are increasingly important.

Ethanol, derived from corn and sugarcane, is already widely used and, in some cases, mandated in the global fuel industry.

Corn and sugarcane are used to produce ethanol because they are rich in fermentable carbohydrates and have well-established production methods.

A factor limiting sugarcane’s global spread is the climate required for cultivation.

Recent advances in biofuel technology include improved enzymes, higher-yield crops and processes that use crop residues to boost yields.

These developments, alongside renewable energy and carbon-reduction efforts, are strengthening collaboration in the sector.

Despite these developments, there remains a need to examine and consolidate the latest progress in biofuel technologies, particularly over the past three years.

Therefore, this review highlights the major technological and sustainability-driven innovations in ethanol during this period. Understanding these advances is essential for future research, global sustainability, and industrial optimisation in the sector.

Advances in corn-based ethanol

2.1. Enzyme and process enhancement

Over the past three years, significant effort has been directed towards developing techniques to improve yield without expanding land use.

Enzyme technology is a key solution: specific enzymes are now applied directly to the crop or during processing, boosting DDGS (distillers’ dried grains) and ethanol production by facilitating more efficient breakdown of plant material, as shown in Table 1.

This technology is estimated to increase overall ethanol production by 10% [2]. Crucially, these enzymes require only a financial investment, as no additional machinery or space is needed to realise these gains.

2.2. Co-product valorisation

With the rise in biochar production, used in carbon removal technologies, the supply chain was unable to keep pace.

This necessitated expanded intake to support higher production. The expansion focused on residues produced by ethanol plants, which began selling these materials.

Even with ethanol production “waste” being used in biochar production, by 2024 approximately 62% of supply had already been sold, with 28% presold for 2026. This raised prices and generated additional revenue for ethanol producers.

Not only has biochar increased in price, but DDGS has risen as well and is expected to grow by 7.3% from 2025 to 2030, as shown in Figure 1.

This increase in value can be attributed to several factors: governments have begun requiring and encouraging the use of DDGS in livestock nutrition through subsidies and awareness campaigns.

Another factor is price, which is estimated to be 10–15% lower than soybeans, another widely used livestock meal.

To meet this demand, industries have begun investing in machinery upgrades, such as fractionation systems that remove fibre and increase digestibility, now being installed in distilleries [3].

2.3. Carbon intensity reduction

One method for distilleries to offset their environmental footprint is through government carbon credits.

These credits were once considered unattainable due to gas emissions. However, in 2024, the first ethanol plant voluntarily entered carbon markets [4]. Red Trail Energy laid the groundwork for future facilities.

In corn ethanol production, yeast ferments corn starch, producing ethanol, solids, and a high-purity carbon dioxide (CO₂) stream as by-products. The CO₂ that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere is captured.

Exhaust gas from fermentation vessels is directed to a capture facility, where it is purified, compressed into liquid form, and dehydrated to remove impurities.

The liquefied CO₂ is then transported through a flowline to an onsite injection well and injected into the Broom Creek Formation, a secure sandstone layer approximately 6,500 feet below the facility, where it is intended to be permanently stored [5,6].

Advances in sugarcane-based ethanol

3.1. 2G sugarcane

The integration of 2G production facilities with existing 1G mills involves using sugarcane residues, including leaves, bagasse, vinasse, and filter cake [7]. These residues are not fully utilised in 1G processes [8].

Including sugarcane bagasse also reduces the need for additional cultivation areas.

First-generation production occurs for only about nine to ten months per year. Including second-generation residues enables ethanol plants to operate year-round, thereby improving efficiency.

Investments in Brazil are also closely monitoring research into generating electrical energy from bagasse, as shown in Table 3 [9]. This could be essential for reducing future plant costs.

3.2. Genetic improvements

Genetically modified sugarcane traits aim to boost yield, pest resistance, and adaptability to new climates.

Methods such as CRISPR-based breeding and marker-assisted selection help improve traits while minimising unintended outcomes [10]. Classical breeding can take 15 to 17 years [11] and requires large quantities of plant material, much of which is wasted due to genetic or breeding failures.

With modern techniques, researchers can directly modify the genetic code of the plant, reducing the time required to achieve desired sugarcane traits.

Emerging trends and market effects - Laws mandating increased ethanol consumption

More countries, economic groups, and states are opening their energy systems to biofuels. Brazil has approved a law increasing ethanol content in petrol from 27.5% to 35% [12].

Biodiesel is rising from 15% to 25%. The most significant change is in aviation, with a 1% blend starting in 2027, rising to 10% in 2037 and increasing by 1% annually thereafter.

In Europe, the EU is finalising its ethanol blending policies, with a 2030 target of 5.5% renewable fuel [13].

In the US, there is no mandatory ethanol percentage, although financial regulations such as waivers influence consumer behaviour [14]. The transition from E10 to E15, along with expanded availability, further demonstrates growing demand.

Future demand for water and air

Biofuels are commonly used in land transport but less frequently in aviation and maritime sectors. This is beginning to change.

Cargo ships have started blending biodiesel onboard [16], improving fuel properties and usability. Ethanol’s higher solubility in water presents additional handling considerations.

MIT researchers are also developing aviation fuel from biomass [17], creating another pathway for broader biofuel adoption.

Beyond regulatory drivers, expanding use in maritime and aviation introduces challenges related to fuel handling, moisture control, and emissions. Ethanol-based fuels are more hygroscopic than petroleum fuels, requiring improved storage and monitoring systems.

Integrated fuel management strategies, including controlled blending, adaptive combustion tuning, and real-time quality monitoring, will support safe and efficient use. These developments indicate that future biofuel deployment depends not only on chemistry, but also on infrastructure and operational co-evolution.

Market reaction

Biofuel companies are actively positioning themselves for future growth. INPASA, Latin America’s largest biorefinery company, currently produces up to 5.6 billion litres of ethanol annually [19].

It owns the world’s largest biorefinery and plans further expansion, investing nearly one billion dollars into facility upgrades [20].

Their actions demonstrate confidence in the sector’s future. Financial markets increasingly factor carbon intensity and regulatory alignment into investment decisions. ~

Producers demonstrating emissions reductions and coproduct integration are better positioned for favourable financing.

The market is shifting towards scale and integration, with larger facilities benefiting from economies of scale and improved logistics.

As consolidation continues, standardisation and transparency are expected to increase. These trends confirm that biofuels are transitioning from a niche option to a mature component of global energy systems.

Conclusion

Between 2023 and 2025, the corn- and sugarcane-based ethanol sector has made clear progress through increased production, stronger coproduct markets, and supportive policies. Enzyme technologies have boosted ethanol output by approximately 10%.

Biochar accounted for 62% of 2024 supply, with 28% already sold for 2026. DDGS prices remain 10–15% lower than soybean prices and are expected to rise by 7.3% between 2025 and 2030.

For sugarcane ethanol, second-generation processes now enable year-round operation. Policy changes, including Brazil’s ethanol blend increase and the EU’s renewable fuel targets, demonstrate rising adoption.

These developments show that the sector is becoming more efficient, environmentally responsible, and economically competitive. Researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders can use these insights to further accelerate progress towards low-carbon transport. These factors collectively explain the growth in investment observed in the biofuel sector over the past three years.

,EVs,2026-01-20 20:03:23+00:00,Times Herald Online,California hits milestone in electric vehicle sales - Timesheraldonline.com,Paul Rogers,,,,,https://www.timesheraldonline.com/2026/01/20/california-hits-milestone-in-electric-vehicle-sales/,"For the past two decades, California has led the nation in electric vehicle sales.
“We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating the California electric vehicle mandate once and for all,” Trump said.
Trump tried to curb California’s electric vehicle rules and allow new offshore oil drilling in his first term from 2017 to 2021.
Two weeks ago, when he released his proposed state budget, Newsom included $200 million for a new electric vehicle rebate program.
“California isn’t slowing down, we’re still leading the pack,” said California Air Resources Board Chair Lauren Sanchez.","In 2012, when there were about 30,000 electric vehicles on the road in California, Tesla was a small new company that mostly appealed to hobbyists, and the Toyota Prius was still a rarely seen novelty in many areas, former Gov. Jerry Brown signed an executive order setting an audacious goal: 1.5 million EVs sold statewide by 2025.

There were lots of skeptics, given that Brown was calling for a 50-fold increase in the status quo. But as it turned out, California achieved it easily.

With the final sales numbers tallied for 2025, more than 2.5 million electric vehicles have been sold in California since 2012, according to data released Tuesday by the California Energy Commission.

“We invested in this future when others said it was impossible,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement.

Newsom highlighted the number — 2,551,121, to be exact — during his appearance Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

For the past two decades, California has led the nation in electric vehicle sales. The state has provided rebates, tax credits and other incentives as part of its efforts to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases.

As technology has improved, allowing much farther battery range — with many models able to travel more than 300 miles when fully charged — EV sales now make up 22.9% of all new car sales in California. Santa Clara County has the highest rate in the state, with 41.1% of all new vehicles sold being electric in 2025.

But electric vehicles face major headwinds. During the past year, President Trump has reversed or blocked many of the federal incentives put in place by former President Biden.

This past year, Trump and Republicans in Congress eliminated the federal tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of new electric vehicles. They let a law expire that allowed states to permit solo EV drivers to drive in carpool lanes on federally funded highways, ending that perk nationwide.

And in June, Trump signed a resolution blocking California’s first-in-the-nation regulations to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered passenger vehicles by 2035, which Newsom had put in place three years earlier.

Trump held a White House ceremony June 12, saying California’s rules limited consumer choice. He revoked federal permission for the ban, called a “waiver,” that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had given to California the previous year when President Biden was in office.

“We officially rescue the U.S. auto industry from destruction by terminating the California electric vehicle mandate once and for all,” Trump said. “They said it couldn’t be done. It’s had us tied in knots for years. They passed these crazy rules.”

Republicans said California’s rules were overly broad and would effectively set a national standard because the state is the largest car market in the United States and, under the Clean Air Act, other states are allowed to copy its rules.

Environmental groups and Democratic leaders said Trump’s rollbacks will lead to more air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and health problems for Californian residents.

Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a lawsuit over the issue minutes after Trump acted. California was joined by 10 other states — Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. The lawsuit is pending.

During the fourth quarter of 2025, Californians bought 79,066 new EVs, representing 18.9% of new-car sales. That was a big drop from the third quarter, when EVs accounted for 29.1% of new car sales statewide. Experts and industry analysts noted the surge in EV sales in the weeks before Sept. 30, when the federal tax credits expired.

Even though two of the top three highest-selling vehicles of any kind in California last year were the Telsa Model Y and the Model 3, the other being the Toyota Camry, Tesla has seen some softening of sales in California. Some residents of the blue state, angry that Tesla CEO Elon Musk contributed $250 million to Trump’s re-election campaign and led an effort called DOGE to reduce federal staffing through firings and early retirements, have resisted buying Teslas, put stickers on them denouncing Musk, or purchased other EVs, like Hyundais, Hondas or Rivians instead.

Trump marked his first year anniversary of taking office Tuesday for his second term. The fight over electric vehicle rules stands as one of the major environmental clashes between his administration and California, alongside Trump’s proposal to allow new offshore oil drilling along the state’s coastline.

Trump tried to curb California’s electric vehicle rules and allow new offshore oil drilling in his first term from 2017 to 2021. But California sued in both cases; the lawsuits were pending when Biden took office, and Biden reversed Trump’s positions.

On Tuesday, Newsom, who is considering a run for president in 2028, cast Trump’s resistance to electric vehicles as putting the United States at a competitive disadvantage in a world where Europe, Japan, Canada, China, and other countries have passed similar laws to encourage the sale of electric vehicles, reduce oil consumption and phase out the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035 or 2040.

“While Washington now cedes the global clean vehicle market to China, California is ensuring American workers and manufacturers can compete and win in the industries that will define this century,” Newsom said Tuesday.

Two weeks ago, when he released his proposed state budget, Newsom included $200 million for a new electric vehicle rebate program. The plan still needs approval from state lawmakers. Details, including how much motorists will get, which cars are eligible and what income limits may apply, have not yet been drawn up.

But for the majority, the new rules represent a welcome change, promising both environmental benefits and significant savings.
As the nation continues its drive toward sustainability, these changes may well prove to be a turning point, making electric motoring more accessible and affordable for millions.","England’s drive toward a greener future just got a significant boost, as new regulations making it easier—and much cheaper—for homeowners to install electric vehicle (EV) chargers have come into force. These changes, introduced by the Labour government last May and taking effect in the summer of 2025, mean that drivers no longer need to submit planning applications to install EV chargepoints at home. It’s a move that could save motorists up to £1,100 a year, according to government officials and industry experts, and is already making waves across the country.

For years, the process of installing an EV charger at home was bogged down by red tape. Homeowners were required to apply for householder planning permission, a bureaucratic hurdle that often resulted in months of waiting, additional costs, and, frankly, a lot of headaches. Now, thanks to this regulatory overhaul, any homeowner in England can install a single wall-mounted or pedestal EV charger on their driveway without the need for planning permission—provided the unit doesn’t exceed 0.2 cubic meters in volume and is positioned at least two meters from the public highway.

“We’re cutting down on paperwork to power up the EV revolution so that drivers, businesses and those looking to make the switch will have more chargepoints to power from and less red tape to deal with,” said Lilian Greenwood, Labour Party minister, at the launch of the new rules. She emphasized the government’s commitment to making the transition to electric vehicles easier, cheaper, and better, pointing to over £2.3 billion in investments aimed at supporting drivers and British carmakers, as well as fueling job creation and economic growth through international trade deals.

The impact of these changes is already being felt. Lewis Gardiner, Operations Director at Osprey Charging Network, called the move “a hugely welcome and practical change that will make a real difference on the ground.” He explained, “Removing the need for planning permission for essential electrical infrastructure like substations across the majority of sites will save months of delays, reduce costs and accelerate the delivery of the rapid charging hubs drivers need. It’s the result of months of collaboration between industry and government and we’re proud to have played a key role in making it happen.”

Patrick Dunne, Sainsbury’s Chief Property and Procurement Officer and Managing Director of Smart Charge, echoed this sentiment. “Everyone at Smart Charge knows how important it is to make EV charging simple, reliable and accessible—both to make transport cleaner and to ensure we’re meeting the everyday needs of drivers throughout the UK. We welcome this new streamlined approach to installing charge points, which will help accelerate the nation’s adoption of EVs,” he said.

The government’s hope is that by making the installation process quicker and more affordable, more drivers will be encouraged to make the switch from petrol and diesel vehicles to electric ones. And with the potential to save up to £1,100 a year compared to running a traditional combustion engine vehicle, it’s a compelling case. According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), the appetite for electric motoring is on the rise: there are now approximately 1.75 million purely electric vehicles in the UK, with 47,000 new EVs registered in 2025 alone—an 8% jump from the previous year.

However, it’s not all smooth sailing. While the new rules remove significant barriers, some restrictions remain in place. For instance, the regulations specify that charging units must not exceed 0.2 cubic meters in volume and must be set at least two meters from public roads. These technical requirements are designed to ensure safety and minimize visual clutter in residential areas.

There are also caveats for certain homeowners. Residents in leasehold accommodation may still face obstacles, as freeholders retain the authority to restrict modifications to properties. Likewise, some newly constructed housing developments have clauses in their title deeds that prevent alterations to a property’s exterior—potentially including the installation of charging points. For those who share driveways or access routes with neighbors, the process could be complicated by legal disagreements or the need for joint consent. These practical realities mean that, for some, the path to an at-home EV charger may still require negotiation and patience.

Despite these challenges, the overall direction is clear: the government and industry are working hand-in-hand to make electric vehicle adoption easier and more attractive. The removal of planning permission requirements is widely seen as a crucial step in accelerating the rollout of charging infrastructure—not just for private homes, but for public and business sites as well. As Gardiner of Osprey Charging Network pointed out, “It’s the result of months of collaboration between industry and government and we’re proud to have played a key role in making it happen.”

Industry leaders agree that the streamlined process will help address one of the biggest concerns for would-be EV owners: the availability and convenience of charging. Patrick Dunne of Smart Charge summed it up: “We welcome this new streamlined approach to installing charge points, which will help accelerate the nation’s adoption of EVs.”

For many, the financial incentive is hard to ignore. With the cost of running an electric vehicle now potentially £1,100 less per year than a petrol or diesel car, and with the process of getting a charger at home made vastly simpler, the barriers to entry are lower than ever. The government’s investment of over £2.3 billion in the sector is also expected to spur innovation and job creation, further embedding the UK’s commitment to a cleaner, greener transport future.

Still, the transition isn’t without its bumps. Leaseholders, residents of new developments with restrictive title deeds, and those with shared driveways may find themselves navigating a maze of permissions and legalities. But for the majority, the new rules represent a welcome change, promising both environmental benefits and significant savings.

With EV adoption climbing steadily—47,000 new electric vehicles registered in 2025 alone, according to SMMT data—the streamlined regulations are set to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of transport in England. As the nation continues its drive toward sustainability, these changes may well prove to be a turning point, making electric motoring more accessible and affordable for millions.

As England’s roads quietly shift from petrol power to electric hum, one thing is certain: the journey toward a cleaner, more efficient future just got a little easier for homeowners across the country.","https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/TC1bbgnq3nbWAVJrrxh76NUL-14=/1200x0/filters:format(webp):quality(85):sharpen(0.5,0.5,true)/tpg%2Fsources%2F97a5514d-9a7a-481a-a6e0-69f40c96e036.jpeg",N,,2026-01-20 14:59:49.866538

From supporting energy development and assessing critical minerals potential to expanding scientific understanding of deep-sea environments, BOEM helped shape a more secure and informed offshore energy future.

Take a deep dive into our biggest achievements from 2025:

Oil and Gas Energy

In 2025, BOEM advanced U.S. energy development by conducting a landmark oil and gas lease sale, proposing new offshore lease sales, releasing a new and expansive National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program, and updating our Outer Continental Shelf planning areas for oil and gas.

Advancing Offshore Energy Development with a Landmark Lease Sale: We successfully conducted Lease Sale Big Beautiful Gulf 1, which was the first offshore oil and gas lease sale required under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The sale generated $300,425,222 in high bids for 181 blocks across 80 million acres in federal waters of the Gulf of America. Thirty companies submitted 219 bids totaling $371,881,093.

Driving Energy Production with a Proposed Second Gulf of America Lease Sale in March 2026: To strengthen U.S. energy dominance, we proposed a second Gulf of America Lease Sale. This sale is the second of thirty Gulf of America oil and gas lease sales required by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Expanding Energy Development in Alaska’s Cook Inlet: We published the Proposed Notice of Sale for Big Beautiful Cook Inlet 1 (BBC1), which would make approximately one million acres available for leasing in Alaska’s Cook Inlet. This marks the first of at least six Cook Inlet lease sales required by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, scheduled annually from 2026 to 2028, and from 2030 to 2032.

Proposing a New National OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program: In response to the National Energy Emergency, we released the first proposal of a new, expansive 11th National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program. This proposal reflects our continued commitment to restore American Energy Dominance and address the nation’s growing energy needs.

Refining Our Outer Continental Shelf Planning Areas for Oil and Gas: We updated our Outer Continental Shelf planning areas for oil and gas management, increasing the total from 26 to 27. This included creating a new High Arctic Planning Area and revising other areas to reflect recent changes in U.S. OCS jurisdictional limits.

Marine Minerals

In 2025, we unleashed America's offshore critical minerals and resources by implementing the directives of Executive Order 14285 . Some examples include:

Taking Action to Unlock Potential Marine Minerals Offshore Virginia: We launched the process for a potential mineral lease sale for heavy mineral sands and other mineral deposits in federal waters off the coast of Virginia. This action—only the third of its kind in more than three decades—represented a significant step toward unlocking the mineral potential of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf and reinforcing the nation’s economic and strategic independence.

Advancing Beach Nourishment and Coastal Protection Projects: BOEM supported the use of Outer Continental Shelf sand in beach nourishment and coastal protection projects in North Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana.

Charting the Future for Potential Offshore Minerals in American Samoa: Offshore American Samoa, we explored the potential for seabed mineral leasing and invited public comments on a possible minerals lease sale—this could be the first mineral lease sale in federal waters in over 30 years! We also completed area identification to determine which specific parts of the Outer Continental Shelf offshore American Samoa will undergo environmental review for proposed commercial leases for critical minerals.

Exploring Potential Offshore Minerals in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands: BOEM invited the public to submit comments on a potential minerals lease sale offshore the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. At this initial stage in the planning process, public input helps ensure that BOEM’s decision-making is locally and scientifically informed.

Renewable Energy

Throughout 2025, BOEM supported efforts to advance the Administration’s offshore wind objectives and enhance oversight of offshore wind activities to promote dependable, American-made energy. We worked to align offshore wind regulations with America’s energy priorities and acted on directives to reduce preferential treatment for unreliable, foreign-controlled energy sources. BOEM also supported the Administration’s efforts to ensure that offshore wind projects do not endanger the environment, U.S. national security, and economic interests.

Environment

In 2025, BOEM supported the responsible and innovative management of offshore development by conducting environmental research and analysis for offshore oil and gas, critical minerals, and sand resources.

Conducting Deep-Sea Research Off Hawaiʻi: This past fall, BOEM scientists explored the remote abyssal plains south of Hawaiʻi Island – one of Earth’s least explored environments – with members from the U.S. Geological Survey. During the expedition, the scientists focused on the large, crescent-shaped area of the abyssal plain, known as the “Hawaiian crescent,” mapping the seafloor, studying the deep-sea environment, and exploring for critical minerals, all while honoring the cultural significance of Moananuiākea.

Deepening Our Knowledge of Alaska’s Offshore Ecosystems: This past summer, BOEM researchers joined the U.S. Geological Survey on a deep-sea expedition along Alaska’s Aleutian Arc to gather vital data on critical marine minerals and deep-sea ecosystems. During the expedition, the scientists collected biological samples, high-resolution seafloor maps, and video footage of the seafloor, all helping to fill critical knowledge gaps in Alaska’s offshore ecosystems.

Exploring the Deep: BOEM, USGS and NOAA Join Forces in the Mariana Arc: This past spring, BOEM, USGS and NOAA Occean Exploration came together to support the Ocean Exploration Trust’s Exploration Vessel Nautilus on a mission to study the remote and volcanically active waters around Guam and the Mariana Arc. The 21-day expedition mapped the seafloor, investigated underwater volcanoes, and collected important data on ecosystems found in extreme deep ocean conditions. These unique habitats may hold critical minerals vital for modern technologies, making this research essential in supporting resource management priorities.

Hello, 2026!

As we embark on 2026, we remain committed to managing offshore energy, marine mineral and geological resources in a responsible way, while supporting environmental and economic sustainability.

Building on last year’s momentum, we are looking forward to continuing to strengthen America’s energy future and making a splash in the year ahead!",https://www.boem.gov/sites/default/files/images/BOEM_Logo_OpenGraph.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 14:59:52.398085

“Energy and geopolitics were always interwoven but I have never ever seen that the energy security risks are so multiplied,” he said.
But Payne defended data centres’ electricity use, arguing that it provides more “economic output per electron” than industries like steel or oil.","The annual World Economic Forum got underway on Tuesday in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, providing a snowy stage for government and business leaders to opine on international affairs. With attention focused on the latest crisis – a potential US-European trade war over Greenland – climate change has slid down the agenda.

Despite this, a number of panels are addressing issues like electric vehicles, energy security and climate science. Keep up with top takeaways from those discussions and other climate news from Davos in our bulletin, which we’ll update throughout the day.

From oil to electrons – energy security enters a new era

Energy crises spurred by geopolitical tensions are nothing new – remember the 1970s oil shock spurred by the embargo Arab producers slapped on countries that had supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War, leading to rocketing inflation and huge economic pain.

But, a Davos panel on energy security heard, the situation has since changed. Oil now accounts for less than 30% of the world’s energy supply, down from more than 50% in 1973. This shift, combined with a supply glut, means oil is taking more of a back seat, according to International Energy Agency boss Fatih Birol.

Instead, in an “age of electricity” driven by transport and technology, energy diplomacy is more focused on key elements of that supply chain, in the form of critical minerals, natural gas and the security buffer renewables can provide. That requires new thinking, Birol added.

“Energy and geopolitics were always interwoven but I have never ever seen that the energy security risks are so multiplied,” he said. “Energy security, in my view, should be elevated to the level of national security today.”

In this context, he noted how many countries are now seeking to generate their own energy as far as possible, including from nuclear and renewables, and when doing energy deals, they are considering not only costs but also whether they can rely on partners in the long-term.

In the case of Europe – which saw energy prices jump after sanctions on Russian gas imports in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine – energy security rooted in homegrown supply is a top priority, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in Davos on Tuesday.

Outlining the bloc’s “affordable energy action plan” in a keynote speech at the World Economic Forum, she emphasised that Europe is “massively investing in our energy security and independence” with interconnectors and grids based on domestically produced sources of power.

The EU, she said, is trying to promote nuclear and renewables as much as possible “to bring down prices and cut dependencies; to put an end to price volatility, manipulation and supply shocks,” calling for a faster transition to clean energy.

“Because homegrown, reliable, resilient and cheaper energy will drive our economic growth and deliver for Europeans and secure our independence,” she added.

China pitches itself as clean energy champion

While the US under President Donald Trump doubles down on fossil fuels and retreats from international climate bodies, China is openly pitching itself as the flagbearer of the clean energy transition and multilateralism.

In Davos, the country’s Vice-Premier He Lifeng invited nations and companies from across the world to “embrace the opportunities from the green and low-carbon transition” by working closely with China.

He boasted about China’s dominance of the global cleantech industry where it controls vast parts of the supply chain – from critical mineral processing to the manufacturing of finished products such as solar panels and electric vehicles.

At ‘Davos of mining’, Saudi Arabia shapes new narrative on minerals

At the same time, He Lifeng told leaders in Davos that Beijing wants to share these opportunities with the world and called on partners to “ensure the free flow of quality green products globally”.

Western nations, including the European Union, have imposed hefty tariffs on Chinese cleantech in an attempt to protect their home-grown businesses from what they regard as unfair competition. But there are signs of those trade tensions easing. Canada announced last week it would let 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the country under a much reduced tariff as part of a sweeping trade deal.

He Lifeng also reaffirmed Beijing’s commitment to achieve for the first time an absolute emissions reduction target by 2035 and to peak its carbon emissions by the end of this decade, as laid out in the country’s latest climate plan.

He described this plan as “a testament to China’s firm resolve and maximum efforts”, although climate experts believe Beijing’s promise to cut emissions by between 7% and 10% by 2035 against an unspecified peak level is weak and unambitious.

In the month that saw the US announce its intention to withdraw from the UN climate convention (UNFCCC), He Lifeng confirmed China’s engagement in climate diplomacy. “China will work with all other Parties to fully and effectively implement the UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement, and uphold the multilateral process,” he said.

AES boss calls for “more technical talk” on supply chains

Earlier, the energy security panel tackled the risks related to supply chains for clean energy and electrification, which are being partly fuelled by rising demand from data centres and electric vehicles.

The minerals and metals that are required for batteries, cables and other components are largely under the control of China, which has invested massively in extracting and processing those materials both at home and overseas. Efforts to boost energy security by breaking dependence on China will continue shaping diplomacy now and in the future, the experts noted.

Copper – a key raw material for the energy transition – is set for a 70% increase in demand over the next 25 years, said Mike Henry, CEO of mining giant BHP, with remaining deposits now harder to exploit. Prices are on an upward trend, and this offers opportunities for Latin America, a region rich in the metal, he added.

At ‘Davos of mining’, Saudi Arabia shapes new narrative on minerals

Andrés Gluski, CEO of AES – which describes itself as “the largest US-based global power company”, generating and selling all kinds of energy to companies – said there is a lack of discussion about supply chains compared with ideological positioning on energy sources.

Instead he called for “more technical talk” about boosting battery storage to smooth out electricity supply and using existing infrastructure “smarter”. While new nuclear technologies such as small modular reactors are promising, it will be at least a decade before they can be deployed effectively, he noted.

In the meantime, with electricity demand rising rapidly, the politicisation of the debate around renewables as an energy source “makes no sense whatsoever”, he added.

BYD exec says EV batteries will make mining CEOs happy

A top BYD executive told the head of a mining company that the rise of electric vehicles (EVs) will make him the “happiest person” because “we’re going to consume a lot of copper, a lot of lithium, a lot of different mining”.

Stella Li, executive vice-president of the world’s biggest electric car company, made the comments to Vale’s CEO Gustavo Pimenta during a panel entitled “Can EVs really dominate?” on Tuesday morning.

EV batteries typically use copper, lithium, nickel and manganese. While these minerals and metals are mined around the world, they are mainly processed in BYD’s home country of China, a dominance that alarms Western powers.

Push for global minerals deal meets opposition, more talks agreed

Climate Home News has highlighted numerous environmental and social problems associated with the mining of these critical raw materials in its Clean Energy Frontier series. Doctors in Chile claim that a copper mine is causing autism, while lithium miners in Nigeria face physical dangers and bad pay.

From the audience, the head of the global IndustriALL trade union Atle Høie said he knows the transition to EVs is “coming” but “mining is still ridden with exploitation” and “minerals are coming from countries where human rights are very poorly developed”.

Pimenta said he wanted mining to be cheap and fast but also ethical, with minerals that can be traced, human rights policies implemented and mines using less land and water. He said Vale was looking at recovering materials from mining waste piles instead of digging new mines.

He added that he didn’t want competitors with low ethical standards because “it’s not a level playing field”, highlighting the need to “rebuild the reputation of the mining industry” in order to convince society to let mining projects go ahead.

He and BYD’s Li played down fears of an under-supply of minerals like copper and lithium, saying sustained and predictable demand would encourage more supply. Li noted there had been a shortage of lithium copper oxide during the COVID-19 pandemic but then the price shot up by a factor of 30 and “suddenly” reserves were found in new countries.

Self-taught mechanics give second life to Jordan’s glut of spent EV batteries

Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan – a major US car-producing state – told the panel that Americans still need both EVs and polluting internal combustion engine vehicles, as seen at the recent Detroit Auto Show.

Whitmer, a Democrat, criticised the US federal government for “back and forth policies” which have made it more difficult for the car industry to go all in and ramp up in the way Chinese firms have been able to.

BYD’s Li said that, unlike China, “some countries” – which she did not name – have gone “back and forth” and “this will confuse manufacturing”.

“Nuclear renaissance” predicted to power AI data centres

The need for clean but reliable electricity to power data centres is likely to lead to a “nuclear renaissance”, according to participants on a panel on artificial intelligence.

Sweden’s centre-right energy minister Ebba Busch told the panel that while Sweden is “still loving renewables”, wind and solar can not provide the kind of power available on demand that is needed to run data centres around the clock because they are too variable. To provide clean, reliable electricity, she said, Sweden is “doing a nuclear renaissance”.

Fellow panellist Joshua Payne – founder of a company called Nscale, which builds and owns data centres – agreed that a nuclear renaissance was “very likely” in the early 2030s. But he also added that northern Norway is the best place to build data centres because it has an oversupply of clean and reliable hydropower electricity.

As Bloom Energy CEO KR Sridhar noted, data centres often consume more electricity than big industrial users like aluminium smelters or petrochemical refiners. Like these industrial sites, data centres will soon be forced by governments to “bring your own power” rather than continuing to free ride from the grid, Sridhar said.

But Payne defended data centres’ electricity use, arguing that it provides more “economic output per electron” than industries like steel or oil. This means it’s better for the economy to use electricity for data centres than other energy-intensive sectors, he argued.

Panellists discussed whether AI will become more energy efficient in future, perhaps due to shortages of computing memory forcing companies to use memory more efficiently and therefore use less electricity. Or because the theory of artificial general intelligence is flawed and a more energy-efficient model of AI – such as that championed by China – will emerge.",https://www.climatechangenews.com/wp-content/files/2026/01/55047490036_b2d16c3375_c.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 16:59:13.029011

The group will meet publicly at least once a month and focus on studying data center citing decisions, according to Kotek’s news release.","Oregon’s governor is organizing a new committee of advisers to weigh in on issues rising from the rapid growth of data centers in the state.

Gov. Tina Kotek announced the new Data Center Advisory Committee on Tuesday and named seven members, who will provide policy recommendations to her and the Legislature no later than October 2026.

Kotek and state lawmakers will use those to create regulations, most likely aimed at where data centers can be built, according to a news release from Kotek’s office. The regulations would aim to protect energy infrastructure and water supplies from being overburdened by the privately run data and AI processing centers, which require massive amounts of energy to run and water for cooling.

“Oregonians have made their concerns about rising utility bills clear. As our state faces rapid growth of data facilities, we must have frank conversations about the challenges and opportunities ahead,” Kotek said in a statement. “I expect the Data Center Advisory Committee to help ensure economic growth while protecting affordable power and Oregon’s critical water resources.”

Oregon’s data center market is among the largest in the nation, according to Chicago-based commercial real estate group Cushman & Wakefield. Access to relatively clean, cheap hydroelectricity in the region and a lack of sales tax, along with billions of dollars in property tax incentives, helped lure the companies.

But the decision to offer those property tax incentives and site a data center is largely a local one, made at the city and county level. The Data Center Advisory Committee is the state’s first big foray into setting data center policy, following several laws that passed in 2025 meant to curb rising electricity rates driven by data centers.

As the giant data complexes expanded across the state during the last several years, energy rates rose on all customer classes served by the state’s private, investor-owned utilities. For residential customers, rates have gone up an average of 50% in the last five years.

Between 2013 and 2023, Oregon’s overall electricity consumption rose by more than 20%, according to a Sightline Institute analysis of U.S. Energy Information Administration data.

“Data centers undoubtedly drove a major share, if not almost all, of this growth,” analysts wrote.

In the next two decades, demand for electricity in the Northwest could double, and demand from data centers is expected to outpace demand from the growing use of electric vehicles until 2046, according to regional energy experts.

Kotek appointed as committee chairs Margaret Hoffmann and Michael Jung. Hoffman is also a member of the Northwest Power and Conservation Council, former energy policy adviser to Oregon governors John Kitzhaber and Kate Brown and former rural development director for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Oregon. Jung is an environmental policy executive and director of the ICF Climate Center, an international tech and energy consultancy.

Other commission members are:

Dan Dorran, chair of the Umatilla County Commission. Umatilla has sited a large number of Amazon data centers in the last decade that have caused 554% demand growth at the Umatilla Electric Cooperative, according to Sightline’s analysis.

Greg Dotson, an energy and environmental law expert at the University of Oregon.

Bill Edmunds, a former private utility executive who teaches energy and business courses at Portland State University and the University of Portland.

Tim Miller, director of the nonprofit industry group Oregon Business For Climate.

Jean Wilson, a renewable energy executive and former president of the nonprofit Oregon Environmental Council.

The group will meet publicly at least once a month and focus on studying data center citing decisions, according to Kotek’s news release. They’ll look at regulations to support how and where data centers could be built to spur “responsible economic development” and job creation, without overburdening local energy and water supplies in the rural communities they tend to be built in.",https://bendbulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2026/01/QTS-Data-Centers-in-Hillsboro-on-Oct.-11-2024.-Oregon-Gov.-Tina-Kotek-created-a-new-advisory-co.jpg?w=729,N,,2026-01-20 14:59:44.130106

The bill also rejects President Trump’s proposal to prohibit funding for wind, solar, and battery projects.","WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senator Gary Peters (MI), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, secured funding for high-impact, local public projects and Michigan priorities in the Fiscal Year 2026 Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act that passed the Senate. The bipartisan legislation includes funding for protecting the Great Lakes, continued construction of the Soo Locks, strengthening our power grid, and flood prevention. The bill now heads to the President’s desk to be signed into law.

“This bipartisan legislation delivers crucial investments that will support Michigan’s economy and help protect our Great Lakes and precious freshwater assets,” said Senator Peters. “I was proud to secure funding in the bill to build more resilient infrastructure, bolster clean energy production, and advance research that keeps our state at the forefront of innovation.”

The bill includes numerous measures led and supported by Peters, including:

Strengthening Critical Infrastructure

Robust Funding for Soo Locks Construction: Peters secured $176.6 million in the bill for the Soo Locks construction project. This funding will support ongoing construction of the new Poe-sized lock. Peters has prioritized securing the funding necessary to build the new lock. Last year, through his role on the Appropriations Committee, he secured more than $264 million through government funding legislation. In 2024, he toured the ongoing construction project after helping to secure $257.4 million for the project. In January 2022, Peters also helped to secure $479 million for modernizing the Soo Locks through the bipartisan infrastructure law.

Brandon Road Lock and Dam Funding: Peters secured $28 million for construction of numerous measures to counter invasive carp at the Brandon Road Lock and Dam, a critical choke point for halting the continued spread of invasive carp and preventing them from establishing in the Great Lakes.

Supporting U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: The bill provides over $10 billion for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to support critical projects that strengthen our nation’s waterways and protect communities from extreme weather events.

Strengthening Michigan Ports and Harbors: The bill provides a historic more than $3 billion, a $702 million increase over fiscal year 2025, to improve navigation and commerce on our nation’s waterways, including the Great Lakes. The bill also includes funding for inland waterway navigation projects, which help improve the transport of important commodities like grain, iron, and petroleum.

Protecting the Great Lakes, Access to Clean Water

Replacing Lead Service Lines in Detroit: Peters secured $9 million in funding for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to replace lead service lines throughout the City of Detroit, helping to ensure safe drinking water and public health.

Great Lakes Authority: The bill includes $5 million for the Great Lakes Authority (GLA), one of ten federal regional commissions that seek to address major economic distress in certain geographic regions. The funding will be used to make targeted investments in economically distressed communities across the Great Lakes Basin, helping to ensure communities throughout the region have access to quality public infrastructure, job training opportunities, and the general tools necessary for economic prosperity. The GLA encompasses counties throughout eight states: Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania, and Indiana.

Great Lakes Coastal Resiliency Study: The bill provides the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers with $3 million to continue conducting its Great Lakes Coastal Resiliency Study, which is developing a coordinated strategy and identifying aging infrastructure to protect 5,200 miles of Great Lakes coastline against flooding and erosion.

Bolstering U.S. Manufacturing and Innovation, Michigan’s Automotive Sector

Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB): The bill provides $110 million for FRIB operations and $15 million for the construction of the High Rigidity Spectrometer (HRS). The facility is housed at Michigan State University. The rare isotopes produced at FRIB will allow nuclear scientists and researchers to explore a range of potential applications in the fields such as energy, medicine, and national security, including diagnosing and curing diseases, improving next generation nuclear reactors for energy, and finding processes to destroy nuclear waste. Once completed, HRS will enable isotope harvesting and substantially increase FRIB’s scientific reach and productivity.

Supporting Scientific Discovery: The bill provides $8.4 billion in funding for the Office of Science. The Office of Science is the largest federal sponsor of basic research in the physical sciences and supports 22,000 researchers at 17 national laboratories and more than 300 universities, including in Michigan. The bill will advance research in the highest priorities including high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, biology, and clean energy to maintain and strengthen our global competitiveness. The bill also boosts funding for the Office’s work on artificial intelligence and advanced computing to help the Department of Energy implement the Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence for Science, Security, and Technology (FASST) initiative.

Renewable Energy: The bill provides $3.1 billion for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs that support all types of research, including into advanced manufacturing and building and industrial decarbonization. The bill rejects President Trump’s proposed cut of over $2.5 billion for this research, as well as his proposal to zero out funding for critical solar, wind, and hydrogen research programs. The bill maintains vital investments to bolster energy and manufacturing supply chains to help ensure our continued global leadership in energy technologies.

Protecting Our Energy Grid: The bill provides $190 million to help ensure the continued success of the Department of Energy’s programs aimed at strengthening the security and resilience of our energy sector and grid. It also provides robust funding for both the Office of Electricity and the Grid Deployment Office, rejecting President Trump’s proposed merger of the two offices. The bill will also support upgrades to critical electrical grid infrastructure, an essential investment when energy costs are skyrocketing due to President Trump’s policies, including the termination of renewable energy projects across the country.

Tribal Energy: The bill provides funding for the Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs. The bill also rejects President Trump’s proposal to prohibit funding for wind, solar, and battery projects. This funding will help electrify the 30,000 Tribal homes that currently do not have access to power.

I look forward to partnering with President Trump to deliver real results for California’s Central Valley in the years ahead.”","WASHINGTON, D.C. — One year ago today, President Donald J. Trump took the oath of office, becoming the 47th President of the United States. In just one year, his administration has secured the border, unleashed domestic energy, and put America back in charge on the world stage.

Members of the Republican Study Committee (RSC) celebrated President Trump’s first-year accomplishments and the results he has delivered for American families.

""One year in, and President Trump proved what we already knew: weakness invites chaos, strength delivers results. Under his leadership, American workers gained back $1,100 in real wages that President Biden's policies destroyed, manufacturing is surging, and new jobs are going to U.S. citizens instead of illegal aliens. And it's not just our economy that's winning again. Our adversaries are contained and our country is leading from a position of strength again. The world knows America is back. Promises made, promises kept!"" said RSC Chairman August Pfluger (TX-11).

“One year into the Trump 2.0 Administration, we’ve seen bold leadership that has delivered lower taxes, stronger borders, renewed energy independence, and historic support for our military and law enforcement. President Trump has kept his promises to the American people, strengthening our economy, defending our freedoms, and holding the line against radical policies that hurt our nation. I’m proud of what we’ve achieved so far, and I look forward to the work ahead to secure a more prosperous future for all Americans,"" said RSC Vice-Chair Ben Cline (VA-06).

“Today we mark year one of President Trump restoring American momentum after years of chaos and decline. Lower costs, unleashing American energy, a secure border, and safer communities prove that real leadership gets real results. America is back!” said RSC Messaging Task Force Chair Mark Alford (MO-04).

“One year ago, President Trump took office with a bold vision to restore economic opportunity for working families and strengthen American competitiveness. That vision is now delivering real results — bigger paychecks, rising wages, and a stronger economy. GDP growth is beating expectations, inflation is moderating, and thanks to pro-working families policies, Americans are better able to afford the essentials of daily life. Republicans in Congress will continue working alongside the Trump Administration to build on this progress by supporting American workers and families, and expanding opportunity across the country,” said House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith (MO-08).

“In just one year of President Trump back in the White House and working with a Republican Congress, the people of North Texas have enjoyed incredible success with lower costs, rising wages that are beating inflation, and they are looking forward to massive tax refunds to help their families keep $1,000 to $2,000 more of what they earn. The Texas border with Mexico has never been more secure and as we are continuing to deport hundreds of thousands of criminal aliens brought in by Joe Biden's open border policies, cities and communities throughout Texas are safer for our families and small businesses. This past year of responsible governance and conservative reforms has helped us set the stage for a cycle of virtuous economic growth that will strengthen our hardworking families and deliver much deserved prosperity for their futures,” said RSC Budget and Spending Task Force Chair Beth Van Duyne (TX-24).

""One year ago, President Trump returned to the White House with a historic mandate to rebuild American strength at home and abroad. In just 12 months, we've worked with the administration to deliver a secure southern border, the lowest gas prices in five years, historic tax relief for working families, and renewed American leadership on the world stage. The path forward is clear: stay focused on commonsense solutions that lower costs for families and advance peace through strength around the globe,” said RSC National Security Task Force Chair Zach Nunn (IA-03).

“In just one year, President Trump has delivered on the mandate the American people gave on Nov. 5th, 2024. He ended the failed policies from Biden and the Democrats — policies that fueled crushing inflation, allowed millions of illegal criminals to pour into our communities, and pushed radical gender ideology into our schools, sports, and institutions. I am honored to serve with President Trump and to be in the fight to secure our borders, restore prosperity, protect our children, and save the future of our country. AND THE BEST IS YET TO COME!” said RSC Emerging Technologies Chair Kat Cammack (FL-03).

""One year since President Trump's inauguration and congressional Republicans continue to renew their commitment to putting taxpayers first and restoring fiscal discipline. The One Big Beautiful Bill reflects that effort and shows what can happen when the White House and Congress work together to deliver real solutions. I fought to include priorities that directly benefit hardworking families, including a strong child tax credit and support for rural hospitals. Those provisions matter. They help parents keep more of what they earn and ensure that families in rural communities can continue to access care close to home,"" said Rep. Robert Aderholt (AL-04). ""The contrast after one year is undeniable. We have moved from excuses to action, from chaos to order, and from a Washington that too often protects itself into a government that is being forced to answer to the American people again. This anniversary is more than a milestone. It is proof that leadership matters. When a President enforces the law, defends our sovereignty, stands up for taxpayers, and leads with strength on the world stage, America wins. President Trump’s first year back in office has shown what is possible when we put America first, and we are just getting started,” said Values Action Team Chairman Robert Aderholt (AL-04).

“We can sum up President Trump’s first year in one word: results. From slashing wasteful spending and securing our border to unleashing energy dominance and jumpstarting our economy, the President has delivered with massive tax cuts and a rollback on burdensome red tape. This first year has been defined by historic speed to reverse the failures of the previous administration—promises made, promises kept. I look forward to continue working with President Trump and my House colleagues to keep America moving forward and make our nation great again,” said Rep. Aaron Bean (FL-04).

“In just one year, President Trump has secured our border, eliminated woke DEI ideology from our military, jump-started the economy by cutting red tape and unleashing American energy, and restored America’s leadership on the world stage. It’s an honor to work alongside President Trump to advance this conservative agenda. The best is yet to come,”said Rep. Chip Roy (TX-21).

“President Trump saved this country from a socialist, Marxist left and delivered historic tax cuts for working families, defunded Planned Parenthood, restored Second Amendment rights by zeroing out the NFA tax, and secured our border. Reconciliation 2.0 is the next step, building on those wins by lowering health care and housing costs, unleashing American energy, and making the American Dream real again,” said Rep. Eric Burlison (MO-07).

“In just this first year, President Trump and Republicans in Congress have secured the border, ended tax on tips, eliminated wasteful spending, fought fraud, and in the case of Arizona's 8th Congressional District, brought in more high-paying tech jobs, laying the necessary groundwork to make the American Dream affordable again,"" stated Congressman Abe Hamadeh. ""We have done this despite constant obstruction from Democrats, who repeatedly show they are more interested in exploiting the struggles of hard-working Americans to advance failed policies and fund the livelihoods of illegal immigrants,” said Rep. Abe Hamadeh (AZ-08).

“One year into President Trump’s administration, America is moving in the right direction. Policies that put American workers and families first are delivering results at home, while peace through strength is restoring credibility and stability abroad. The best is yet to come as we continue advancing economic growth, security, and opportunity for the American people,” said Rep. Claudia Tenney (NY-24).

“In the year since President Trump took office, we have seen amazing success at our border. I will continue to push to codify President Trump’s executive orders that have enabled this historic change. Thank you, President Trump, for your leadership and for making the border secure again,” said Rep. Michael Guest (MS-03).

“One year into President Trump’s second term, the momentum is undeniable. With another reconciliation package on the horizon, we’re pushing forward bold, commonsense reforms to strengthen the economy, secure the border, and put American families first. This is how you deliver results and we’re just getting started,” said Rep. Ralph Norman (SC-05).

“In just one year, President Trump has undone the damage caused by the Biden autopen presidency and made America respected again on the global stage,” said Rep. Stutzman. “Terrorists are on the run, our economy is on the rise, and there are still three years to go! The Golden Age of America is upon us,” said Rep. Marlin Stutzman (IN-03).

“What a difference a year makes. One year after President Trump laid out a clear plan in his inauguration address, that plan is being executed and delivering results. Under President Biden, the country faced numerous failures, including a broken border, weakened energy production, runaway inflation, heavy regulations, declining military recruitment, reckless spending, and global instability. Under President Trump, the border is being secured, American energy is back, delivering lower gas prices, inflation has decreased, wages are increasing, and families are keeping more of their paycheck. Burdensome regulations are being rolled back, allowing businesses to grow. Military recruitment is surging, wasteful spending is decreasing, and waste, fraud, and abuse are being eliminated. Accountability is being restored. Abroad, the U.S. is once again pursuing peace through strength and restoring credibility. With pro-growth policies, deregulation, and investment, the economy has real momentum, with growth projected to exceed 4%. It has been a strong year, and we are just getting started. My bipartisan message is simple: Democrats must stop the political posturing and focus on governing, because it is time to build a stronger America together,” said Rep. Dan Meuser (PA-09).

“Today marks one year of America’s golden age,” said Rep. Troy Nehls (TX-22). “In just 365 days, we now have the most secure border in history, gas prices are down, taxes have been cut, we are once again respected on the world stage, our communities are safer, and waste, fraud, and abuse have been eliminated. Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, our country is doing better than ever before, and I’m proud to stand with President Trump and my House Republican colleagues in working to Make America Great Again.”

“It’s been one year since President Trump’s historic return to the White House,” said Rep. Vince Fong (CA-20). “In record time, he secured the border, lowered costs, spurred economic growth, and rooted out waste, fraud, and abuse across the federal government. For the Central Valley, that means fighting for reliable water supplies and more energy production. Policies that put working families, farmers, and small businesses first. I look forward to partnering with President Trump to deliver real results for California’s Central Valley in the years ahead.”",https://republicanstudycommittee.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicanstudycommittee.house.gov/files/evo-media-image/AP-PRESSER_0.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 14:59:32.088859

From my understanding, it was sort of last minute as far as the actual invite, this has been in the works for a while as far as governors working with the White House, including Democrats, Wes Moore of Maryland was the other Democrat in attendance, but it was pretty interesting to sort of see them all come together and call on PGM to take action.

Now, PJM doesn’t have to do anything. What’s interesting, I mean, clearly there’s a political element of this. I think the governors and the White House see a reason to be seen as responsive to rising electricity prices, which I’m sure will get more into, has become a really potent political issue. And there’s a lot of questions, I think in talking to experts with some of my colleagues around actually implementing this and what it would take. But to see all these folks at the White House with very disagreements around broader energy policy and the types of generation we should be building, I thought was pretty noteworthy.

Bill Loveless (05:09): Yeah, yeah, certainly affordability, right? That’s sort of the political watchword these days on so many issues. And in electricity, the concerns over rising prices, they’ve gone up, what about 7% in the United States over the past year. And so politically it’s a big issue as well as for the pocketbook. Josh, I know there’s a lot of uncertainty at this point, but I mean, do some see this as what it will take to achieve some sort of breakthrough in terms of providing reliable but affordable sources of electricity for not only data centers, but for the general public?

Josh Siegel (05:45): I mean, I think people seem to think it’s a show of force that really we haven’t seen that’s like, okay, people recognize how big of a problem this is. So in that aspect it’s positive. But as far as any immediate impact, how quickly would PJM act on this, if at all? Would they have a different interpretation of what to do? We know how long it takes to build power plants in this country. Permitting I’m sure we’ll get into is a challenge, so I don’t think you would see any immediate relief for this, but it’s sort of more to show that folks are taking action. There’s bipartisan interest in doing so. I think a lot of questions are around does FERC, so PJM would have to file a filing with FERC. We know that the FERC has been a huge priority of this administration to sort of see FERC as an avenue to move their energy agenda for chair. Laura Swett was in attendance at this event. So I think that was sort of telling to show, okay, they see a need here to maybe act on this if PJM again were to proceed, but a lot of questions as far as how quickly you would see something like this actually be implemented and take effect in time for people to see it and be visible. I think that’s unlikely as far as midterm election season.

It’s designed to motivate big tech companies to build new power plants to serve rapidly growing AI data centers.

It was especially interesting to see Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, a longtime critic of PJM, attend the event. From my understanding, the invitation was fairly last-minute, though the effort has been in the works for some time and included Democratic Governor Wes Moore of Maryland. Seeing them all come together to call on PJM to act was noteworthy.

Josh Siegel (04:37): PJM doesn’t have to do anything, of course. There’s clearly a political element. The governors and the White House want to be seen as responsive to rising electricity prices, which have become a potent political issue. There are major implementation questions, and it will take time to build new power plants. Still, given the disagreements among these leaders over broader energy policy, it was striking to see them unified in this moment.

Bill Loveless (05:09): Affordability really is the political watchword right now. Electricity prices have risen about 7 percent over the past year. Josh, do some see this as a potential breakthrough for providing reliable and affordable electricity, not just for data centers but for the public more broadly?

Josh Siegel (05:45): People see it as a show of force and recognition of how serious the problem is. That’s positive. But in terms of immediate impact, it’s unclear how quickly PJM would act, if at all. Building power plants takes time, and permitting remains a challenge. This is more about signaling action and bipartisan interest than delivering near-term relief, especially before the midterms.

Bill Loveless (06:59): Yeah, absolutely. We’ll talk more about FERC at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in a few minutes, but because certainly a lot will be happening there, and of course this is happening as we are seeing major geopolitical events around the world. I wonder, are events in major oil producers like Venezuela and Iran reshaping the context for US energy policy making this year, Maxine, are they changing any energy priorities around, I don’t know, production, strategic reserves, sanctions, environmental issues?

Maxine Joselow (07:35): Those are a lot of really big questions, Bill. Let me see if I can take a stab at answering some of them and I’ll let Josh weigh in on some of them too. I think at a very high level, the fact that oil prices are low right now has allowed the administration to have more confidence and to kind of be unfettered in taking these big geopolitical actions because they know that there won’t be repercussions at home. Americans won’t be seeing higher prices at the pump as a result, which is top of mind in this whole question about affordability. People often notice prices at the pump more than they notice their electricity bills going up. And so whether it’s Venezuela, whether it’s Iran, the administration feels like it has room to make these big interventions because of the fact that prices are low, generally speaking right now. But those are some big questions. I don’t know if Josh, you want to jump in on some of those too?

Josh Siegel (08:29): Yeah, I do see it sort of involving the affordability context. There’s some intersection here, and again, my frame is really from the Hill. I do most of my reporting in Congress and when I talk to Democrats, they sort of see this as an opportunity to say, Hey, President Trump’s so focused on these overseas interventions, domestic affordability, what does he really care about? And then there’s this question of the administration is exporting Venezuela’s oil. They say the US government has control over the revenue and it’s going to go to the Venezuelan people. But I think there’s a lot of questions. I think Democrats see an opportunity to use that as like, okay, we’re giving more control to this administration. That obviously has stepped on the power of the purse in lots of ways as far as when it comes to Congress’s prerogative over federal government funds and appropriations. This seems separate from that. This wouldn’t involve Congress from everything that I’ve been told as far as does Congress get a chance to weigh in on what to do with these revenues? But I think they see it as an opportunity to say, oh, the Trump administration, we’re going to trust them to sort of handle this when they’ve intervened in funding matters pretty aggressively across the board on energy.

Maxine Joselow (09:41): And just speaking of Democrats in Congress in Venezuela, I also thought it was notable that the administration appears not to have briefed members of Congress in advance of the strike. And then at the same time, the head executives of major oil companies had a heads up and were brought into these conversations earlier on, and you see Democrats like Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee sending letters to these top oil company executives asking, what did you know and when and did you know it before we did?

Bill Loveless (10:14): So to some extent, it does color some of the discussions that take place, obviously over energy policy this year.

Josh Siegel (10:22): Yeah, no, I think that’s for sure. And again, I think Democrats are already eager to sort of show that the Trump administration is too close to the oil industry. And this is another example, although, I mean that big White House meeting right there was ExxonMobil, a lot of skepticism around whether what it would take to actually go back in Venezuela in a significant way. So I think that’s interesting that there does seem to be division within the industry on how that will play out. But I think Democrats see an opportunity here and it’ll color a lot of what we see the rest of the year.

Bill Loveless (10:56): So let’s go to Congress, go to Capitol Hill. Are there two or three flash points for lawmakers in 2026? Josh, I know you’ve been big in covering permitting reform, so I would hazard to guess that’s one of them, but there’s grid reliability, something else.

Josh Siegel (11:15): I think permitting reform is really, I mean, the top policy issue I’m still watching for, I mean, I know right? Talks are on pause right now. So Senate Democrats have stopped negotiating with Republicans because the Trump administration during the Christmas holiday season basically paused all offshore wind projects that are in construction, five really large projects. And that sort of caught some folks by surprise, given the timing of that — happened right after the house passed their NEPA overhaul bill, which was sort of their imprint on permitting reform was meant to sort of jumpstart negotiations. The Senate was already having conversations, but Senate Democrats were like, look, we can’t do this when it’s very clear that the Trump administration has favorites when it comes to energy, they favor fossil fuels, they favor nuclear. How can they implement any permitting bill that might benefit clean energy or should on a policy basis benefit clean energy?

(12:08): But I mean the outside noise for action is still super significant. Every industry is at the table that you can think of, oil and gas, clean energy, tech, I mean, so I think the noise is going to be consistent throughout the year. There could be opportunities to reopen. We’ll see if, I’m sure we’ll get more into this, but a big question mark going forward is does the Trump administration change their tactic on clean energy at all? They suffered some court losses here last week with three of these projects, three of these offshore wind projects that now can continue construction. Does that change anything from this administration? Is rising prices and sort of what it looks like when they’re taking projects offline and how that might impact things, does that force them to change course at some point? So I think that’s the biggest question hovering over permitting reform, but I expect that to be a constant conversation every week. It feels like there’s an event from some industry group hoping that they return to the table. So we’ll see. But that’s really my big one.

Bill Loveless (13:05): I mean, that’s been the case with permitting reform for several years, right? I mean, it’s constantly chatter over this. There has been more action lately with the passage of the bill by Republican Bruce Westerman and Democrat Jared Golden late last year. But as you say, there’s been these obstacles that have come up more recently over the administration’s pausing again of offshore wind projects. Maxine, you cover Interior. Remind us what’s happened most recently with those offshore wind projects.

Maxine Joselow (13:37): Yeah, so I cover the interior department generally and have been following these offshore wind projects, specifically, including the ups and downs of their various legal battles. And last week, as Josh noted, there was a trio of adverse rulings against the administration ordering all three of these projects to again resume construction and finding that the Trump administration had not adequately explained why these projects needed to stop construction because they pose these unspecified national security risks. And essentially in its abrupt December 22nd announcement, just three days before Christmas, ordering these projects to stop construction, the Interior Department had cited these classified reports by the Defense Department, now called the Department of War, that found that these projects posed security risks and that the turbines could interfere with the radar used by military vessels and other boat captains. And the three judges in these three cases all ruled that those reports which they saw under seal, did not adequately justify stopping these multi-billion dollar projects, some of which are almost near completion and in operation.

Bill Loveless (14:59): Yeah, there’s been a lot of turmoil over these offshore wind projects. A lot of those that were on the drawing board are no longer there because of the administration’s opposition to this form of energy. So yeah, it’s been quite tumultuous and costly certainly for those offshore developers. I just wonder with those actions on the offshore wind happening when they did and how it came at a point when the house had just passed this bill, so there was giving hope to some people that maybe there would be some sort of permitting reform this year if in fact that can be resolved. Josh, as I understand it in the House, there was some stiff opposition to doing anything to stop the White House from stopping wind projects. And they can point to this has happened during the Biden administration when the President pulled permits that had been done for the pipeline from Canada. I mean, is this one of the big stumbling blocks that needs to be resolved if permitting reforms to go anywhere?

Josh Siegel (16:00): I mean, it’s the biggest one for sure. I mean, we saw, as you noted in the House, I mean some of the Freedom Caucus hard right along with more moderate members who just oppose offshore wind kind of banded together and saw this provision that Westerman was able to negotiate in the markup of his bill that essentially put some limits. I mean it was a pretty modest measure, but put some limits around the executive branch’s interference in the permitting process, which has been sort of the biggest hangup in these talks. Westerman knew he was going to have to get at this issue at some point. He negotiated that with Democrats, but the Freedom Caucus got wind of it, and they immediately saw it as a target on Trump policies, even though Westerman really took pains to say this is a technology neutral, as you noted, Bill, we’ve seen it, the Biden administration take actions against fossil fuel projects.

(16:48): So it was meant to really not target any specific technology, but that didn’t stop the Freedom Caucus. They eventually got it through, but Westerman had to water it down somewhat. And yeah, I mean on the Democratic side, the biggest thing they want out of these talks in the Senate, they even thought what Westerman did was not sufficient at all. So they want to see stronger language in this area. They want to see both Trump administration change its behavior as far as how it’s treating these projects. And then they do this exact opposite right after the House passes its bill when they put the halt on these offshore wind projects. But they also want to see a big policy right as this Interior Department memo that interior secretary Doug Bergham put in, that essentially requires him to sign off on routine permits for solar and wind onshore projects on federal lands.

(17:36): But this affects projects on private lands because some of these approvals involve crossing state and private lands, and that policy has really put a hamper on project development in this country. And the Democrats say they want that policy to go away. They want to maybe put in language into a bill that would limit that kind of stonewalling that the administration has been doing. Rather than outright rejecting. They’re just not approving anything. So is there a way to get at that? But we know that any move in this area is going to get backlash on the right. So it’s tricky to see how you get compromise on that.

Maxine Joselow (18:09): Those are great points, Josh. And I would just add, there was I think a lot of speculation in climate and energy circles in Washington about whether these two things were related, whether the collapse of the permitting reform talks on the Hill was related in any way to the Trump administration’s announcement that it was ordering a halt to construction on these five offshore wind projects just a few days later. And my reporting, my colleagues in their reporting have tried to answer that question, and it seems a little unclear, but maybe the answer is a tentative no. I didn’t actually end up including this in my story, but I’ll share it with listeners of this podcast that I had an interview with Congressman Jeff Van Drew, Republican of New Jersey and leading opponent of offshore wind projects, and I asked him: “You along with your colleagues in the Freedom Caucus up in arms over this language in the permitting reform, talks about offshore wind. Did you call President Trump? Did you call the White House and maybe get this issue back on his radar in a way that may have resulted in that stop work order announcement?” And he actually declined to take credit for getting it back on the White House’s radar, which I thought was very telling whenever a lawmaker declines to take credit for something that’s notable, I think when given the opportunity to do so.

Josh Siegel (19:29): Yeah, no, Maxine, that’s a great point. I do think it’s unclear as far as the connection, but you raise a point on, did just sort of the conversation around this put it back into Trump’s radar and like, Hey, why haven’t we done anything lately against offshore wind? So I think that’s a possibility, but it also shows I think, how disconnected the administration is from Congress that maybe there wasn’t a direct connection here, but they clearly were not aware or they didn’t care that what they did here would permeate or affect permitting talks on the Hill. They didn’t make that connection. So it’s sort of unclear how much they actually see a need for congressional action, what their priorities would be. There hasn’t been a great public discussion of that from administration officials other than some NEPA reform, but they’re going to need more than that to get a bill through and then maybe to see some pipeline approvals streamlined through the Clean Water Act. But they’re doing it right. We’ve seen the EPA do regulatory action and that recently, so it’s unclear. I mean, they’re doing a lot on permitting to benefit the projects they want. So how much do they really want Congress to act?

Bill Loveless (20:31): Yeah, and I certainly want to get to EPA in a moment, one of Maxine’s beats. But I think for years we’ve heard about all of the above energy policy, and there’s some controversy over that, some depending on which side of the political spectrum you sit. Some people would prefer more of this than that, but it seems to be there has been more of an acknowledgement that in all the above energy policy is important to consider. And at a time when renewables solar and wind achieving a bigger part of the new generation in this country, IEA just put out a new short-term energy outlook, I believe it was today, that’s saying that solar power is driving electricity generation growth and will do so over the next two years. But there’s a lot of talk about base load too, particularly natural gas and nuclear new to back in the in the mix again, is there, where do we sit with this? It takes some years to get a gas turbine built and operating in this country for baseload. The renewables seem to come on faster. Is there some meeting in the middle among politicians and regulators over where the optimal growth can be in this country for electricity, Maxine?

Maxine Joselow (21:44): Yeah. Well, I think this whole notion of all of the above energy policy has had a really fascinating political realignment attached to it that I’ve observed as a reporter in the space over the last several years. When you think back to the first Trump administration, they used the phrase to describe their energy policy, all the above. And to some extent it was more true in the first Trump administration because you still had offshore wind leasing taking place. You still had interior Secretary Ryan Zinke at the time praising the offshore wind leasing bonanza that had resulted in a bunch of bids. And fast forward to today, and you actually, despite the fact that President Trump issued an executive order on day one of returning to office calling a national energy emergency and saying that his administration was going to take all of these steps to bring new energy sources online faster, you actually see his administration not so much taking in all of the above approach as pushing for fossil fuels like coal, which he calls beautiful clean coal, natural gas oil, and of course, some technologies that energy secretary Chris Wright tends to favor like nuclear and geothermal at the same time as his administration is arguably throttling wind and solar onshore and offshore.

(23:11): And so all of the above has in some ways become an opening for Democrats to attack the administration on and say, Hey, you say you’re all of the above, but in fact you’re throttling these sources of power. And in the case of offshore wind, these five wind farms we were talking about that are stalled or were stalled off the East coast, we’re projected to power hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses with clean energy at a time that there’s potentially shortages in the northeast.

Bill Loveless (23:40): Well, I mean, we talk about energy all of the above, but I mean this administration came in with energy dominance being the theme, right? Oil and gas and coal. So there’s no getting away from that, and I don’t mean to diminish the significance of that aspect of the administration’s energy policy, but I think out there in the atmosphere when people look at energy, our energy needs, you can’t ignore the fact that the renewables have come on so substantially in recent years and raises the question of what role they could play in combination, say with batteries, for example, which seems to be coming on in greater force these days as well as the fossil fuels. It’s a lot to consider Josh.

Josh Siegel (24:21):

Yeah, no, Maxine is spot on as far as Democrats seeing an opportunity in this, and you are hearing them increasingly talk about wind and solar in the context of being the cheapest quickest to get on the grid at a moment of great energy need out there, less sort of in the climate frame, which is interesting and saying, I mean the administration is preventing that from happening. They’re literally taking projects offline that are ready to go. So it is interesting to see Democrats. And as far as fossil fuels, I mean, I feel like most I talk to on the hill, I mean, you still have maybe the progressive left who would like to see less fossil fuel use even now, but folks seem to say we’re in a different context, a different time with the growing rising demand. We didn’t see that in the last Congress. It wasn’t part of the conversation when we were talking about the Inflation Production Act, which was the big Biden administration climate energy initiative. So Democrats are largely aligned, I think, on we’re really all of the above, not. So it’s been pretty interesting to see that evolution.

Bill Loveless (25:29): Well, we’re talking about Congress, but as I often say, and probably have said it more in recent years, it’s the agencies that seem to matter most when it comes to energy and climate outcomes. And that’s certainly the case here in 2026. And there we’re talking EPA, DOE, Interior, FERC, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Maxine, where do we even begin with EPA? There’s so much that has occurred during this administration regarding regulations and rulemakings, which are the ones that deserve a particularly close attention right now?

Maxine Joselow (26:06): Great question. Where to begin? There’s been such a flurry of news out of EPA under the second Trump administration, Lee Zeldin, the EPA administrator had this day back in March that I remember because my inbox was just ping, ping, ping where they sent out, I think a total of 30 press releases about each of these new regulatory rollbacks they were undertaking. LeeZeldin called it the Greatest Day of Deregulation in American History and said he was driving a dagger through the heart of the climate change religion, which is a quote that’ll stay with me for a while. And since then there’s just been an onslaught of more news out of the agency. And I think one announcement that deserves a lot of attention and scrutiny is an announcement that I covered last week, it feels like longer ago, but yeah, it was last week. I got my hands on some internal EPA emails and documents that were later posted to their website and formally announced to the public, and they show that the EPA is going to make what I described in my article as a seismic shift to the way that it conducts cost benefit analysis for new clean air rules.

(27:22): And instead of considering both the health benefits of reducing air pollution, including the avoided asthma attacks and avoided premature deaths, the agency is only going to be considering the costs to businesses of complying with the rules. And that’s going to mean that in these cost benefit analysis, the costs of clean air regulations appear to greatly outweigh the benefits, which would be a significant change from the past three decades of EPA rulemakings under the Clean Air Act, where the benefits have typically exceeded the cost by at least a 30 to one ratio.

Bill Loveless (28:00): In the case of that, and there’s so many, as you say, other things going on at EPA right now, I mean, they proposed considering revising the Greenhouse Gas reporting program that could remove reporting requirements for many industry sectors and potentially reshaping how emissions are tracked and regulated in this country. And they’ve more recently proposed limiting the ability of states to block construction of oil and gas pipelines and coal export terminals. And perhaps the biggest thing, in my mind anyway, is that rescinding the 2009 endangerment finding, which provides the legal foundation for regulating greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles and power plants under the Clean Air Act, there could be some decision on that fairly soon. Right, Maxie?

Maxine Joselow (28:47): That’s right. My colleagues and I are expecting a decision to formally repeal the endangerment finding this month. It might slip to next month, but so far every indication we’re hearing is it could be by the end of this month, and that would arguably be the single biggest deregulatory action by the EPA ever. To be fair to Lee Zeldin, that would probably be an accurate way to describe that action just because of the enormous benefits of climate regulations that have flowed from that Seminole 2009 finding that greenhouse gases do in fact endanger public health and welfare and therefore should be regulated under the Clean Air Act. And that has paved the way for EPA to regulate greenhouse gases from car and truck tailpipes, from coal and gas power plant smokestacks. And as part of this proposal to repeal the endangerment finding, EPA is expected to also erase all limits on greenhouse gas pollution from light duty vehicles and power plants could be next.

Bill Loveless (29:53): I mean, this will be challenged in court as are all new regulations regardless of what administration’s in power at the moment, but we’re only entering the second year of the Trump administration. I mean, is it likely that this decision on the endangerment finding as well as other rules that EPA has proposed could in fact take effect within the next couple of years?

Maxine Joselow (30:23): Well, Bill, I’m not an environmental lawyer. I just interview a lot of them, but I think they’re all thinking that the EPA and the Justice Department want this case to reach the Supreme Court within President Trump’s second term and have this issue decided before the next administration comes into office, particularly if it’s a democratic administration. And in an ideal world for them, the Supreme Court would overturn Massachusetts versus EPA, which was the landmark case that found that EPA can regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants under the Clean Air Act, and that would prevent a future Democratic administration from coming in and reestablishing these limits on cars and power plants and other sources of pollution.

Josh Siegel (31:08):

Yeah, it’s been, just from a help perspective, it’s been interesting to hear Republicans universally who I talked to, even ones who were starting to lean in a little bit on climate change, saying that they support what the administration’s doing on the endangerment finding. I talked to Shelly Moore, Capto chair of VPW Committee of West Virginia who can be moderate on certain energy issues, or at least on how she talks about them. And she was saying, I mean, we want the end engagement finding to go away because we don’t want to see another Democratic administration come in and do what the Biden administration did as far as regulating power plants, vehicles in sort of an aggressive fashion. And they actually see that that’s why we need to see something like this. We don’t want ping ponging anymore. We want finality to it. So I think that’s pretty interesting to note, although there has been some pushback on the greenhouse gas reporting program that the administration has moved to undo where there’s a tie in there to carbon capture tax credits and accessibility, so the administration in the fossil fuel industry are aligned and wanting to see maybe that maintained, which is interesting.

Maxine Joselow (32:14): Yeah, I think potentially even more interesting than Congressional Republicans kind of falling in line is, as Josh said, industry pushback to some of these changes out of EPA. And that’s been a trend that I’ve noticed in my reporting on EPA over the past several months is in many cases, the agency is rolling back programs that industries actually like and want to keep around. So the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program is a great example. It’s just all it requires is reporting, reporting your greenhouse gas emissions. And the oil and gas industry really likes this program because it makes them look pretty good. It shows the progress they’ve made in reducing methane emissions compared to their competitors around the world, and it allows them to market their gas as more clean when they’re selling it abroad. Similarly, the Energy Star program, which we haven’t talked about, the administration said it wanted to eliminate it. There was pushback, and the home appliance manufacturers said, Hey, we actually really like this program. Similarly, it allows us to market energy efficient products like washing machines, dishwashers, et cetera, to consumers who recognize that label. And actually, there was pushback from the Hill too in the latest appropriation bill for the EPA and interior department that would actually provide and maintain funding for that program as well.

Bill Loveless (33:36): Now, you mentioned appropriations, Maxine, I don’t know if you or Josh have been following appropriations closely lately, but it’s my impression, I think there’s a bill moving through the hill right now for appropriations for the Department of Energy and some other agencies, and I may be wrong, but I think that the agency’s on fairing all that badly. I mean, compared to what the appropriations were previously. Right. Do either of you track that at all?

Josh Siegel (34:03): Yeah, so the appropriations bills for Interior and the Energy Department did pass the House and Senate already. So the Senate was last week. So I’m not sure if the President has actually signed those into law at this point. But yeah, these were compromised bills. I don’t have the numbers on top of me, but they definitely rejected some of the Trump administration’s proposed cuts, and you saw great votes from both the Democrats and the Republicans, great amount of votes, which I think was notable in this environment that they were able to get there. Appropriation seemed to be sort of the one thing maybe right now where you are seeing some members assert themselves and say, Hey, we need to claw back some power here.

Bill Loveless (34:40): So the funding is more or less consistent with what the agencies have gotten in the past, Josh?

Josh Siegel (34:44): Yeah, I mean, I don’t know. Comparing it to, I’m sure it’s less than the Biden administration have to go and look at the numbers, but they do reject some of the aggressive cuts that the Trump administration was proposing.

Bill Loveless (34:56): Let’s get back to FERC, and I always hesitate when I bring up FERC. As I recall, my first beat as an energy reporter in Washington many years ago was covering the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. And I always said that that was sort of my bootcamp in covering energy in Washington because it’s pretty darn complicated place, but it continues to be important. And we’ve mentioned previously the new chair, Laura Swett, and she said at the first meeting that she chaired that her top priority would be connecting data centers to the grid, along with ensuring grid reliability at reasonable prices. Josh, what’s been happening there and what should we be paying particularly close attention to?

Josh Siegel (35:37): Yeah, the big thing we’re tracking, of course, and our FERC reporter, Isa Domínguez, so I sort of moonlight as a FERC reporter occasionally, but yeah, basically Chris Wright Energy Secretary, Chris Wright, issued this request under section 403 of the Department of Energy Organization Act for the commission to initiate a rule speeding connection of data centers to the grid, really dealing with this issue of interconnection and gave a pretty fast timeline for FERC to act on that. He wants action by the spring. So yeah, as you said, I mean FERC chair Laura Swett has seemingly leaned in on this area. They seem poised to issue a rule on it, notice of proposed rulemaking, and then there’s actually some bipartisan interest on it on the hill. I reported on energy committee chair Mike Lee and ranking member Martin Heinrich, who have really not gotten along on much on that committee.

(36:29): There’s been a lot of tensions in that relationship, but they actually issued a letter to FERC saying, we want to see you take action in this area while, of course, keeping state’s rights and consumer utility bills in mind. So there does seem to be great interest across the energy industry on action. I think the details will matter a lot. We’ve seen state utility commissioners sort of push back on maybe some move into their authority in a way that we haven’t seen when it comes to the grid, so it’ll be interesting to see what FERC does here.

Bill Loveless (37:02): Yeah, it seems like that would be a big potential source of conflict, right? States because states maintain considerable authority over what’s built when it comes to the electric grid, unlike natural gas pipelines and oil pipelines where FERC has considerably more authority than the states. But it’s a very complex issue, and one, I would think it’s going to take some time to work out.

Josh Siegel (37:27): We’ve seen a former Republican for chair Mark Christie really express that from a state perspective on like, look, we need to build a lot more generation and quickly, but he thinks the proposal from the energy secretary will undercut that goal. He talks about legal risks and just as he put it in an assault on the traditional authority of the states, who as he notes are really the key players in what kind of generation gets built.

Bill Loveless (37:52): Then of course as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, there’s renewed interest in building nuclear in the United States, other conventional nuclear new reactors, small modular reactors, restarting reactors that had been previously shut down all of these things, and it’s all before the NRC, which is under a lot of pressure from the White House to act quickly and raising fears among some who follow nuclear regulation closely that maybe they’re going to be sideswiping the close scrutiny that NRC is typically administered in the past. So Josh,we need to keep our eye on NRC as well.

Josh Siegel (38:28): Yeah, we do. I mean, we’ve been watching it here at POLITICO on the energy team, and we’ve seen Trump fire NRC Commissioner, Chris Hanson, we’ve seen others quit, and then he has a new one, Ho Nieh. So this is really one of those independent agencies along with FERC. But I think NRC has even been more glaring of where we’ve seen the Trump administration really try to assert themselves and use it as a vehicle to advance their agenda. And the Energy Department has put some very aggressive goals as far as deploying new nuclear reactors here in the next couple of years. So there’s a bipartisan interest, as you said, so I don’t want to totally say this is going to be a political act that will come out of NRC because of the Trump administration. And Ho Nieh is someone who comes from industry and is seen as having respect. He got bipartisan votes out of the Senate. But yeah, definitely going to be watching what they do in the coming months as far as whether they play much of a role in the Trump administration’s nuclear agenda.

Bill Loveless (39:25): Well, of course, it is an election year. The midterms come up in November and raises the question of how much does the upcoming election cycle affect energy and climate policymaking these days? Maxine, I was just reading Frank Maisano, who we all know, I think at the law firm, very small in one of his weekly emails said, as 2026 unfolds energy policy is shaping up to be a defining fault line in the midterm elections, one that will influence how Republicans position themselves heading into the next presidential cycle. How does the election factor into these activities that we’ve been discussing in the Congress among the agencies, and I guess more importantly among voters across the country?

Maxine Joselow (40:18): Well, we see that poll after poll shows that climate change is not a top tier issue for voters, unfortunately for us climate reporters who it is a top tier issue for in our beats. But energy affordability as part of this broader theme of affordability that we’ve been talking about, I do think will be a big issue in the midterm elections and in those special elections that were held earlier last year for the Governor of Virginia and the Governor of New Jersey, Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill respectively did talk often on the campaign trail about energy and energy affordability, and they both won in those states. And Mikie Sherrill, I think even was talking about PJM and data centers and getting a bit wonky with it. So we’ll have to see how much of a concern it is among the many other concerns for voters right now, Venezuela, immigration, et cetera. The list goes on, but certainly I think both parties are going to be looking to use it as a wedge issue to their advantage.

Josh Siegel (41:23): Yeah, no, I think energy affordability will be a top tier issue in terms of electricity prices in a way we haven’t seen before. And it’s been interesting to see the Trump administration’s evolution on this because I think for a while we saw the president really trying to point voters’ attention to gasoline prices being really low, and how, as Maxine mentioned earlier in our conversation, that’s always the most visible thing to voters when it comes to energy prices and utility rates are utility bills are very hard to unpack. We haven’t really seen a huge political emphasis on it, but now, I mean, the Trump administration clearly is scrambling on it, and we see the president and his true social posts talking about data centers and wanting them to build their own generation announced playing up deals that we’re seeing in the tech space around that area. We saw the White House announcements around PJM that I covered last week, so clearly, and we’ve seen Chris Wright acknowledge that electricity prices, and this is an interview I had with him over the summer, are a vulnerability for them, and they’re the party in power. We know that the incumbent usually gets blamed for these kind of things, so we will have to see how it actually trickles down to house and Senate races, but it’s definitely going to be a top tier issue.

Bill Loveless (42:35): Josh, I saw a former colleague, Callie Patteson of The Examiner wrote the other day that Wright told her that he was willing to put his job on the line over electricity prices.

Josh Siegel (42:47): Yeah, no, I mean, he’s been really out there, but again, I think the Trump administration is hoping they could sort of make this argument that it’s the Biden administration’s fault, that it’s because of renewable energy. I mean, we’ve seen that Chris Wright refers to renewable energy as a parasite on the grid. I mean, he’s really consistent in his messaging saying that that’s what’s been driving up rates in a lot of states. But I mean, that’s just politically right. I mean, we haven’t seen great evidence that blaming a prior administration works out. I mean, the Biden administration faced this problem. They were blamed for inflation that a lot of it was not in their control. There was a result of COVID and returning back from that. But we’ll see if that pays off for them. But clearly that’s the strategy is to say there’s a problem, but it’s not our fault, and we’re trying to do what we can now to keep coal plants online to sper more oil and gas generation, but it might not pay off right away.

Bill Loveless (43:43): Well, we’ve covered a lot. And before we go, what I had like to talk a little bit about covering the beat, you’ve each been doing it for some time now and your experience matters. What do you find the hardest to explain to readers about energy and climate policy in Washington, Maxine?

Maxine Joselow (44:05): Well, one of my goals as a reporter is always to explain to readers how seemingly wonky, arcane policy decisions that get made in DC affect real people, affect their lives, their livelihoods, their pocketbooks. And that’s one of my biggest challenges. But I think one of my greatest opportunities in my reporting too, and when I report on the EPA, I always try to connect it back to what this change to the way they’re conducting cost benefit analysis means for the clean air that we all have come to take for granted when we breathe it as a result of steep reductions in air pollution from the Clean Air Act over the past half century. So that’s something I’m going to be trying to do over this next year, 2026, and hopefully going on more reporting trips and traveling across the country and not just staying chained to my desk in dc but actually getting out and talking to real people about how these moves are affecting them.

Bill Loveless(45:03): Josh?

Josh Siegel (45:04): Yeah, I think just covering this unfolding story around the White House’s attempt to ensure really one of the bright spots in the economy, the surge in construction of data centers devoted to AI and how they’re trying to ensure that isn’t overcome by the rising cost of energy and those two political imperatives, how they clash and just making sure we’re clear to readers on what’s actually behind rising prices, what role data centers are having or not having, could they actually help lower prices? There’s an argument and on that side as well. So just making sure we’re really covering it beyond the political rhetoric, which has been pretty aggressive as far as each side wanting to play the blame game already. So I think there’s a lot of complexity there and just want to, it’s a challenge to be honest as far as being clear about what we’re seeing and what we might see going forward, but we’re definitely trying to do our best on the energy team.

Bill Loveless (45:59): You sort of answered a question that I have in mind, but let me ask it anyway. Is there an energy, or a climate story that you think isn’t getting enough attention right now? Maxine?

Maxine Joselow (46:13): I don’t want to say that in front of Josh and have him steal it before I get to report it out, Bill, but that’s a good question. I don’t know. I think the energy and climate press corps here in DC is doing a great job, but there’s always room to cover more that isn’t necessarily part of the national conversation, but maybe there are local stories on climate and energy that it takes, to my earlier answer, getting out of DC to discover.

Josh Siegel (46:46): Yeah, I mean, I think there’s great coverage being done as far as state and local level. I’m really, as someone who covers permitting, it’s been interesting to see how state and local actions to restrict wind and solar developments or NIMBYism the new frontier on that has been interesting to see some backlash in areas that have openly supported renewable energy in the past, like Iowa, I did some reporting there, but would love to have more opportunity around that as midterms kick in and cover how more states are grappling with this need to build more, which is generally something Republicans want to do, but sort of NIMBYism and how we’re starting to see conservatives really push back on renewable development happening near them. So transmission’s long been a part of this conversation as well. So just continuing to cover that and how it’s actually trickling down at the state and local level. But again, there’s been really good reporting on that from others for sure.

Bill Loveless (47:39): Well, there’s a lot to cover there, and I didn’t mean to try to prompt you to scoop yourself in front of one of your competitors, but you’re both covering a lot of ground and there’s so much for us to keep track of in this year, 2026 in Washington, DC and the United States. So Maxine, Josh, thanks for joining us today on the Columbia Energy Exchange.

Maxine Joselow (48:01): Thank you so much.

Josh Siegel (48:02): Appreciate it.",https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Image_Reporters-Roundtable_-Whats-Driving-US-Energy-Policy-News-in-2026.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 14:59:15.398132
