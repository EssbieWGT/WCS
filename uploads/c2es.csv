Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, is demanding that Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin halt plans to dismantle landmark federal climate programs, citing newly revealed documents and warning of harm to American industry and consumers.

According to documents obtained exclusively by Democratic staff on the Senate EPW Committee, the EPA is preparing to shut down the Climate Change Division and Climate Protection Partnership Division within the Office of Atmospheric Protection. These divisions oversee the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) and the widely used Energy Star Program, which has saved Americans more than $500 billion and prevented nearly 4 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions over three decades.

“For the past 15 years, the GHGRP has collected facility-level emissions data from over 8,000 facilities, supplying vital information to policymakers, scientists, investors, and the public,” Whitehouse wrote in a letter to Administrator Zeldin. “These data inform our national GHG inventory, support international emissions reporting, and serve as the de facto standard for many companies’ climate disclosures.”

Whitehouse warned that the proposed rollback would remove a competitive edge for U.S. manufacturers. GHGRP data has shown that American facilities are less carbon-intensive than foreign competitors. Eliminating this program, he argued, would strip U.S. companies of data that allows th

em to market themselves as cleaner than global rivals, including those in China.

“[E]limination of the GHGRP would likely harm the very companies supposed to benefit from fewer reporting requirements,” Whitehouse added. “You will rob American industry of data giving [it a] competitive advantage.”

The documents indicate the agency’s justification for dismantling the GHGRP is based on feedback from industry trade associations, citing a desire to reduce regulatory burdens on oil and natural gas producers. Critics, including Whitehouse, argue the move aligns with the interests of fossil fuel companies, which supported former President Donald Trump’s campaign with significant funding and lobbying efforts aimed at environmental rollbacks.

“EPA’s recent actions—including the elimination of the GHGRP—continue the pattern of allowing polluters to dictate environmental policy,” Whitehouse stated. “Dismantling the GHGRP prioritizes polluter interests over the international competitiveness of American steel, aluminum, fertilizer, cement, and chemicals industries.”

Whitehouse has requested a formal response from Administrator Zeldin by May 14, 2025.",https://eponline.com/-/media/ENV/eponline/Images/2025/051325NSC-Compliance.png,N,,2025-05-13 17:08:47.192406

MONTPELIER, VT - Vermont Department of Public Service","Vermont Business Magazine The Vermont Department of Public Service is pleased to announce a $22.34 million subaward with Vermont Housing Finance Agency (VHFA) as part of the federal Solar for All Program (SFA). This funding represents over a third of Vermont's $62.45 million federal grant from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and will support affordable housing solar initiatives across the state.

SFA was created under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. It will offer $7 billion nationally to help lower the cost of electricity through solar power, which has historically been out of reach for low-income households.

The initiative was championed by Vermont's Congressional delegation, particularly by Senator Bernie Sanders who introduced the Solar for All Program.

“Solar for All will not only combat the existential threat of climate change by making solar energy available to working class families,” said Senator Sanders. “It will also substantially lower the electric bills of Americans and create thousands of good-paying jobs. This is a win for the environment, a win for consumers, and a win for the economy.”

Under this partnership, VHFA will award grants and loans to affordable housing developers to support installation of solar arrays on building rooftops, on-site ground-mounted arrays, or participation in larger off-site community solar installations.

""We are pleased to partner with VHFA to deliver solar options for affordable housing residents,"" remarked Department of Public Service Commissioner Kerrick Johnson. ""Currently, towns with the highest energy burden in Vermont have the least amount of installed solar. That’s why the primary objective of this program is to deliver benefits to disadvantaged Vermonters, regardless of their dwelling status.”

""VHFA is excited to participate in this historic program,"" said VHFA Executive Director Maura Collins. ""The program will assist our residents, who can expect to receive a long-term reduction in their utility costs or equivalent benefits. Solar power will also help affordable housing developers become part of the climate solution by offsetting the increased costs associated with heating with electricity.""

In the coming months, VHFA will hold public outreach sessions with housing developers, residents, and other key stakeholders to further inform the design of the program.

About Vermont’s Solar for All Program

Vermont's application to the EPA includes three separate programs:

The VHFA affordable housing solar initiative, referred to as the Multi-Family Affordable Solar Housing (MASH) Program;

The Affordable Community Renewable Energy (ACRE) Program, which is an existing community solar program run through utilities and will be expanded through the funding made available by SFA; and

The Residential Assistance in Solar Energy (RAISE) Program, which will offer low-income single-family homeowners the opportunity for direct ownership of net-metered rooftop solar installations of up to 5 kilowatts.

Any unobligated funding under this program would be rescinded, if the Committee’s proposal is approved.

DEP received $44.4 million for grants under this program and only a small portion has been obligated so far. Read more here.

DEP would still have federal funding remaining for conventional oil and gas well plugging under the federal Bipartisan Infrastructure Act for its primary well plugging effort and to plug orphan conventional wells, unless Congress acts to rescind the funding.

US House Committee Action

The MERP's waste emissions charge is estimated to raise $7.2 billion in federal revenues and save American families and taxpayers tens of billions in avoided health costs.

In response, EEN Action President & CEO Rev. Dr. Jessica Moerman submitted the following letter urging members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee to oppose efforts to delay or repeal this cost-effective fee on wasted natural gas and instead come together to optimize the MERP program to generate federal revenue, create jobs, and defend the health and lives of our children--

Dear Member of the House Committee for Energy and Commerce,

On behalf of the more than 600,000 pro-life Christians who have voiced their support for methane pollution safeguards over the last decade, I write to urge you to oppose efforts to repeal the Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP) and delay implementation of the Waste Emissions Charge (WEC) in the forthcoming budget reconciliation package.

As evangelical Christians, we believe that all human life is sacred and worthy of protection.

We are committed to defending life, especially that of our children both born and unborn, from all harms.

This includes harms from pollution from carbon-based energy, which medical research finds is the leading environmental threat to children’s health.

Air pollution emitted with wasted natural gas is linked to the development and exacerbation of asthma, other respiratory diseases, cancer due to exposure to carcinogenic benzenes, heart disease, premature death, and poor birth outcomes including birth defects, low birth weight, and premature birth, and even stillbirth.

Together, air pollution associated with methane waste emissions from the oil and gas sector is estimated to cost Americans $77 billion in health impacts each year, with energy-producing regions most affected.

While some have called the WEC a tax on natural gas that companies will pass on to consumers; in truth consumers are already paying a natural gas tax: through $77 billion per year in health costs, poor health, and the grief of losing a loved one early from exposure to toxic pollution that can be avoided by capturing wasted natural gas.

To defend the health of our children, energy workers, and their families, our country must curtail needlessly wasted natural gas.

The MERP is a fiscally responsible, market-based measure designed to curb methane waste that will raise billions in federal revenues and save American families and taxpayers tens of billions in avoided health costs.

While the current draft text extends the WEC through 2035, it simultaneously delays its start date by a full decade—pushing the first year of covered emissions from 2024 to 2034 and effectively gutting the program’s impact for the next ten years.

The delayed implementation of the fee until 2034 would eliminate $7.2 billion in projected federal revenue and allow for another decade the egregious waste of $1 billion in lost commercial value per year.

While concerns have been raised that a fee to encourage the oil and gas sector to capture wasted natural gas could negatively impact small producers, the MERP was specifically designed to support small producers in reducing their methane waste.

As part of the program, only the largest producers would be assessed a fee, which would end once methane waste emissions are sufficiently reduced.

Furthermore, federal taxpayers have already provided generous financial assistance to assist industry in reducing methane waste, with much of the $1.55 billion in MERP grant funding already out the door.

Much of this assistance was aimed at lowering the bar for small producers to put in place waste reduction technologies.

Wasted natural gas is not only poor stewardship of our energy resources but robs our children and loved ones from reaching their full God-given potential.

Excessive methane waste should be assessed a fee to defend the health of our children, ensure taxpayers are compensated for the loss of a valuable American resource, and encourage oil and gas partners to address the energy emergency by bringing more gas to market instead of wasting it into thin air.

Now is not the time to put a significant federal revenue raiser on the sidelines.

We urge you to oppose efforts to repeal the Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP) and delay implementation of the Waste Emissions Charge (WEC).

We instead urge the committee to come together for discussion and dialogue on optimizing the implementation of MERP to generate federal revenue, create jobs, and defend the life of our children.

This Clean Air Month, the DNR’s Air Management Program is highlighting the nonattainment challenges facing Wisconsin and sharing resources available for individuals, businesses and communities to stay informed about air quality.

Wisconsin’s air quality successes over the last 20 years include an 88% decrease in sulfur dioxide concentrations, a 26% decrease in fine particle pollution and a 21% decrease in statewide ozone concentrations. Still, even as air pollution has declined over the past few decades, that trend has slowed in recent years. Longstanding issues such as unique geography and meteorology and transported emissions continue to impact the air quality along Wisconsin’s Lake Michigan shoreline.

Additionally, impacts from increased wildfire activity make it more challenging to meet today’s U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) air quality standards.

Ozone pollution remains a particularly complex challenge for Wisconsin. The EPA estimates Wisconsin contributes no more than 10% of the ozone concentrations measured in ozone nonattainment areas, while other states contribute as much as 50% (the remaining contributions are from non-state sources, like emissions from natural sources).

Ozone forming pollutants – volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) – are emitted by upwind states and transported over Lake Michigan, where they react and form ozone, which is then carried onshore via lake breezes. This process can often lead to elevated ozone levels in Wisconsin’s lakeshore counties, even though a large portion of that pollution comes from other states, explains DNR Air Management Program Director Gail Good.

Wisconsin continues to seek effective federal rules to address and control pollutant transport. “Though Wisconsin does not emit the majority of the air pollution currently in the state, we are responsible for meeting federal air quality standards regardless of where the pollutants originate,” Good said. “The State of Wisconsin is working to ensure that rules addressing ozone transport adequately and fully resolve ozone transport obligations for Wisconsin and ensure Wisconsin businesses are not held responsible for nonattainment issues they have no control over.”

Over the past three years, companies have made plans to invest more than $843 billion across the United States in projects aimed at reducing planet-warming emissions, driven by lucrative tax credits for clean energy provided by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

But only about $321 billion of that money has actually been spent, with many projects still on the drawing board, according to data made public on Tuesday by the Clean Investment Monitor, a joint project of the Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Now, much of the rest, about $522 billion, will depend on action playing out on Capitol Hill. Starting on Tuesday, Republicans in Congress will begin a contentious debate over proposals to roll back tax credits for low-carbon energy as they search for ways to pay for a roughly $4 trillion tax cut package favored by President Trump.

A draft bill issued on Monday by Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee would effectively end most of the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax incentives.

A tax credit for low-carbon electricity sources like wind, solar, nuclear or geothermal power would be phased out over the next few years. Rebates for consumers to buy electric vehicles would mostly disappear by the end of 2025. Tax breaks for domestic factories that make batteries or solar panels would end by 2031 and would contain new restrictions that could make them extremely difficult to access. Incentives for producing hydrogen fuels would end this year.

While shrinking those tax credits could help Republicans save hundreds of billions of dollars, it could also cause companies to abandon plans for new nuclear reactors or battery factories. More than three-quarters of pending investments were planned in Republican-held congressional districts.

“It’s jobs, it’s tax revenue into local communities,” said Ben King, an associate director at the Rhodium Group, a research firm that tracks investment data with M.I.T.’s Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research. “It does represent a meaningful economic change in some of these places.”

The prospect of repeal has set off a furious lobbying battle in Washington, with energy companies pleading with lawmakers to preserve the tax breaks.

At least three dozen Republicans have asked their colleagues to keep at least some tax credits to protect jobs in their districts and reduce electricity prices. But a nearly equal number of conservative House members are pushing publicly to kill the climate law altogether.

One Republican supporter is Representative Juan Ciscomani of Arizona, whose district includes an electric vehicle factory and several solar projects under construction. “When I looked initially at the energy tax credits and how they were benefiting Arizona, a lot of those projects were underway, the jobs had been created, the ball was more than rolling at that point,” Mr. Ciscomani, who was elected in 2022, said. “So it made sense for me to stand up for that.”

If the tax credits are completely rescinded, it would sharply reduce future demand for electric vehicles, batteries, solar panels and wind turbines, according to projections by the Rhodium Group. The effect would be compounded if the Trump administration moved forward as planned with undoing Biden-era tailpipe pollution limits for cars and trucks, which would have pushed automakers to sell more electric vehicles.

The uncertainty around the tax credits, as well as confusion over Mr. Trump’s tariffs, has led many low-carbon energy companies to put their investment plans on hold.

In the Midwest, Heliene, a solar manufacturer, has paused plans to build a $350 million factory that would produce cells for solar panels, which today mostly come from China. Martin Pochtaruk, Heliene’s chief executive, said it was too risky to finance the plant without clarity on whether Congress would maintain tax credits for domestic energy manufacturing.

“Right now, we see a lot of folks just waiting,” said Jason Grumet, chief executive of the American Clean Power Association, a renewable industry trade group. “People are not canceling things, but they’re also not breaking ground.”

“There is a remarkable tension right now, between probably the best fundamentals for investment in the energy sector that we’ve seen in a generation and the greatest amount of uncertainty that we’ve seen in the generation,” Mr. Grumet said. “That is a collision that all manufacturing now is trying to navigate.”

The Fate of Low-Carbon Electricity

The biggest tax breaks in the Inflation Reduction Act were for companies that build power plants that generate electricity without emitting any planet-warming greenhouse gases. Those credits were set to remain in place for many years to come, until emissions from the U.S. electricity sector fell 75 percent from 2022 levels.

So far, power companies have mainly taken advantage of these credits to propose new solar, wind and battery plants in places like Texas, California, Wyoming and Arizona, since those technologies are ready today. But the credit was designed to also spur a wave of innovative nuclear reactors, advanced geothermal plants, fusion plants, hydroelectric dams and novel types of batteries over the next decade.

The credits have already allowed developers to install solar panels on sites as varied as a carport in New Mexico and a shuttered coal plant in Illinois, said Russ Bates, chief executive of NXTGEN Clean Energy Solutions, a low-carbon energy developer.

Yet those credits may wind down much faster than many companies expected. Under the House bill issued on Monday, the full clean-electricity credits would only apply to new power plants that are “in service” by 2028, which would exclude a large array of wind, solar, nuclear and geothermal plants that are under development but won’t be completed by then. The credits would then phase down and disappear after 2031.

In South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, recently warned that, without the tax credits, efforts to expand nuclear power in his state “are dead.”

What Congress decides could reshape the nation’s power grids. If the credits are repealed entirely or severely restricted, one study found, wind and solar installations would likely fall by half over the next decade, while electric utilities would burn more fossil fuels like coal and gas instead. That could lead to higher electricity prices, since renewables are often the quickest and easiest source of power for utilities to build. Emissions would also rise.

Risks for Domestic Supply Chains

Perhaps the most visible effect of the Inflation Reduction Act so far has been a surge of domestic manufacturing. Four years ago, the United States had hardly any capacity to build solar panels, wind turbines or lithium-ion batteries. Most of that happened in China and elsewhere.

That’s quickly changing.

The law gave hefty tax breaks to wind and solar developers if they used components made in the United States. It also doled out additional tax credits for domestic clean-energy factories. In addition, billions of dollars in funding from a 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law allowed the Biden administration to support domestic supply chains, including mining for key elements like lithium.

That has had a major effect in places like Dalton, Ga., once known as the nation’s carpet manufacturing capital. In 2023, Hanwha Qcells, a Korean solar company, announced it would invest $2.5 billion to expand its factory in Dalton, creating the largest solar panel manufacturing facility in the Western Hemisphere.

“It’s a newer technology for us, but it’s one we’re excited to be making right here,” said Jason Mock, president of the Greater Dalton Chamber of Commerce.

If all the solar factories currently planned in the United States get built, the country would have the capacity to produce three times as many solar panel modules as were installed in 2024, according to an analysis by the Rhodium Group and M.I.T. Yet the solar industry is still reliant on countries like China for many underlying components, such as the polysilicon wafers.

It’s a similar story for batteries: The number of U.S. factories that are currently planned would build enough lithium-ion modules and cells to satisfy future demand for electric vehicles, although progress has been much slower in building up domestic supplies of raw ingredients like graphite and lithium.

It’s not clear if those supply chains will survive. In the House draft bill, Republicans proposed sharp new restrictions on the use of materials from China, which could make it difficult for many U.S. factories to qualify.

The bill would also end by next year a $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric cars that is available for buyers of cars largely produced in the United States. That would reduce demand for electric vehicles, which would in turn affect a broad swath of battery manufacturing and demand for critical minerals like lithium.

At least 24 factories have been set up in the United States to produce electric cars that qualify for the credit, including a Ford plant making plug-in hybrids in Louisville, Ky., and a General Motors battery plant in Ohio, according to a study from Atlas Public Policy, a research firm.

Near Savannah, Ga., Hyundai invested in a $7.5 billion factory to build some of its most popular electric vehicle models, which qualify for the consumer credit. Local politicians, who spent years persuading Hyundai to come to the site, are concerned about possible changes to law.

“It’s difficult for a company to invest somewhere and then conditions change,” said Bert Brantley, chief executive of the Savannah Area Chamber of Commerce. “So our take is that some consistency is helpful for companies as they make large investments.”

Still, Mr. Brantley said he hoped that Georgia could continue to be a leader in electric vehicle production regardless of what happens to the tax credits. “This is a long-term play, we hope to be at it for a long time,” he said.

Other Energy Technologies in Limbo

Over the past three years, the federal government has also been supporting a broad array of emerging energy technologies that are less mature, including low-carbon hydrogen fuels that could power trucks, new processes to make cement and steel without emissions, as well as technologies to pull carbon dioxide out of the air.

Many of these projects could potentially qualify for tax breaks in the Inflation Reduction Act. Others have been supported by billions of dollars in grants and loans from the Department of Energy.

In Western Minnesota, DG Fuels plans a $5 billion plant to produce aviation fuel from agricultural waste. In Indiana, Heidelberg Materials, a cement maker, wants to capture the carbon dioxide it emits and bury it underground. In Louisiana, a company is planning to make a low-carbon ammonia that could be used for fertilizer.

New Orleans, which has become a major hub for exporting natural gas, has seen a boom in new industries like carbon capture and hydrogen that could help cut emissions in the future. “We’re becoming very diversified,” said Michael Hecht, president of Greater New Orleans, Inc., the economic development agency for southeast Louisiana.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/12/multimedia/00cli-energyinvest-wind2-zptm/00cli-energyinvest-wind2-zptm-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 15:12:13.178292

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), enacted in 2022, marked a seismic shift in U.S. industrial and energy policy, promising clarity and stability to a previously fragmented clean energy landscape. It introduced comprehensive, decade-spanning incentives designed to catalyze investments across renewables, hydrogen hubs, electric vehicles, and domestic manufacturing. Almost immediately, this legislation became a magnet for institutional capital and strategic corporate commitments, prompting over $200 billion in clean energy and manufacturing investments in its first year alone. America appeared to be reclaiming its position as a global clean-energy leader, driven by a coherent industrial policy that many international investors applauded and enthusiastically embraced.

Perhaps most importantly, it was the return of big industrial policy, in fact almost any industrial policy, to the United States. The concept went out of favor in the country, and its intellectual close follower the United Kingdom, much more so than in the rest of the West. Europe certainly didn’t have the coherence and focus of China, but it did manage to have an industrial policy, hence the reason it still has heavy industry and commercial ship building. But with the IRA, the United States was back in the industrial policy game, and focused on the economy of the future.

But now, barely two years into this promising trajectory, a House Republican bill just released dubbed “The One Big, Beautiful Bill“—Trump and company appear to be going out of their way to make governance look silly—is going to hobble movement. The proposed rollback will dismantle key IRA provisions, including clean energy production and investment tax credits, domestic manufacturing incentives, and targeted hydrogen production support, ending some programs far ahead of schedule. This abrupt about-face in regulatory direction sends a jarring signal to global markets. After promoting a compelling narrative of stable, long-term incentives, the U.S. is doubling down on being fragmented and unreliable, effectively advertising itself as closed for business to international investors who had previously been attracted by precisely the kind of policy consistency the IRA initially represented.

The implications for institutional investors globally are significant. For instance, the proposed elimination of transferable clean energy credits would abruptly terminate a mechanism widely seen as revolutionary for project financing. Transferability had expanded market access, simplifying financial structures, attracting more diverse pools of capital, and opening pathways for non-traditional investors—such as foreign institutions—to participate directly in American clean energy projects. Now, under the proposed legislation, these opportunities vanish, reinstating barriers that limit investment primarily to large, tax-equity-driven domestic investors. International institutional capital, which recently found the U.S. clean energy market compellingly attractive, will be pushed back onto the sidelines and will redirect toward other regions offering more predictable returns and consistent regulatory frameworks.

This policy reversal also critically undermines recent progress in domestic clean manufacturing, a major growth segment, especially in red states and counties. Prior to the IRA, the U.S. had largely ceded all dominance in solar, battery production, electric vehicles, and advanced materials to China and other Asian economies. With IRA incentives, however, American manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines, battery cells, and critical minerals gained traction, starting to reverse decades of offshoring. Billions of dollars flowed into regions such as Georgia, Ohio, and Michigan, promising a manufacturing renaissance anchored in clean technology and the energy transition. But with the new House proposal shortening or outright ending crucial manufacturing credits, projects that once looked profitable and secure now face existential threats. This sudden evaporation of incentives jeopardizes factory expansions and new plant developments, with multinational corporations likely to relocate and reconsider future investments in jurisdictions perceived as more stable, notably the European Union or Canada.

Hydrogen hubs and associated infrastructure are equally vulnerable, which is a mixed blessing. As I noted a month ago when especially blue state hubs were rumored to be on the chopping block, cutting hydrogen for energy plays would accidentally be the right thing to do, and it appears that’s being followed through on. The IRA established a generous production tax credit for clean hydrogen intended to help build a robust domestic hydrogen economy, essential for decarbonizing hard-to-electrify sectors like refining and ammonia. Numerous regional hydrogen hubs attracted major global players eager to capitalize on these incentives, driving planning and early-stage development across the nation. But the House Republican bill dramatically truncates these incentives, imposing unrealistic construction deadlines that effectively render the hydrogen credit irrelevant to most developers. Institutional investors, who typically seek stable policy environments, will likely respond by halting or reducing their exposure to the emerging U.S. hydrogen market. Instead, they’ll redirect their capital towards European and Asian markets that offer clearer, longer-term commitments and strategic certainty.

Unsurprisingly, carbon capture incentives, including those related to blue hydrogen, aren’t touched in the bill. While Trump’s steroid-addled stampede through the economic China shop has added significantly to the structural headwinds facing the United State’s oil and gas industry, he can’t be directly removing their subsidies after all. On a similar note, electric vehicle incentives are on the chopping block too.

This new American uncertainty is especially advantageous to global competitors, primarily China and the European Union. China, already dominant in renewable energy supply chains, battery production, and electric vehicles, stands to gain significantly from U.S. flailing. The country continues to offer clear, consistent, and strategically aligned policies that attract long-term investment, reinforcing its supply-chain dominance. European policymakers, similarly, have responded to the IRA not by retreating but by solidifying their own incentives under the European Green Deal and various national strategies. Countries like Germany and France are aggressively courting clean technology investors through predictable regulatory frameworks, tax incentives, and public funding. As U.S. regulatory unpredictability grows, the EU emerges as a natural beneficiary, becoming an increasingly attractive destination for investment that might have otherwise flowed to the United States.

Of course, this further eliminates any pretense that the United States is a leader or even a reliable partner on the most important file of the 21st Century, climate change. Europe and China will continue to lead on this crucial file as the United States further isolates itself.

From an innovation standpoint, the abrupt legislative shifts disrupts U.S. attempts at technological leadership in new clean technologies. IRA incentives created a predictable market environment that accelerated innovation in emerging technologies like advanced geothermal, long-duration energy storage, and next-generation battery chemistries. While I don’t think much of advanced geothermal electrical generation, and said so at length in a dozen-part series recently, advanced drilling techniques are strongly advantageous for geothermal heat exchange and seasonal heat storage. Venture capital firms and global investors began allocating funds to early-stage U.S. companies, banking on stable, policy-backed demand growth. As these incentives abruptly vanish, the U.S. will lose its position as a destination for innovative capital in the space, ceding technological breakthroughs and intellectual property generation to more stable policy environments, particularly in Europe and East Asia. The innovation ecosystem in the U.S., once considered unmatched, faces potentially significant setbacks, undermining decades of competitive advantages carefully nurtured through previous policy and funding programs.

This is on top of the Trump Administration’s attacks on research and academia, attacks most analogous to Mao’s Cultural Revolution, ironically. The gutting of secondary grants for lab space and administration, the ideological attacks on climate science, health research and similar areas, and the attacks on foreign residents of all non-white hues are leading to brain drain instead of brain gain. The global conveyor belt of hungry, innovative, intelligent talent to the United States is stopping. The One Big, Beautiful Bill is just another nail in the country’s innovation coffin.

Ultimately, the tabled legislative rollback represents far more than just a domestic policy change. It signifies the breakdown of a coherent U.S. industrial strategy that, for a brief but impactful period, successfully combined climate ambition with economic opportunity. It reintroduces uncertainty precisely when certainty is most critical, signaling to global investors that America is neither reliable nor consistent in its strategic priorities. The clear message now resonating throughout global financial centers is that the U.S. investment market, previously seen as open and inviting, is volatile and unpredictable, prompting a long-term exodus of capital and talent to regions offering clearer and more stable frameworks.

The bill isn’t law yet. But investors will already be reading it and changing their investment strategies. Chinese and European policy strategists will be rubbing their hands with glee, and contacting global institutional investors to invite them to divert money to welcoming economies with stable policies.

The House Republican bill represents not merely a shift in policy but a profound strategic miscalculation. It closes American access to many of the global capital and innovation flows necessary to compete economically in the 21st century. Meanwhile, China and Europe stand ready to capitalize on these mistakes, capturing the investment, manufacturing opportunities, and technological breakthroughs that were within America’s grasp, undoubtedly reshaping the global economic and geopolitical landscape for decades to come.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ChatGPT-Image-May-12-2025-07_35_36-PM.png,N,,2025-05-13 15:12:17.414384

Climate, energy and transport are now split apart, and climate and energy are relegated to conservative-led ministries where many climate researchers fear they won't get enough attention.","VIENNA – Vienna's city hall, with its stone towers and gargoyles, often reminds visitors of another neo-gothic building, says city council member Nina Abrahamczik.

""Children who come with the school classes are like, 'Oh, it looks like Hogwarts,'"" she says.

But Abrahamczik, who heads the city's climate and environment committee, says this building has something Hogwarts doesn't: solar panels.

When Vienna began requiring all new buildings and building extensions add solar panels two years ago, Abrahamczik says they also felt it was important to add panels to city hall. The panels aren't visible from the ground, so the city can maintain the building's 19th century look, while cutting climate pollution. ""That's something where also our job as a role model comes into play,"" Abrahamczik says. ""We have to show how it's possible.""

Vienna takes its job as a climate role model seriously. In addition to mandating solar panels and energy-efficient buildings, Vienna is now heating thousands of homes with geothermal energy instead of planet-heating natural gas. It's building massive heat pumps. It's investing in new infrastructure to help adapt to heat waves and floods. And this spring Vienna passed a historic climate law, outlining a plan to get its climate pollution down to zero by 2040.

Vienna is home to one in five Austrians, and its climate action is increasingly important for the country's climate leadership, says Gernot Wagner, Columbia University climate economist and an advisor for Vienna's Mayoral Advisory council. Austria's newly elected federal government is deprioritizing climate action, Wagner says. In the new coalition government, the ecological Green Party is out, and conservatives, who are less interested in climate action, have gained power. ""At the federal level things are taking a step back, climate is taking a back seat,"" he says.

Meanwhile Vienna is forging ahead, and its experience as a climate leader holds lessons and inspiration for cities around the world.

Cities — including those in the U.S. — can make a big dent in cutting climate pollution based on their policy actions, says Nathan Hultman, director of the Center for Global Sustainability at the University of Maryland. That's because 70 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions come from cities.

Hultman's group found city and state climate policies could drive down U.S. emissions 54 to 62% below 2005 levels by 2035, even with federal inaction or reversals of climate action. ""From a pure numbers standpoint,"" Hultman says, ""actions that are taken in cities can in fact have a real impact.""

Cities play a big role in cutting fossil fuels

At the edge of an old airfield in eastern Vienna there's a 15-story tall drilling rig where men in hardhats move seven-inch metal pipes. The clangs of the pipes echo as they fall to the ground.

Bernhard Novotny, project director for the site, says the pipes are for geothermal wells. The wells stretch miles underground to extract boiling water that lies under the earth's subsurface. That hot water will heat 20,000 Viennese homes by 2028, Novotny says.

Vienna has a goal of getting its buildings completely off gas by 2040. The city got off Russian gas in January, Wien Energie spokesman Alexander Hoor, says. Getting off gas ties into the city's climate goals because gas infrastructure leaks methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and gas also releases carbon dioxide when burned. To get off gas, Vienna plans to heat buildings using heat pumps, capturing gases from waste, burning waste, and geothermal wells.

These geothermal wells are a joint-venture between Vienna-based energy company, OMV, and Vienna's municipal heating and electrical utility, Wien Energie. Being a municipal utility means the company has a stable climate strategy linked to Vienna's, says Rusbeh Rezania, Wien Energie's head of decarbonized heating. That consistency has given Wien Energie flexibility to experiment with new combinations of energy sources, Resania says. ""We are not like a private company in which the strategy is changing every year or every two years,"" Rezania says. "" We have time to learn, and we can have time to use the right technology.""

In addition to innovating ways to cut climate pollution, Vienna is finding new ways to hold itself accountable for its climate goals, says Jürgen Czernohorszky, executive city councilor responsible for climate and environment.

Vienna's new climate law now requires projects of the city and municipal companies to detail both the financial costs of the project and the planet-heating emissions costs. ""There's now a city climate budget which allows us to plan not only in Euro, but also in CO2,"" Czernohorszky says.

And if individuals or organizations find that Vienna isn't living up to its climate goals, the law has a remedy for that, too, says Katharina Rogenhofer, head of the Austrian climate think tank Kontext Institute for Climate Matters. If Vienna isn't taking promised climate actions, the public ""can actually go to court and then trigger those processes.""

Vienna leads as Austria slows down

Vienna is leading on climate action at a time when the new Austrian federal government is losing momentum, Wagner says. In the previous Austrian government, the Green party was in charge of a large ministry with climate, energy, and transport grouped together so it could be more effective. ""This Austrian climate super-ministry, if you will,"" Wagner says.

In Austria's new coalition government, which came into office in March, the Green party is out of power. Climate, energy and transport are now split apart, and climate and energy are relegated to conservative-led ministries where many climate researchers fear they won't get enough attention.

Things are not as bad for climate as they could have been, Czernohorszky, a member of the Social Democrats party which is part of the coalition, says. The country narrowly avoided a far-right government that promised to cut billions of dollars worth of climate measures. ""We looked into an abyss of abandoning every climate policy Austria has come up with in the last decade,"" Czernohorszky says. "" The alternative would've been rather bad for everybody.""

Stefan Gara of the liberal NEOS party, part of the coalition government, writes in an email he wants to make ""clear how important the issue of climate is to us at NEOS.""

The conservative ÖVP party, also in the coalition, didn't respond to NPR's request for comment.

Austria still has a goal of reaching ""climate neutrality"" by 2040, like Vienna. For Austria, that means both cutting fossil fuel use and trying to store carbon dioxide underground. It's unclear if the Austrian federal government will reach the goal, Wagner says. But Vienna is a different story, says Karl Steininger, professor of climate economics at the University of Graz.

""Vienna said, if [federal politicians] don't go ahead,"" Steininger says, ""We'll go ahead. And set an example that others can follow.""

Vienna offers a pollution-cutting model — to a point

Vienna offers a climate action model for cities around the world, says Andy Deacon, co-managing director of the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy. Deacon says city governments can play a key role in cutting emissions through policies in areas like public transit, food waste, building codes and energy.

Not all of Vienna's climate actions are replicable in cities like the U.S. For example, while Vienna is able to achieve pollution reductions through its municipal electric utility, around 70 percent of Americans get their electricity from private investor-owned utilities. It can often be hard to compel private utilities to move away from fossil fuels, says David Pomerantz, the executive director of the Energy and Policy institute, a utility watchdog group.

""Who can make an investor-owned utility do something they don't want to do? It ultimately runs through public utility commissions. A lot of them are openly hostile to anything that smacks of climate stuff,"" Pomerantz says.

Still Justin Bibb, the mayor of Cleveland, says his city is forging ahead on reaching the city's goal of climate neutrality by 2050. He's focusing on areas his city does control, like energy-efficient building standards and electric vehicle infrastructure.

""The tools and levers I have, I'm gonna keep using them. And while we don't have a good partner in DC,"" Bibb says, ""as the mayor, I still gotta deliver. I still gotta lead. I still gotta get stuff done.""

Ready for when pendulum swings again

Researchers say city governments hold key tools to help their communities adapt to climate change's growing risks.

Vienna is seeing increased flooding because of climate change, including a 1,000 year flood event in September. Abrahamczik says increased flood risk is why the city is building ""sponge cities"". That's when cities incorporate things like sand, ponds and green spaces in urban design to soak up excess water and better manage flooding. Because Vienna is seeing more deadly heatwaves, it's planting trees for shade, and expanding district cooling, a climate-friendly alternative to air conditioning.

Wagner says while Austria's federal government right now isn't as active on climate change, he hopes ""the pendulum will swing back"".

In the meantime, Abrahamczik says Vienna isn't waiting around. "" Waiting for others is something we cannot afford in the time of climate crisis,"" she says. ""We are done waiting.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2400x1350+0+251/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc0%2Fd0%2Fc54ca01f4e8885dda9726bafcabc%2Fdsc6419-2.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 15:13:15.906558

The plans are part of a reconciliation package being debated by Congress aimed at forcing through cuts to essential services for working families to give tax breaks to billionaires and large corporations.

This climate realism agenda can come in left- and right-wing flavors.","Second, Donald Trump is the President of the United States. He began the process to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement on January 20, 2025, his first day in office in his second term. (He, of course, did this in his first term as well.) He illegally froze funding for climate programs that had passed and became law during the Biden administration, and his administration continues to ignore court orders to unfreeze these monies. He has signed numerous executive orders, including onreinvigorating clean [sic] coal,reversing state-level climate policies, “Zero-based regulatory budgeting to unleash American energy,” and “unleashing” American energy, the last of which revoked more than a dozen Biden era executive orders.

How do we address a world that is increasingly shaped by these two facts?

One attempt can be seen in the Council on Foreign Relations’s new “Climate Realism Initiative.” Its statement of purpose attempts to make climate action palatable to MAGA world by securitizing it, framing climate change as a foreign threat to Fortress America. It calls for investing in next-generation technologies and geoengineering in the hopes of leapfrogging the Chinese-led clean energy revolution that is beginning to decarbonize the world today is the best realistic way forward.

This attempt is doomed to failure. Real climate realism for the United States is to stop the destruction of American state capacity, and then to reflect and build on areas of core strength including finance and software.

CRI’s launch document does not call for the U.S. to reduce its own emissions. I’ll say that again: There is no call for the U.S. to reduce its own emissions in the essay establishing the mission and objectives of the Climate Realism Initiative. Written by Varun Sivaram, formerly chief strategy and innovation officer at wind energy developer Orsted and now the leader of the initiative, the essay proposes that four dug-in “fallacies” are getting in the way of effective policy-making: that climate change “poses a manageable risk” to the U.S.; that “the world’s climate targets are achievable;” that the clean energy transition is a “win-in for U.S. interests and climate action;” and that “reducing U.S. domestic greenhouse gas emissions can make a meaningful difference.” For Sivaram, the problem is always other places and their emissions.

He then goes on to propose three “pillars” of climate realism: the need for America to prepare for a world “blowing through climate targets;” to “invest in globally competitive clean technology industries;” and to “lead international efforts to avert truly catastrophic climate change.” How an America that does not commit to reduce its own emissions will have any credibility or standing to lead international efforts is left unstated.

Sivaram attempts to trick the reader into overlooking America’s emissions by ignoring the facts of the past and focusing instead on guesses about the future. It’s true that in 2023, China produced more than a quarter of new global carbon pollution — more than the United States, Europe, and India combined. But no country has contributed more to the blanket of pollution that traps additional heat in our atmosphere than the United States, which has emitted over 430 billion tons of CO2, or 23% of the world’s total historical emissions. Even in 2023, the U.S. remained the world’s number two carbon polluter.

Sivaram goes further than merely minimizing the U.S. role in creating our current climate problems. Indeed, he sets up climate change as a problem that foreign countries are imposing on Americans. “Foreign emissions,” he writes, “are endangering the American homeland,” and the effects of climate disasters “resemble those if China or Indonesia were to launch missiles at the United States.” There is something to this rhetoric that is powerful — we should think about climate-induced disasters as serious threats and respond to them with the kind of resources that we lavish on the military industrial complex. But the idea that it is foreign emissions that are the primary source of this danger is almost Trumpian.

The initiatives proposed in the Climate Realism launch are the initiatives of giving up. Investing in resilience and adaptation is needed in any scenario, but tying this spending on adaptation to Trumpian notions of protecting our borders reeks of discredited lifeboat ethics, which only cares to save ourselves and leaves others to suffer for our sins. And while supporting next-generation technologies is an appropriate piece of the policy puzzle, they should be like the broccoli at a steakhouse: off to the side and mostly superfluous compared with the meat and potatoes of deployment and mitigation to decarbonize today.

Sivaram may argue that there’s no point in trying to compete against China in the technologies of today when Chinese firms are so dominant and apparently willing to make these products while earning minimal profits. And from a parochial profit-maximizing perspective, there is a business case that firms should not be building lots of new solar cell manufacturing facilities given global manufacturing capacity.

But if American automotive firms simply ignore the coming EV wave and hope against hope that some breakthrough in solid state batteries will allow them to leapfrog over the firms vying today, they are fooling themselves. Electric vehicle giant BYD and world-leading battery manufacturer CATL have both announced batteries that can charge a car in five minutes. Both are also moving in the solid state space, and CATL is pushing into sodium ion batteries.

The notion that U.S. firms ought to sit out this fight for strategic reasons also ignores how China has come to dominate these sectors — by investing in today’s state of the art and pushing it forward through incremental process improvements at scale. The Thielian notion that “competition is for losers” leads to an immense amount of waste as wannabe founders search for unbreakable technological advantages. If venture capitalists want to fund such bets, I’m not going to stop them. But as a policy prescription for climate realism, it fails.

The final gambit of the essay is to advocate for America-controlled geoengineering. This, too, is an area where research may be needed. But regardless, it is the kind of emergency backup plan that you hope that you never need to use, rather than something that should be central to anyone’s policy strategy. Trump is currently decimating American capacity to research hard problems, whether they be cancer or vaccines or social science or anything else, so it is difficult to imagine that this administration is likely to spend real resources to investigate geoengineering.

The Climate Realism Initiative pitches itself as “bipartisan.” But where is the MAGA coalition that supports this? Even simple spending on adaptation and resilience seems unlikely to find much of a political home given the Trump administration’s drastic cuts in weather and disaster forecasting. Sivaram even mentions the need to balance the budget as part of climate realism, which must be a sick joke. For all of the fanfare over cuts to the federal government under Trump, the budget deficit is the last thing that they care about. Tax cuts remain the coin of the realm, with the House budgetary guidelines expanding the deficit by $2.8 trillion. Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, similarly, has a distorted notion of government efficiency, ignoring the returns to government investments and gutting the tax collection capacity of the IRS.

The Biden administration had plans — “all of the above” energy among them — that were coherent, if not necessarily the most appealing to the world. They were based on the idea that a resilient climate coalition in the U.S. required more than just deploying Chinese-made products.

CRI seems to want to engage instead in a fantasy conversation where anti-Chinese nationalism can unite Americans to fight climate change — an all-form, no-content negative sum realpolitik that does little to address the real, compelling, and deeply political questions that the climate crisis poses.

Alternative visions are possible. The American economy is services based. Americans and American firms will inevitably make some of the hardware components of the energy transition, but the opportunities that play to our strengths are mostly on the software side.

It is critical to remember that the clean technologies that power the energy transition are categorically different from the fossil fuels that the world burned (and still burns) for energy. We do not require a constant stream of these technologies to operate our economy. The solar panels on your roof or in the field outside of town still generate electricity even if you can’t buy new ones because of a trade war. Same with wind turbines. In fact, renewables are a source of energy security because the generation happens from domestic natural resources — the sun and wind. Yet smart thinkers like Jake Sullivan fall into the trap of treating “dependence” on Chinese renewable technologies as analogous to European dependence on Russian natural gas.

Even China’s ban on U.S.-bound rare earth exports won’t make much of a dent. Despite the name, rare earths aren’t that rare, and while China does dominate their processing, it’s a tiny industry; in making fun of the “critical” nature of rare earths, Bloomberg opinion writer Javier Blas noted that the total imports of rare earths from China to the U.S. in 2024 was $170 million, or about 0.03% of U.S.-China trade. That being said, the major concern is if supplies fall to zero then major processes that require tiny amounts of rare earths (like Yttria and turbine construction) could be completely halted with serious fallout.

The American government should carefully choose what industries it would like to support. Commodity factories that have little-to-no profits, like solar cells, seem unattractive. There are many more jobs in installing solar than there are in manufacturing it, after all.

On the other hand, sectors with a much larger existing domestic industry, such as wind turbines and especially automobiles, should not be left to wither. But rather than a tariff wall to protect them, the U.S. auto firms should be encouraged to partner with the leading firms — even if those firms are Chinese — to build joint ventures in the American heartland, so that they and the American people can participate in the EV shift.

But the core of real climate realism for the United States is not about new factories. It’s about playing to our strengths. The United States has the best finance and technology sectors in the world, and these should be used to help decarbonize at home and around the world. This climate realism agenda can come in left- and right-wing flavors. A leftist vision is likely state-led with designs, guides, and plans, while the right-wing vision relies on markets.

Take Texas. On May 7, 2020, the Texas grid set a record with 21.4 gigawatts of renewable electricity generation. Just five years later, that figure hit 41.9 gigawatts. Solar and batteries have exploded on the grid, with capacity hitting 30 gigawatts and 10 gigawatts respectively. They have grown so rapidly because of the state’s market-based system, with its low barriers to interconnection and competitive dynamics.

Of course, not every location is blessed with as much wind, sun, and open space as Texas. But there’s no reason why its market systems can’t be a template for other states and countries. This, too, is industrial policy — not just the factory workers building the technologies or even the installers deploying them. There is lots of work for the lawyers and power systems engineers and advertisers and policy analysts and bankers and consultants, as well.

Yet instead of seizing these real chances to push climate action forward at home and abroad, the Trump administration is eviscerating American state capacity, the rule of law, and global trust in the government. The whipsawing of Trump’s tariffs generates uncertainty that undercuts investment. The destruction of government support for scientific exploration hits at the next-generation moonshots that Sivaram is so enamored of, as well as the institutions that educate our citizens and train our workforce. Trump’s blatant disregard for court orders and his regime’s cronyism undercut belief in the rule of law, and that investments will rise and fall based on their economics rather than how close they are to the President.

But it’s not just Trump. Texas legislators are on the verge of destroying the golden goose of cheap electricity through rapid renewables deployment out of a desire to own the libs. Despite the huge economic returns to rural communities that have seen so much utility-scale expansion in the state, some Republican legislators are pushing bills that would stick their fingers into the electricity market pie, undercutting the renewable expansion and mandating expensive gas expansion.

The Trump business coalition, which was mostly vibes in the first place, is fracturing. There are conflicting interests between those who want to fight inflation and those who see low oil prices as a problem. Pushing down oil prices by pressuring OPEC+ to pump more crude and depressing global economic outlooks with the trade war (Degrowth Donald!) has hurt the frackers in Texas. Ironically, one way to lower their costs is to electrify operations, so they don’t have to rely on expensive diesel.

Climate change is here, but so is Donald Trump. Ignoring either one is a recipe for disaster as they both create destructive whirlwinds and traffic in uncertainty. The real solution to both is mitigation — doing everything possible today to stop as much of the damage as possible before it happens.

The decision will leave minimum U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods at 30%, down from 145%, and China’s tariffs on American imports at 10%, down from 125%, CNN notes. Monday’s news saw Dow futures rise by 2% and S&P 500 futures rise by almost 3%. But while some have hailed the result of the talks as a “best case scenario,” fears about rising costs have already caused companies including Rivian and First Solar to lower deliverable estimates and expected revenue for the year. China and the U.S. additionally agreed to a “mechanism to continue discussions about economic and trade relations,” while Bessent said both sides are committed to “more balance in trade” going forward.

2. CATL seeks to raise $4 billion in Hong Kong listing

Chinese electric-vehicle battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology announced in a filing Monday that it aims to raise as much as $4 billion in its Hong Kong Stock Exchange listing this year. CATL EV batteries were installed in more than 17 million vehicles last year, including Teslas, meaning it was represented in one in every three EVs in 2024, The Wall Street Journal reports; however, earlier this year, the company was given a “scarlet letter” in the U.S. when the Pentagon added it to a blacklist of “Chinese military companies.”

CATL is reportedly offering around 118 million shares, with a final price to be announced on or around May 19, and trading starting on May 20. The offer price will be no more than 263 Hong Kong dollars per share, or about $33.81. Its share offering would “more than double proceeds in Hong Kong’s market for listings this year,” per Bloomberg.

3. States sue Trump administration, arguing there is no ‘energy emergency’

Fifteen states filed a lawsuit on Friday arguing that President Trump’s declaration of an “energy emergency” is “unsupported.” As we’ve covered at Heatmap, Trump’s January 20 executive order directed federal agencies to “use all necessary resources to build critical infrastructure” to expedite extraction of coal, natural gas, and oil, including by bypassing or shortening environmental protections and reviews. The states, however, argued in their filing that “U.S. energy production is at an all-time high and growing,” and that “the invocation of the nation’s emergency authorities … is reserved for actual emergencies — not changes in presidential policy.”

The lawsuit was brought by Democratic attorneys general in Washington, California, Arizona, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin. Washington State’s Office of the Attorney General said in a press release that, in addition to being unlawful, Trump’s energy emergency order notably “excludes wind, solar, and batteries — among the cheapest and cleanest modern energy sources that exist today.”

4. Equinor warns it will cancel Empire Wind if admin doesn’t lift stop-work order

Equinor has threatened to cancel its Empire Wind project if the Trump administration does not immediately lift its stop-work order,E&E News reports. The 54-turbine offshore wind project, located south of New York’s Long Island, is fully permitted and has been under construction since 2024. Equinor, however, said that the Interior Department’s order in April to “halt all construction … until further review of information that suggests the Biden administration rushed through its approval without sufficient analysis” is costing the company $50 million a week, which it called “unsustainable.” Equinor also took issue with the characterization of its permitting process as “rushed,” noting that it took the company eight years to receive its federal permits, and that its lease was obtained during the first Trump administration.

As my colleagues Emily Pontecorvo and Jael Holzman have reported, canceling the project would be a huge blow to New York State’s clean energy goals, since Empire Wind was seen as a path away from its dependence on fossil fuels. “The state’s target of deploying 9 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035 was already going to be nearly impossible due to Trump’s pause on new leases and permits,” they wrote. “Without the 800 megawatt Empire Wind project, New York will only have 1 gigawatt in the pipeline.”

5. PJM warns hotter-than-normal summer could lead to historic supply shortages

PJM Interconnection issued a warning on Friday that anticipated above-average temperatures this summer “could trigger [grid] supply shortages for the first time,” Bloomberg reports. PJM — the country’s largest regional transmission organization, operating a 13-state market across much of the East Coast and Midwest — said that for most of the summer, it anticipates a peak of just over 154 gigawatts, “for which PJM should have adequate reserves to maintain reliability.” But 2025 also marks the first time PJM has assessed that an extreme scenario could put it over its generation capacity, with a potential peak demand as high as 166 gigawatts, beating 2006’s record of 165.6 gigawatts. “Under such circumstances, PJM would call on contracted demand response programs,” which pay customers to reduce their electricity use on an emergency basis, “to meet its required reserve needs,” the company said.

The award honors farmers and forestland owners who go above and beyond in their management of soil health, water quality, and wildlife habitat on working land.

Named in honor of renowned conservationist Aldo Leopold, this award recognizes landowners who inspire others with their dedication to environmental improvement. In his influential 1949 book, A Sand County Almanac, Leopold advocated for “a land ethic,” an ethical relationship between people and the land they own and manage.

Sand County Foundation and national sponsor American Farmland Trust present the Leopold Conservation Award to private landowners in 28 states. In Kentucky, the $10,000 award is presented with Kentucky Agricultural Council and the Kentucky Association of Conservation Districts.

The finalists are:

Steve and Melanie Kelley: The Kelleys utilize no-till practices and plant cover crops to conserve soil and moisture. This enhances the soil for the next year’s crop. Their farm located near Bardwell in Carlisle County features 48 acres of filter strips, and 17 acres of grassed waterways and rock chutes to mitigate erosion. Solar panels produce electricity and provide the farm with another source of income. Wildlife and pollinator-friendly habitat has been established on 800 acres.

Dr. James “Greg” Kuhns: Dr. Kuhn’s Crooked Creek Farm in Bullitt County has prioritized agronomy, timber, land, and water management practices. Milkweed patches have been preserved and expanded to serve as breeding sites for endangered Monarch butterflies. Riparian buffers have been established to reduce erosion and protect water quality. Forest pools were built for wildlife. Fescue fields were converted to native grasses to support haying and provide wildlife habitat.

John and Randy Seymour of Upton in Hart County: The Seymours have actively managed their woodland for timber and wildlife habitat since the 1970s. Overtime they converted a tobacco, hay, and beef cattle farm near Upton in Hart County into native seed production. In addition to a 100-acre savanna restoration they efforts protect a large cave that hosts thousands of bats in their breeding season. By creating the Roundstone Native Seed Company they have helped others to establish native grass and wildflower habitats.

Kentucky landowners were encouraged to apply, or be nominated, for the award. An independent panel of Kentucky agricultural and conservation leaders reviewed the applications.

The award recipient will be recognized at the Kentucky Association of Conservation Districts’ Annual Convention in August. Last year’s award recipient was Michael W. Wilson of Lawrenceburg in Anderson County.

“The Kentucky Agricultural Council is excited to recognize private landowners across the state who practice exceptional environmental stewardship,” said Tod Griffin, Kentucky Agricultural Council Chair. “Farmers are innovators in conservation and protecting our natural resources to ensure food and fiber production for future generations of Kentuckians.”

“KACD and conservation districts promote the sound management of all our natural resources, and we are excited to recognize these well deserving landowners in Kentucky,” said Allan Bryant, Kentucky Association of Conservation Districts President. “The Association and conservation districts work daily to assist private landowners in their efforts to adopt sound soil and water conservation practices on their land that benefit us all.”

“These award finalists are examples of how Aldo Leopold’s land ethic is alive and well today,” said Kevin McAleese, Sand County Foundation President and CEO. “Their dedication to conservation is both an inspiration to their peers as well as a reminder to all how important thoughtful agriculture is to clean water, healthy soil, and wildlife habitat.”

“As the national sponsor for Sand County Foundation’s Leopold Conservation Award, American Farmland Trust celebrates the hard work and dedication of the award finalists,” said John Piotti, AFT President and CEO. “At AFT we believe that exemplary conservation involves the land itself, the practices employed on the land, and the people who steward it. This award recognizes the integral role of all three.”

The Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) is currently reviewing the extension of $5.38 billion worth of low-interest loans to companies planning nearly 10 gigawatts (GW) of new natural gas-fired capacity in a bid to boost generation capacity for ERCOT.

The Texas Energy Fund was established in 2023 by the Texas Legislature through Senate Bill 2627, the Powering Texas Forward Act, to provide grants and loans to finance the construction, maintenance, modernization, and operation of electric facilities in Texas.

Last year, ERCOT forecast that electricity demand in the Lone Star State could double in six years, necessitating the urgent addition of more generation capacity.

However, eight of the projects initially proposed have already been withdrawn or canceled, while Texas regulators have also denied state funding due to applicants failing to meet due diligence requirements.

Engie Flexible Generation North America, a unit of France’s energy giant Engie, and Howard Power Generation have withdrawn their applications citing “supply chain constraints”, according to PUCT’s recent actions cited in a Houston Chronicle review.

Constellation Energy Generation withdrew its application citing TCEQ permit uncertainty regarding environmental impacts, while WattBridge Energy withdrew its plans because of “lower than anticipated returns”.

The development highlights the difficulties energy firms face in planning and building new gas-fired capacity even in the state of Texas, even under pro-fossil fuel President Donald Trump.

The Texas Energy Fund and its program to back new gas powered generation are “falling apart”, Citigroup said earlier this year.

The need for new capacity in Texas is urgent to meet growing power demand and keep electricity supply reliable, following the collapse of the ERCOT grid during a winter storm in 2021 and several close calls in peak summer since then.

The Detroit automaker says it will begin commercial production of lithium manganese-rich cells at an Ultium Cells plants in Ohio or Tennessee. Ultium Cells is a joint venture between GM and LG Energy Solution.

The announcement comes amid pressure from President Donald Trump to increase U.S. manufacturing, particularly in the auto industry, by levying high import taxes. Increased production also would reduce reliance on low-cost batteries made in China.

GM touted its new battery cells as cheaper to make than the nickel-rich cells currently in use but with similar range thanks to a higher-percentage of less-expensive manganese. GM said trucks using the cells will have a 400-mile range.

“We’re pioneering manganese-rich battery technology to unlock premium range and performance at an affordable cost, especially in electric trucks,” Kurt Kelty, vice president of battery, propulsion and sustainability at GM, said in a statement.

Part of GM's long-term strategy for an all-electric fleet by 2035 includes making less-expensive battery cells and ramping up production.

The market for EVs is slowly growing, but most U.S. drivers still prefer gas-powered vehicles. Range anxiety, expensive price tags and limited infrastructure to support charging stations remain barriers for customers.

GM last month scaled back production to match dragging EV sales at its Factory Zero Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center, which makes all-electric SUVs and trucks.

Still, total GM sales of EVs nearly doubled in the first three months of 2025 compared to the same time last year, with a little less than 32,000 vehicles sold this year versus more than 16,000 sold in 2024.

Opening statements in the case, which was filed just days after the dam in Gladwin and Midland counties failed and led to catastrophic flooding, began Monday, according to online records for Michigan's Court of Claims.

The state had filed a motion seeking for summary disposition, but an attorney representing several victims of the destructive flood, said Judge James Redford denied the motion.

“We are pleased the court has denied the state’s motion for summary disposition, allowing this case to move forward to trial and ensuring that the victims of the Edenville Dam disaster will finally have their day in court,"" said attorney Kevin Carlson of Royal Oak-based Pitt, McGehee, Palmer, Bonanni & Rivers, in a statement.

On May 19, 2020, after several days of heavy rainfall in the area, Wixom Lake, the lake impounded behind the Edenville Dam, reached about 5.5 feet above normal pool level. The east embankment of the dam gave way, nearly emptying Wixom Lake and flooding downstream dams and communities.

The water released from the east embankment overwhelmed the Sanford Dam downstream, devastating the Village of Sanford, flooding buildings, causing $21 million in damage to the fishery and about $91 million to the freshwater mussel ecosystem, according to a filing by the state in a previous case related to the incident. More than 10,000 residents were forced to evacuate.

In October 2023, a federal judge found that Boyce Hydro, the private company that owned the dam, was responsible for the failure. Attorney General Dana Nessel filed suit against the company earlier that year, claiming Boyce officials were aware of a key defect in the structure about 10 years earlier but failed to make repairs or notify the state as required.

A month later, the same judge ruled that Boyce was liable for nearly $120 million in environmental damage caused when the dam collapsed.

As recently as four months before the dam failure, the state found the structure didn’t meet flooding capacity standards at the state level and was preparing a final report when the dam failed.

Boyce Hydro LLC and Boyce Hydro Power LLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in August 2020 in federal bankruptcy court in the Eastern District of Michigan.

The ongoing Court of Claims lawsuit seeks relief against the Michigan Department of Natural Resources and the Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, alleging the state failed to take action to ensure safety as the dam grew increasingly dangerous.

""These plaintiffs have suffered unimaginable losses, and we are committed to holding the parties responsible accountable for their actions,"" Carlson said in his statement. ""For five years, the State of Michigan knew about the dam’s dangerous condition but refused to act in the best interests of the public and instead made the dam more dangerous by authorizing higher water levels. We look forward to pressing forward with this case and ensuring justice for those impacted by this catastrophic failure.”

EGLE and Michigan DNR officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Online court records do not list a date for the next hearing in the case.

Revenue: Plug reported revenue of $133.7 million for Q1 2025 versus $120.3 million in Q1 2024. Sales in Q1 2025 represent growing electrolyzer deliveries, continued demand in material handling, and ongoing deployments in our cryogenic platform.

Gross Margin: The Company reported gross margin loss of -55% in Q1 2025 versus a gross margin loss of -132% in Q1 2024. The improvement year over year reflects ongoing optimization of internal supply chains, continued cost reductions, price increases, and progress in leveraging the Company’s hydrogen platform.

Cash Flow: Net cash used in operating activities plus net cash used in investing activities declined to $152.1 million in Q1 2025 versus $288.3 million in Q1 2024. Plug ended the quarter with $295.8 million in unrestricted cash. The launch of Project Quantum Leap in Q1 2025—targeting over $200 million in annualized savings—combined with anticipated sales growth, strategic pricing actions, disciplined inventory and capex management, and increasing leverage of Plug’s hydrogen production platform, positions the Company for continued improvement in cash utilization in the near term as these initiatives take full effect across operations.

Liquidity Enhancements: In May of 2025, the Company closed the first tranche of a $525 million secured credit facility with Yorkville Advisors, drawing $210 million in aggregate principal. This financing was established commensurate with retiring $82.5 million of principal for the existing convertible debenture with Yorkville Advisors, which had approximately 55 million associated underlying shares given the conversion price and therefore this refinancing has reduced potential dilution risk. As Plug has commented previously, we anticipate no additional dilutive equity offerings this fiscal year.

In 2025, we are focused on three core areas: material handling, electrolyzers, and hydrogen supply. These are the businesses where Plug holds competitive advantages—and where we believe we can deliver the most meaningful impact for our customers and investors.

Hydrogen Generation Network Milestones

A key achievement in Q1 2025 was the commissioning of Plug’s 15-ton-per-day (TPD) hydrogen liquefaction plant in St. Gabriel, Louisiana, through its joint venture with Olin Corporation. This facility:

Increases Plug’s U.S. hydrogen production capacity to ~40 TPD;

Strengthens the Company’s ability to deliver clean, domestic hydrogen to customers such as Amazon and Walmart;

Additionally, Plug completed the transfer of approximately $30 million in energy storage Investment Tax Credits (ITCs) related to its Georgia hydrogen plant and is pursuing similar non-dilutive transactions for its Louisiana and other hydrogen equipment deployments.

Global Electrolyzer Growth and Energy Transition Impact

Plug’s GenEco electrolyzer business continues to scale rapidly, with revenue increasing 575% year over year. Other recent notable milestones include:

A signed 3 GW supply agreement with Allied Green Ammonia for a landmark green hydrogen-to-ammonia project in Australia;

Surpassing 8 GW in global Basic Engineering and Design Package (BEDP) contracts;

System deliveries to customer sites across North America, Europe, and Asia, accelerating decarbonization efforts globally.

Adoption of Fuel Cell Solutions

Plug deployed over 848 fuel cell units in Q1 2025 primarily supporting its material handling segment. Key highlights include:

A new partnership with STEF, a European leader in temperature-controlled logistics, supporting Plug’s expansion in Europe;

A $10 million Q4 2024 order structured under an ITC safe harbor investment strategy, unlocking over $200 million in future equipment opportunities, where deployments have commenced in Q1 2025;

Continued expansion of hydrogen infrastructure and fuel cell deployments with global logistics and automotive customers.

Additionally, Plug delivered cryogenic storage and refueling systems to transit agencies and fleet operators, reinforcing its presence in the hydrogen mobility sector.

2025 Outlook

Plug expects second-quarter 2025 revenue to range between $140 million and $180 million, with additional improvement from Q1 2025 in gross margin and working capital performance anticipated throughout the year. Building on the progress made in Q1 2025, the Company remains focused on leveraging its recently completed infrastructure—including the Louisiana hydrogen plant—to enhance margin performance and reduce third-party fuel costs.

Plug also plans to drive continued global adoption of its GenEco electrolyzer platform, which remains a key growth engine, while advancing financing initiatives such as investment tax credit transfers and project equity alignment to support long-term capital efficiency. Collectively, these efforts reflect Plug’s ongoing commitment to disciplined execution, profitable growth, and leadership in the global hydrogen economy.

“With new capacity online in Louisiana, accelerating adoption of our GenEco electrolyzers, and improved cash flow discipline, Plug is executing with focus and urgency,” said Andy Marsh, CEO of Plug. “We’re delivering real progress toward profitability and scaling our hydrogen ecosystem to meet growing global demand for clean energy.”

The House Energy and Commerce committee has jurisdiction over Medicaid. The committee has to cut $880 billion from the committee’s budget. Despite Speaker Johnson and President Trump stating Medicaid will not be touched, the Congressional Budget Office stated that there is no way to achieve the cut without harming the program. During markups, we expect to see committee members cut spending by implementing work requirements and shifting costs to states by reducing the federal expansion match rate or implementing per capita caps. All of these changes are counterproductive, forcing states to either reduce benefits or kick beneficiaries off the program.

The Agriculture Committee has authority over the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and has to cut $230 billion from its budget. Proposed legislative text reduces the size of benefits, implements harsher work requirements, and shifts costs to states. All of these changes would be devastating for children and families receiving SNAP.

The Ways and Means Committee handles federal tax policy, and the committee is planning to extend the expiring provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (P.L. 115–97). This extension would give the top 0.1% an additional $314,000 a year in tax breaks and cost trillions of dollars.

Repealing clean energy tax credits will raise costs for families and houses of worship

Members of the Ways and Means Committee hope to repeal or cut parts of the clean energy tax credits of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA, P.L. 117-169) in order to fund tax cuts for the wealthy and deportation and detention efforts.

Passed in 2022, the IRA created new and expanded existing historically bipartisan clean energy tax credits, incentivizing businesses, houses of worship, and individuals to invest in clean energy projects. Cutting these credits threatens to increase household electricity bills by around 10% on average in 2035. Quaker meeting houses across the nation have used clean energy tax credits through the “direct pay” provision, which allows certain tax-exempt entities to directly receive rebates from the Internal Revenue Service.

Because of their widespread economic benefits, 21 House Republicans and 4 Senate Republicans have come out in support of the credits. However, on May 1, 38 House Republicans issued a letter urging a full repeal of the IRA. As the Ways and Means committee members consider their fate, we urge Congress to build upon, not tear down, these wildly successful tax credits and continue to champion environmental stewardship.

Cuts to Social Programs to Put Kids in Cages

Attribution

Fibonacci Blue

The House Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees marked up bills– totaling $81 and $69 billion respectively– toward the largest investment in immigration enforcement in U.S. history. The social costs exceed any dollar amount.

Since January, unchecked enforcement has forced toddlers to appear in immigration court without an attorney and separated families without due process. Agents have kidnapped international students and imprisoned them with insufficient medical care, inadequate food, cold temperatures, and without religious accommodations. U.S. citizen children, including multiple with terminal illnesses, have been held in family detention, denied access to counsel, and removed without medication. The reconciliation bill will continue these disappearances and drive up profits for private detention corporations.

Despite endless hours for deliberation during the House markups, the House majority refused to take up amendments to prevent the government from removing sick U.S. citizen children; protect Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) holders; or prevent the U.S. from sending funds to dictators to imprison deportees. A political show of concern for unaccompanied children over the last year failed to produce sheltering or legal representation for vulnerable minors navigating an intimidating system alone. To add more harm, the bill punishes poor people fleeing persecution through fee increases such as a burdensome $1,000 asylum application fee.

Conclusion

Congress must denounce unconscionable cuts to health care, food assistance, and clean energy initiatives that will bankroll tax cuts for the wealthy and incite fear in the immigrant communities we belong to and love. We instead urge lawmakers to instead fund programs that honor that of God in every individual. This means investments that meet the needs of families, advance the transition to clean energy, and provide orderly and humane pathways for people to immigrate to the United States.

The House Ways and Means Committee bill, if passed, would hamper these goals,” said Long.
A recent report from ACORE showed that the current tax credits have added US$115 billion in clean energy investments last year, while supporting over 3.5 million jobs.
It is possible to phase out incentives for clean energy investment, production, and manufacturing without harming American consumers or businesses — and we stand ready to help.","Released yesterday (12 May), the Committee is expected to vote on the proposed bill today.

“The accelerated phase-out would likely trigger a surge of solar installations as homeowners rush to complete their projects before the end of 2025,” said clean energy comparison company EnergySage. According to its data, a typical residential solar panel system costing US$20,552 after the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) could incur an additional US$8,978 cost after the deadline passes.

Section 25D is not the only provision that the Committee aims to end sooner than initially intended for US residential owners. A second amendment from the Reconciliation Bill would move forward the end of the advanced manufacturing production credits (Section 45X) by one year from the end of 2032 to the end of 2031.

On top of all of these proposals, the bill aims to terminate a number of clean energy and vehicle credits earlier than the dates initially set, in most cases the end of 2032.

Moreover, Sections 112008 and 112009 – dubbed “the Phase-out and restrictions on clean electricity production credit” and “Phase-out and restrictions on clean electricity investment credit” – aim to restrict access to the credit for certain prohibited foreign entities. This includes the use of materials from foreign entities for a facility that begins construction a year after the enactment of the bill, or if the taxpayer is a foreign entity.

Similar to Sections 25D and 45X, the bill also aims to change the phase out dates for the production credits.

“There is a 20% credit reduction for facilities placed in service in calendar year 2029, a 40% reduction for facilities placed in service in calendar year 2030, a 60% reduction for facilities placed in service in calendar year 2031 and zero credit available after December 31, 2031,” reads the bill. “Transferability is repealed for facilities where construction begins two years after the date of enactment of this bill.”

‘This is not the time for disruption,’ says ACP

Reaction from the industry to the released text of the Reconciliation Bill has been widely negative, with both the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and The American Clean Power Association (ACP) claiming it will destroy jobs and force American factories to close.

“If adopted, the proposed language will raise energy costs for American consumers, force American factories to shut their doors and threaten American jobs,” said Jason Grumet, CEO of ACP.

Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of added: “This legislation will cause hundreds of American factories to close, eliminate tens of thousands of jobs, force electric bills to skyrocket for everyone, weaken the reliability of our electric grid and eliminate our capacity to compete with China.”

Hopper added that the legislation would affect red-state economies, with more than “75% of at-risk factories and investments concentrated in these communities.”

“While American businesses are demanding more energy to compete against our adversaries and consumers are turning to clean energy to hedge against rising electricity prices, these proposals will undermine our nation’s efforts to achieve president Trump’s American energy dominance agenda,” Hopper said

The president and CEO of industry non-profit the American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE), Ray Long, said that the US need to build the equivalent of 12 New York Cities’ worth of new power by 2030 in order to remain competitive with China in the artificial intelligence race, and that this legislation would hamper that goal.

“Energy dominance means a secure, affordable, reliable energy supply that serves as the basis for our national security, technological leadership, and economic prosperity. Achieving this is a bipartisan goal. The House Ways and Means Committee bill, if passed, would hamper these goals,” said Long.

A recent report from ACORE showed that the current tax credits have added US$115 billion in clean energy investments last year, while supporting over 3.5 million jobs. However, ACORE also released a survey of investors and developers in March 2025 where the majority of respondents said the uncertainty over tax credits could cause investors and developers – by 84% and 73%, respectively – to decrease their activity in renewable energy.

Grumet said: “With energy demand surging, this is not the time for disruption. It is possible to phase out incentives for clean energy investment, production, and manufacturing without harming American consumers or businesses — and we stand ready to help.

“As the legislation moves through the process, we will work with lawmakers to ensure that the final product achieves necessary cost savings while maintaining investment certainty, energy reliability, economic growth and global competitiveness.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Residential-solar.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:36:41.611884

The United States imports 85 percent of its potash from Canada, which is the world’s largest exporter of the minerals.
Mr. Trump s described his “love” for Canada and desire for continued friendship.","President Trump had one big question on his mind as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney headed to Washington last week.

“I very much want to work with him, but cannot understand one simple TRUTH,” Mr. Trump said in a social media post, reiterating several of ways he believes Canada benefits unfairly from its trade relationship with United States.

The president also repeated his incorrect claim that the United States is “subsidizing” Canada to the tune of $200 billion, alluding to the country’s trade deficit with Canada, which is the value of what the United States imports minus its exports.

In fact, the trade deficit last year was $63.3 billion, according to U.S. data. And if Canada’s energy exports were stripped out, it turns into a trade surplus.

For Mr. Trump, it all boils down to one point: does the United States need Canada?

Mr. Trump’s resounding answer is no, and he has imposed tariffs on many Canadian goods.

“We don’t need their Cars, we don’t need their Energy, we don’t need their Lumber, we don’t need ANYTHING they have, other than their friendship,” he said in the social media post.

But industry groups and government say differently.

The U.S. needs Canada to make cars

The auto industries in Canada and the United States have become highly interconnected over the last three decades — especially between Detroit, Mich., and Windsor, Ontario, the busiest commercial crossing along the border — as the countries knocked down trade barriers.

So intertwined are the supply chains that car parts can cross the border as many as eight times during the manufacturing process. That has made it difficult to define what constitutes an auto import.

The U.S. needs Canada’s energy

The United States is the world’s top oil producer, but many of its refineries rely partially on heavy crude oil, a variety that Canada specializes in extracting. Retooling U.S. refineries to eliminate the need for crude oil would cost billions and companies are not willing to make those investments, especially because of the uncertainty over Mr. Trump’s trade policies.

Sixty percent of the heavy crude oil imported to the United States in 2022 came from Canada, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Besides oil, Canada, in 2023, supplied nearly 100 percent of the natural gas and 85 percent of the electrical energy imported by the United States, according to Canada’s energy regulator. Canadian electricity is especially important to powering New England.

Canada also more provides more than one-fourth of the uranium the United States imports to run nuclear reactors, federal data shows, a higher share than any other nation.

The U.S. needs Canada’s lumber

Howard Lutnick, the U.S. commerce secretary, is investigating whether lumber imports are a threat to national security.

In 2021, the most recent year figures were available, the United States purchased $28 billion worth of lumber from Canada, representing nearly half of lumber imports.

American industry groups have estimated that the tariffs on lumber that Mr. Trump has introduced will increase home costs by an average of about $9,000.

U.S. farmers need Canada to plant their crops

Farmers kicking off the planting season this year were reminded of the U.S. agriculture industry’s reliance on Canadian imports of key chemical ingredients used in fertilizer, like the potassium-rich minerals called potash.

The United States imports 85 percent of its potash from Canada, which is the world’s largest exporter of the minerals.

But Mr. Trump’s tariffs on Canada will make potash more expensive for farmers to import and the increases could be passed down to grocery store shoppers, according to the Fertilizer Institute, a U.S. industry group. The next biggest global exporters of potash are Russia and Belarus.

Trump says the U.S. needs Canada’s friendship. Many Canadians say forget about it.

The usually warm relationship between the two countries is in tatters, with Canada invoking a defensive tactic used in hockey — “elbows up” — as its posture against Mr. Trump’s economic attacks and threats to make Canada a U.S. state.

Canadians have taken to boycotting American-made products and shirking summer travel to the United States, with the number of flights scheduled to the country from Canada down by 21 percent, a New York Times analysis shows.

A quirky symbol of the countries’ special bond has also suffered. The United States has restricted Canadian access to the Haskell Free Library and Opera House, a historic site that straddles the border between Quebec and Vermont. American officials said the move was necessary to stop “drug traffickers and smugglers.”

Despite the frosty relations, Mr. Carney and Mr. Trump had a cordial exchange in front of news media cameras in the Oval Office last week.

Mr. Trump s described his “love” for Canada and desire for continued friendship. Still he repeated his desire for Canada to become part of the United States.

Mr. Carney quickly pushed back to make clear that his country was not for sale.

Mr. Trump did not relent: “Never say never!”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/09/multimedia/00int-canada-trump-explainer-tqvm/00int-canada-trump-explainer-tqvm-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:42:02.724035

How to make a wine barrel Just as Kentucky is the epicenter of bourbon, so too is it the headquarters of bourbon barrel production.
This has been a particular blow to American bourbon and cooperages, conjoined industries already imperiled by changing consumer tastes.
Used bourbon barrel prices have dropped nearly 50% in the past six to eight months.
It takes at least two to four years to go from log to freshly emptied bourbon barrel, often longer,” said Albrecht.","No one at Tucson’s Hamilton Distillers knows exactly what wood the cognac barrels holding whiskey are made of.

“Probably Spanish oak?” one employee ventures a guess. The age of the barrels is also a question mark. No one working here is old enough to vouch for that; the distillery believes they are anywhere from 100 to 125 years old, which is old in the grand scheme of barrels’ lifespans, but not unusual. But it can say with certainty, using records of its vintages, that these barrels are on their fifth use – at least.

In the alcohol industry, when ageing liquor can easily take decades, the vessels that house them can also become more covetable over the years. In an age of disposable materials and dire news of plastics polluting our environment, reused wooden barrels exist in stark contrast. The lives of barrels are long, shockingly sustainable and currently imperiled by trade war.

Many circumnavigate the globe and end their days in distilleries in remote corners of the world, originating in the forests of Hungary and moving from mountain towns in Canada to distilleries in the Caribbean and Mexico. At Hamilton, new American oak barrels hold fresh distillate, alongside the dinosaurs: French cognac barrels that show their age. They’re gray, stained and a little warped.

Laws Whiskey House in Denver, Colorado, considers itself a “terroir-forward distillery”, the distillery’s brand manager, Casey Rizzo, told me over the phone. Terroir, the flavor that emerges from a specific environment, comes from both grain and barrels. “White American oak has a lot of natural wood sugars and natural vanillin. When you’re charring a barrel, you’re caramelizing it like a creme brulee. A barrel pulls whiskey in and then pushes it back out. Whiskey goes into the barrel clear and comes out with all that color, and vanilla and caramel flavors.”

Rizzo added: “We think of barrels as teabags. It gets used first for bourbon, like the first steep of a teabag. You get a lot of color and flavor from the barrel quickly. If you use the barrel again, it’ll take longer to impart, so maybe it’s used for scotch, which sits and ages longer. You mute the barrel’s flavors along the way.”

Modern distilling relies on increasingly sophisticated technologies for monitoring conditions in cellars and fermentation, but distilleries still depend on lo-tech barrels to impart flavor and color to their products. Barrels consist only of wood and steel hardware, held together with no glue or nails. Remove its rings and give it a smack, and a barrel can unfurl like a chocolate orange. At some distilleries, employees still rotate their barrels by hand, a practice called clocking (rolling barrels according to a clock’s face). “This ensures proper exposure to the varying temperatures within the warehouse and adds consistency from barrel to barrel,” said Frank Krockenberger, director of hospitality for Loretto, Kentucky’s Star Hill Farm, home of the Maker’s Mark distillery.

It was one stop on my journey to follow how barrels – so important for the beverage industry – are made. As a food and beverage writer, much of my work dredges up stories about monumental food waste, and the struggle to repurpose materials. But when it came to barrels, I found practices that were surprisingly sustainable, of wood being reused for centuries, and forests being protected.

How to make a wine barrel

Just as Kentucky is the epicenter of bourbon, so too is it the headquarters of bourbon barrel production. An hour away from Maker’s Mark, in Louisville, I witnessed the birth of American oak barrels at the Brown-Forman Cooperage, which produced barrels exclusively for the Cooper’s Craft and Jack Daniel’s brands, at least in terms of their first use (however, the cooperage recently closed, with the Kentucky Distillers’ Association citing changing consumer trends, European Union tariffs and taxes as reasons for the industry’s decline).

Machines carved staves (the vertical planks of a barrel), and master coopers (the craftsmen who make barrels) hammered hoops around them before charring them on a rotating belt with enormous bursts of flame. The scene blended with modern efficiency and ancient technology (the Roman historian Pliny the Elder wrote about coopers near the Alps who stored their wine in hooped wooden vessels, and there is archaeological evidence of barrels from ancient Egypt). The business had churned out barrels since 1945 and produced more than 60,000 barrels annually. But starting this year, Brown-Forman will now source barrels externally.

Oak is commonly used for barrels, due to the ease of carving it, its durability in holding liquid (it is unlikely to warp or crack) and its ability to impart desirable flavors to spirits. But not all barrels are made of oak. I encountered barrels made from chestnut, hickory and maple, as well as more exotic woods used in the ageing of specialty products (Hawaiian koa used to age sugarcane rum, and Brazilian amendoim bravo used to age cachaça, for example). I also found hybrid barrels in Patron’s distillery, their bodies composed of Brown-Forman American oak staves, and their heads (the ends of the barrels) made of French limousin oak.

The barrel-making process is zero-waste and astonishingly fast. It takes a cooper about 45 seconds to raise a single barrel. Sawdust is collected and used for horse and cow bedding. These barrels are frequently shipped flat, so “we don’t ship air”, one cooper told me, and are reassembled at their destinations.

I found Brown-Forman’s trademark “B” stamp on dozens of rusted hoop rivets, 1,900 miles away in the cellars and storage rooms of Don Fulano in Jalisco, Mexico. In the ageing rooms of a different tequila distillery, Volcán, I found barrels containing decade-old tequila held together by rivets stamped with Bs. The trained eye can spot other signs of where a barrel came from, said Greg Roshkowski, the vice-president of wood planning, procurement and processing at Brown-Forman, Jack Daniel’s and Cooper’s Craft’s parent company, wrote via email. He said some experts “will be able to spot Brown-Forman barrels by other various characteristics, such as the head placement, chime (the beveled edge of a barrel, where the staves meet), locations of hoops, etc. It’s certainly fun to walk through other countries and their warehouses and see 50- to 60-year-old Brown-Forman barrels ageing all sorts of spirits from rum to scotch and Irish whiskey.”

The international use of barrels is part and parcel of the global liquor industry. Large conglomerates like LVMH, Brown-Forman and Suntory have multiple spirits brands in their portfolios, and barrels make their rounds internally. A Kentucky-made barrel might end up in Scotland to age scotch because Brown-Forman owns both the Jack Daniel’s and Glendronach brands.

Given the barrels’ long lives and travels, makers are investing in regenerative cultivation of their raw materials. Though mature white oak trees are plentiful, the species could be on the decline, primarily due to a “lack of active management that creates the conditions needed for oak seedlings to thrive”, according to the US Department of Agriculture’s Forest Service. Maker’s Mark, part of Suntory, partnered with the University of Kentucky in a genome-mapping project of the American white oak to preserve the species. The partnership has also led to the establishment of the world’s largest repository of American white oak trees. It’s 24 acres with nearly 10,000 trees representing more than 400 varieties of white oak, among other sustainability initiatives.

The barrel-flavor equation

Sustainability isn’t the only concern. Manipulating flavors with barrels is a science and art. Roshkowski said: “[The barrels] are part of their recipes. You’ll see callouts for once-used Jack Daniel’s barrels from Scotland to Guyana, Russia to Malaysia and beyond. These barrels will live on for another 30 to 50 years ageing fine spirits, coffee beans, honey, soy sauce or Tabasco.”

Lucas Assis, an agave and sugarcane spirit educator, said: “Fortaleza used charanda [a rare Mexican sugarcane rum] barrels for their winter blend [last year],” he said. “Barrels tell a story. It doesn’t matter how many times you use it. French oak is still going to bring back chocolate or spiciness. Brazilian amburana wood gives a cinnamon finish.”

Distilleries that aren’t owned by large conglomerates enlist the help of a barrel broker who can source unique barrels. Mara Smith sources old pinot noir barrels from France through a broker, as they give her Inspiro tequila a rosy hue and flavors like “berries, some nuttiness, a floral [aroma] on the nose”.

Barrels foster circular economies. I see Whiskey Del Bac barrels at Tucson’s Monsoon Chocolate. “We get mesquite-smoked whiskey barrels a couple days after they’ve been drained, then we take refined chocolate, put it into nut milk bags, cut the top of the barrel off, and age the chocolate for four to six months. Cocoa butter is the carrier of aroma in chocolate, so it’s sitting there, absorbing the barrel’s aroma,” said Adam Krantz, the company’s founder.

I bite into the barrel-aged chocolate, tasting whiskey and smoke. A barrel is near the end of its life when it gets to Monsoon. Slicing it open for chocolate renders the barrel useless for anything other than furniture, planters and a rather stunning variety of items such as golf ball holders, ax targets, lazy susans and more, all under the Wine Enthusiast product umbrella.

In remote, mountainous Banff, Canada, Park Distillery sources barrels from wineries and other distilleries. “We are looking for sweet and rich flavors from the barrel. Lignin, vanillin, tannins and lactones are some of the important compounds in the wood,” said master distiller Scott Coburn. Like Tucson’s Hamilton Distillers, the operation is relatively small, and it receives assembled barrels. After about three uses for whisky (which must be aged for a minimum of three years in Canada), it uses them for barrel-aged gin and cocktails. Then the barrels are passed on to breweries for barrel-aged beer. Once spent, the barrels meet their end in Banff’s restaurants as decoration.

Rizzo outlines a Laws Whiskey barrel’s typical lifespan. “We age our Four Grain Bourbon and send those used bourbon barrels [after four to 10 years] to a local apiary, Bee Squared, in Berthoud, Colorado. They age their honey in those used barrels for 90 days to produce a glorious local barrel-aged honey. We then get those barrels back and put more bourbon into them to make a natural honey-aged bourbon [which takes a year and a half of ageing]. One went to our friends at Lady Justice Brewing, who aged a honey bock beer in the honey barrel. Once that was finished in six months to two years, they put malted barley grain inside the barrel for another six months to two years to flavor the grain to produce another beer. And then the barrel is made into furniture.” These barrels had seven lives.

But barrels’ travels are in danger

Recent tariffs are making the very aspect of manufacturing barrels, distilling alcohol and selling its finished product more expensive. In American winemaking, particularly in California, French oak barrels will be affected by the EU’s retaliatory tariffs. Since barrels are essentially an ingredient in any given type of alcohol’s recipe, a winemaker would not be able to easily switch out a type of wood they have used previously for something available domestically.

Since tariffs are duties placed on imported goods, used barrels costs are spiking, whether they are entering the US or departing it (due to retaliatory tariffs).

American spirits companies saw the effect that potential tariffs had on Canada immediately, as their products were pulled off Canadian shelves in February, in response to the 25% tariffs on Canadian goods that the Trump administration had put in place then. This has been a particular blow to American bourbon and cooperages, conjoined industries already imperiled by changing consumer tastes.

“Even when barrels aren’t directly targeted by tariffs, they’re deeply tied to the global trade of the products they help create – bourbon, wine, tequila, rum. Tariffs on those goods ripple down to the barrel market. Producers are scaling back how much they’re ageing and how far ahead they’re willing to invest, and that’s hit the barrel world hard. Used bourbon barrel prices have dropped nearly 50% in the past six to eight months. “Some days, it feels like they’re falling by the hour,” said Matt Albrecht, owner of River Drive Cooperage in Buxton, Maine, who also sells and sources used barrels.

“It’s a perfect storm,” said Albrecht. American producers are now rushing to empty barrels and bottle their spirits ahead of expected tariffs and are flooding the market. “Meanwhile, international buyers, many of whom were paying top dollar for barrels just last year, are holding off, betting that prices will drop even further if the US economy stumbles. That’s led to a standoff: supply is high, demand is frozen and prices are volatile.”

The consequences of this current disruption in the barrel economy might not be seen for years. “What’s on the market today started as trees harvested years ago. It takes at least two to four years to go from log to freshly emptied bourbon barrel, often longer,” said Albrecht.

After the 2008 recession, there was a barrel shortage in 2012, which meant there was four-year lag in the barrel supply chain. One can only hope that these emblems of sustainable, circular economies may continue to age gracefully, their journeys unhindered by tariffs.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ac9b4dc1f1a1bc4ddfe0039d2ce9e90d3590eab/360_0_3598_2879/master/3598.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6301a532e14dfd45e621b2b79a78db5f,N,,2025-05-13 14:45:05.878858

On the one hand, there's no daylight between Netanyahu and — Bibi and President Trump, in the sense that President Trump has not criticized Netanyahu's plans for Gaza, at least not publicly.","Amna Nawaz:

Tonight, the final living American hostage held by Hamas is free. Edan Alexander entered Israel from Gaza earlier today in a deal made directly between Hamas and the United States.

His release came as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu went further than before on his plans for Gaza, calling for its reoccupation, and as President Trump left today for his four-day trip to the region.

Nick Schifrin begins with the hostage release and an emotional reunion in Israel.

Nick Schifrin:

Five hundred and eighty-four days. Edan Alexander is free in his mother's arms, the Israeli-American soldier reunited with his family. He was kidnapped on October 7, 2023, when Hamas and its supporters rushed into Israel and overran a nearby military base. That day, he was just 19 years old, now 21, a native of New Jersey, where in Tenafly today, they cheered the moment they saw a native son released.

And the moment Yael Alexander got to speak to him.

Yael Alexander, Mother of Hamas Hostage: They just released a photo of you. And you look unbelievable. Wow, you look beautiful. I love you so much. I love you. And I'm going to see you very soon, very soon.

Nick Schifrin:

Tonight, Netanyahu went further, telling wounded soldiers that Israel had made a decision to reoccupy Gaza.

""Things have changed,"" he said. ""A decision has been made to go all the way. We will conquer Gaza and our security control there will be permanent.""

In Gaza, Israel has blocked all aid for two months, deepening the deprivation. Today, an umbrella organization of U.N. and international humanitarian groups declared that nearly half-a-million people face catastrophic hunger and are at risk of famine. In the next 11 months, more than 70,000 children are expected to be acutely malnourished.

The U.N. has recently run out of food, and residents say what little food is left in the markets is overpriced.

Nick Schifrin:

So he spoke to a group called the War Wounded Forum for Decisive Victory.

They confirmed Netanyahu's comments to me, but the prime minister's officials have not actually explain exactly what he meant. But the statement comes about one week after Israel said it was going to change its military strategy in Gaza, away from targeted raids in certain areas in Gaza to actually holding areas and clearing areas, and then forcibly moving the population of Northern Gaza to Southern Gaza, all of which will require tens of thousands of additional reservists that are being called up right now throughout Israel.

And all of that will bring more pain to the people of Gaza, Says Hussein Ibish of the Arab Gulf States Institutes in Washington.

Nick Schifrin:

There is absolutely concern among the officials I speak to, mainly because of three decisions that the president has made with Steve Witkoff, one of his most senior aides that you saw in the video there.

One is the release of Edan Alexander, which Witkoff led directly with Hamas over Israeli officials' heads, number two, a U.S. cease-fire with the Houthis in Yemen, despite the fact that the Houthis have not agreed to stop fire at Israel, in fact, recently fired at Israel again, and U.S. direct talks with Iran, something that was announced by President Trump while Netanyahu was actually in the Oval Office.

A U.S. official tells me this. On the one hand, there's no daylight between Netanyahu and — Bibi and President Trump, in the sense that President Trump has not criticized Netanyahu's plans for Gaza, at least not publicly. And last week, Trump met with Ron Dermer, a Netanyahu top aide for many years. That's an unusual level of coordination with a minister from a foreign government by the president.

But, on the other hand, this U.S. official says there's definitely a different approach that President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu has. This official says President Trump's been vocally anti-war and is trying to make deals that end the wars in Gaza and prevent a war in Iran, whereas Netanyahu has talked about military action in Gaza, in Lebanon, and floated the idea of military action in Iran.

And the official warns me that, as long as this war in Gaza continues, the more likely it is that President Trump will see Netanyahu as unwilling to compromise and make the kinds of deals that are clearly the priority of President Trump going into this Middle East trip, which, notably, by the way, does not include a stop in Israel.

Nick Schifrin:

Yes, we call them deliverables in the news business, right?

President Trump is on the way to Saudi Arabia right now, where a senior official there tells me that the deals announced tomorrow during this trip will include artificial intelligence, space technology, and energy, including a reference of future U.S. support for civilian nuclear energy in Saudi Arabia.

But much of the trip, this official and other officials tell me, will be focused on business deals. And these will be billed as enormous investments in the U.S. and into the U.S. economy. And that approach, according to analysts I speak to, works for Gulf leaders. They need U.S. military assistance. They need U.S. engagement in the region.

And they see flattering Trump, an investment in America, as the best way to do that. And they welcome how Trump administration officials have taken a more realist approach to the region, says Jon Alterman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Jon Alterman, Center for Strategic and International Studies: They don't talk about democratization. They don't talk about human rights. They don't talk about humanitarian assistance. They don't talk about all sorts of things that a lot of regional governments feel are naive and weaken them in terms of security in the name of rights.

And this more transactional president narrows the area of interest of the United States in ways they feel is in their interest and gives them something to work with.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/05/HostageReleased-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:42:06.239875

If that exception makes its way into the final legislature, EVs from Rivian, including the R1S and R1T, could still qualify for tax credits.
Per the Reddit post, the complete text of the EV tax credit repeal proposal is supposed to be shared today (Monday) at 2 PM.","While the current majority in DC shared intentions to likely kill the existing $7,500 federal EV tax credit, some language in a (very fluid) proposal suggests that not all automakers will be immediately affected. For example, Rivian is an American automaker whose sales are young enough that US consumers might still be able to take advantage of the tax credit, and that could also include the upcoming R2 EVs.

May 13, 2025: As expected, the House Ways and Means Committee published markups of “The One, Big, Beautiful Bill” to the public domain. As we reported below, the proposal includes ending several federal tax programs on December 31, 2025.

That includes termination of the Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicles Credit and the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Credit, as well as the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit.

Lastly, the proposal includes a termination of the Clean Vehicle Credit at the end of this year. However, as originally reported below, there is an exception for automakers who have not sold at least 200,000 vehicles between December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2025.

That means Rivian EVs could very well still qualify for federal tax credits through December 31, 2026.

The past two years, federal tax credits for EV sales through the Inflation Reduction Act have done wonders for US adoption, helping give consumers the last little push they needed to go all-electric with at least one vehicle in their home.

It was great while it lasted.

These days, the current administration has its sights set on a delusional idea of “success” from the past, trying to breathe new life into dying industries like coal and, yes, combustion vehicles. EV adoption was never going to happen overnight, but recent discussions among the GOP stating it is likely to kill the federal EV tax credit is disheartening news.

We’ve already long-surpassed “critical mass” in the US adoption process, so it’s a fair wager that EVs are here to stay and will continue increasing their market presence. While most makes and models are likely to be disqualified from federal EV tax credits after 2025 (only about 20 or so currently qualify these days), some proposed exceptions in place will allow credits to continue for American companies like Rivian, for example.

Proposal states Rivian EVs could qualify for tax credits after 2025

According to Reddit user u/FiveDollarHoller, they are a lobbyist in the midst of Washington’s discussions to repeal the federal EV tax credit. According to the post, the US House Ways and Means Committee will finalize its tax title this week.

According to proposal shared by reliable source close to the lobbyist, a slew of credits will be eliminated on December 31, 2025, including the following:

Used EV credit

Clean Vehicle Credit

Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit

Alernative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Proprty Credit

We share the same sentiment as the lobbyist in that this proposal remains fluid and discussions are ongoing, so the details of these plans could have already changed by now and most likely will change before everything is approved through the necessary government channels.

One interesting tidbit in the current proposal is an exception within the $7,500 Clean Vehicle Credit for OEMs that have not sold 200,000 vehicles by December 31, 2025. If that exception makes its way into the final legislature, EVs from Rivian, including the R1S and R1T, could still qualify for tax credits.

Better still, Rivian recently shared that it remains on track to begin scaled production and deliveries of its second flagship model, the R2, in 2026, meaning customers of that BEV could also qualify for federal tax credits.

At the end of 2024, Rivian had sold 51,579 compared to 50,122 a year prior and 20,332 deliveries in 2022. Per its recent Q1 2025 quarterly report, the American automaker targets 40,000 to 46,000 deliveries in 2025. By those numbers, that puts Rivian around approximately 168,033 total deliveries if it hits the high end of its 2025 outlook.

As such, Rivian’s numbers would fall below the 200,000 sales threshold outlined in the current proposal. Again, this is hearsay at most until we get a legitimate proposal publicized by the Capitol. Still, it’s a noteworthy potential perk for companies like Rivian if it comes to fruition. It could also incentivize more US consumers to purchase a Rivian since it could be one of the only OEMs that still qualify (along with Lucid, probably).

Per the IRS, despite being built in Normal, Illinois, the Rivian R1 models are not listed as qualified BEVs for the $7,500 tax credit. We will have to see how this all plays out in the coming days and months.

Per the Reddit post, the complete text of the EV tax credit repeal proposal is supposed to be shared today (Monday) at 2 PM. Once a bona fide proposal is in place, it will still need to be approved by the House Ways and Means Committee, then the House, followed by the Senate (which may be a lot more challenging to get approved).

We will monitor this process closely, which will likely last well into 2025, and will report on what EVs (if any) may still qualify for federal tax credits next year and whether that will include Rivian. Regardless, if you’re pondering the idea of purchasing a BEV (Rivian or not), you should try to take delivery before the end of the year because the federal EV tax credit doesn’t appear long for this world.",https://i0.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/05/Rivian-tax-credit-R2.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-13 14:33:58.858511

Cutting Household Bills We are currently producing—and paying for—the energy we need plus the energy we waste.
And as people like me who build stuff for a living know, you can’t build much of anything unless you work together.","The energy and technology sectors are merging, the demand for power is surging, and the battle lines that have defined energy policy debates for decades are being overtaken by events. To lead the world in artificial intelligence (AI) and—as Adam Smith envisioned—enable people to earn a better living with greater ease, America must learn to build big things again without breaking people’s backs with rising costs—and we’ve got to do it with a sense of urgency. To succeed, we need stable energy policy, lasting permitting reform, and a sustained focus on cutting bills for American families.

COMMENTARY

The need to act is apparent. Demand is growing faster than we can build new generation from any source. U.S. load growth is projected to increase by up to 128 GW by 2029, while backlogs for new gas turbines are stretching out to four years or more, and the average interconnection queue for new generation takes more than five years to complete. The pressure on America’s ability to generate and deliver enough power isn’t just coming from AI and industry. The increasing impact and frequency of extreme weather is straining regional power grids with residential heating and cooling loads, with two more major winter storms and one intensive heatwave pushing system limits since Winter Storm Elliot forced rolling power outages across the Southeast on Christmas Eve in 2022.

At the same time that we need more energy, we also need more affordable energy, so hardworking families can keep the lights on without skimping on groceries. Families and seniors living on less in rural counties are particularly stressed. They already pay an average of 20% of their entire household income for electricity, not because rates are high, but because rural housing is in such a poor state of disrepair. Add upward pressure on rates from the cost of new generation, aggravated by the complexity tax of America’s antiquated permitting system, and residential energy bills will continue to rise if we don’t correct our course.

Market Stability

Against this backdrop, the House of Representatives is considering a full repeal-replace of the Inflation Reduction Act, which, despite its name, set an energy and industrial policy framework that the market has been executing against for three years. While course corrections are needed and necessary in a dynamic market, and the sharp upward shift in demand projections requires a legislative response, rapid reversals in policy direction are out of sync with an industry that undertakes resource planning in 10- to 30-year cycles. Even community-scale solar and storage projects like those we build at Groundswell take two or more years to complete and can barely keep up with the shifting sands in Washington.

Moreover, new potential energy projects representing more than double our current installed capacity are currently standing in line in interconnection queues. Repealing investment incentives that have driven large-scale project development since 2022 would kill too much of this in-process capacity while the market retools around new rules. Moreover, pre-commercial technologies including advanced nuclear, which use some of the same incentives as solar, have longer development timelines and an even greater need for market stability to reach commercial scale. If we are truly committed to an American-made nuclear renaissance, we need to sustain critical existing policies, including tax credits aligned with U.S. manufacturing, so we can finish building what we’ve started while Congress charts new paths to American AI leadership.

Lasting Permitting Reform

Whether it’s new nuclear or a weatherization program, large and small energy projects face a morass of federal, state, and local permitting and paperwork that isn’t just red tape, it’s a complexity tax that increases project delivery costs and timelines beyond our ability as a society to pay. As a nation, we will not be able to keep up with energy demand, or realize the kitchen table benefits of energy efficiency or AI-driven economic development, without lasting legislative permitting reform.

As a senior advisor at the Office of Management and Budget, I led President Obama’s permitting accelerator and cut timelines in half for $350 billion in infrastructure projects. While we made big gains, the work revealed the need for a more fundamental legislative modernization. More than a dozen federal agencies issue a host of permits defined in laws that have been layered on top of one another over more than a hundred years. Many of these permits have conflicting statutory requirements that make it impossible—and even illegal—for agencies to rally around a shared project timeline or goal. Only Congress can consolidate federal permits and eliminate the complexity tax so America can start building again, but it has yet to pass a bill.

Cutting Household Bills

We are currently producing—and paying for—the energy we need plus the energy we waste. Prioritizing energy efficiency, as mundane as it sounds, cuts waste and has the additional benefit of confronting the affordable housing crisis through the same measures. As with infrastructure permitting, however, there is an inherent complexity tax of duplication and red tape that limits the number of families who realize savings from federally funded energy efficiency programs. The most recent fiscal year (FY) 2026 federal budget proposal would eliminate them almost entirely, effectively increasing household energy bills and raising the risk of shut-offs for people who are already struggling to keep up. The greater opportunity, however, is to sustain the federal commitment to energy efficiency while undertaking the hard work of optimizing program design so that federal funds can be easily layered with utility and corporate investments to get more bill savings, and more available capacity, for the money.

Local solar projects paired with energy storage also have a role delivering bill savings where siting new capacity on the distribution system avoids more costly infrastructure investments. Initiatives like Groundswell’s Southeast Rural Power program and the City of Baltimore’s Community Resiliency Hubs show how municipalities, utilities, and nonprofits are working together to strengthen the local grid and reduce bills. Local programs can scale savings nationally. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) Solar for All program, for example, is enabling 60 teams across every state to build new local solar capacity that will cut electricity bills by a minimum of 20% for nearly one million American families.

Working Together

We’re short on power and families are facing risings costs. We need to expand capacity and lower people’s bills. There are projects and programs in the pipeline that will help achieve these goals if we sustain a stable market environment, and keep investing in efficiency and local projects to keep energy affordable while we transform the permitting process to support the new technologies and American industries that will help make life better and easier for the next generation.

It won’t be simple, particularly in a cultural environment that increasingly rewards outrage, but it’s important to do hard things the right way. Remaining mired in conflict that whipsaws the market each election cycle costs precious time. And as people like me who build stuff for a living know, you can’t build much of anything unless you work together.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Stock_U-S-Capitol-Building_AOC.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:36:45.983364

Known for its diversity and beauty, an agate stone is a form of quartz. It can be translucent and in some cases completely transparent.

Rockhounding, a cooler name for rock collecting, is a favorite pastime for visitors and residents who live in northern Michigan.

Here's what to know about the agate gemstone and where you can find it in Michigan:

How are agate stones formed?

Agates are formed when gas bubbles in lava leave a hole in the ""vesicle"" in the rock, according to the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy.

Silica (silicon dioxide) solutions flow into the hole in the host rock and fill it up over time, making the bands, the news release says.

Different chemicals in the solution cause the bands to be different colors.

How do I know my stone is an agate?

""Agates are sometimes hard to identify, even for the experts,"" Mary Ann St. Antoine, a senior environmental quality analyst in the Marquette District Office of EGLE, said in a news release.

Antoine, who said she found her favorite agate in Grand Marais, encourages collectors not to get discouraged when the outside of the rock has a dull, waxy luster.

Agates are often translucent, so collectors should hold them up to the light to see if they transmit some light.

When is the best time to look for an agate?

EGLE says the best time for Michiganders to look for agates is after a storm, when the waves have washed up new rocks.

Where can I find agate stones in Michigan?

The stones can be found across multiple locations in Michigan including:

Whitefish Point

Muskallonge State Park

Grand Marais Beach

Bay Furnace Beach

Pebble Beach

Agate Beach

Misery Bay

Black River Harbor Beach

Eagle River Beach

Techniques for identifying rocks

These identification techniques, according to the EGLE, can help rock hunters determine the type of rocks they have:

Appearance

Color(also color of a ""streak"" if it can be made by swiping the specimen on a piece of porcelain, creating a powder)

Luster (shiny, dull, glassy)

Fluorescence (shines under UV light)

Unique properties

Shape/structure (crystal form or amorphous?)

Breakage (how does it break apart, cleavage or fracture?)

Density/specific gravity (can get an idea by ""hefting"" to see if it's heavy for its size)

Unique properties

Magnetism

Smell

Radioactivity

What is a Yooperlite?

The republican proposal instead channels that money to wealthy elites, increasing the deficit by trillions of dollars along the way.

Republicans in Congress released their 389-page proposal today and, as expected, it includes several provisions to eliminate popular clean energy credits which were driving a boost in American manufacturing.

The credits were largely established under President Biden as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, which raised hundreds of billions of dollars through tax enforcement on wealthy individuals and corporations and channeled that into energy efficiency credits for American families.

We’ve covered how families could save thousands of dollars on upgrades to lower their energy costs through these credits.

But these credits aren’t just money-saving for Americans, they also work to boost American manufacturing.

Due to various provisions in the bill, particularly around the $7,500 EV tax credit which was limited to cars that undergo final assembly in North America. While loopholes exist, nevertheless the bill resulted in a massive expansion of American manufacturing, driving hundreds of billions of dollars of investment and creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.

But now, republicans in Congress are trying to roll much of that progress back.

Here’s a list of the bill’s various effects related to clean air and energy (via the BlueGreen Alliance):

Attaching restrictions to clean energy and manufacturing tax credits that would make them unusable in practical terms while also “sunsetting” those tax credits early, a move that research suggests will increase costs for American families;

Repealing the Clean Vehicle Tax Credits;

Repealing the Clean Hydrogen Tax Credit;

Clawing back unspent funds for air quality monitoring in schools, clean manufacturing, state and community energy programs, and electric grid upgrades;

Defunding and delaying the Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP), which reduces pollution and protects the health of workers and communities;

Clawing back all unspent Inflation Reduction Act funds, including many provisions that would have lowered energy bills, created jobs, and reduced pollution; and

Attacks on many additional Inflation Reduction Act programs and initiatives.

You can perhaps see a pattern in these effects: they’re primarily targeted towards increasing costs for regular American families who were taking advantage of these tax credits, and towards programs that would keep you and your children healthier.

Previous analyses show how repealing these tax credits would lead to increased electricity prices for all Americans.

It should not be any surprise to anyone that has been paying attention that republicans want to poison you and raise your costs, but some people apparently still need more examples, so here we are.

In particular, the new tax proposal eliminates the US EV tax credit which had driven so much of that investment due to its domestic manufacturing provision (though there are some small carveouts). Not only does that inflate the cost of the best vehicles available today for Americans, it also takes away one of the incentives that was driving investment in US manufacturing.

We’ve warned before that a bill like this would just send more EV jobs to China, a country where nobody is “debating” over which direction the auto industry is going. Chinese automakers all know the industry is going electric, and they’re putting all of their effort into it.

This is quite a contrast with Western automakers which keep hemming and hawing, begging their governments to let them go bankrupt with anti-EV policy decisions that will only slow down their transition towards modernizing to the global EV status quo.

We’ve already seen the effects of other poor policy decisions on manufacturing, with several companies pausing or canceling plans to build manufacturing facilities in North America as a result of tariff chaos at the hands of an ignoramus. Republican districts have been hit hardest, as they were where the majority of this investment had been going.

And we’ve seen it made clear that the republicans in government responsible for protecting clean air would rather poison you and raise your fuel costs, as long as it helps the oil industry which bribed them into their position.

But then, the cherry on top of today’s tax proposal is that its cuts of these credits don’t even have a greater budgetary purpose. Not only was the Inflation Reduction Act revenue-positive – which is to say, it raised more money than it spent, thus reducing the deficit – today’s republican tax bill is revenue-negative, which is to say, it will increase the deficit.

The republican proposal raises the debt ceiling by $4 trillion, and it makes use of virtually all of that headroom, as the Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that it will add $3.7 trillion to US debt. This is largely due to the bill’s significant giveaways to wealthy elites, with the majority of tax cuts targeted at the wealthiest households.

So the government isn’t even getting any savings out of this bill, merely channeling more money from working families to the wealthy elites that the republican party has always tried to benefit (including in other ways than the clean energy credits, like by cutting health care for the poor).

If you have a republican representative, all it takes is 3 republican Congresspeople to oppose this job-killing bill and to stand up for the well-being of their constituents.

Of course, if you have a Democratic representative, it’s also worth letting them know that you oppose the tax bill, just in case a few of them decide to jump ranks and join the republicans in harming America. We certainly hope they don’t, but it could happen.

Among the proposed cuts is the rooftop solar credit. That means you could have only until the end of this year to install rooftop solar on your home, before republicans raise the cost of doing so by an average of ~$10,000. So if you want to go solar, get started now.

The House Committee on Energy and Commerce’s draft budget proposal released Sunday night axes two of the primary avenues by which the electric vehicle giant earns regulatory credits. Congress also appears poised to vote to revoke California’s authority to implement its Zero-Emission Vehicle program by the end of the month, another key source of credits for the automaker. The sale of all regulatory credits combined earned the company a total of $595 million in the first quarter on a net income of just $409 million — that is, they represented its entire margin of profitability. On the whole, credits represented 38% of Tesla’s net income last year.

To add insult to injury, the House Ways and Means committee on Monday proposed eliminating the Inflation Reduction Act’s $7,500 consumer EV tax credit, the used EVs tax credit, and the commercial EVs tax credit by year’s end. The move comes as part of the House’s larger budget-making process. And while it will likely be months before a new budget is finalized, with Trump seeking to extend his 2017 tax cuts and Congress limited in its spending ability, much of the IRA is on the chopping block. That is bad news for clean energy companies across the spectrum, from clean hydrogen producers to wind energy companies and battery manufacturers. But as recently as a few months ago, Tesla CEO Elon Musk was sounding cavalier.

After aligning himself with Trump during the election, Musk came out last year in support of ending the $7,500 consumer EV tax credit, along with all subsidies in all industries generally. He wrote on X that taking away the EV tax credit “will only help Tesla,” presumably assuming that while his company could withstand the policy headwinds, it would hurt emergent EV competitors even more, thus paradoxically helping Tesla eliminate its competition.

While it looks like Musk will get his wish, he probably didn’t account for a small but meaningful carveout in the Ways and Means committee proposal that allows the tax credit to stand through the end of 2026 for companies that have yet to sell 200,000 EVs in their lifetime. While Tesla’s sales figures are orders of magnitude beyond this, the extension will give a boost to its smaller competitors, as well as potentially some larger automakers with fewer EV sales to their credit.

A number of other provisions in the Ways and Means committee’s proposal spell bad news for Tesla and EV automakers on the whole. These include the elimination of the $4,000 tax credit for used EVs as well as the $7,500 tax credit for commercial EVs — which leased cars also qualify for. This second credit, often referred to as the “leasing loophole,” allows consumers leasing EVs to redeem the full tax credit even if their vehicle doesn’t meet the domestic content requirements for the buyer’s credit. The committee also wants to phase out the advanced manufacturing tax credit by the end of 2031, one year earlier than previously planned. While not a huge change, this credit incentivizes the domestic production of clean energy components such as battery cells, battery modules, and solar inverters — all products Tesla is heavily invested in.

The domestic regulatory credits that comprise such an outsize portion of Tesla’s profits, meanwhile, come from a mix of state and federal standards, all of which are under attack. These are California’s Zero-Emission Vehicle program, which sets ZEV production and sales mandates, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, and the Environmental Protection Agency’s greenhouse gas emissions standards.

While the mandates differ in their ambition and implementation mechanisms, all three give automakers credits when they make progress toward EV production targets, fuel economy standards, or emissions standards; exceed these requirements, and automakers earn extra credits. Vehicle manufacturers can then trade those additional credits to carmakers that aren’t meeting state or federal targets. Since Tesla only makes EVs, it always earns more credits than it needs, and many automakers rely on buying these credits to comply with all three regulations.

It’s unclear as of now whether lawmakers have the authority to eliminate the federal fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions standards via budget reconciliation. A Senate stricture known as the Byrd Rule mandates that provisions align with the basic purpose of the reconciliation process: implementing budgetary changes; those with only “incidental” budgetary impacts can thus be deemed “extraneous” and excluded from the final bill. It’s yet to be seen how the standards in question will be categorized. At first blush, fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions standards are a stretch to meet the Byrd Rule, but that determination will take weeks, or even potentially months to play out.

What’s for sure is that California’s ZEV program cannot be eliminated through this process, as the program derives its authority from a Clean Air Act waiver, which was first granted to the state by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1967. This waiver allows California to set stricter emissions standards than those at the federal level because of the “compelling and extraordinary circumstances” the state faces when it comes to air quality in the San Joaquin Valley and Los Angeles basin. California’s latest targets — which require all model year 2035 cars sold in the state to be zero emissions — have been adopted by 11 other states, plus Washington D.C.

These increasingly ambitious goals would presumably cause the tax credits market — and thus Tesla’s profits — to heat up as well, as most automakers would struggle to fully electrify in the next 10 years. But the House voted at the beginning of the month to eliminate California’s latest EPA waiver, granted in December of last year. Now, it’s up to the Senate to decide whether they want to follow suit.

To accomplish this task, Republicans have called upon a legislative process known as the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to overturn newly implemented federal rules. Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, for one, has been vocal about using the process to end California’s so-called “EV mandate,” writing in the Wall Street Journal last week that “it’s time for the Senate to finish the job.” And yet other Senate Republicans are reluctant to attempt to roll back California’s waiver. The Government Accountability Office and the Senate Parliamentarian have both determined that the regulatory allowance ought not to be subject to the Congressional Review Act as it’s an EPA “order” rather than a “rule.” Going against this guidance could thus set a precedent that gives Congress a broad ability to gut executive-level rules.

During his first term, Tesla CEO Elon Musk stood in firm opposition to efforts to roll back fuel efficiency standards. But lately, as the administration has started turning its longstanding anti-EV rhetoric into actual policy, Trump’s new best friend has been relatively quiet. Tesla’s stock is down about 25% since Trump took office, as investors worry that Musk’s political preoccupations have kept him from focusing on his company’s performance. Not to mention the fact that Musk's enthusiastic support for Trump, major role in mass federal layoffs, and, well, whole personality have alienated his liberal-leaning customer base.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MDE5OTcwNC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc2MDYzMTU2MH0.Wjkjtvmf4V9x7ISf28QiCjvOFE01rShCS24f4uTCgPg/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-05-13 15:13:28.384865

On May 10, 1950, Congress established one of the world’s best value, highest impact, and, frankly, coolest science agencies. The NSF finances federal research in just about anything that’s not health (the National Institutes of Health do that).

It’s been a bit of a rough birthday party. Elon Musk’s “DOGE” has been cutting research funding right and left, including at least 13 grants at MSU at the last count. The director of NSF just resigned as the Trump administration announced plans to dissolve its 37 specialist divisions. Trump’s budget proposes cutting NSF by half. The money that would save? About $5 billion, which isn’t that far from the amount of money that the budget wants to give to SpaceX. And of course they are going especially hard after anything that implies a commitment to equity, diversity, or inclusion, whether it’s the whole NSF equity division or research on environmental justice in Detroit.

Michigan researcher’s work on air pollution and racial inequities caught in funding freeze

NSF, unlike the Trump administration, doesn’t “give” money to anybody for anything. It chooses grants for research on an enormously competitive basis – in the 2024 fiscal year, only 15.4% of NSF grant applications were funded. The government is paying universities to do the best possible research with NSF money, and it’s driving a very hard bargain. When a university, be it Harvard, Grand Valley State, or Albion College, gets a grant, it’s not getting a gift of tax money. It’s competing very hard for the right to do science that barely breaks even.

What does NSF do for us? One measure is direct spending. In Michigan, the NSF spent $262 million in fiscal year 2023. The University of Michigan ($132m), MSU, ($66m), and Michigan Tech ($15m) were the largest recipients, but practically every four-year school in Michigan won NSF support. NSF helps support economic engines for the whole state in the big schools, but equally imagine the seasonal, tourism-dependent economy of the Upper Peninsula without Michigan Tech’s success at winning competitive grants for its year-round scientific work.

Michigan also wins when the US wins. NSF works for all Americans, and often the whole world. Imagine the auto industry, or pretty much any industry, operating as it does today without 3D printing. NSF funded that. Artificial intelligence? NSF. The MRI machines that help doctors diagnose you? NSF. The Doppler radar technology that saves lives in severe weather and makes aviation far safer by conquering wind shear? NSF. Lasik? NSF. Polar or undersea exploration? NSF. Duolingo‘s underlying programming? NSF. The internet itself? NSF. The list is a long one, and in each case it means a crucial sector that thrives because NSF took a bet on the underlying science that others commercialized.

It should be no surprise, then, that Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas economists found that federal science funding has implied returns between 140% and 210%- a fantastic investment by any standard and one that by design accrues to communities, small businesses, and all of us.

What happens when funding is interrupted, or cut? Scientists start to leave science, permanently, after as little as a month of interrupted funding. They certainly can find work, but it will probably be work that underuses their skills.

Meanwhile, what happens to the science that does get done when we take away federal funding? Researchers who lose federal support often get private industry funding, which sounds great until we see that it produces lower quality science that is less influential, contains less basic research that leads to breakthroughs, and is more likely to produce a benefit confined to a single business that paid for the research.

That America, of stagnant science and profiteering businesses, might appeal to real estate developer Donald Trump and technology hype man Elon Musk. It shouldn’t attract the rest of us.

Don’t forget that science is fast-moving, collaborative, and international. The European Union and some Canadian institutions are directly trying to recruit our scientists. China, a fierce scientific competitor, has for a long time seen many of its best minds move to the US, teach our students and work in our companies, because of the science ecology that the NSF supported. Trump and Musk are giving Beijing an opportunity to reverse the flow as our immigration and higher education policies make the United States an impossible option.

Cutting federal funding produces scientific stagnation that benefits only a few, short-termist, businesses. By replacing basic, public research with applied, private, research it makes the rich richer and deprives all of us of breakthroughs that come from basic research. And in a state like Michigan, cutting the NSF makes it all the more likely that we continue our decades-long slide from the technological leaders that we were a century ago.

NSF is 75 years young this month. In a better world, we would be strengthening it so it can make our lives even better in the coming years. Unfortunately, we are fighting to protect it, and if we lose the world, and the United States in particular, will be permanently worse off.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-12-192101.png,N,,2025-05-13 14:40:36.481448

For model year 2026, the model makes advancements in range, output, charging performance, and vehicle design. Leading the charge is a larger lithium-ion battery with a higher total capacity of up to 74.7-kWh, equipped on a newly available XLE Front-Wheel-Drive Plus (FWD Plus) model, as well as the XLE All-Wheel-Drive (AWD) and Limited (FWD/AWD) grades. Models equipped with the new battery are projected to have a manufacturer-estimated rating of up to 314 miles* of range on a full charge. A 57.7-kWh battery will also be available on a XLE FWD model.

The 2026 bZ will be equipped with a North American Charging System (NACS) charging port, giving it access to thousands of high-speed charging stations nationwide. Under ideal conditions when using DC fast charging* it is capable of charging from 10% to-80% battery capacity in around 30 minutes. The 2026 Toyota bZ also adopts Plug & Charge capability, an industry standard protocol that allows automatic identification, authentication and authorization at selected charging networks, reducing the need for multiple mobile charging applications.

Toyota’s compact, lightweight and energy-efficient eAxles have also been upgraded. They now use silicon carbide (SIC) semiconductors, which help deliver higher power output. For AWD models, output increases by 50% to 338 combined system net horsepower (hp), making it capable of going from 0-60 MPH in 4.9 seconds. Front Wheel Drive models also boost their output, now delivering up-to 221 hp (previously 201 hp).

The model also receives a name change, switching from the Toyota bZ4X to the Toyota bZ, simplifying the name for customers. The 2026 bZ also presents a refreshed exterior design that harmoniously blends form and function. While maintaining its distinctive aesthetic, the updated model incorporates subtle refinements to the front fascia and lighting elements, with slim LED daytime running lights that integrate into a sleek hammerhead front end. Redesigned front overfenders also change the look, with a newly available color-matched moulding that blends into a lower profile front fascia.

Inside, the 2026 bZ will offer a spacious and technologically advanced cabin designed for comfort and connectivity. The console layout is now optimized, with two front wireless chargers and a new, slimmed down dashboard with a larger 14-inch Toyota Audio Multimedia touchscreen and soft touch materials, gives it a premium feel. The 64 color, customizable ambient lighting throughout the cabin further enhances the tactful interior styling.

The 2026 Toyota bZ is expected to start arriving at Toyota dealerships in the second half of 2025. The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price will be announced closer to on-sale date.

*Ranges and charging times will vary depending on weather and other factors.

Two Battery Choices and Faster Charging

The 2026 bZ battery options include a 57.7-kWh and 74.7-kWh unit, manufacturer estimated all-electric drive range ratings are:

314 miles (XLE FWD Plus; 74.7-kWh battery) *

299 miles (Limited FWD; 74.7-kWh battery) *

288 miles (XLE AWD; 74.7-kWh battery) *

278 miles (Limited AWD; 74.7-kWh battery) *

236 miles (XLE FWD, 57.7-kWh battery) *

For 2026, the bZ adopts a NACS charging port, capable of DC fast charging. It will also have Level One and Level Two AC charging with a higher capacity 11-kW on-board AC charger (up from 7-kW capacity on the prior model). The charging port will be located on the front right-side of the vehicle and the model will come with a dual-voltage charging cable.

A new battery pre-conditioning function is also equipped on all models. This system is designed to bring the battery to an optimal temperature for DC fast charging, which can enable faster charging in colder climates. This function can be activated manually or automatically by setting the navigation system destination to a fast-charging station.

The 2026 bZ also adds steering wheel mounted paddle shifters to activate and adjust regenerative braking. These paddles turn the system on and dial the regenerative braking force up or down based on driver preference to capture additional energy and transfer it to the battery.

The Toyota bZ also has a battery thermal management system, which includes a water-to-water heat exchanger and heating adjustment valve to increase battery temperature, to help optimize DC charging speeds in cold weather. The following systems and equipment are designed to reduce energy consumption, especially power used for heating in cold climates:

Heat pump system for both heating and air-conditioning

Standard Front-seat and steering wheel heaters

Available Front-seat radiant foot-and-leg heater

Available heated rear seats and ventilated front seats

In terms of battery safety, Toyota uses many measures to help protect cell integrity, thanks to the design and a multiple monitoring system intended to protect the vehicle’s battery system. This includes:

Redundant monitoring of battery voltage, current and temperature designed to detect signs of abnormal heating to maintain optimal battery temperature and help prevent cell damage

Utilization of a high-resistance coolant circulation system is designed to help prevent a thermal event from short circuits even in high battery load conditions due to repeatedly switching between high-speed driving and rapid charging

Surprising Capability

On AWD bZ models, the surprisingly capable X-MODE system will be equipped. X-MODE is a function that allows the driver to operate a switch to select a mode according to the road conditions, automatically changing to optimize brake control and power delivery at the wheels for enhanced control and traction.

A feature of the system is Grip-Control. When activated and used at low speeds, the system leverages motor drive power modulation to achieve capable off-road performance. This feature was developed as an added function to react to road surface characteristics and maintain a constant speed to prevent slipping on rough roads.

The bZ’s impressive driving performance is due in part to the BEV-dedicated e-TNGA platform. This architecture allows for a low center of gravity and rigid chassis, thanks to the high-capacity lithium-Ion battery pack placed flat under the floor. Its handling prowess is also due in part to the battery cross-framing structure, which adds to overall vehicle rigidity.

The use of a lightweight body structure with sections of high-tensile steel reinforced frame components around the battery pack, coupled with a dynamic suspension, contributes to the bZ driving feel. An intelligent throttle feature provides a smoother feel when accelerating and decelerating, and Vehicle Stability Control helps the driver maintain vehicle control under adverse conditions.

Design Updates and Comfort Improvements

The Toyota bZ comfortably resides in the small SUV segment, with an 8.2-inch ground clearance, 184.6-inch overall length, 73.2-inch overall width, and 65-inch overall height (including antenna). Its 112.2-inch wheelbase provides for a stable, comfortable ride.

The 2026 Toyota bZ’s design has been updated both inside and out. The front presents a sleeker, more elegant look. The interior has been updated with a new center console for easy use of digital devices and a new instrument panel design, with a 14-inch multimedia screen fitted as standard.

On the inside, both the XLE and Limited grades bring high-tech, comfort focused features. New for 2026 is slimmer dashboard design with front and rear ambient lighting with 64 available colors to set the perfect mood. Dual Qi-compatible wireless smartphone chargers also up the tech in the front of the cabin. Additional standard features for both grades include a heated SofTex-trimmed 3-spoke steering wheel with regenerative braking paddle switches, and a top-mount Multi-Information Display for a heads-up view of the road.

Interior dimensions are designed to maximize space for people and cargo alike. The bZ has a comfortable 42.1-inches of legroom for the front seat and 35.3-inches for passengers in the rear seat. Cargo volume is 27.7 cubic feet behind the second row.

The 2026 Toyota bZ offers a variety of exterior color options, including an option for color- matched overfenders on models that wear Wind Chill Pearl, Heavy Metal, or Black paint. Single and two-tone paint treatments and the following interior/exterior combinations are available:

Active Safety & Driver Assist Technology

The 2026 bZ features Toyota Safety Sense 3.0™, Toyota’s suite of active safety and driver assistance features. This system is designed to support driver awareness, decision-making, and vehicle operation. This system uses a combination of millimeter wave radar and monocular camera to monitor various driving conditions. Please note that Toyota Safety Sense 3.0 systems are not a substitute for safe and attentive driving. The safety suite includes:

Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection: Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection (PCS w/PD) is designed to help detect a vehicle, pedestrian, bicyclist, or motorcyclist and provide an audible/visual forward-collision warning under certain circumstances. If you don’t react, the system is designed to provide automatic emergency braking.

Full-Speed Range Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC): an adaptive cruise control system that is designed to be set at speeds above 20 mph. DRCC uses vehicle-to-vehicle distance control to help maintain a preset distance from the vehicle ahead of you.

Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist (LDA w/SA): detects lane markings or the road’s edge at speeds above 30 mph. LDA w/SA is designed to provide an audible/visual warning if an inadvertent lane departure is detected. If no corrective action is taken, Steering Assist is designed to provide gentle corrective steering for lane-keeping assistance.

Lane Tracing Assist (LTA): designed to help keep the vehicle in the center of a lane. LTA assists the driver with steering control while DRCC is in use.

Road Sign Assist (RSA): uses the forward-facing camera to recognize specific road signs, such as speed limit, stop, and yield signs. RSA provides sign information to the driver via the Multi-Information Display.

Automatic High Beams (AHB): designed to detect headlights of oncoming vehicles and taillights of preceding vehicles. AHB automatically toggles between high and low beams as appropriate.

Proactive Driving Assist (PDA): uses the vehicle’s camera and radar, when system operating conditions are met, to provide gentle braking and/or steering to support driving tasks such as distance control between your vehicle and a preceding vehicle, pedestrian, or bicyclist. PDA can also provide gentle braking into curves.

Blind Spot Monitor with Rear Cross-Traffic Alert is also standard. The BSM system uses rear side radar sensors installed on the inner side of the rear bumper on the left and right side to assist the driver in confirming safety when changing lanes. The RCTA function uses the same sensors installed behind the rear bumper. This function is intended to assist the driver in checking areas that are not easily visible when backing up.

Safe Exit Alert is also standard on bZ.

Fifteen states have sued the Trump administration over the energy emergency declaration.","The Interior Department said it would fast-track the permitting process for a uranium mine in Utah as part of President Trump’s plan to shorten environmental reviews and speed the construction of certain types of energy projects.

An environmental assessment of the Velvet-Wood mine project will be completed in 14 days, the agency announced. Such a review would typically take about one year.

Critics have called the plan to drastically shrink the review time dangerous, and projects that are approved under such a compressed process are likely to face legal challenges.

In a statement, Doug Burgum, the interior secretary, said the expedited process had been established to fix what he called an “alarming energy emergency because of the prior administration’s Climate Extremist policies.” He said that the speedy review “represents exactly the kind of decisive action we need to secure our energy future.”

The Velvet-Wood project, in San Juan County, Utah, aims to produce uranium, which is used as a fuel in nuclear power plants, as well as vanadium, used in the production of steel alloys.

It is being built on the site of an older mine that closed in the 1980s. The company leading the project, Anfield Energy, also plans to restart a uranium mill to extract uranium from ore.

The Interior Department said the project would result in three acres of land “disturbance.” The agency declined to make public the permit application or other documents detailing what it meant by “disturbance.”

Sarah Fields, founder of Uranium Watch, an environmental group based in Utah, said her organization had concerns about effects on water resources, as well as about radioactive waste from mining operations.

Ms. Fields said the expedited approval process also meant “there’s no opportunity for public comment, and the public often brings up issues to the agency that they’re not aware of.”

Corey Dias, Anfield’s chief executive, called the fast-track permits “a game changer for us.”

He said he expected to be able to recover 4 million tons of uranium and nearly 5 million tons of vanadium over the life of the project. “The fact that we’re being recognized as an advanced asset to be put into operation by the government, I think, is a big thing for us,” Mr. Dias said. “It also reflects the nature of the importance of uranium for domestic production.”

The decision to fast-track a uranium project comes as the White House is considering several executive orders aimed at speeding the construction of nuclear power plants to help meet rising electricity demand, according to drafts reviewed by The New York Times.

The Interior Department has said that the United States is “dangerously reliant” on imports of uranium and vanadium to meet its needs. It has argued that, in 2023, U.S. nuclear generators relied 99 percent on imported uranium concentrate, including from Russia.

Mr. Burgum then initiated a process by which environmental reviews that typically take a year to complete would be finished in 14 days. More complicated environmental impact statements, which usually take two years, would be completed in 28 days, the department said.

U.S. energy production has been near record highs.

The Interior Department is condensing the review process by claiming emergency authority under the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act and the National Historic Preservation Act.

Fifteen states have sued the Trump administration over the energy emergency declaration. They have argued that no emergency exists and that the order instructs regulators to illegally bypass reviews of fossil fuel projects, potentially damaging the environment.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/12/multimedia/12cli-interior-fvmb/12cli-interior-fvmb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:36:52.041844

The move has prompted a broader conversation among the Detroit Lakes School Board about the future of the building and the property.

The Lincoln Education Center currently houses Community Education, Early Childhood and Family Education, and preschool programs. While Community Education and ECFE will temporarily move to M State under a multi-year lease, the district plans to work with M State to establish long-term use of space in a designated area of the building.

Preschool programming will be split between Rossman Elementary and Roosevelt Elementary. Roughly 20 staff members will be reassigned to mirror the programming currently offered at Lincoln.

""Both elementary schools are well-equipped with space for student development,"" Community Education Director Andrew Lesch said. ""Moving preschool into these excellent facilities to continue the school readiness program is very exciting.""

Lincoln’s relocation comes after several years of facilities upgrades that began with a 2018 bond referendum. The bond, valued at just over $60 million, funded remodeling and expansions at the elementary schools, the middle school and added two major expansions to the high school. Construction wrapped up in the 2021–22 school year.

“You heard the community say, we want to keep our existing sites, we want to add on, to have enough space,” said Jason Kuehn, Detroit Lakes Public Schools director of finance and operations. “So, adding gyms, adding classrooms, those types of things were done.”

Lincoln has long been a candidate for modernization. The building, one of the district’s oldest, has evolved significantly over the decades and now faces mounting deferred maintenance.

“(Lincoln has) changed and evolved over decades; it's one of our oldest, if not the oldest, properties ... it has a lot of maintenance needs that if we wanted to be in there long term, it's gonna cost a fair amount of money,” Kuehn said.

Immediate repairs — such as roofing and HVAC work — could cost around $2 million in the next few years. After conducting a demographic and space utilization analysis, Kuehn said existing space in the elementary schools and at M State offered a more cost-effective solution.

“I think if we would have been able to pass a $100 million project back in 2018, we would have been able to address some of those needs right then and there,” Kuehn said. “I was the principal over at Rossman, and there were some things that we had to cut out of our project at that time, because ultimately there wasn't enough money for all of the things that were desired.”

Along with new classroom space, enrollment trends have also factored into the decision. The district has seen declining student numbers and an opportunity to reassign early childhood classrooms into available elementary school space.

“We've had a bubble of kids — a bigger group of kids — the last group of them actually are seniors this year,” Kuehn said. “When they were in elementary school, they were always in the 240 to 275 student per grade range — right now, our kindergarten class is currently 175.”

Lesch said the board began transition discussions in February, with families notified of the final decision in early April. Enrollment will be finalized in the coming weeks, and Lesch said communication with families will continue throughout the summer. The conversation, he said, was “ready to happen.”

“It’s going to be really good for families and really good for kids,” Lesch said. “Less transitions to feel comfortable in a building that they’re eventually going to spend their K-5 years in will hopefully help reduce some of those new building jitters.”

Lesch also said he and his staff will keep families updated on social media about the transition timeline.

“There might be a transitional period where we might not be available in person during the move — we will make sure we let the community know how to get hold of us during that state,” Lesch said.

With the decision to cease programming at Lincoln, the School Board is now discussing the future of the building and property. The board began considering its options during a work session on April 22.

“I think the discussion is, do we need that property now or in the future?” Kuehn said during the session.

The board reviewed four options: maintain the building and property as-is, demolish the building and maintain the land, sell the property and building together, or demolish the building and sell the property. If the district chooses to sell the land post-demolition, it must consider how to make it attractive to potential buyers.

“You take on some liability,” Kuehn said about maintaining the building. “You still have to operate it even if you aren't using it — so that kind of gives a framework for all the pieces.”

A facilities committee meeting in June is expected to help shape a final recommendation for the School Board to act on.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/e0a9f60/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3879x2586+0+0/resize/1599x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F31%2F7b%2Fec5d0e344d4f8d375545acf3882c%2Flincoln-5.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:40:40.948695

Dear reader,

As Republicans in the US put forward plans that would end renewable energy subsidies and scrap tax breaks for electric vehicle purchases, clean energy campaigners in the EU are calling for a European competitiveness fund to fill investment gaps.

The House ways and means committee will today discuss “the one, big, beautiful bill”, which Republicans claim will deliver on President Trump’s economic agenda and support pro-family, pro-worker tax provisions.

“Under the economic policies of President Biden and Washington Democrats, the wealthy and well-connected benefited from taxpayer handouts. The ways and means Republican tax bill ends special interest giveaways and will hold the woke elite and entities that benefit from the tax code accountable. It will halt the flow of taxpayer dollars to illegal immigrants and China,” says ways and means committee chair Jason Smith.

Under the section of the bill headed “make America win again” and “working families over elites”, it proposes terminating support for a host of clean energy technologies and actions, including EVs, home energy efficiency improvements, clean electricity, clean fuels, green hydrogen and hydrogen storage.

How to create an EU competitiveness fund for clean tech

Meanwhile, in Brussels, 16 clean tech organisations have written to the European Commission and parliament, backing the creation of a European competitiveness fund.

They highlight four steps they believe can ensure the fund works and keeps the EU on track with its climate action. These include preserving the scope of existing EU programmes for strategic climate and energy investments and increasing the climate mainstreaming target from 30 per cent to 50 per cent under the next multiannual EU budget.

The organisations also underline the importance of simplifying access for small and medium-sized enterprises, co-operatives and households to EU finance and of integrating the efficiency-first principle in investment planning. They likewise warn against reinventing the wheel and advise instead that the EU channels more funding to existing successful programmes like Horizon Europe, the Innovation Fund and InvestEU.

“A more ambitious green industrial policy demands harmonised, targeted EU public funding, which the competitiveness fund promises to provide. But the EU should proceed with caution. If this new architecture comes at the expense of climate action or research excellence, we will be putting our long-term competitiveness at risk,” says Institute for Climate Economics research fellow Ciarán Humphreys.

Reason to stick with biodiversity net gain

Also along the lines of not stopping something that is working, David Hill, former deputy chair of Natural England, urges the UK government not to change the rules on biodiversity net gain, or even scrap the law as some rumours suggest.

Hill says the initiative is beginning to work well. He warns the public purse will never be able to raise the amounts of money needed to protect and restore the UK’s damaged biodiversity. Further, pulling the rug out from the initiative would send the wrong message to investors domestically and abroad, given the high regard in which BNG is held as the first global compliance market for biodiversity, he says.

“If we want markets to work for nature, leveraging far larger amounts of money than a government-run scheme could achieve, we must stop making investors nervous. The government needs to listen,” writes Hill.

ISSB reporting change: ‘a technical cherry on top of a technical cake’

Elizabeth, meanwhile, examines how the proposal by the International Sustainability Standards Board to exclude certain financial sector emissions from Scope 3 reporting has sparked a debate about the extent to which insurers can be held accountable for their indirect emissions.

Ashurst lawyer Becky Clissmann says the ISSB’s move is not a rollback and not analogous to what the EU is trying to achieve with its omnibus proposal. “This is much more nuanced — it’s a technical cherry on top of a very technical cake,” she tells Elizabeth. “The world is definitely realising how difficult it is to do sustainability reporting well, but in that sense it’s very sensible to make sure that what comes out of reporting is decision-useful for investors.”

Ways to rewrite the economy

Finally, today, we dive into the latest report from the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, Rewiring Finance — a New Approach to Financing a Sustainable Economy, which argues that attempts to scale up sustainable finance have failed to deliver the necessary change required to transition to a more environmentally and socially just economy.

The authors make three proposals they believe could alter this dynamic.

First, ensuring industrial and financial policies set out transition pathways for all economic sectors, with incentives for the financial system to deliver on them. Second, a mindset shift that moves the financial sector from compliance to value creation by actively engaging with the risks and opportunities the transition poses.

And third, the report urges the financial sector to embed sustainability into financial values by pricing in the financial materiality of climate change, biodiversity loss and inequalities.

Until tomorrow,

Philippa

Their suit in Seattle federal district court argues that there is no actual emergency, just an administration intent to fast-track certain projects through environmental permit reviews.

The order was part of a slate of day-one directives Trump issued on Inauguration Day. It directs federal agency heads to expedite permitting for energy-related projects using “any lawful emergency authorities available to them.” In remarks at the time, he blamed inflation partly on escalating energy rates and said that “We will drill, baby, drill” to bring prices down.

The suit, filed May 9 by the Democrat-run states, also names the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, as well as several agency leaders. as defendants. State officials in the suit want a judge to declare the order unlawful and to block the agencies from issuing permits on an emergency basis related to the order.

The states argue in their suit that the order is an unlawful reach beyond the president’s legal authority. Historically, the Corps and other agencies have used emergency procedures for projects needed in the aftermath of disasters such as the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil platform explosion or severe damaging storms.

“The invocation of the country’s emergency authorities is reserved for actual emergencies—not changes in presidential policy or because the president feels like it,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement. “These procedures misuse authorities meant for disaster response and bypass important health and environmental protections for the benefit of the fossil fuel industry.”

In his order, Trump stated that expanding national energy infrastructure “is an immediate and pressing priority” to protect national and economic security. Administration officials have not yet formally responded to the suit, but a White House spokesperson told the Associated Press that the president “has authority to determine what is a national emergency, not state attorneys or the courts. {He] Trump recognizes that unleashing American energy is crucial to both our economic and national security.”

By bypassing normal regulatory processes, states say the hastened permitting will result in environmental damage.

“Environmental regulations exist because we’ve seen what happens when they don’t,” said Casey Sixkiller, Washington Dept. of Ecology director, in a statement. “The federal administration is proposing an end-run that ignores the hard lessons of the past. These protections aren’t red tape—they’re guardrails that protect our air, water, land, and keep our families safe.”

States participating in the suit include Arizona, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin. Other than Vermont and Wisconsin, the states also are part of a group of 17 states and District of Columbia that just sued the Trump government over his order temporarily halting permitting approvals for wind energy projects.

But federal officials have already taken action to fast track energy project reviews. The Corps identified hundreds of projects to expedite under the directive. Earlier this month, agency officials in Detroit cited the order when they announced an accelerated timeline for review of Enbridge Energy’s proposed Line 5 Tunnel Project to build a replacement the oil and natural gas liquids pipeline tunnel under the Straits of Mackinac in Lake Michigan.

Public comment on the Line 5 project’s environmental impact statement was moved up from sometime next year to 30 days ending June 30, and Corps officials said they anticipate issuing a decision this fall.

But one observer is skeptical that the expedited approval process will work.

""The AI-related national energy emergency declared by Trump has at best only a tenuous relationship with the Army Corps’ emergency regulation,"" Dan Farber, faculty director of the Center for Law, Energy & the Environment at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law, said in a May 13 opinion in Utility Dive.. ""If the Corps does make wide use of this regulation where it doesn’t apply, courts have an obligation to make the Corps start over again. Thus, the process for processing a permit application will take longer than ever.""

Legal Battlefield

The lawsuit is the latest salvo in a series of developing legal battles over energy, pollution and climate change—with parties that include groups of attorneys general organized by political affiliation, oil and gas companies, industry groups and federal and state governments turning to courts to answer questions about climate liability and compensation.

The administration announced May 1 legal action to prevent states from suing or recovering costs from fossil fuel companies related to climate change, with the U.S. Dept. of Justice on April 30 filing lawsuits against Michigan and Hawaii and complaints against New York and Vermont.

The suits filed against Hawaii and Michigan are preemptive, intended to block the states from suing oil and gas companies, measures they were exploring. The planned legal steps are ""unlawful state overreach that would threaten [U.S.] energy independence,"" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson in the agency's environment and natural resources division. Justice also called “overreach"" Hawaii's suit announced May 1 against fossil fuel companies.

Hawaii Attorney General Anne Lopez termed Justice involvement a “direct attack on Hawaii’s rights as a sovereign state,” and said it would “vigorously oppose this gross federal overreach.”

Hawaii filed against seven oil and gas companies and subsidiaries, as well as the American Petroleum Institute for what it describes as “deceptive conduct leading to the current climate crisis,” in a press release. “Hawaiʻi has spent, and will continue to spend, substantial sums to recover from and adapt to climate change-induced harms,” said the suit. It calls for the firms and lobby group to “abate, directly or through an abatement fund, the harm caused by their conduct.”

The complaints against Vermont and New York pertain to state laws allowing them to recover costs from fossil fuel companies—up to $75 billion over 25 years per New York’s law—to be used for infrastructure and climate adaptation work. Justice wants the laws declared unconstitutional, claiming they are “preempted by the federal Clean Air Act"" and other federal authority.,” according to the press release.

Vermont’s first-in-the-nation Climate Superfund Act and New York’s Climate Change Superfund Act were enacted last year, with several other states considering similar legislation.

The laws are already being challenged by the institute and U.S. Chamber of Commerce in a suit last year, and by attorneys general from 22 states and several industry group in a February suit against New York. West Virginia Attorney General JB McCuskey termed the New York law also ""unconstitutional."" Following the Justice Dept. May 1 announcement, 24 Republican attorneys general asked to join the lawsuit against Vermont.

This board was created to strengthen and expand Kentucky’s agricultural economy through strategic planning, targeted partnerships, and financial incentives. The board will administer programs, such as grants, forgivable loans, and revolving loan funds, to support infrastructure upgrades, market expansion, and value-added agricultural development. The overall goal is to attract private investment, create new economic opportunities, and uplift farming communities throughout Kentucky.

The creation of this board is the result of Commissioner of Agriculture Jonathan Shell’s vision that “Agriculture is Economic Development.” In 2024, Commissioner Shell conducted a statewide listening tour, hosting regional meetings with farmers, business leaders, and community stakeholders. The input gathered during those meetings shaped the priorities and design of this new initiative.

Commissioner Shell will serve as Chairman of the Board and will appoint the following five members to serve on the inaugural Kentucky Agricultural Economic Development Board:

Dr. Kenny Burdine – Dr. Burdine serves on the Kentucky Agricultural Finance Corporation and will represent local economic development. He is an Extension Professor in livestock economics at the University of Kentucky Martin-Gatton College of Agriculture, Food, and Environment.

Lori Noel – Lori Noel serves on the Kentucky Agricultural Finance Corporation and will represent specialty crop producers. She is the Executive Vice President and Chief Lending Officer at FNB Bank in Western Kentucky.

Kevin Fields – Kevin Fields serves on the Kentucky Agricultural Development Board and will represent livestock producers. He owns a cow-calf operation in Madison County and is co-owner of Tri-County Fertilizer and Propane Co.

Neil Denton – Neil Denton serves on the Kentucky Agricultural Development Board and will represent row crop producers. He is a farmer, co-owner of Atlas Media Solutions, owner of Agri-Move LLC and serves as president of the Kentucky Small Grain Association.

Missy Vanderpool- Missy Vanderpool was nominated by the Kentucky Association for Economic Development. She is the Executive Director of the Henderson Regional Industrial Authority.

The Kentucky Agricultural Economic Development Board will operate within the Kentucky Department of Agriculture’s Kentucky Office of Agricultural Policy, under the leadership of Executive Director Brandon Reed. More specifically, it will be housed within the newly created Division of Agricultural Economic Development, led by Director of Economic Development Jacob Estes.

The establishment of the Board comes at a significant moment, as the Kentucky Office of Agricultural Policy celebrates its 25th anniversary in 2025. The Board represents a collaborative effort between the Department of Agriculture, the General Assembly, Kentucky farmers, business leaders, and community stakeholders, all working to strengthen and expand Kentucky’s farm economy.

“As the Kentucky Office of Agricultural Policy marks 25 years of service, it is only fitting that we launch the Division of Agricultural Economic Development,” Executive Director Brandon Reed said. “Commissioner Shell’s vision and passion for advancing Kentucky agriculture are second to none, and I’m proud the General Assembly recognized that by creating this Board.

Having a large stable of big power users willing to throttle back usage could give NRG a critical tool for the future.
Grids are designed to withstand the very hottest and coldest days of the year, when power demand peaks.
“That 14% includes zero from data centers,” but these big power users will be a significant part of NRG’s future, Coben said.
LS Power will keep about 10 gigawatts of natural gas, renewable and energy storage capacity.","NRG Energy Inc. agreed to acquire a fleet of natural gas-fired power plants from LS Power Equity Advisors LLC for about $12 billion including debt, betting the fuel will be crucial to meet electricity demand from data centers.

The cash-and-stock deal calls for NRG to buy 18 gas-fired facilities from LS with a combined capacity of about 13 gigawatts, the companies said Monday in a statement. That’s enough to power about 10.4 million homes.

NRG, a Houston-based independent power producer, has already been a key beneficiary of the AI-driven boom that’s upended the US power system, and now it’s vying to take a bigger share of that growth. Electric demand had been mostly flat for a generation before OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT in late 2022, signaling the arrival of artificial intelligence. Now, a surge in data centers to power AI has reignited investor interest in electric providers.

“It’s kind of like finding the Holy Grail,” Chief Executive Officer Larry Coben, an archaeologist, said in an interview. “This portfolio seems to be the perfect fit for us.”

The facilities NRG is buying are spread across nine states, expanding its footprint in the Northeast and Texas. The move gives NRG a larger presence on the grid run by PJM Interconnection LLC, the operator powering the data center capital of the world in northern Virginia.

NRG is also acquiring LS’s CPower business, a 6-gigawatt portfolio of commercial consumers that has agreed to curtail usage to free up supply when the grid is stressed. Having a large stable of big power users willing to throttle back usage could give NRG a critical tool for the future.

Grids are designed to withstand the very hottest and coldest days of the year, when power demand peaks. That means on most days, there’s spare supply. If power producers can coordinate users to conserve energy when the grid needs it, they can connect more homes and businesses without bringing the system to the brink of blackouts during heat waves and deep freezes.

Investors rallied behind the deal, sending NRG shares up as much as 25% on Monday, the most intraday since July 2017. It was a far cry from the reaction to the company’s last big acquisition of Vivint Smart Home Inc. for nearly $3 billion, which caused shares to plunge and drew ire from activist investor Elliott Investment Management LP.

With the LS purchase, NRG said adjusted earnings per share will now expand at 14% on a compound annual growth rate over five years, up from previous guidance of 10%. The company reiterated its previously announced plan to spend $1.3 billion on share repurchases and dividends of about $345 million.

“That 14% includes zero from data centers,” but these big power users will be a significant part of NRG’s future, Coben said. “We are still vigorously, vigorously pushing that.”

NRG increased its order for big gas turbines with GE Vernova Inc. by 1.2 gigawatts to 2.4 gigawatts. These new power plant would most likely support demand from data centers, though other customers may want to lock in new supply too given tightening in power markets, he said. Coben, who declined to discuss details at this time, said that gas and renewables are both needed to feed the super cycle of demand growth.

The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026.

LS Power will keep about 10 gigawatts of natural gas, renewable and energy storage capacity. It will also hold onto its transmission business, LS Power Grid platform, which has more than 780 miles of high-voltage lines in operation and another 350 miles under construction or development.

Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Scotiabank served as NRG’s advisers on the deal. Citi and Goldman are providing financing. White & Case LLP was NRG’s legal counsel.

Evercore was LS Power’s lead financial adviser.

The House bill would move up the date for which large projects can qualify for incentives.
The process allows for a simple majority vote in the Senate provided a reconciliation bill raises revenue or spends it.","Republican leadership in the Ways and Means committee of the U.S. House of Representatives released Monday night a draft of a reconciliation bill that seeks to undo much of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

The landmark 2022 law implemented a range of incentives that spurred the production of clean energy, electric vehicles, carbon capture, and battery storage. Since the IRA was enacted, the law has spurred more than $275 billion in private investment in the United States.

House Republicans’ axe has fallen in places both expected and surprising.

Under the “expected” column: Electric vehicle tax credits and the ability to transfer tax credits for clean energy production from one organization to another.

The EV tax credit gives consumers up to a $7,500 tax credit on the purchase of an EV; the bill proposes ending the credit in 2026 and reinstating a cap of 200,000 vehicles per manufacturer. Several companies, including Tesla, GM, and Toyota, hit that cap years ago.

The transferability clause has spurred an entirely new market, with over $30 billion worth of deals happening in 2024 alone. The provision allows companies and other organizations to take advantage of IRA tax credits even if they have no tax liability. A church, for example, can install solar panels and sell the tax credits to companies that can make use of the incentives.

There were more surprising changes, too.

Nuclear power, normally a favorite of GOP lawmakers, would no longer benefit from tax credits for electricity generation. The law would also end tax-exempt status for environmental groups if the government decides that they have “supported terrorist organizations.” Advanced manufacturing would also see incentives cut back, as would tax credits for carbon capture, something that many large oil companies have publicly supported.

Sustainable aviation fuel is among the technologies that might see its incentives spared, as were bonuses for clean energy producers known as “adders.” The House bill also does not seek to claw back funds that have already been spent, contrary to what’s happening at the EPA. The House bill would move up the date for which large projects can qualify for incentives.

None of this is set in stone, of course. This is a first draft at a process that’s certain to be drawn out and messy. Lobbyists and political action committees are already rolling out pressure campaigns to dissuade GOP politicians from voting in favor, and they have a chance at succeeding, given how many Republican districts have benefited from the IRA in just a few years.

Whether such an ambitious repeal of an existing law will pass muster under reconciliation rules also remains an open question. The process allows for a simple majority vote in the Senate provided a reconciliation bill raises revenue or spends it. Repealing the IRA would essentially be doing the opposite.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-950173010.jpg?resize=1200,861",N,,2025-05-13 14:34:35.012512

American Bitcoin, the mining firm backed by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., said Monday that it would go public on the Nasdaq through a merger with public company Gryphon Digital Mining. The combined company will operate as American Bitcoin, which lists Eric Trump as a co-founder and chief strategy officer.

The merger marks a more aggressive move by the Trump family into the electricity infrastructure that enables its digital currency business. American Bitcoin started out as a subsidiary of the Miami-based energy infrastructure company Hut 8, which has a portfolio of 15 sites in the United States and Canada totaling more than 1,000 megawatts of energy capacity. Hut 8 will act as American Bitcoin’s exclusive infrastructure and operations partner, according to the companies’ announcement, and American Bitcoin previously said it would co-locate miners at Hut 8 sites.

A presentation by American Bitcoin says that the new venture aims to “become a category leader in the Bitcoin ecosystem” and to achieve “mining leadership” through “Hut 8’s energy advantage, rapid execution and proven team.” The company, the presentation says, can also leverage and expand “access to low-cost power, establishing a fundamental operational advantage” to its mining business.

Upon returning to Washington, Trump wasted no time standing behind tech executives pledging hundreds of billions of dollars to build data centers big enough to command the lead over China in developing artificial intelligence. And Trump has said he wants the U.S. to be the crypto capital of the world, including by opening up energy resources to boost digital mining. “If crypto is going to define the future, I want it to be mined, minted and made in the USA,” Trump said at an industry conference last July while running for his second term.

The White House has framed Trump’s “energy abundance” agenda as an economic necessity for America’s powerful tech companies — largely to power an AI boom, but also for energy-hungry crypto mining and high-tech manufacturing. The White House has rolled out executive orders designed to speed permitting and bypass environmental rules to get data centers and power plants built more quickly. And the Energy Department plans to help private companies build data centers on federal land, including at national labs.

Through American Bitcoin — a Hut 8 subsidiary that was briefly called American Data Center — the Trump family business venture is delving deeper into the energy space where federal policies under Trump intersect directly with access to electricity and fuels. And that comes as the energy industry is in some turmoil. On-again, off-again tariffs and the global economic implications are contributing to a slump in oil prices and pushing up costs for energy technology. Trump has put natural gas build-outs and reviving old coal plants at the center of his energy policy, while attacks on wind and solar power are pushing more of that investment to the sideline.

In an April call launching American Bitcoin, Eric Trump said the winner of the bitcoin race will be “whoever can do it best and most efficiently and most pragmatically, in the cheapest energy environments.”

“We’ve got the best energy policy in this country. That policy is only getting better,” he said in April.

The growing web of Trump-affiliated ventures, including a currency firm World Liberty Financial and the $TRUMP memecoin, are attracting greater scrutiny. Senate Democrats pulled support for bipartisan crypto legislation earlier this month after the Trump family business announced it had completed a $2 billion digital coin deal for a transaction led by MGX, a large investment fund backed by United Arab Emirates.

MGX is also an investor in Stargate, a U.S. data center megaproject that Trump rolled out on his first day in office. Stargate investors OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle and MGX are building its first project in Abilene, Texas, and plan to tap Texas natural gas production for electricity.

Conflicts of interest

The decision to take American Bitcoin public by merging with a Nasdaq-traded firm increases access to technology investors, including those with interests in energy.

The “mining” of digital currency requires massive amounts of computing power. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated last year that digital currency mining accounted for as much as 2.3 percent of the nation’s electricity use based on publicly available data. Plans to survey crypto companies about their energy consumption and sources of energy were halted after an industry lawsuit last year and have not been revived under the Trump administration.

American Bitcoin did not detail what sources of energy it planned to use or where it would build new mining sites. The company also did not reply to a request for comment.

Hut 8 currently owns some or all of 15 power and digital infrastructure sites in Canada and the U.S., according to regulatory filings. That includes a site powered by wind and grid connections in the Texas Panhandle; a grid-connected site in Niagara Falls, New York; and a mine partially powered by a gas turbine in Alberta. At the end of 2024, the company said its development pipeline had approximately 12,300 megawatts of energy capacity.

In the April call, Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot said the company would “focus on developing and monetizing data centers, not Bitcoin mining itself.”

Las Vegas-based Gryphon, meanwhile, has said it entered into an agreement to acquire an Alberta site it could scale up to 4 gigawatts of gas-generating capacity with carbon sequestration. The company said that site could support an expansion into AI and high-performance computing data centers.

Under the deal to go public, the investors in American Bitcoin would control 98 percent of the new company. Gryphon shareholders would hold 2 percent.

Tom Mapes, the president of the Digital Energy Council, said in an interview that the merger shows how “energy and technology are only growing to be more hand in glove and whoever has the access to energy is going to be the leader in technology.” Mapes, whose group represents crypto miners, said the combined company presents some “real opportunities” by representing the energy development and mining businesses.

Erran Carmel, a technology professor at American University who studies digital currency, said the “pay to play” opportunity could enrich the president and his family. The extension to energy-heavy mining of digital assets could also present a conflict of interest for Trump.

“The immensity of the shift on crypto from the Biden administration to the Trump administration is so extreme,” Carmel said. “The Biden administration was understandably hesitant about crypto on a number of levels. Trump has done a complete 180 for the United States.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt rebuffed ethics concerns in a statement.

“President Trump is compliant with all conflict-of-interest rules, and only acts in the best interests of the American public — which is why they overwhelmingly re-elected him to this office, despite years of lies and false accusations against him and his businesses from the fake news media,” Leavitt said in an email.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/61/6e/92ece20948ec807eb9c63ae17426/emirates-crypto-47920.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:37:05.598933

Working-class households would be unable to receive the 30% tax credit for installing rooftop solar if the bill’s language is passed as-is.

It’s just one update to clean energy credits in the Committee’s draft budget bill, which will go through markups today. The bill does not scrap the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) entirely, but does eliminate certain credits and phases out others.

The draft bill removes clean energy credits for individuals, while preserving most of them for large-scale solar developers. It would eliminate the 30% residential ITC (25D) as well as the EV credit (30D) on December 31, 2025.

For large-scale solar, the full value of the ITC (48E) and PTC (45Y) remain intact through 2028 before a phase-down of the total credit to 80% in 2029, 60% in 2030, 40% in 2031 and zero in 2032. That’s earlier than current IRA language, which triggers phase-out at the later of 2032 or when U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from electricity are 25% of 2022 emissions or lower.

ITC adders like the low-income bonus credit and domestic content credit are not mentioned in the bill, so investment banking company Roth Capital Partners said those credits appear to be safe and to follow the same phase-down as the general ITC/PTC. However, transferability of the ITC and PTC would be eliminated two years after bill enactment. The bill also removes the “start of construction” provision and requires projects to be “placed in service” to begin collecting the ITC or PTC.

The advanced manufacturing tax credit (45X) is preserved at full value in the draft bill through 2031 before ending without a phase-down in 2032. Wind products are excluded from the credit starting in 2028.

The bill also adds restrictions to 45X, 48E and 45Y for any involvement with “prohibited foreign entities,” formally known as a “Foreign Entity of Concern,” classified under a 2021 defense bill. For the ITC and PTC, credits can’t be claimed if the facility includes “any material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity.” The bill further defines “material assistance” as “Any component, subcomponent, or critical mineral included in such property is extracted, processed, recycled, manufactured or assembled by a prohibited foreign entity, or any design of such property was based on any copyright or patent held by a prohibited foreign entity or any know-how or trade secret provided by a prohibited foreign entity.”

Solar industry trade organization SEIA said the bill will “effectively dismantle the most successful industrial onshoring effort in U.S. history.”

“This legislation will cause hundreds of American factories to close, eliminate tens of thousands of jobs, force electric bills to skyrocket for everyone, weaken the reliability of our electric grid, and eliminate our capacity to compete with China. This disruption would devastate local, red-state economies, with more than 75% of at-risk factories and investments concentrated in these communities,” said SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper in a press statement.

“The solar and storage industry appreciates the many competing interests faced by this Congress and stands ready to work together with our elected officials to ensure that American energy dominance prevails. The current proposals do not achieve that. Our nation’s energy security and national security are on the line,” she continued.

A multi-phase project of UofL's Christina Lee Brown Envirome Institute, the university said it's the result of more than two years of research, construction and planting, spanning 0.65 acres with 119 new trees and 242 new shrubs.

The forest is much more than a public park, however. UofL said it's a space ""for scientific inquiry into the impact of intense urban greening on human health and the wider urban environment.""

“The vitality of downtown Louisville is inextricably linked to the vitality of the University of Louisville and the entire metropolitan community,” said UofL President Gerry Bradley. “This beautifully renewed green space will benefit not only residents and visitors to the downtown area, it also will serve as a research site for groundbreaking investigations into the connection between trees and health by UofL researchers.”

According to a release, a 30-year lease with Louisville Metro Government allows the Envirome Institute to use Founders Square as an outdoor public laboratory. Researchers can use the park to monitor air and surface temperatures, air quality and how the forest can affect temperature and humidity in the area.

The park has been densely planted with trees, shrubs and ground cover to optimize cooling and reduce urban heat, the university said. The project builds on the university's Green Heart Project, which found trees can lower residents' inflammation levels.

“The Trager MicroForest is part of the wider mission of the Envirome Institute to pursue knowledge about health,” said Aruni Bhatnagar, director of the Christina Lee Brown Institute. “This little forest will not only provide a pleasant space to spend time in downtown Louisville, but it will also help us test how dense urban planting can improve human health. The results of this experiment could inspire and inform the planting of microforests in cities worldwide.”

UofL said the microforest is considered part of its New Vision of Health Campus. Located just across Fifth Street, it will include offices and public spaces to study how environmental factors affect human health.

WARREN, Mich. — General Motors expects to pioneer a new ""groundbreaking"" EV battery technology that the automaker says will reduce costs and boost profitability of its largest electric SUVs and trucks.

GM is targeting the new batteries and chemistry inside them — called lithium manganese-rich (LMR) prismatic battery cells — to be used in full-size electric vehicles such as its Chevrolet Silverado and Escalade IQ beginning in 2028.

The new batteries use more-prevalent, less-expensive minerals like manganese instead of larger amounts of cobalt and nickel that are currently used in EV batteries from GM and other automakers.

Different EV battery chemistries impact everything from the range and safety of EVs to energy efficiency and charging capabilities, among other needs.

""LMR unlocks the premium range and performance at an affordable cost,"" said Kurt Kelty, GM vice president of battery, propulsion and sustainability, during a media event at the automaker's tech and design campus in suburban Detroit. ""It's a game-changing battery for electric trucks.""

GM's first-to-market expectations come after crosstown rival Ford Motor earlier this month announced its intention to launch what it similarly called ""game-changing"" LMR batteries before 2030.

GM

LMR batteries have been around for decades, but they've historically offered a far shorter lifespan, according to Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at auto advisory firm Telemetry.

It's a problem GM believes it has solved with its LMR batteries, which are being developed in partnership with LG Energy Solution.

Ultium Cells, a GM and LG Energy Solution joint venture, plans to start commercial production of LMR prismatic cells in the U.S. by 2028, with preproduction expected to begin at an LG Energy Solution facility by late 2027.

LMR prismatic cells

Prismatic cells references the form, or shape, of the square battery cells. They've historically been used in hybrid vehicles such as the Toyota Prius, followed more recently by EVs.

GM, for several years, has been using rectangular ""pouch"" cells in the U.S., while also also utilizing cylindric cells in China. GM says it first started researching manganese-rich lithium-ion battery cells in 2015, accelerating the technology development in recent years.

GM expects the new prismatic LMR batteries and supporting technologies to cut hundreds of pounds from its large EVs. The new battery packs will have 50% fewer parts as well as a significant reduction in the number of modules, or cell cases, inside the vehicles' battery packs, GM said.

Photo by Steve Fecht for General Motors

For EVs, battery cells are typically combined into battery modules, which are then installed in battery packs that get integrated into a vehicle.

Kelty said the LMR batteries will be supplemental to GM's current pouch cell batteries, formerly known as Ultium, as well as upcoming LFP — lithium iron phosphate — prismatic battery cells that are expected to be used in smaller, entry-level EVs.

""We're going through a massive growth phase in our EV side of the business,"" Kelty said, noting that GM has surpassed Tesla as the top EV battery manufacturer in North America. ""We're really building a electrification powerhouse.""

GM expects the LMR prismatic battery cells to have 33% higher energy density, providing addition miles of range, compared with the best-performing LFP cells, but at a comparable cost.

Kelty declined to discuss the specific cost of the batteries, commonly measured in dollars per kilowatt-hour, or kWh, but confirmed the company achieved a cost reduction of $60 per kilowatt-hour last year.

Scott Mlyn | CNBC

The average cost of battery packs for EVs dropped 20% to $115 per kilowatt-hour in 2024, according to a BloombergNEF battery price survey released in December.

Abuelsamid, a former engineer turned analyst, estimates GM's packs with LMR prismatic batteries are likely around a cost of $80 to $90 per kWh. That compares with at least $125 per kWh for GM's current batteries, he said.

GM declined to disclose whether vehicles with LMR batteries will be profitable upon launch. The Detroit automaker said nearly 50% of its current EVs in the first quarter were variable profit positive, meaning they generated enough revenue to cover their production costs.

'Next step'

Kelty described LMR as the ""next step"" in GM's EV plans. The automaker has sunk billions of dollars into electrification as part of an ongoing, yet scaled back, plan under GM CEO Mary Barra.

In 2021, Barra said GM would exclusively offer EVs by 2035, investing $35 billion between 2020 and 2025. The company has since said customer demand — which has been slower than expected — will dictate its EV plans. It also has not disclosed its total EV investment thus far.

GM believes the LMR batteries will assist in lowering barriers for consumer adoption of EVs. Most notably, concerns around cost and range. Other hurdles, such as charging infrastructure and consumer education, remain.

CR’s March 2025 nationally-representative survey found overwhelming support for energy efficiency standards among Americans across the political spectrum

WASHINGTON, D.C. — The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is reportedly planning to shutter its long-running Energy Star program.

Sara Enright, senior director of safety and sustainability policy at Consumer Reports, said: “Energy Star empowers consumers, guides businesses, and supports innovation—all while saving Americans a lot of money. It has delivered huge benefits for the economy, public health, and the environment for more than three decades. We urge officials to find a way to keep this program going.”

Shanika Whitehurst, associate director for Consumer Reports’ product sustainability, research and testing team, said: “If this popular program goes away, it would be a big loss for the millions of consumers who’ve come to recognize and trust the label every time they shop for major products and appliances. The loss would hit especially hard at a time when people are dealing with unpredictable energy bills and trying to cut expenses.”

Launched by the EPA in 1992 during the Bush administration, the Energy Star program has become a cornerstone of the U.S. energy efficiency movement. It sets voluntary standards for appliances, electronics, lighting, and HVAC systems—and awards a widely trusted label to products that meet or exceed those standards. The blue Energy Star logo is now widely visible throughout American homes, stores, and workplaces.

By raising awareness of energy-efficient products and helping consumers make informed choices, Energy Star has driven market demand for innovation to drive down home energy costs. Today, more than 40% of Fortune 500 companies participate in the program, and over 800,000 product models have earned Energy Star certification. According to the EPA, every dollar invested in Energy Star has delivered nearly $350 in energy cost savings for U.S. households and businesses. Households using Energy Star certified products save an average of $450 annually on utility bills—real relief for consumers facing rising energy prices.

CR’s March 2025 nationally representative survey of 2,291 U.S. adults found overwhelming support for energy efficiency standards. Eighty-seven percent of Americans—including 94% of Democrats and 82% of Republicans—agree that home appliances for sale in the U.S. should be required to meet minimum levels of energy efficiency.

When asked what an “energy efficient” label means to them, 73% of Americans said it signals cost savings on energy bills compared to an appliance without the “energy efficient” label. A little under half (46%) said such a label indicates a lower environmental impact than an appliance without that label.

How Do We Determine the Best Hybrid Cars for the Money?

Often, a hybrid powertrain comes at a higher cost. To determine if a hybrid vehicle’s added expense is worth the cash for buyers, we devised an efficiency-cost rating, which is simply the EPA’s combined mpg rating divided by the base price (MSRP plus destination charge). We then multiply that result by 1,000. A high mpg rating and low price provide a high efficiency-cost rating. The higher the score, the better it is.

This list is composed of model-year 2025 hybrids without a plug, and we don’t account for vehicle equipment levels, quality judgments, cost of car ownership or any variances from EPA mileage estimates. The goal here is to pay the least for the most mileage, barring all other considerations. We also denote where the vehicle is assembled to account for any tariffs that could affect the price of the car.

It comes with two hybrid powertrain choices: one that prioritizes fuel efficiency and the other that leans more into horsepower. As far as competition, the Crown has the class to itself, as other full-size hybrid sedans hail from luxury automakers.

Pickup Truck

2025 Ford Maverick

Price: $29,840

Gas mileage: 42/35/38 mpg

Efficiency-cost rating: 1.33

Assembly point: Mexico

Ford’s compact Maverick pickup truck tops the list because of its blend of efficiency, utility and affordability. Few trucks currently offer a hybrid engine, so competition is slim. For 2025, AWD is now available with the hybrid powertrain. Ford’s larger F-150 hybrid is much more expensive and rated lower at 22/24/23 mpg.

Subcompact SUV

2025 Toyota Corolla Cross Hybrid

Price: $29,845

Gas mileage: 45/38/42 mpg

Efficiency-cost rating: 1.65

Assembly point: U.S. (Huntsville, Ala.)

The 2025 Toyota Corolla Cross Hybrid tops the list for subcompact SUVs, and it’s no surprise since it’s based on the also-competitive Corolla hybrid sedan. Powering the hybrid model is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine and three electric motors making a combined 196 hp; AWD is standard.

Compact SUV

2025 Kia Sportage Hybrid

Price: $30,185

Gas mileage: 42/44/43 mpg

Efficiency-cost rating: 1.42

Assembly point: South Korea

Kia’s compact Sportage SUV comes in a few flavors, including a plug-in hybrid for those looking to boost their fuel economy even more. It has some competition in the compact SUV class, including the more expensive Toyota RAV4 Hybrid (39 mpg combined) and Hyundai Tucson Hybrid (38 mpg combined). The RAV4 earned a distant second place to the Sportage with a 1.16 rating on our efficiency-cost scale.

Mid-Size SUV

2025 Hyundai Santa Fe Hybrid

Price: $39,775

Gas mileage: 36/35/36 mpg

Efficiency-cost rating: 0.91

Assembly point: U.S. (Montgomery, Ala.)

Hyundai redesigned its three-row mid-size Santa Fe SUV for 2024 with more rugged styling, a more versatile cabin and a hybrid variant that delivers much better fuel economy than the gas version. A very close second is the 2025 Kia Sorento Hybrid, which starts a bit higher at $40,105; it gets an EPA-estimated 36/36/36 mpg for an efficiency-cost rating of 0.90.

Minivan

2025 Toyota Sienna

Price: $40,635

Gas mileage: 36/36/36 mpg

Efficiency-cost rating: 0.89

Assembly point: U.S. (Princeton, Ind.)

Currently, electrified minivan choices are slim — but they’re growing. The 2025 Toyota Sienna comes only as a hybrid. The 2025 Chrysler Pacifica comes as a hybrid, as well, but it has a plug. For 2025, competition increases with the 2025 Kia Carnival Hybrid. Starting at $42,235 and with a fuel economy rating of 34/31/33 mpg, it earns a 0.78 cost-efficiency score.

The health of Hoosiers and Indiana’s environment may bear some of the costs of massive cuts the Trump administration is calling for at the U.S. EPA, according to a former agency official and local advocates.
“That would be devastating and really eviscerate the people and programs currently serving Hoosiers and others,” Shore said.
The Sierra Club put together an online dashboard to track the effects the Trump administration’s EPA cuts have related to coal pollution.
“Without these rules being enforced there will be thousands and thousands of tons of extra air pollution, extra water pollution,” Anderson said.","President Trump has proposed a 55% cut to the U.S. EPA's budget.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has proposed further cuts to his own agency.

These cuts could create more pollution to Indiana's air and water, advocates say.

The health of Hoosiers and Indiana’s environment may bear some of the costs of massive cuts the Trump administration is calling for at the U.S. EPA, according to a former agency official and local advocates.

Indiana already ranks dead last in a U.S. News and World Report ranking of state's natural environment based examining air and water quality as well as overall pollution. The state also has some of the most polluted waterways in the country and the largest number of toxic coal ash ponds of any other state.

Advocates say the plans announced by President Donald Trump and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin to slash the agency’s budget and staff could affect Indiana’s water and air quality, leading to poor public health outcomes such as more asthma attacks, lost workdays due to illness, and premature deaths while continuing the state's legacy of environmental degradation from pollution.

Zeldin announced the agency would undergo a reorganization that includes cutting staffing levels to what he said were similar to when former President Ronald Reagan was in the White House. He also said he was reducing EPA’s annual budget by $300 million.

“We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S. and more,” Zeldin said in a recorded speech in March announcing his deregulation efforts.

Trump’s recent budget proposal calls for 55% cuts to the agency’s overall budget including nearly $2.5 billion from the Clean Water State Revolving Fund that provides low-cost financing to communities working on water quality projects. This comes after his administration clawed back billions in grant funding for environmental and climate change initiatives in February, resulting in Indiana potentially losing $100 million in federal assistance.

Former EPA official on Indiana’s future

Debra Shore, former administrator for EPA’s Region 5, which oversees Indiana and other Midwest states, told IndyStar cuts to staffing and funding would undermine the agency's ability to respond to emergencies, weaken clean air and water enforcement and reduce monitoring for pollutants like PFAS and lead.

“That would be devastating and really eviscerate the people and programs currently serving Hoosiers and others,” Shore said.

The EPA in 2024 awarded and spent more than $63 billion across the U.S., but the agency only needs 35% of that total to accomplish its mission, the EPA press office said in a written statement to IndyStar.

""We will be exceptional stewards of taxpayer dollars with a laser focus on EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment and Powering the Great American Comeback, which is anchored in providing clean air, land, and water for ALL Americans,"" the statement says.

But Trump’s cuts to the EPA could result in Indiana losing out on another $130 million in grant money meant for safe drinking water, according to data from the Environmental Protection Network, an organization of former EPA staffers. The group also projects the cuts would slash 65% of EPA’s Region 5 workforce — about 700 employees — including from its enforcement, emergency response and drinking water programs.

These employees work directly with Hoosiers on environmental issues.

The full extent of the proposed cuts are still unknown, but whatever they are will also affect communities where some of this money would be headed. Shore, who helped oversee some of EPA’s work in Indiana when she was in office during the Biden presidency, said the federal money was a boon for Indiana communities.

“Those were direct injections into local economies, because the contractors doing that work were going to be hired locally,” Shore said. “Many of the goods and supplies that were going to be used were American made or even locally provided, and the workers live and work in those communities.”

Hoosier advocates react to EPA cuts

David Van Gilder, senior policy and legal director at Hoosier Environmental Council, said the Trump administration's contention that every federal agency is rife with waste, abuse and fraud is a false premise. He added the idea the EPA could do the same heavy-lifting work with half of its people and resources doesn’t make sense.

“When it comes to federal or state agencies doing important work, there is a reason you have scientists and analysts focusing on one specific issue and know it up and down and backward and forward,” Van Gilder said. “When you get rid of those people you not only lose that one person, but that legacy expertise and institutional knowledge, too.”

Looking back at Indiana’s history, Van Gilder said the waterways used to be a horror show. The only reason they’ve been cleaned up in any fashion is because people in agencies like the EPA are doing the work to regulate industries that pollute.

“As much as we love the jobs they produce and the economic engine they have been for Indiana, they do not self-regulate,” Van Gilder said.

Had industry not been adhering to regulations, Shore said events like the Canadian wildfire smoke would be much worse for the health of Hoosiers as they would have been exposed to even more dangerous chemicals.

“If we hadn’t done such a good job of reducing emissions from steel mills and power plants, and so on,"" Shore said, ""people would have died.”

Cuts could worsen coal pollution

While Hoosiers may lose out on federal grant money and assistance from the EPA during disasters, coal could once again get a boost from lax regulations.

The Sierra Club put together an online dashboard to track the effects the Trump administration’s EPA cuts have related to coal pollution. The interactive map gives users any idea on how much pollution could be avoided if air and water rules are upheld.

Rolling back rules like the agency’s Good Neighbor Plan, mercury and air standards and effluent limitations would leave Hoosiers exposed to dangerous pollutants, said Megan Andersson of the Hoosier Chapter of the Sierra Club.

“Without these rules being enforced there will be thousands and thousands of tons of extra air pollution, extra water pollution,” Anderson said. “That means more premature deaths for Hoosiers, more asthma attacks, more lost workdays due to illness, and so on.”

The EPA cuts could also lead to reduced oversight and monitoring of the harmful emissions from coal plants, Shore said. Opening the door for coal to regain some foothold in the energy world is a sort of attack on the clean energy sources that contributed to less pollution and healthier air, she said.

Tony Mendoza, senior attorney with Sierra Club, said all of these cuts and rollbacks undermine the ability of the federal government to regulate industry.

“The destruction of government capacity to regulate creates opportunities for the worst actors to get away with violating emissions standards,” Mendoza said.

Given President Donald Trump’s longtime derision of clean energy and his desire to boost American oil, gas and coal, it’s no surprise LPO would be on the chopping block.
The internet, the moon landing, atomic energy — and the industries built on top of them — were all the product of government investment.
Congress finally has a big idea for AI regulations: It wants to stop states from issuing any at all, for a decade.
POLITICO’s Pieter Haeck reported for Pro subscribers on the visit, which will come as the Trump administration seems to be escalating its trade war with the European Union.","A Department of Energy program beloved by the tech right might become the latest victim of the Trump administration’s war on “woke.”

As part of the House Energy & Commerce Committee’s reconciliation budget text released late Sunday night, the majority of the hundreds of billions of dollars authorized for the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office would be rescinded.

The LPO was pumping hundreds of millions, and in some cases billions, of dollars into speculative and future-tech projects under the administration of President Joe Biden, funded by the Inflation Reduction Act. While many of the projects were part of a liberal-friendly clean energy push, the LPO also funded bipartisan or even somewhat GOP-coded projects like the restarting of the Palisades nuclear plant in Covert, Michigan.

Its potential gutting prompted immediate anguish from one conservative wonk, who compared the Republican-controlled Congress to an environmental group: “Who needs the NRDC to wreck nuclear when we have House Energy and Commerce?”, wrote Emmet Penney, a pro-nuclear energy scholar at the right-leaning Foundation for American Innovation, on X.

In one sense it’s obvious why the LPO would be an easy target for Washington Republicans. The office, created in 2005, went largely inactive for a decade starting in 2011 after Republicans made a massive national story out of its investment in the failed solar panel firm Solyndra, which defaulted on a $535 million LPO loan. When Congress revived it and boosted its lending authority to more than $400 billion, the money went largely to fund Biden’s clean-energy goals.

Given President Donald Trump’s longtime derision of clean energy and his desire to boost American oil, gas and coal, it’s no surprise LPO would be on the chopping block. DOGE has already cut 60 percent of the LPO’s staff.

But politically it’s not as simple as that. In the current energy-hungry tech environment, this is actually an issue that splits Republicans. A growing coalition on the right and center-right has been vocal in its support for the program — saying it’s exactly the kind of risk-taking venture the U.S. government should be involved in if it really wants to usher in the shiny, sci-fi future promised by prominent figures on the right like Elon Musk.

Penney, as part of a think tank joint-venture “Techno-Industrial Policy Playbook” published last week, wrote a proposal for “Advancing Nuclear with the Loan Programs Office” which argued that “If America wants to win, it needs to invest in radically expanding its nuclear fleet.”

He lays out a conservative-friendly case that the LPO could revitalize American energy by re-opening currently shuttered nuclear plants, as well as revitalizing the heartland by converting coal plants to nuclear and creating a pipeline to commercialize prototype nuclear systems. (Earlier this year Secretary of Energy Chris Wright played up his approval of the second and third disbursements from the LPO to Michigan’s Palisades plant, launched under the Biden administration last year.)

This is more than just a policy disagreement over who, how, and where new sources of power should be funded — it’s one about whether Republicans should take a stronger policy hand in directing the American state and economy.

“We have the nationalist developmental side [of the GOP], then we have the free marketers, and these people don’t really know how to get along,” Penney told DFD. “The institutional path dependency is towards the more traditional GOP stance, and we’re now watching that play out with the politics of the LPO.”

In large part, this debate is over the role of government support in tech innovation — a policy very much under fire right now, but arguably the bedrock of the whole economy we live in. The internet, the moon landing, atomic energy — and the industries built on top of them — were all the product of government investment.

For a while during the Biden administration it seemed like Washington had found fresh bipartisan enthusiasm for such projects, most notably in the form of the CHIPS and Science Act, which authorized massive subsidies for semiconductor manufacturing and domestic research (although Congressional spending often fell short, especially in the case of the research component). But the all-out war waged by Trump, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought and Elon Musk’s DOGE on non-defense spending has caught that bill and an endless list of similar federal programs in its crosshairs, with Trump even calling in his address to a joint session of Congress in March to end CHIPS and Science.

That’s left voices on the right like Penney’s — and their unexpected allies on the left and center, like The American Prospect’s Ryan Cooper, who called the LPO one of the “hidden gems of American government” in lamenting its planned elimination — largely out in the cold. Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), one of CHIPS and Science’s key architects, petitioned the Trump administration in February to save American research funding, and last week re-introduced a bipartisan 2021 bill that would restore much of it, but has failed to gain much traction.

“It feels like we’re at a time of reprisal,” Penney said, making a case that the Trump administration’s aggressive cost-cutting could threaten future innovation.

“This really hurts nuclear, but I also think that it might even threaten the bipartisan consensus … the base of Democratic support for nuclear is premised on faith in the federal government, and when you deteriorate that faith, it will poison the water on Democratic support for nuclear.”

It’s unclear what the LPO’s ultimate fate might be — the Trump administration’s own draft budget left it largely untouched, while Trump issued an executive order on Friday directing a quadrupling of the U.S.’ nuclear power capacity, something that seems unlikely without the LPO given the extent to which it allows government to take on much of the inherent risk in investing in nuclear.

So far, however, the burgeoning tech right has hoped Trump’s alliance with prominent tech figures, stated commitment to revitalizing American industry, and thirst to dominate China would win out over his revanchist obsession with tearing down the modern administrative state.

But if the steamroller approach the Trump administration and the GOP-controlled Congress have taken to experimental programs like the LPO is any indicator, they might find themselves in the same boat as other parts of his coalition like pro-Palestinian activists, strict pro-life Catholics, and even right-leaning immigrants, burned on key issues after lending Trump their political capital.

an ai moratorium?

Congress finally has a big idea for AI regulations: It wants to stop states from issuing any at all, for a decade.

Last night, Republicans added a surprise piece of language to the budget reconciliation bill that would put a 10-year moratorium on state and local AI laws. POLITICO’s Mohar Chatterjee and Anthony Adragna reported for Pro subscribers on how the move by the House Energy & Commerce Committee would re-set the terms of AI regulation for the rest of the country.

It’s far from clear whether this is politically viable, or even legal. But it comes as tech giants are pushing Washington in the same direction.

POLITICO’s Brendan Bordelon and Chase DiFeliciantonio reported today on a campaign by companies including OpenAI, Meta, Google, IBM and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz to convince Congress to pass AI rules before the states — in particular California — do the same.

California lawmakers responded to the latest moves in Congress with harsh criticism. Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener called it “illegal and bad,” telling POLITICO’s Sacramento tech reporter Tyler Katzenberger, “This latest power play to try to broadly ban states from protecting the public — it’s a gold rush,” adding, “We need to say no.”

an eu envoy

The EU’s tech chief Henna Virkkunen will visit the U.S. this week. POLITICO’s Pieter Haeck reported for Pro subscribers on the visit, which will come as the Trump administration seems to be escalating its trade war with the European Union. A representative told Pieter that Virkkunen’s agenda is “still being finalized.”

Last Thursday Virkkunen said she spoke with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg about “compliance” with the European Union’s Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act. The EU stuck Meta with a €200 million fine in April for violating the DMA.

It's still early in what could be a lengthy and contentious process for the federal budget. The big issue is how President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers will find enough spending to cut to continue the tax cuts first passed in 2017.

Several tax credits created or expanded in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act that focus on clean energy are on the chopping block in draft amendments to be considered Tuesday by the House Ways and Means Committee.

Interested in understanding the impact solar can have on your home? Enter some basic information below, and we’ll instantly provide a free estimate of your energy savings.

Clean energy industry groups and others are already gearing up to fight the proposal, and some Congressional Republicans have previously expressed a desire not to terminate the tax credits.

What energy and electric vehicle credits would change

The proposal would essentially nix tax credits for home energy and electric vehicles in the IRA.

According to the plan, the residential clean energy credit, which provides a 30% tax credit for home solar panels, batteries, geothermal heat pumps and more, would expire at the end of 2025. The credit is currently set to expire at the end of 2034. The tax credit for rooftop solar panels has existed, in some form or another, since 2005.

The clean vehicle credit, which provides up to $7,500 for new electric vehicles, would also expire at the end of the year, instead of 2032. An exception would allow buyers to claim the credit during 2026 on vehicles that haven't sold 200,000 units as of the end of 2025.

The energy efficient home improvement credit, which covers items like home energy audits, heat pumps, air conditioners and water heaters, would also be cut at the end of 2025, instead of its current expiration date of 2033.

These changes, if they pass, wouldn't affect vehicles or projects purchased in 2025 -- including any purchases you may have already made with the tax benefits in mind.

Taxpayers claimed more than $6 billion under the clean energy credit and $2 billion under the energy efficient home improvement credit in 2023, the first full year they were available at the IRA's rates, according to IRS data. More than 750,000 tax returns claimed a credit for rooftop solar panels that year.

Nothing is final yet

The federal budget process is a bit more complicated than the I'm Just a Bill song in Schoolhouse Rock, but the important note at this point is that the process is only beginning.

Groups backing clean energy have already started to oppose the proposal. Abigail Ross Hopper, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in a statement Monday that the changes would be devastating to efforts to build domestic manufacturing of solar technology. She also criticized the proposed cut of the residential credit for undermining ""our individual liberties and freedom to choose how we power our homes.""

More clean energy also means cleaner air and water—outcomes that improve Hoosier’s quality of life, the local environment, and people’s health.","The benefits of federal clean energy tax credits are clear. Adding diverse energy resources to Indiana’s grid increases reliability, decreases consumer costs, creates jobs, and has the potential to foster massive economic growth — to the tune of $565.7 million annually.

That is why, in 2022, the federal government created this set of tax credits to incentivize the development of clean energy infrastructure and technologies. In the first two years, $9 billion has been invested in projects across Indiana. An added $20 billion in outstanding investment for projects has been announced but not implemented. Through these tax credits, Indiana has expanded the sector and fostered economic growth to the benefit of all Hoosiers, and there should be more to come.

A new study commissioned by The Nature Conservancy shows that between now and 2032, these credits will annually generate $300.8 million through household income, $59.3 million in local, state, and federal tax revenue, and support 6,300 jobs. Further, these benefits are not isolated to only one industry but span construction, manufacturing, professional services, and the supply chain.

Despite the incredible results and the promise for future growth, these tax credits are at risk of being eliminated. The current budget talks make tax credits an easy target for federal cuts looking to reduce the debt fast. In response, 21 Republican members of the House of Representatives signed a letter showing their support for these credits. But this may not be enough to save them from being cut. That is why we urge the entire Indiana Congressional delegation to use their influence while serving on key committees to protect this potential growth engine for our state.

We can keep Indiana competitive in the national market and support local businesses. However, we must take full advantage of all the available tools, including clean energy tax credits. As the new administration works to encourage industries to return to the U.S., it is imperative to keep Indiana a desirable environment to retain and attract strong economic potential. Indiana, with its clear advantage due to a diverse energy portfolio—both in infrastructure and land—is set to benefit.

Hoosier businesses make decisions based on economic potential. The clean energy tax credits offer a proven way to foster economic growth, bolster manufacturing, lower energy costs, and attract more companies to Indiana—all while diversifying energy sources and promoting clean energy. More clean energy also means cleaner air and water—outcomes that improve Hoosier’s quality of life, the local environment, and people’s health.

In fact, of the 28 cities studied — all with a population of 600,000 and up — each one of them was experiencing what’s called land subsidence.

That is to say: they are sinking.

Some far more than others, but Detroit’s subsidence was eighth highest among the cities studied, trailing Houston (5.22 millimeters per year); Fort Worth (4.37 millimeters per year); Dallas (3.85 millimeters per year); New York City (2.43 millimeters per year); Chicago (2.32 millimeters per year); Columbus (1.93 millimeters per year); and Seattle (1.85 millimeters per year).

Researchers concluded that groundwater extraction more broadly was a primary culprit for the subsidence in most cities, along with other factors.

See, for example, the three cities with by far the greatest amount of decline: Houston, Fort Worth and Dallas, all in a state that relies heavily on groundwater extraction for things like agriculture and other uses. In all, about 80% of the sinking across the cities studied was attributed to groundwater withdrawal.

That’s not quite the case in Detroit, however.

The slow sinking of the city is primarily due to glacial isostatic adjustment, or what the researchers shorthand to “GIA.” Basically, that’s the lingering effects of the last Ice Age some 16,000 years ago.

Although the thick ice that once covered huge chunks of the country has long since melted, the land is still reacting. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration likens it to when a soft mattress slowly returns to its original form after the person lying in gets up.

Other cities that fit into that category include New York, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Denver, Indianapolis, Columbus, Nashville, Chicago and Portland.

Jeremy Bricker, an associate professor of engineering at the University of Michigan, said even though Detroit is subsiding, Michigan, more broadly, is actually rising.

That’s because the state was once covered by the 5 million square mile North American Laurentide ice sheet, which in some areas was up to two miles thick.

""If you think of the whole continent in general, the places that had the glaciers, they were pushed down,"" Bricker said. ""They are gradually rebounding upwards. Most of Michigan was covered, but it's certainly possible that there are some pockets that are behaving otherwise.""

Just 0.3% of Detroit’s land area had no observed subsidence, while 97.5% had subsidence between zero and three millimeters per year. The remainder of the land had subsidence between five and 10 millimeters per year.

That doesn’t just affect roads and bridges and buildings. It affects people, as well.

The research team determined that just 32 Detroiters live in a portion of the city where there was no observed subsidence. But 596,307 people live in parts of the city that are sinking by a rate of up to three millimeters per year. The researchers found that 1,416 people are living in parts of Detroit where the subsidence is between three and five millimeters per year, and 292 live in areas where the subsidence is between five and 10 millimeters per year. Ten millimeters is about the same size as a pencil eraser.

The threat to buildings is generally low, the researchers said, but it’s definitely not a non-zero number.

Of Detroit’s stock of some 453,500 buildings, 362 were high risk and another 39 were very high risk. Put another way, that’s one of every 1,131 Detroit buildings were at high or very high risk — far fewer than San Antonio (one in every 45), Fort Worth (one in every 143) and Memphis (one in every 167).

Researchers described subsidence’s potential damage to buildings as “one of the most harmful yet less visible effects” because it “can occur even with minor changes in land motion,” essentially meaning that “infrastructure can be silently compromised over time, with damage only becoming evident when it is severe or potentially catastrophic.”

Bricker said that if subsidence occurs non-uniformly, it can present problems for the built environment.

""If you have a given site that's subsiding two millimeters on one part of a site and not on the other part, over time that's going to cause your foundation to crack, dams to crack, roadways to crack,"" Bricker said. ""Differential subsidence is a major problem ... But as far as I know, it's not as much of a concern as freeze-thaw and other things. Michigan's ground is pretty stable.""

Mike Kozak, president and partner of the engineering firm Giffels Webster, said the impact of the ground movement is difficult to determine precisely, but it should be kept in mind.

""The differential settlement is really when things matter,” Kozak said. “If you think of a building downtown, and it’s got a sidewalk out in front of it and a road next to it, if the building moves two inches down and then everything else stays at the same spot, you’re going to have visual impacts of that. You’re literally going to trip as you step out of the building, or the doors aren’t going to function.

But he also noted: ""If everything’s moving at the same time at almost unnoticeable levels, a couple millimeters a year, it’s probably less of an impact because your whole system is moving up and down, including the soils below.""

Infrastructure, such as roads, with a shorter life expectancy may see a more muted impact due to subsidence, Kozak said, because they are more frequently redesigned and reconstructed than, say, water mains or buildings that are expected to last far longer.

""I don't know that anybody on paper right now has a plan in place to worry about a whole city that's going to be three inches lower 10 years from now,"" Kozak said. ""That's certainly something that could impact a lot of properties.""",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/Main%20Image%20-%20Detroit_Skyline_from_River.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:40:48.737436

GM has deployed lithium manganese batteries in the past, including in first-generation Chevrolet Volt.

General Motors said May 13 that it will be the first automaker to deploy a new battery chemistry slated to increase range and affordability for electric vehicles.

GM and its partner LG Energy Solution plan to launch production of the technology, called lithium manganese-rich batteries, in the U.S. by 2028.

GM’s cross-town competitor Ford Motor Co. said late last month it also plans to roll out the same technology by the end of the decade.

The new “prismatic” battery cell, meaning it is stored in a more efficient rectangular shape instead of a pouch, performs at a 33% higher energy density than the best-performing lithium iron phosphate-based cell, which is currently the industry standard. The current battery pack requires a lot more nickel, which GM said comes at a comparably high cost. Batteries represent at least a third of the cost of an EV.

GM said in a statement that for longer than a decade, it had been working toward launching LMR batteries, which avoid two main hurdles of the technology: a short battery life and voltage decay.

The chemical composition of a high-nickel battery includes roughly 85% nickel, 10% manganese and 5% cobalt. The composition of LMR cells is only 35% nickel, 65% manganese, and virtually no cobalt.

The new system also integrates with GM’s current North American battery production of lithium, graphite and manganese. GM recently invested in a Norwegian synthetic graphite producer for battery technology.

GM has deployed lithium manganese batteries in the past. The first-generation Chevrolet Volt used cells with manganese spinel cathodes, according to Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at Telemetry Insights.

Abuelsamid told the Detroit Free Press that the close announcements by Ford and GM reflect the competitive environment of the industry seeking to construct more durable, affordable electric vehicles with decent range.

“It's hard to say who will get LMR into volume production first, but GM seems perhaps more likely. They've already committed to 2028 with LG in one of the Ultium Cells plants and have assigned a vehicle program to use these cells,” he said, referencing the company's mention the technology will be likely suited for larger trucks and utilities. “As far as the density and cost, manganese cells have long been a known quantity and they should have no issues with the performance claims.”

In this case, it looked at the impact of climate change on racing and raising Thoroughbreds.
""During flooding, horses can become injured or stranded.
The report's analysis seems to be in line with Kentucky Derby weather patterns.","As Sovereignty splashed to victory in this year's Kentucky Derby (G1) in Louisville, Ky., it marked the seventh time in the past 17 editions of the Churchill Downs classic that it's been contested on either a sloppy or wet-fast track.

In April, Keeneland had to push back its opening weekend from Friday and Saturday, April 4 and 5 to Monday and Tuesday, April 7 and 8 after heavy rains brought flooding to the area.

Based on a United States Environmental Protection Agency report posted to its website in January, Kentucky tracks would be wise to continue to be prepare for increased wet weather. That report predicts climate change will bring increased extreme precipitation events and flooding in Kentucky, which can affect communities and economies across the state.

Unfortunately, that prediction would play out this spring when multiple rounds of heavy rain and thunderstorms impacted the area April 1-6. Flooding led to three fatalities in Central Kentucky and seven fatalities across the state. The report noted that since tracking began in 1980, all four of the billion-dollar flooding disasters to affect Kentucky occurred in 2010 or later. This spring's flooding figures to be a fifth in that category.

The report, titled ""Climate Change Connections: Kentucky (Thoroughbred Horses),"" was part of a series that highlighted climate change connections to culturally, ecologically, or economically important features of each state and territory. In this case, it looked at the impact of climate change on racing and raising Thoroughbreds.

The report noted that racing can expect a higher percentage of off-tracks in Kentucky as the trend is expected to continue. It also noted added concerns for horse farms.

""Flooding also presents challenges for horses and other livestock,"" the report said. ""During flooding, horses can become injured or stranded. Flooding can also create conditions, such as standing water, that can attract pests, such as mosquitos, which can lay eggs and spread diseases, including eastern and western equine encephalomyelitis and West Nile virus that can be harmful to humans and horses.

""In July 2023, nearly 11 inches of rain over a two-day period in Kentucky broke some local rainfall records and resulted in flash flooding that destroyed homes and displaced residents. The aftermath of the storm also created a myriad of issues for farms and horse operations. Grass fields were flooded and animals did not have anything to graze on, and fences were washed away, making it hard to keep animals contained.""

The report's analysis seems to be in line with Kentucky Derby weather patterns. The National Weather Service lists the longest stretch of wet Derby days (based on the full 24 hours) in the race's 151-year history as 2007-13 with precipitation surpassing a half-inch in four of those years. Rainfall on Derby day has surpassed an inch of rain just six times overall but half of those occasions have occurred since 2010, including the 3.15 inches that fell in 2018—a Derby day record.

This year saw 0.37 inches of rain. While fans had to deal with wet weather, on the track the Churchill crew delivered a surface that was fair to competitors.

The bigger concern this spring were the multiple rounds of heavy rain, thunderstorms, and tornadoes that impacted Kentucky April 1-6. That brought flash flooding and areal flooding, including historic and near-record river flooding along many river basins; as well as mudslides and landslides.

Forecasters predict periods of extreme weather in the Northwest will only bring more trouble in the future: the threat of rolling blackouts within the decade if the region’s current energy trends continue.
The biggest owner of these transmission lines, the federal Bonneville Power Administration, has been slow to spend on upgrades — and slow to approve new green projects until upgrades are made.
Bonneville’s parent agency, the Energy Department, declined to make officials available for an interview, but Bonneville answered written questions.
Those plants would still have to contend with transmission lines that have no room for their power.","Electric companies in Oregon and Washington are hurtling toward deadlines to stop using power generated by coal, gas and other fuels that contribute to global warming. Yet the states are nowhere near achieving their goals, and the dramatic consequences are already being felt.

During a winter storm in January 2024, for example, the Northwest barely had enough power to meet demand as homeowners cranked up electric heaters and energy prices surged to more than $1,000 per megawatt-hour, or 18 times higher than the usual price. Power lines were so congested that owners of the transmission network made an extra $100 million selling access to the highest bidder.

Multiple utilities were operating in states of emergency during the storm, preparing for rotating power outages.

The storm “highlighted a tipping point and demonstrated how close the region is to a resource adequacy crisis,” the Western Power Pool, a regionwide organization of utilities, wrote in its assessment of the event.

Price spikes like this are one reason customers of major utilities in Oregon are paying 50% more on their power bills than they were in 2019. The number of utility customers disconnected last year for failure to pay soared to 70,000, the highest number on record.

Forecasters predict periods of extreme weather in the Northwest will only bring more trouble in the future: the threat of rolling blackouts within the decade if the region’s current energy trends continue.

Wind, solar and other renewables are the only forms of power that can be added to solve the problem, thanks to Oregon’s and Washington’s green energy mandates. Yet better transmission lines are needed to carry new energy sources in the windy and sunny eastern parts of the region to big cities west of the Cascade Mountain Range.

Experts say adding transmission lines in corridors that currently lack them would also enable utilities to keep power flowing when ice storms or wildfires threaten other parts of the grid.

The biggest owner of these transmission lines, the federal Bonneville Power Administration, has been slow to spend on upgrades — and slow to approve new green projects until upgrades are made.

Bonneville’s parent agency, the Energy Department, declined to make officials available for an interview, but Bonneville answered written questions.

“The potential for blackouts in the Pacific Northwest is incredibly low,” the agency said. “Grid planners and operators will continue to ensure reliability.”

Washington and Oregon lawmakers failed to address the Bonneville bottleneck when they approved clean energy mandates in 2019 and 2021, as ProPublica and OPB reported recently.

Oregon Rep. Ken Helm, a Portland-area Democrat who was a sponsor of the 2021 legislation, said the failure to prioritize transmission lines wasn’t the only flaw with the legislation. He said the bill failed to provide accountability, having no penalties for when a utility did not reach certain deadlines for acquiring either solar or wind energy. Helm said now, House Bill 2021 is “dead letter law.”

“Senators and representatives like me, we cannot continue to believe our own PR, that we have been successful in promoting a renewable electricity future,” said Helm, a member of the House Committee on Climate, Energy and Environment. “We are not heading in that direction, and we’re going to have to take action to change that or nothing will happen.”

Some lawmakers tried to play catch-up this year. Legislators in each state drew up plans for state transmission authorities that could finance improvements independent of utilities and Bonneville. Those efforts failed.

“Oregon desperately needs to take some leadership here,” said Nicole Hughes, executive director of the group Renewable Northwest, which advocates for weaning the region off of fossil fuels.

The Northwest’s situation is only expected to get worse. The region’s electrical demand is forecast to double over the next 20 years, in large part because data centers, rewarded with tax breaks in both Oregon and Washington, are driving an increase in power use the region hasn’t experienced since the early 1980s.

Abandoning Oregon’s and Washington’s renewable energy laws wouldn’t help, Oregon’s Citizens’ Utility Board says, because new fossil fuel power plants would cost ratepayers more than wind or solar. Those plants would still have to contend with transmission lines that have no room for their power.

The region’s utilities, meanwhile, say they’d like to add 29,000 megawatts of generating capacity over the next 10 years — an unprecedented addition that would be roughly equivalent to all the electricity that the Northwest currently consumes at any given time. The projects on their to-do list are powered entirely by renewable energy.

Yet the utilities added only a little over half the power to their systems that they planned for last year. In fact, of the 469 projects that applied to connect to Bonneville’s grid in the past decade, the only one to win the agency’s approval was in 2022. Growth in green energy in 2024 came from projects that began seeking a connection to Bonneville’s grid prior to 2015 or that connected to smaller transmission networks owned by private utilities.

If the utilities continue to fall as short of their goals as they did in 2024, then projections from the Western Electricity Coordinating Council suggest residents will spend the equivalent of nearly a month annually under the threat of brownouts — the inability to power all the circuits in a household — or blackouts.

“In the next few years, we may start having to make some tough choices about the availability of electricity,” Hughes said.

Hughes has spent 20 years in the renewables industry.

“A fully funded Energy Star program is particularly important for meeting the Trump administration’s goal of reducing Americans’ energy bills,” the letter said.
Energy Star is so ubiquitous, nearly 90% of American consumers recognize it, the New York Times said, citing the government.
“Eliminating the Energy Star program would directly contradict this administration’s promise to reduce household energy costs,” Paula Glover, president of the nonprofit coalition Alliance to Save Energy, told CNN.
“For just $32 million a year, Energy Star helps American families save over $40 billion in annual energy costs.","Any budget-aware, environmentally conscious consumer scouting out new appliances knows to look for the Energy Star label.

The familiar blue-and-white logo – stuck on refrigerators, stoves, dishwashers, heat pumps, washers, dryers, water heaters and air conditioners – signifies cost savings and efficiency.

But the program, run by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, could be in jeopardy, according to major media outlets.

CNN broke the news last week about the Trump Administration’s plans to shut down Energy Star as part of an EPA reorganization.

President Donald Trump is looking to do away not only with the EPA’s Energy Star division but also with a division focused on climate change, CNN reported.

Shutting down Energy Star would be bad for the public, according to New York Times “Your Money” columnist Ron Lieber.

“It’s a useful seal of approval, a signal of outsize efficiency and the lower utility bills that you’ll pay over time,” Lieber wrote.

Pointing to a document on the EPA website, Lieber says the government claims $500 billion in savings for homes and businesses over the past three decades.

The Associated Press brought the savings closer to home for readers, noting the program says a household with Energy Star products can save $450 a year through lower energy costs.

According to Sarah Gleeson, climate solutions research manager at the climate action nonprofit Project Drawdown, if Energy Star disappears, it will be more difficult for consumers to have trustworthy information about products’ energy use, the AP reported.

Details about the proposed overhaul of the EPA are skimpy.

“The EPA did not confirm directly it was ending the program…” the AP reported, “but said the reorganization ‘is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency’s core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback.’”

The New York Times also reported the planned cuts, citing agency documents and a recording of an internal meeting.

“EPA managers announced during a staff meeting on Monday that divisions that oversee climate change and energy efficiency would be eliminated as part of an agency reorganization,” the newspaper reported on May 6. “That includes the EPA’s climate change office as well as the division that oversees Energy Star.”

The Washington Post similarly reported on the Trump team’s intentions, citing three people briefed on the matter as well as slide presentations obtained by Democrats on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

The Post reported that the fate is unknown of federal tax credits for home builders who build to Energy Star standards and homeowners who make energy efficient upgrades, such as installing certain kinds of doors, windows and skylights.

Outlier in the White House

The idea of doing away with Energy Star isn’t a new one for Trump, according to CNN.

He floated the idea during his first administration, the network said.

Trump appears to be an outlier among occupants of the Oval Office.

“It’s had widespread support from all presidents except for Trump,” Steve Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, told the New York Times.

The program has also enjoyed bipartisan support, and with good reason.

CNN described Energy Star as “a longstanding public-private partnership certifying energy efficient appliances and helping consumers find products and tax credits to bring down the cost of energy efficient appliances.”

More than 1,000 companies, organizations and cities – including Philadelphia – last month wrote to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in support of the program, according to Politico’s E&E News publication.

“A fully funded Energy Star program is particularly important for meeting the Trump administration’s goal of reducing Americans’ energy bills,” the letter said. “Our companies have devoted considerable time and resources to partnering with Energy Star because it works for business. We respectfully urge you to stand with us in support of Energy Star by ensuring that it remains well-funded and expertly staffed at EPA.”

The Sierra Club, one of the nation’s foremost environmental groups, issued a less diplomatic statement to the AP.

“For an administration who keeps claiming the country is facing an ‘energy emergency,’ Trump continues to attack any and all efforts aimed at saving energy through efficiency,” Xavier Boatright, deputy legislative director for clean energy and electrification at Sierra Club, said in a statement to the news agency.

Santa Claus-level recognition

Energy Star launched in 1992 under President George H.W. Bush. Its label “provides simple, credible, and unbiased information that consumers and businesses rely on to make well-informed decisions,” according to the Energy Star website.

Energy Star is so ubiquitous, nearly 90% of American consumers recognize it, the New York Times said, citing the government.

“It’s an easy way for them to identify high energy-efficiency equipment,” Nadel told the newspaper.

“It has brand recognition and consumer trust that only Santa Claus can compete with,” Christine Egan, head of Collaborative Labeling and Appliance Standards Program, an international nonprofit dedicated to energy-efficient appliances, told the Washington Post.

The EPA and its private-sector partners – including almost 40 of Fortune 500 companies – “deliver cost-saving energy efficiency solutions that protect the environment, improve air quality and protect public health,” the program said.

“Eliminating the Energy Star program would directly contradict this administration’s promise to reduce household energy costs,” Paula Glover, president of the nonprofit coalition Alliance to Save Energy, told CNN. “For just $32 million a year, Energy Star helps American families save over $40 billion in annual energy costs. That’s a return of $350 for every federal dollar invested.”

The program has powerful allies on Capitol Hill.

CNN reported that U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the Trump administration’s decision to eliminate Energy Star left her “baffled.”

“I know that my constituents like knowing what the energy usage is of a particular appliance so that they can factor that into their buying decisions,” Collins told CNN.

If Energy Star evaporates, consumers can still find some appliance efficiency guidance in the bright yellow EnergyGuide stickers overseen by the Federal Trade Commission, according to the Washington Post.

There are downsides, however.

“School districts across the country continue to grow their electric school bus fleets,” she added.","School districts are contemplating how to best move forward with the cleanest-emitting school bus that best meets their individual needs, be that an electric school bus (ESB), one fueled by propane, or a cleaner diesel variety.

Several factors lead to the uncertainty over more widespread adoption of ESBs. Pricing, infrastructure and range remain concerns, and Lion Electric customers are still figuring out their next moves amid the company’s auction following financial trouble. But none are bigger than the the fate of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) five-year, $5 billion Clean School Bus Program.

Some anxiety eased in late February, after the Trump administration a month earlier put a temporary pause on award distribution, despite a memo from the EPA CFO that all program funds appropriated by the IIJA and IRA should continue to flow. Last month, the National Association for Pupil Transportation (NAPT) announced funding through the 2023 grant competition awards is now accessible.

By the end of 2024, the EPA made three rounds of awards to 1,344 school districts, totaling some $2.8 billion. Over 98 percent of those funds have gone toward purchasing ESBs.

NAPT noted it is not clear whether the EPA plans to award the remaining $2.2 billion as was authorized by Congress or to let its authorization run out, adding the program has received some strong support from senators in states where electric buses were being purchased and in at least one state where they are being manufactured.

The EPA did not respond to questions for this article. If the Clean School Bus Program lives on, one electric vehicle insider told School Transportation News funding could be funneled toward more propane school buses.

Meanwhile, Blue Bird used its first quarter results to address the impact of the federal funding pause on ESB deliveries through the Clean School Bus Program. Some

750 ESBs were sold or scheduled for production and delivery, whereas 250 were awarded with funding paused. Blue Bird initiated a reprioritized production plan to build fully funded buses earlier and push back build dates for ordered buses where EPA and federal funding was paused.

The company said it is processing new ESB orders attached to state and local funding and has confirmed political support for the Clean School Bus Program from elected officials in Washington, D.C. Blue Bird also indicated it has lowered its range of annual forecasted ESB deliveries from 1,300 to 1,000 buses.

The company noted uncertainty over the impact of tariffs means it will explore sourcing and other options with suppliers. All applicable government tariffs will be passed through to the end customer, with a potential five percent increase on all Blue Bird non-ESB buses expected by the end of February, should the tariffs on components be applied as originally proposed. School districts are exploring available options.

The non-profit Vermont Energy Investment Corp. (VEIC) has a clean transportation team specializing in programs and projects supporting electric vehicle fleet adoption and alternative fuel vehicle technology.

VEIC published a report last September for the Montana Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) on ESB performance, summarizing evaluation activities and results associated with ES deployments in the program over the 2023-2024 academic school year.

The report found ESBs performed well in all weather conditions and route types. In extremely cold conditions, vehicle efficiency was reduced by up to 40 percent. However, ESBs were found to start up more consistently and reliably than diesel buses. ESBs also had better acceleration and quieter operation than diesel buses, but a lower top speed. Each ESB averaged $1,575 in annual fuel savings compared to diesel buses.

The report indicated primary vehicle downtime causes were related to components outside of the electric drivetrain. Resolving these issues proved more challenging with some vendors than others.

Incorporating feedback from interviews with 15 school transportation managers, school bus drivers and mechanics who engaged the most with ESBs in this program, the final section of the report offers key guidance for future ESB deployments in Montana, including in the areas of training and support, charge management, regenerative braking, and charging strategies.

Dan Rispens, superintendent of East Helena (Montana) Public Schools, noted his district received a grant through Montana’s Department of Environmental Quality that was derived from the Volkswagen settlement of 2016-2017.

“Grant funds offset approximately 80 percent of the purchase price of our bus,” said Rispens. “We were motivated by the prospect of new technology and reduced operating costs, but the primary force in our decision was grant funding.”

Its Lion Electric C bus was ordered in 2021 and delivery was accepted last August. Rispens said the district received EPA rebates to supply three additional Lion Electric buses, but East Helena passed on purchasing them given Lion Electric’s current financial status.

Speaking to the challenges East Helena Public Schools has encountered with its electric bus, “delivery timelines are challenging due to backlog in manufacturing and supply chain disruptions,” Rispens said.

“Our vendor does not have a nationwide network of dealers, so any technical assistance or warranty work is done by remote consult or sending technicians out on the road, making it cumbersome and complicated.”

Local mechanics do not know how to fix or repair the bus and do not have service manuals for it, Rispens added.

“Our bus has been here since last summer and has only been used for about a month on an actual route,” he said. “The heat system was found to be non-functional.

We are still waiting on repairs. This left the bus unusable during Montana’s harsh winter.” Last July, the World Resources Institute’s Electric School Bus Initiative reported that while the EPA had by that point funded more than 8,000 electric school buses through the EPA Clean School Bus Program, demand for ESBs is outpacing funding.

States, financing entities and utilities continue driving momentum for ESBs, noted WRI spokeswoman Katherine Roboff. “The Maryland Energy Administration recently launched a new funding program in support of school bus electrification,” she said. “We are tracking $2.3 billion in state-level funding for which ESBs are eligible. California and New York are good examples of robust state-level funding.

“We have also been in conversation with a wide range of green banks and financial institutions across the country who are also exploring the topic of financing electric school buses,” Roboff continued. “The Connecticut Green Bank, for example, has developed a new ESB financial product.”

However, the EPA is revoking $20 billion in contracts the Biden administration approved with at least eight green banks. Many Republican leaders call green banks “slush funds,” the Associated Press reported last month. At press time, the Connecticut Green Bank was one of seven green banks still listed on the EPA website.

States Continue Funding Work

The Public Service Commission of Maryland recently approved an electric school bus utility pilot program, Roboff added. The program is one of a dozen nationwide that recently closed or soon will close applications for funding. Districts also continue to explore electrification through transportation-as-a-service providers and other innovative business models built around subscription fees, Roboff said.

“School districts across the country continue to grow their electric school bus fleets,” she added. For example, the Beaverton School District in Oregon has been adding ESBs on an annual basis, leveraging a range of funding sources. In 2021, Beaverton was the first school district in Oregon to acquire an ESB and has added them yearly for a current total of 15 electric buses and 31 charging stations. Among the funding sources was a voter-approved $723 million bond, a portion of which is designated for replacement of diesel-powered buses with propane and electric buses.

Other funding sources include the Oregon Department of Energy’s Public Purpose Charge Program, Portland General Electric’s Electric School Bus Fund—funded through the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality’s Clean Fuels Program—and the EPA.

Beaverton also has 65 clean-burning propane buses using renewable propane. While the district plans to replace 225 diesel-powered buses with ESBs and propane-powered buses, some will be retained for long-distance field trips and athletic events. The district uses renewable diesel fuel, noting its higher cost is expected to drop as its supply expands.

That plan may be revisited if future battery technology improves to extend the distances ESBs can travel on a single charge. Molly Hale, marketing communications manager for Cummins’ Accelera zero-emissions business, noted Blue Bird has the company’s integrated powertrain, the PowerDrive 7000, that includes the BP97E battery, assembled in Columbus, Indiana, at its main manufacturing facility.

“Additionally, Thomas Built Buses recently announced the launch of their new Jouley Gen 2 bus with the new addition of our 14Xe eAxle and ELFA inverter,” she said. “We are pleased to be partnering with two major school bus OEMs and are excited to see the success of these buses gaining momentum and adoption. Blue Bird has delivered more than 2,000 ESBs with our powertrain.”

As speed bumps increase on the path to school districts incorporating more ESBs into their fleets, districts are pursuing a variety of approaches, such as this pilot project in New Mexico, which signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with ESB manufacturer GreenPower Motor Company. The state will seek an appropriation of $5 million to conduct a pilot program funding the purchase of ESBs, charging station installations and management costs.

Rolling with the Punches

Uncertainty over the future of ESB funding has affected many school districts, including the Ritenour School District in Overland, Missouri. The district on Feb. 4 announced the arrival of the first three Thomas Built Buses Jouleys of a 24-ESB fleet funded by a nearly $9.5 million EPA Clean School Bus Program grant sought to replace 24 diesel buses.

The district announced 24 new charging stations as well. However, the district indicated uncertainty over receiving the remaining 21 ESBs from the Clean School Bus Program due to its funding pauses. Brooks McQuinn, transportation director for the Malone Central School District in Malone, New York, noted the district has four ESBs and had received the EPA grant. The district received $1.4 million dollars for the purchase of the buses and chargers, covering most of the project cost. McQuinn pointed out existing infrastructure accommodated the chargers. The district also has its own lot and inside storage space for the buses.

The district’s fleet includes 43 65-passenger buses fueled by propane, gas, diesel and now the four ESBs. “We cover 386 square miles in this district, with a lot of different terrain,” said McQuinn. “We have used propane buses for years because it was a cleaner source of fuel, and we get tax credit for that fuel type. We have geared to gasoline engines due to the size of our district and sporting events. We have phased out our diesels and only have three left.” McQuinn noted the district is surprised the power capability of the ESBs is limited to about 75 miles a day.

“We have also not had a very cold winter here since we received these buses last March,” he added. “Our winters here can hit 30 degrees below [zero]. Overall, [ESBs] have a place in this district, but we certainly cannot meet the [state of New York] deadlines of 2035 for a complete EV bus world.” McQuinn said the cost of a propane or gasoline bus is about $185,000, including added options. The ESB costs about $465,000 and has limited options.

“The New York State [Department of Transportation] is very strict about what has to be on a school bus,” he said. “If the federal grants go away, it would put our district in a very vulnerable state. We are currently maxed out with our energy output, and if we were to add anymore [electric] buses we would have to put all new infrastructure here that would cost the district and local taxpayers millions of dollars.

“We would also have to look for alternative means for sporting events, field trips and any other trips outside of to and from school transportation,” he continued. The Electrification Coalition notes ESB procurement can take up to 18 months. This includes installing the charging infrastructure and getting enough power from the local utility. The organization noted Climate Mayors Electric Vehicle Purchasing Collaborative offers cooperative purchasing contracts for Blue Bird, IC Bus, Lion Electric, and Thomas Built Buses. The Collaborative also includes resources for the procurement process, policy guidance and a variety of other informative resources.

The Coalition advises districts to identify the appropriate type of EV charging stations, determine their locations and explore charging software to help achieve electricity cost savings.

Three types of charging stations include Level 1 (120V), Level 2 (240V), and direct current fast charging (DCFC). Engagement with the local utility is critical to assist

with the connection process for EV charging equipment, determine whether infrastructure upgrades are needed, determine charging rates and best charging times, and available software platforms.

Other Options

A video interview conducted by Steven Whaley, Blue Bird’s alternative fuels manager for eastern North America, and Anthony Jackson, executive director of transportation at Bibb County School District in Georgia, highlights operational benefits of propane school buses, including the elimination of diesel regeneration issues, reduced maintenance costs due to fewer parts and quieter operation. Bibb County School District purchased 31 propane buses in 2014, with the driving factor being issues with regeneration on the diesel engines. Benefits derived included no need for NOx sensors or having to replace particulate matter filters.

Bus drivers love that the bus is much quieter compared to diesel buses, Jackson said.

Now, most of the district’s fleet is comprised of propane-fueled buses, with propane fuel provided by Bobtail loads to the district’s four 1,000-gallon tanks. There also are diesel buses and those running on unleaded gasoline are used for field trips.

The district spent $790,599 to run over 2 million miles at a cost of 39 cents a mile, a 27 cents per-mile cost savings with more than a $500,000 in annual fuel savings. The Alternative Fuel Excise Tax Credit for propane vehicles is 36 cents a gallon for even more cost savings.

“The fate of the Alternative Fuel Tax Credit for propane vehicles is tenuous at best,” Whaley noted. “But the value proposition for propane without any incentives stands impressively on its own.” Clean diesel has also become a more attractive option, especially when using renewable diesel. But incentives for RD only currently exist in California, Oregon, Washington and New Mexico, the only states that have passed the

Low Carbon Fuel Standard.

Still, tougher EPA emissions standards have been a driving factor in diesel being more

than 90 percent cleaner today than a decade ago. Those emissions are expected to only get cleaner starting in 2027, when EPA’s Phase III GHG standard is scheduled to go into effect. But at this report, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin signaled the rule and others are under reconsideration. If rolled back, diesel school buses could be easier and less expensive to obtain, especially in states that were previously forecasting limited availability.

As the industry awaits word on Phase III , Cummins announced last month its much-anticipated B7.2 diesel engine on the company’s HELM or fuel-agnostic platform. The emissions reduction to less than 0.035 grams of NOx per horsepower/hour, as required by EPA Phase III represents, an approximately 83-percent-cleaner engine than 2010 engines with 50-percent fewer particulate matter.

These are achieved by using a “clean sheet base engine,” a culmination of all the components, a Cummins spokesperson said.

The emissions warranty and useful life requirements also increase, with automatic engine shutdown and stop-start that can further lower emissions and GHG. Meanwhile, in anticipation of the Trump administration, the California Air Resources Board ceased seeking the additional federal waivers it needed to fully implement its Advanced Clean Fleet rule that about a dozen states were set to adopt. Many of those states are now not implementing it, which set out to reduce the number of diesel heavy-duty trucks that could be sold in California and the other so-called CARB states.

Diesel Emissions Reduction Act reauthorization was also introduced in Congress last month. That program, which ran through fiscal year 2024, had been marked for review by the Trump administration. It has been responsible for replacing over 5,100 high emissions school buses since 2010.

President Donald Trump has previously promised to kill the EV tax credit as more of a social statement, aiming to reverse course on the so-called EV mandates under the Biden administration.
That said, not all Republicans are on board with the end of clean energy tax incentives.
Former President Joe Biden's environment-focused charge on electric vehicles was projected to cost the federal government over $200 billion over 10 years, according to Capital Alpha Partners.
With over $2 billion in EV tax credits doled out last year, lawmakers are moving quickly to appease President Trump ahead of a looming tax cut package.","Government subsidies have been one of the major factors helping to encourage Americans into buying electric vehicles over the last five years, but as of Tuesday, Republicans in the House of Representatives are officially trying to kill the federal EV incentives.

Specifically, a proposal introduced to the House Ways and Means Committee asks the fiscal-focused group to repeal the $7500 new-vehicle-tax-credit as well as a $4000 used-vehicle credit on December 31, 2025. However, automakers that have yet to sell 200,000 EVs would be given another year to dole out new vehicle credits. The economic proposals will be subject to a Ways and Means Committee hearing on May 13.

In adition, a new provision added to a battery production tax credit for automakers specifies that credits would be withheld from vehicles produced by Chinese companies or through licensing agreements with Chinese firms. This change would significantly impact companies like Ford and Tesla, as both companies regularly outsource battery technology duties to Chinese manufacturers.

""I think there is a better chance we kill it than save it,"" speaker of the House Mike Johnson said about the EV tax credits to Bloomberg last week. ""But we’ll see how it comes out.

Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA).

A loan program intended to fund the creation of alternative fuels is also on the chopping block alongside the corporate average fuel economy standards and emission rules for 2027 and beyond. The proposed emissions changes will be reviewed by the Energy and Commerce Committee.

President Donald Trump has previously promised to kill the EV tax credit as more of a social statement, aiming to reverse course on the so-called EV mandates under the Biden administration. Similarly, Senate Republicans have floated taxing all EVs $1000 annually in an effort to drive revenue for road repairs, insinuating that EV owners aren't paying their fair share of road use fees.

That said, not all Republicans are on board with the end of clean energy tax incentives. Documents from ClearView Energy Partners indicate that 38 House Republicans have voiced support for keeping the Inflation Reduction Act's clean energy incentives, including the ones focused on electric vehicles. Former President Joe Biden's environment-focused charge on electric vehicles was projected to cost the federal government over $200 billion over 10 years, according to Capital Alpha Partners. With over $2 billion in EV tax credits doled out last year, lawmakers are moving quickly to appease President Trump ahead of a looming tax cut package.

Partisanship is clearly part of the package here, but the federal government would not be alone in altering its EV subsidy mechanism. States like California, Washington, and Oregon were quick to offer EV incentives and saw a massive spike in adoption as a result, but the economic realities of such rapid EV adoption have set in: all three states have shifted their EV incentives and have even imposed additional registration fees on electric models in an effort to make up for the lost gas tax revenue. That tax revenue is almost always used to fund roadway repair; without a consistent flow of gas-guzzling vehicles, states are trying to find new ways to pay for road maintenance. Either way, it seems likely to be a new era for EV owners and buyers in the not-so-distant future.","https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/row-of-electric-vehicles-is-plugged-in-and-charging-at-news-photo-1747146885.pjpeg?crop=1.00xw:0.669xh;0,0.269xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-05-13 14:34:47.937352

“The company will continue to evaluate the timing and project progression as market conditions change,” Chiu said in a statement Tuesday.

The decision has no impact on current employment at the Honda manufacturing plant in Alliston, Ont., he added.

Honda’s EV project in Canada includes a retooled assembly plant, an electric vehicle battery plant in close proximity, as well as two key battery parts facilities located elsewhere in Ontario.

The project was expected to see the two main plants create 1,000 jobs on top of retaining the existing 4,200 jobs at the assembly plant.

Under the original plan, the plant was set to produce up to 240,000 vehicles per year when fully operational in 2028.

The project was first announced in April 2024 at an event that included then-prime minister Justin Trudeau and Ontario Premier Doug Ford and was to receive support from the federal and Ontario governments.

Ottawa was set to give the Japanese automaker around $2.5 billion through tax credits, while Ontario committed to provide up to $2.5 billion in support, directly and indirectly.

5,100 new jobs — Study tallies Windsor economic benefits of NextStar EV battery plant

In reporting its latest financial results Tuesday, Honda Motor Co. said its profit for the financial year through March fell 24.5 per cent from the previous year and warned that U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs will worsen its earnings.

The Tokyo-based automaker said its annual profit totalled 835.8 billion yen (US$5.6 billion), down from 1.1 trillion yen in the previous year. Annual sales edged up 6.2 per cent to nearly 21.69 trillion yen (US$147 billion).

Honda executive vice-president Noriya Kaihara acknowledged that Trump’s tariffs would likely hurt, erasing 650 billion yen (US$4.4 billion) from its operating profit for the fiscal year through March 2026. That’s mainly because of U.S. tariffs on vehicles from Canada and Mexico. Honda’s vehicle shipments from Japan to the U.S. are negligible.

Officials stressed major uncertainties remain, but said they felt it was important to give a realistic projection, no matter how pessimistic it might be.

Chief executive Toshihiro Mibe said Honda will do its best to minimize the impact from tariffs. In the long term, Honda will transfer auto production to U.S. plants and rethink its investment plans. All decisions will be made “very carefully,” Mibe told reporters.

Loss of two grants is ‘very destabilizing’ This is the second grant Green Umbrella has lost since Trump took office.
She says Green Umbrella has started to see an increase in community support.","A project working to reduce energy costs for people living in low-income housing is on hold after the federal government cancelled the grant funding it.

In 2023, Green Umbrella received a $1.1 million award from the Environmental Protection Agency to study energy efficiency and air quality in affordable housing units through a partnership with Over-the-Rhine Community Housing and the city of Cincinnati.

Executive Director Ryan Mooney-Bullock says the initiative also included installing energy-saving technology, like insulation, electric stoves and heat pumps, in about 35 homes.

Now, that work is on pause. Green Umbrella learned last week its grant had been terminated because it is “no longer in alignment with the EPA’s priorities.”

“The loss of these funds means that we have to stop work on projects that were really designed to benefit community members that have been historically underserved, and it's also preventing us from completing a research study that could then be used to inform how this type of energy efficiency work is rolled out in communities across the country,” Mooney-Bullock said.

She says Green Umbrella was about to make a major purchase of heat pumps when they learned about the grant termination.

“It came at a really bad time in the sense that we were about to do a ton of implementation that is really going to benefit the residents living in these buildings and their nonprofit landlord Over-the-Rhine Community Housing that is managing these buildings,” Mooney-Bullock said.

The Cincinnati-based nonprofit is not the only organization seeing its funding cancelled. The Trump administration is clawing back tens of millions of dollars for environmental research across the country, according to The New York Times.

Green Umbrella is looking for ways to continue the data collection that is already underway. It’s working on the study with three research partners: Indiana University, Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pennsylvania.

“We have a group of residents who are participating in this and are helping us collect data, and we don't want to just drop the ball on them,” Mooney-Bullock said.

The nonprofit also is disputing the grant termination with the EPA and seeking final reimbursements. Mooney-Bullock says she doesn’t know how long it will take to get that money back since the payment system no longer shows the grant.

To keep the project moving forward, Green Umbrella is looking to community members and businesses for support.

Loss of two grants is ‘very destabilizing’

This is the second grant Green Umbrella has lost since Trump took office.

The first was a $500,000 EPA grant helping Greater Cincinnati community members address environmental risks in their neighborhoods.

“It is very destabilizing for a nonprofit to have significant funding pulled out at the last minute or while projects are underway,” Mooney-Bullock said.

She says the organization is not currently in a financial position where it needs to lay people off or make staffing changes.

“That is certainly something that is a concern if grants continue to get frozen and we're not able to raise the support we need from our local partners,” Mooney-Bullock said.

She says Green Umbrella has started to see an increase in community support.

GM has deployed lithium manganese batteries in the past, including in first-generation Chevrolet Volt.

General Motors said May 13 that it will be the first automaker to deploy a new battery chemistry slated to increase range and affordability for electric vehicles.

GM and its partner LG Energy Solution plan to launch production of the technology, called lithium manganese-rich batteries, in the U.S. by 2028.

GM’s cross-town competitor Ford Motor Co. said late last month it also plans to roll out the same technology by the end of the decade.

The new “prismatic” battery cell, meaning it is stored in a more efficient rectangular shape instead of a pouch, performs at a 33% higher energy density than the best-performing lithium iron phosphate-based cell, which is currently the industry standard. The current battery pack requires a lot more nickel, which GM said comes at a comparably high cost. Batteries represent at least a third of the cost of an EV.

GM said in a statement that for longer than a decade, it had been working toward launching LMR batteries, which avoid two main hurdles of the technology: a short battery life and voltage decay.

The chemical composition of a high-nickel battery includes roughly 85% nickel, 10% manganese and 5% cobalt. The composition of LMR cells is only 35% nickel, 65% manganese, and virtually no cobalt.

The new system also integrates with GM’s current North American battery production of lithium, graphite and manganese. GM recently invested in a Norwegian synthetic graphite producer for battery technology.

GM has deployed lithium manganese batteries in the past. The first-generation Chevrolet Volt used cells with manganese spinel cathodes, according to Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at Telemetry Insights.

Abuelsamid told the Detroit Free Press that the close announcements by Ford and GM reflect the competitive environment of the industry seeking to construct more durable, affordable electric vehicles with decent range.

“It's hard to say who will get LMR into volume production first, but GM seems perhaps more likely. They've already committed to 2028 with LG in one of the Ultium Cells plants and have assigned a vehicle program to use these cells,” he said, referencing the company's mention the technology will be likely suited for larger trucks and utilities. “As far as the density and cost, manganese cells have long been a known quantity and they should have no issues with the performance claims.”

Most notably, the Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law by President Biden in 2022, allocated nearly $270 billion through a series of tax credits, loans, grants and subsidies to areas including renewable energy and industrial decarbonization solutions.
The proposal would also eliminate tax credits at the end of 2025 for household energy efficiency improvements and for residential expenditures on renewable energy including solar electric property, solar water heating property, fuel cell property, small wind energy property, geothermal heat pump property, and battery storage property.
In a statement following the release of the tax plan, Rich Powell, CEO of the Clean Energy Buyers Association said: “Preserving the federal technology-neutral energy tax credits is crucial for supplying the energy needed to serve the 21st century industries of the United States and to drive American innovation and energy dominance.
Moreover, some of America’s largest companies are attempting to advance critical new technologies like geothermal and advanced nuclear energy, but those technologies will not move forward if these tax credits are phased out.","Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee in the U.S. Congress released their new tax plan aimed at becoming part of the Trump administration’s proposed “One, Big, Beautiful Bill” tax and spending bill, which includes major cuts to Biden era green energy-focused tax incentives in areas including electric vehicles and clean energy production.

The Biden administration had put in place legislation directing hundreds of billions of dollars to accelerate the energy transition in the U.S. and to help meet climate goals put in place by the administration. Most notably, the Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law by President Biden in 2022, allocated nearly $270 billion through a series of tax credits, loans, grants and subsidies to areas including renewable energy and industrial decarbonization solutions.

President Trump has pledged to reverse Biden’s energy transition policy’s, including announcing the U.S.’ exit from the Paris Agreement on his first day in office, and also referencing plans to “end the Green New Deal,” likely a reference to the Inflation Reduction Act.

Key energy transition focused proposals presented in the Republican tax plan include terminating a $7,500 clean vehicle tax credit at the end of 2025 except for vehicles produced by manufacturers that have not sold 200,000 new clean vehicles, and a $4,000 tax credit for previously-owned clean vehicles, as well as a tax credit for up to $40,000 for large commercial clean vehicles.

The proposal would also eliminate tax credits at the end of 2025 for household energy efficiency improvements and for residential expenditures on renewable energy including solar electric property, solar water heating property, fuel cell property, small wind energy property, geothermal heat pump property, and battery storage property.

Additionally, the package would phase out tax credits for the production of or investment in zero emissions electricity, beginning with a 20% reduction in 2029, and full elimination in 2031, and would also end a tax credit for the production or use of clean hydrogen.

Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith said:

“Under the economic policies of President Biden and Washington Democrats, the wealthy and well-connected benefitted from taxpayer handouts. The Ways and Means Republican tax bill ends special interest giveaways and will hold the woke elite and entities that benefit from the tax code accountable.”

Sustainability-focused groups criticized the new proposals, warning that the elimination of the tax incentives will increase energy costs for consumers and slow the development of new energy sources.

In a statement following the release of the tax plan, Rich Powell, CEO of the Clean Energy Buyers Association said:

“Preserving the federal technology-neutral energy tax credits is crucial for supplying the energy needed to serve the 21st century industries of the United States and to drive American innovation and energy dominance. As electricity demand rapidly increases now and in the years ahead, we need more options, not less. Moreover, some of America’s largest companies are attempting to advance critical new technologies like geothermal and advanced nuclear energy, but those technologies will not move forward if these tax credits are phased out.",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Congress.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:34:52.037714

Right now, the wielders of the sledgehammer have won out.
“The Ways and Means bill is at odds with American energy dominance,” said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association.
While clean energy advocates rang the alarm bells, some conservatives were mad it did not just ax the climate law entirely.
“I’m glad my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee are advancing this reform to responsibly phase out these tax credits,” she said.","House Republicans’ plan to terminate or phase out clean energy tax credits from the Democrats’ 2022 climate law is even more aggressive than what many K Street lobbyists and renewable energy advocates had been bracing for.

Legislation released Monday by the Ways and Means Committee — up for markup Tuesday afternoon — is one piece of the GOP’s work to extend the 2017 tax cuts, enhance defense and boost domestic energy production.

While far from becoming law, the committee’s product drew quick condemnation from environmentalists, renewable energy industries and other advocates who have been pressing Republicans to protect Inflation Reduction Act incentives in a megabill intended to bypass the Senate filibuster.

“This is what full repeal looks like in practice,” said Adrian Deveny, a former energy staffer to Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). “It’s just obscured by lots of complicated legislative language to effectuate it.”

The plan would get rid of tax credits for electric vehicles buyers and hydrogen producers by the end of the year. It would phase out incentives for advanced manufacturing and nuclear power production. And it would end the practice known as “transferability,” which allows project sponsors to transfer the credit to a third party and is often used in finance agreements.

Spared from the knife were incentives for biofuels and sustainable aviation fuels; in fact, they were extended by four years with lower emission qualifications.

The legislation also includes new domestic sourcing requirements intended to disqualify companies tied to China and other foreign adversaries from accessing the incentives.

Republican leaders have struggled to appease warring factions within the party and deliver a bill to President Donald Trump’s desk by this summer — indeed one hard-line House Republican said the cuts to green credits didn’t go far enough.

But those leaders have also said they had intended to take a “scalpel” rather than a “sledgehammer” to the IRA. Right now, the wielders of the sledgehammer have won out.

House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith (R-Mo.) said on social media that his text would take Republicans “one step closer to putting One Big, Beautiful Bill” before Trump.

Most environmental groups were aghast at the proposals. Ben Jealous, CEO of the Sierra Club, pointed to a provision that would strip organizations of their tax-exempt status if the administration determined they supported terrorist organizations.

“Allowing any administration to label an American organization it disagrees with or simply does not like as ‘terrorists’ is not just wrong, it is unamerican,” Jealous said in a statement.

Some renewable energy advocates invoked Republican rhetoric in criticizing the legislation. “The Ways and Means bill is at odds with American energy dominance,” said Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association.

While he argued that the bill would raise energy costs, “force American factories to shut their doors, and threaten American jobs,” he said he stood ready to work with Republicans.

“It is possible to phase out incentives for clean energy investment, production, and manufacturing without harming American consumers or businesses — and we stand ready to help,” he said.

Republicans might need help on a host of issues. A few dozen moderates — though many of whom are not on the Ways and Means Committee — have been signaling their interest in protecting some of the IRA credits.

But it remains to be seen how they will respond should the package clear committee. Complicating matters is the intraparty fight over state and local income tax deductions, or SALT, which could upend the entire effort.

Other hurdles remain in the Senate. Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah), who carved out a climate lane when he was in the House, demurred Monday when asked about the proposal. The same was true for Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), who said he had not seen the text. Neither voted for the IRA in 2022.

Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) was not as quiet. He chided Republicans, saying they were ceding the clean energy economy to China.

“The Inflation Reduction Act is the single largest clean energy and climate investment in our history, and we will not let Trump, Big Oil, and Republicans roll back our gains and deny our communities and young people the chance at a livable future,” he said in a press release.

‘Pulling the rug out’

One piece of the fine print could be a big deal for projects. Moving forward, new projects accessing the technology-neutral credits likely would not get built in time to be “placed in service”— or when they begin selling electricity to the grid — and meet the phase-out deadline. Current law uses phaseout dates based on when construction begins.

“Some projects that have already started development and gotten financing on the basis of a commenced construction tax structure,” Deveny added. “So this is pulling the rug out from under the industry.”

Other advocates noted the credits have spurred more than $400 billion in investment since the IRA passed nearly three years ago — including many in Republican-held congressional districts.

The electric vehicle industry put a finer point on it. “Businesses throughout the auto industry, from critical mineral and material developers to battery manufacturers and automakers, are making investments supported by the certainty offered by our federal government,” said the Zero-Emission Transportation Association’s Executive Director Albert Gore in a press release.

“In turn, these investments are creating new economic opportunities in local communities, from Reno, Nevada, to Casa Grande, Arizona, to Savannah, Georgia.”

New ad push

Tax credit advocates are making an eleventh-hour push to put new pressure on House Republicans who they believe could be convinced to take a tougher stand.

Unlocking Advanced Energy — an initiative run by the energy industry association Advanced Energy United — is rolling out a six-figure ad buy this week targeting five Republican-led districts with tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in planned private-sector investments that would benefit from the IRA.

The digital-only campaign, details of which were shared first with POLITICO’s E&E News, would target constituents in the districts of Reps. Juan Ciscomani (R-Ariz.), Gabe Evans (R-Colo.), Beth Van Duyne (R-Texas), Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.) and Ryan Mackenzie (R-Pa.).

Some of the ads state that advanced energy manufacturing is growing thanks in part to climate law credits, and they assert that those districts’ Republican representatives can help keep that momentum going.

While clean energy advocates rang the alarm bells, some conservatives were mad it did not just ax the climate law entirely.

“Does the bill fully repeal the IRA to stop the devastatingly bad projects being implemented in my district (battery, solar farms, etc..)?” Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) wrote in a long post outlining his many concerns with the bill. “NO, it phases those out, which will cause a race to construction (among other problems), and leaves many in place we should not.”

But Rep. Julie Fedorchak (R-N.D.) — who has argued solar and wind energy are no longer nascent industries in need of such generous subsidies from the federal government — applauded the plan.

“I’m glad my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee are advancing this reform to responsibly phase out these tax credits,” she said. “Retiring these tax credits will save taxpayers billions of dollars, strengthen our grid, and help deliver on the promise of the One Big Beautiful bill to make America stronger, safer, and more competitive.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/67/63/1c48dc744f73aebe1fa305f35048/u-s-congress-37717.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:34:55.445244

The hydrogen holdup is the latest GM project in Michigan facing uncertainty.
Some of that funding, which GM has yet to receive and is in question under President Donald Trump, was committed to pay for tooling at the Detroit plant.
Unlike the Piston plant, the one in Brownstown Township produces components in addition to fuel cells.
Piston was awarded $1.5 million performance-based grant from the state in January to support the hydrogen project.","Piston, which counts GM among its top customers, entered into an agreement with the automaker last September to lease and operate a 292,550-square-foot plant, where it expected to create 144 jobs. It is the first standalone plant dedicated to fuel cell production for GM.

GM spokesman Kevin Kelly declined to provide details about the status of the project other than to say it has not been cancelled.

Piston declined to comment.

The reason for GM pausing the project is not clear, but it comes at a challenging time for the automotive industry. Carmakers and suppliers are navigating the impact of tariffs under the Trump administration and at the same time grappling with how to place their bets on future propulsion systems as regulations and consumer demand shift. GM executives said earlier this month they anticipate a $5 billion hit this year from tariffs.

The hydrogen holdup is the latest GM project in Michigan facing uncertainty. The automaker is reassessing product plans for the long-delayed Orion Assembly Plant in Oakland County and the future of the Renaissance Center in downtown Detroit remains unclear as GM prepares to move its headquarters to Dan Gilbert’s Hudson’s Detroit development.

GM has plenty of company when it comes to indecision about new propulsion investments. Michigan saw a wave of hydrogen and battery plant announcements a couple of years ago, but many of them have either been stalled, shrunk or scrapped. Economic development officials say that most of the projects will pay off, but it will just take longer than expected.

GM was among several manufacturers to be awarded a chunk of $750 million by the U.S. Energy Department a year ago under then-President Joe Biden to boost hydrogen fuel cell production. Some of that funding, which GM has yet to receive and is in question under President Donald Trump, was committed to pay for tooling at the Detroit plant.

The plant was intended for low-volume production, but GM declined to say how it would use the fuel cells. It is likely they would be used in nonautomotive applications before going into trucks. In addition to the Piston supply deal, GM has a joint venture with Honda producing fuel cell systems at a 70,000-square-foot plant in Brownstown Township downriver. Unlike the Piston plant, the one in Brownstown Township produces components in addition to fuel cells.

Piston was awarded $1.5 million performance-based grant from the state in January to support the hydrogen project. Michigan Economic Development Corp. spokesman Otie McKinley said none of that money has been disbursed.

Piston, owned by former Detroit Pistons guard Vinnie Johnson, a Crain's 2024 Newsmaker of the Year, has a large chunk of business tied to GM projects in a holding pattern. The supplier was tapped by GM to operate a $278 million, 960-job plant at the former Palace of Auburn Hills site to supply Orion Assembly.

At the old State Fairgrounds site, Piston was tasked with making the investment and creating the jobs under a nine-year contract, though the exact financial structure of the deal is unclear, as is the amount of money that has been invested so far.

The building occupied by the hydrogen program is part of a massive speculative redevelopment project completed by Sterling Group and Hillwood. Greg Scovitch, vice president of development for Hillwood, told Crain’s earlier this month he was unaware of any changes with the user’s plans.",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/Piston%20plant_0.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:42:25.071383

The Chamber’s Business Impact Awards honor organizations that drive innovation and economic growth in the Northern Kentucky. SD1 was recognized for its groundbreaking Clean H2O40 program — a 20-year strategic plan that is transforming how the region manages sewer overflows, protecting waterways, and safeguarding community health.

“We are grateful to be recognized by the NKY Chamber and our peers in the business community,” said SD1 Executive Director Adam Chaney. “Our team works around the clock, often behind the scenes, to protect our rivers, our neighborhoods and our future. This award affirms that our efforts are making a real difference in the lives of Northern Kentuckians.”

SD1 manages more than 2,200 miles of sanitary and stormwater infrastructure across Boone, Campbell and Kenton counties, serving over 347,000 residents. The agency treats approximately 35 million gallons of wastewater daily and prevents about 105,000 pounds of waste from entering the Ohio River each day.

At the heart of SD1’s environmental efforts is Clean H2O40, a federally negotiated agreement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The program aims to eliminate all typical-year sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) and capture at least 85% of typical-year combined system flow (CSO) by 2040.

During Phase 1 of the program, completed in 2023, SD1 significantly outperformed its regulatory targets—eliminating more than 60% of SSOs and capturing nearly 71% of CSOs. Key projects included a double siphon beneath the Licking River that removed 42 million gallons of typical-year SSOs and multiple equalization tanks that mitigated millions more.

SD1’s controlled storage approach—using detention basins and equalization tanks to hold and gradually release stormwater—has proven to be both environmentally and economically effective. This strategy is expected to save ratepayers hundreds of millions of dollars over the life of the program.

“SD1’s commitment to environmental stewardship is rooted in the belief that clean water is fundamental to quality of life,” said Chaney. “Northern Kentucky has always been a river town. Clean H2O40 is our pledge to future generations that we will keep those rivers clean, healthy and flowing with possibility.”

Rapid Analysis: House GOP’s Clean Energy Repeal and What it Means for the Affordability Crisis

The GOP’s proposed budget reconciliation bill kills jobs and raises household energy costs. Here’s our latest analysis.

Share:

After weeks of working behind closed doors on their budget reconciliation bill, House Republicans are finally releasing draft legislative text ahead of the committee markup process. These proposals, across various committees, are not only expected to make devastating cuts to Medicaid and food assistance, but would also gut clean energy, climate, and environmental justice programs that are reducing costs, creating jobs, and improving public health across the country.

Let’s not mince words: Republicans are trying to raise your energy bills and destroy thousands of American jobs—simply to pad the pockets of billionaires, fossil fuel executives, and their top corporate backers with massive tax cuts.

We’ve compiled our policy analysis of the Republicans’ proposed Energy and Commerce (E&C) Committee bill text and Ways and Means (W&M) Committee bill text below to explain how these sweeping cuts will harm your pocketbooks, health, and planet.

Conclusion and Opportunity to Take Action

Background

First, some context: Back in 2022, Congress passed transformational clean energy investments as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). These investments were strategically designed to make energy bills more affordable, revitalize American manufacturing, and create millions of good jobs for working Americans, while cutting pollution. But House Republicans are now unleashing a full-scale attack on these historic investments, even though the lion’s share of the benefits from these investments flow to GOP districts. They’re targeting critical programs like clean energy tax credits, advanced manufacturing tax credits, Environmental Justice Block Grants, and the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF).

Simply put, these bills are an affront to American communities struggling with a cost-of-living crisis, working people trying to support their families, and those living in sacrifice zones with polluted air and water. Let’s take a closer look at the devastating cuts proposed by these Republican committees.

Toplines

Ways and Means

The House W&M Committee covers the tax-writing elements of the reconciliation bill, meaning this part of the Republican-proposed bill includes major cuts to the federal energy tax credits that are already delivering enormous benefits, particularly in Republican districts. These benefits include affordable clean energy and historic climate pollution reductions. Here’s what the GOP is proposing:

Republicans are gutting or outright repealing tax credits for clean energy, clean vehicles, home efficiency, and clean manufacturing. The W&M Committee proposal would effectively repeal IRA tax incentives — raising Americans’ energy costs, killing jobs, and freezing new investments, especially in domestic manufacturing. House Republicans are using a sledgehammer and pretending it is a scalpel.

Under the W&M Committee proposal, most credits are eliminated at the end of 2025. Others have unworkable “placed in service” provisions or overly-complex and burdensome “foreign entity of concern” requirements that make them difficult to use, before they are then phased out. The GOP has also proposed terminating the “transferability” provision for the tax credits, which would strangle the growing clean energy market.

Here are the specific critical clean energy tax credits affected by the bill (this list is not exhaustive):

Clean Energy Investment and Production Tax Credits (45Y and 48E) are changed to begin phasing out in 2029, and are fully eliminated at the end of 2031. Additionally, the specified calendar years no longer refer to the date of “commencement of construction” but instead to the date “placed in service,” which will effectively kill most new projects and jeopardize the financing of many projects already underway. This is a radical shift in U.S. energy tax law.

All of the Electric Vehicle Credits (45W, 30D, 30C, 25E), including for new and used EVs, are functionally eliminated.

Advanced Manufacturing Credits (45X) are subjected to unworkable new “foreign entity of concern” provisions that will freeze new investment and reverse America’s manufacturing renaissance. The credits are phased out at the end of 2031, with wind energy components no longer eligible after 2027.

Home Energy Efficiency Credits (25C) are eliminated at the end of 2025.

New Energy Efficient Home Credits (45L) are eliminated at the end of 2025.

Residential Solar Credits and other home energy systems credits (25D) are eliminated at the end of 2025.

Energy and Commerce

The House E&C Committee covers, among other things, any elements of the reconciliation bill related to the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency. This part of the reconciliation bill attempts to repeal most of the federal grant programs created by the IRA, as well as setting up rubber stamp permitting for fossil fuel infrastructure.

Republicans claim to be cutting at least $6.5 billion in funding for climate and clean energy programs that benefit American households, alongside proposing devastating and shameful cuts to critical health programs.

House Republicans are severely stretching the limits of the rules of reconciliation that prohibit making non-budgetary policy changes as they attempt to repeal vehicle emissions standards required by the Clean Air Act.

The GOP has proposed repealing sections of the Clean Air Act and other laws created in the IRA.

Under this proposal, key programs are completely repealed, and any unobligated funding is rescinded. (‘Unobligated funding’ means approved money that has yet to be legally committed for a specific purpose).. Many of these programs have most of their money obligated but could still be impacted by repeal, including this non-exhaustive list:

Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund

Environmental Justice Block Grants

Vehicle Efficiency and Emission Standards

Methane Emissions and Waste Reduction Incentive Program

Climate Pollution Reduction Grants

Department of Energy Loan Programs Office

Transmission Planning, Siting, and Financing

Clean Ports Program

Advanced Industrial Facilities Deployment Program

The bill allows natural gas pipeline projects to pay a fee of $10 million to bypass the normal permitting process and then guts the normal judicial review process by severely limiting who can bring forward lawsuits. Similarly, the bill says applicants should pay $1 million for the Department of Energy to deem a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export permit in the “public interest”, essentially allowing the fossil fuel industry to buy one of the necessary approvals. This makes a farce of our permitting process and essentially legalizes corruption with a pay-to-play privilege for gas pipelines.

1. Clean Energy Tax Credits (45Y and 48E)

Let’s start with one of the most powerful tools supporting rapid deployment of new energy generation and a modern, reliable, and affordable electricity grid for American homes and businesses: the IRA’s clean electricity tax credits. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) (45Y) is a technology-neutral tax credit that subsidizes the production of zero-emission sources like solar, wind, nuclear, hydropower, and geothermal. For every kilowatt hour (kWh) of clean energy generated, the producer gets a base credit of 2.6¢/kWh if they meet certain criteria. Similarly, the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) (48E) provides a credit of 30 percent (or more) of the investment into these same zero-emission energy generation technology projects, including energy storage.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

The tech-neutral tax credits are phased out and have many new restrictions placed on them.Tax credits begin to phase out for projects placed in service in2029 (eligible for 80 percent of credits in 2029, 60 percent in 2030, 40 percent in 2031, and full repeal after that).

All date cut-offs are now when projects are “placed in service” instead of when they begin construction, which jeopardizes new and existing investments.

Transferability of the credit from project sponsors to third-party buyers with tax liability is no longer allowed. This would further undermine investment in new projects.

The GOP’s proposal applies a new, unworkable Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) requirement to the credit, restricting it for any entities that are deemed by the Trump administration to be ""foreign-influenced entities"" or that make substantial payments (≥ percent per transaction or ≥15 percent in aggregate) to businesses overseas. These provisions take effect two years after enactment and would strangle investment in new energy generation.

Key Impacts:

Repealing the clean energy tax credits would worsen the affordability crisis, raise energy bills, harm grid reliability, kill jobs, and inflame the climate crisis.

Skyrocketing energy prices: Full repeal of the clean energy tax credits would raise American household energy bills. It could increase annual energy bills up to $140-$220 per household across the country in 2040, and over $500 per year in some states. The W&M proposal, which guts the tax credits, would approach those levels.

Kill good-paying jobs: Full repeal of the 45Y and 48E clean energy tax credits alone would result in roughly 100,000 fewer full-time jobs across the country by 2040. The W&M proposal would approach those levels.

Repealing the clean energy tax credits would harm grid reliability. These tax credits are enhancing grid reliability in the face of increased electricity demand and extreme weather. Clean energy is the fastest, cheapest way to add new power to the grid. In fact, clean energy accounted for 93% of the new energy capacity added to the U.S. grid last year.

These changes jeopardize billions of dollars of existing investments, including any project underway now that won’t be fully operational until 2028 or later.

Slashing the clean energy tax credits would worsen the climate crisis. Saving the 45Y and 48E tax credits would cut climate pollution by 300 to 400 million tons compared to no tax credits in 2035. That’s 29-46 percent lower than a scenario without clean energy tax credits. After a year marked by devastating, billion-dollar climate disasters, floods, and fires, it’s more important than ever that we address climate head-on.

2. Electric Vehicle Credits (45W, 30D, 30C, 25E)

The IRA’s electric vehicle (EV) tax credits have been rapidly accelerating America’s clean auto industry and jobs, while making EVs more financially accessible for some families. Households and commercial companies can receive tax credits for purchasing new electric vehicles (up to $7,500) and used electric vehicles (up to $4,000), as well as for chargers and installation.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

The GOP’s bill eliminates the IRA’s 30D clean vehicle credit for most vehicles at the end of 2025 with a one-year extension for a limited number of vehicles, which means that households will no longer be able to receive a tax credit of $7,500 for a new qualifying EV.

The bill also guts the used clean vehicle credit 25E(g) at the end of the 2025 calendar year, meaning households can no longer receive a tax credit of $4,000 for purchasing a previously-owned electric vehicle.

The bill further eliminates the qualified commercial clean vehicles credit 45W(g), with an exception carved out for vehicles placed in service before 2033 and under a binding contract entered into before May 2025.

The GOP terminates the alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit 30C(i) at the end of 2025.

Key Impacts:

Fully repealing the IRA’s EV tax credits would drive a wrecking ball through the American-made EV industry, leading to the potential cancellation of as much as 100 percent of all planned construction and expansion of American EV assembly capacity. That’s according to the latest analysis from Princeton University’s ZERO Lab, assuming that the EPA’s tailpipe emissions regulations are repealed alongside the 30D and 45W tax credits. The same analysis finds that roughly 8.3 million fewer EVs and plug-in hybrids could be driving on American roads in 2030.

For households, new and used electric vehicles would become less financially accessible, meaning consumers would have fewer transportation options.

Repealing the EV tax credits would cause major job losses, according to the CEO of the Ford Motor Company, and benefit China, according to General Motors.

3. Manufacturing Credits (45X)

The Advanced Energy Manufacturing Credit (45X) provides an incentive to manufacturing facilities that produce clean energy components or systems in the U.S. Facilities that produce solar, wind, advanced batteries, and certain critical minerals are rewarded for re-shoring supply chains in America.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

This bill eliminates the manufacturing tax credit at the end of 2031, and terminates tax credits for wind energy components sold after 2027. Importantly the proposed bill applies a new unworkable Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) requirement to the credit, restricting it for any entities that are deemed by the Trump administration to be ""foreign-influenced entities"" or that make substantial payments (≥5% per transaction or ≥15% in aggregate) to businesses overseas. This provision will make the 45X credit fundamentally unusable, even before the credit is sunsetted.

Key Impacts:

The 45X Advanced Energy Manufacturing Credit has sparked a renaissance in U.S. manufacturing, especially for electric vehicles, advanced batteries, and solar energy and their supply chains The credits have helped incentivize over $200 billion in new investment in the U.S. and positioned the U.S. to be competitive in critical 21st century global industries. This incentive has contributed to job and manufacturing growth in districts that Republicans represent. The GOP’s call for repeal would directly harm jobs and livelihoods of their constituents, and send American manufacturing jobs overseas.

4. Home Energy Efficiency Credits (25C, 45L)

Thanks to the IRA, households can take tax credits of 30 percent off, up to $2,000, for installing a heat pump or heat pump water heater, plus $1,200 for weatherization and insulation via the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (25C). The 25C tax credit helped 2.3 million American families improve their homes and reduce their monthly energy bills in 2023. Families are saving an average of $130 a year in energy costs. By 2032 homeowners are expected to use the credit enough to cut peak electric demand by 3,400 MW.

The New Energy Efficient Home Credit (45L) provides incentives to builders of homes that meet Energy Star or Zero-Energy Ready Home standards. This credit has assisted with the construction of nearly 350,000 efficient new homes in 2024 and cut homeowner energy bills by about $450 per year.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (25C) is eliminated as of the end of 2025. The New Energy Efficient Home Credit (45L) is eliminated for homes acquired after the end of 2025, unless the home construction began before May 12, 2025.

Key Impacts:

Cutting building energy efficiency credits takes money out of people’s pockets by making home energy upgrades more expensive and raises everyone’s utility bills by reducing efficiency and putting more pressure on the electric grid. Households can currently save $990 per year on utility bills if they utilize the 25C tax credit and these credits create 240,000 jobs. By effectively terminating the Energy Efficient Home Credit for new buildings starting TODAY, this is a major gut punch to any builders trying to provide new homes to address the housing crisis.

5. Residential Clean Energy Tax Credits (25D)

Dating back to 2005, the Residential Clean Energy Tax Credit provides households with a 30 percent tax credit for rooftop solar, wind power, geothermal heating systems, and battery systems. In 2023, 1.2 million American families took advantage of the residential clean energy tax credit, and now 5 percent of US households have solar. And all of that small-scale solar adds up, with over 66GW installed, amounting to more than one-third of US solar capacity.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

The Residential Clean Energy Tax Credit is eliminated as of the end of 2025.

Key Impacts:

Households would see higher costs for home energy upgrades and lose access to $1,250 in savings per year on utility bills. At the same time, we would be cutting a huge source of new energy capacity just as demand on the grid is increasing, which will raise energy costs for everyone. Plus, cutting the residential clean energy tax credits would kill hundreds of thousands of jobs in the home energy and rooftop solar sector.

6. Transferability

The transferability provisions for various energy tax credits included in the IRA makes it possible for more companies and communities to access tax credits for their cost-cutting, job-creating energy projects. Through transferability, a project sponsor that may not have tax liability can sell their energy tax credit to a third party that does. This reduces the cost of the project and expands the universe of entities that can benefit from these important incentives. Furthermore, transferability has been used to benefit new clean energy technologies and manufacturing facilities, helping to grow new industries that are not reliant upon complex tax equity financing deals.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

Transferability is repealed for all applicable tax credits effective for construction beginning two years after the enactment of this bill, and applies to any fuel production-related credits after December 31, 2027.

Key Impacts:

Transferability broadens capital access, particularly for more local project developers, manufacturers, and fuel producers that have traditionally lacked access to this investment market. In fact, it’s already catalyzed more than $500 billion in private capital since 2022. Without this tool, significant chunks of the clean energy tax credits will be cannibalized by large banks and complex tax equity deals, which is an unnecessary waste of taxpayer money. Some clean energy developers will be shut out from this critical market, significantly diminishing our ability to meet the growing energy demand driven by artificial intelligence (A.I.) and data centers. This repeal will strangle the booming clean energy market — driving up costs for households and limiting investments in energy production at a critical moment.

7. Other IRA Programs Affected by the W&M Proposal

Direct Pay (aka Elective Pay) allows states and local governments and non-profit organizations to access 12 of the IRA tax credits and is not impacted by the Ways & Means proposal—however, the policy would be rendered fundamentally useless if the underlying tax incentives are repealed, especially those supporting clean electricity, electric vehicles, and charging infrastructure.

Clean Fuels Production Credits (45Z) are extended to 2031 with increased generosity for fuels with land use impacts and ""renewable natural gas.”

Carbon Capture Credits (45Q) are amended so that credits cannot flow to a specified foreign entity. Transferability is repealed.

Hydrogen Production Tax Credit (45V) is eliminated at the end of 2025.

Nuclear Tax Credit (45U) is phased out beginning in 2029 (80 percent in 2029, 60 percent in 2030, 40 percent in 2031, and 0 percent after 2031).

8. Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund

The $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) is the largest grant program within the IRA. This $27 billion is divided into three programs: the National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF), the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA), and Solar for All. Not only does this program provide a significant investment in pollution-reducing clean energy technology, but it also benefits communities that have been historically overlooked and underserved, bringing greater equity to the clean energy transition. For months, the Trump administration has waged an unsubstantiated assault on this fund. At every turn, the administration has been unable to justify its attacks to undermine this program, failing to offer evidence to support its bogus claims of fraud, waste, or abuse.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

Republicans have proposed repealing section 134 of the Clean Air Act and rescinding all unobligated balances in the GGRF program.

Key Impacts:

The GGRF is unlocking a historic wave of public and private investment, delivering local economic development opportunities that would not have materialized without this program, especially in disadvantaged communities. But the Trump administration has already been attacking the GGRF through an illegal funding freeze, and a court battle is currently raging with program awardees, in particular the NCIF and CCIA programs. The GGRF funding has technically been obligated, and only minimal GGRF funds remain unobligated and available for rescission. But the E&C proposal would harm program implementation and oversight at EPA. It may also represent an attempt by Congress and the administration to block or claw back funds that have been legally obligated.

9. Environmental Justice Block Grants

This first-of-its-kind $3 billion federal program aims to empower disadvantaged communities to determine and design their own visions of pollution reduction and clean energy investment. The Environmental Justice (EJ) Block Grants, also known as the Community Change Grants, provide highly flexible funding that goes directly to nonprofit organizations serving these communities. This means projects are designed by and for communities to address their unique needs and build resilience to extreme weather events and environmental risks.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

Republicans propose completely repealing section 138 of the Clean Air Act, eliminating the Environmental Justice (EJ) Block Grants program, and rescinding any unobligated funding, which would deprive disadvantaged communities of hundreds of millions of grant dollars.

Key Impacts:

Without EJ Block Grants, there will be less financial support for on-the-ground, community-led organizations that provide life-changing services to households based in disadvantaged communities or living near sacrifice zones. Examples of critical services include community-led pollution monitoring, prevention, and remediation; projects that reduce indoor air pollution; projects to counter health risks from urban heat islands, extreme heat, and wildfires; improved community engagement in public processes; and technical assistance.

10. Vehicle Efficiency and Emission Standards

The Department of Transportation (DOT) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards for efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks. These standards have saved drivers trillions of dollars and drastically reduced harmful pollution from vehicles—reducing smog and health impacts like asthma and heart disease. Rescinding these standards is not allowed by the rules of budget reconciliation, but Republicans are trying to repeal them anyway.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

Republicans propose repealing the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) efficiency standards and the EPA’s greenhouse gas emissions standards for passenger and light trucks starting in model year 2027 and efficiency standards for heavy-duty trucks starting in 2030. This action is plainly inadmissible under congressional budget reconciliation rules. The bill also rescinds any unobligated funding for the clean heavy-duty vehicles program and loans to support vehicle and vehicle supply chain manufacturing facilities.

Key Impacts:

If Republicans successfully gut these vehicle standards, we would end up with less efficient and more polluting vehicles, burning 70 billion extra gallons of gasoline through 2050 and increasing climate pollution by more than 710 million metric tons. Eliminating these standards would increase costs by $600 over the lifetime of new vehicles. Increased pollution would lead to greater health risks (asthma, heart disease, cancer) from toxic air pollution. Attempting to repeal these rules via reconciliation would seriously stretch the limits of reconciliation by trying to set regulations via this budgetary process.

11. Natural Gas Expedited Permitting

As it currently stands, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) reviews applications for the construction and operation of interstate natural gas pipelines under the authority of section 7 of the Natural Gas Act. FERC review ensures that applicants certify that they will comply with Department of Transportation safety standards.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

This bill allows natural gas pipeline projects to pay a fee of $10 million to bypass the normal permitting process and then guts the normal judicial review process by severely limiting who can bring forward lawsuits.

Key Impacts:

This makes a farce of our permitting process and essentially legalizes corruption with a pay-to-play privilege for gas pipelines. Americans will be severely impacted by gas pipelines built through their communities. Medical professionals and frontline leaders have long documented the devastating health, economic, and local environmental harms from this fossil fuel infrastructure.

12. Rubberstamping Liquefied Natural Gas Exports

Under the Natural Gas Act, the Department of Energy (DOE) has the authority to determine whether proposed liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports to non-Free Trade Agreement countries are in the “public interest” or not. This is part of a wider review process when considering proposed LNG export facilities.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

Republicans are proposing that the DOE would be allowed to determine that a proposed liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facility is in the “public interest” if the applicant pays $1 million.

Key Impacts:

Similar to the natural gas pipeline permitting above, this normalizes a pay-to-play privilege for LNG export infrastructure, potentially expediting the build-out of these mega-polluting projects. As DOE’s own studies show, unfettered U.S. LNG exports will hurt Americans with higher electricity and gas prices and drastically worsen climate pollution. Medical professionals and frontline leaders have long documented the devastating health, economic, climate, and local environmental harms from this kind of fossil fuel infrastructure, particularly in the Gulf South.

13. Methane Emissions and Waste Reduction Incentive Program

Methane is a potent, planet-heating greenhouse gas that oil and gas operators often flare or leak into the atmosphere. That’s why Congress passed the Waste Emissions Charge (WEC) through the IRA in 2022, requiring oil and gas operators to pay a penalty fee if they exceed a certain level of methane pollution. Soon after, the Biden-led EPA introduced a rule implementing the WEC. But at the beginning of 2025, the Republican-controlled Congress voted to eliminate that rule. Now, Congress is trying to get rid of the fee outright via the budget reconciliation bill.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

The bill attempts to completely repeal subsections (a) and (b) of section 136 of the Clean Air Act and rescinds any unobligated funding. The methane fee is retained, but the language is altered so that the fee is not collected until ten years from now.

Key Impacts:

By cutting methane pollution and other harmful pollutants, the WEC would have helped prevent asthma attacks and other health-harming impacts. The program would have reduced an extremely harmful greenhouse gas superpollutant. Altering the WEC will disproportionately impact communities of color and disadvantaged communities. The methane fee is also a revenue raiser, so its alteration would necessitate even deeper cuts to other vital programs to comply with the GOP’s self-imposed spending cut targets.

14. Climate Pollution Reduction Grants

The Climate Pollution Reduction Grants (CPRG) are an EPA program established as part of a new Clean Air Act Section 137 created in the IRA, which provides grants to state, local, and Tribal governments to create and implement programs that reduce emissions and support jobs and communities. It was funded with $5 billion, including $250 million in planning grants, $4.6 billion for implementation grants, and the remaining balance for technical assistance and program implementation. These grants have been used to support state, local, and Tribal governments in nearly all 50 states.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

The E&C Committee proposes to repeal and rescind unobligated balances in the CPRG program account. At the start of the Trump administration, the CPRG program had approximately $90 million in unobligated funding.

Key Impacts:

Rescinding funding for the CPRG program would dramatically harm program implementation at the agency. Without these dollars, EPA staff may also be unable to process grant funding disbursements to states, cities, and Tribal nations who have received obligated funding awards.

15. Department of Energy Loan Programs Office

The Department of Energy Loan Programs Office (LPO) was created with strong bipartisan support during the George W. Bush administration, and for the last two decades, it has provided critical financing for American energy, manufacturing, mining, and other industrial projects that reduce emissions and support American leadership in the fast-growing clean energy economy. To date, the LPO has financed approximately $90 billion in innovative energy and manufacturing projects, including a $465 million loan to Elon Musk’s Tesla Motors in 2010. And at the conclusion of 2024, the LPO had collected over $5 billion in interest payments from its loans, meaning that it has made a profit for American taxpayers.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

The bill would rescind unobligated balances in the LPO, which currently holds billions in unspent funds used to support loans under the 1703 program that supports clean energy and industrial transformation. These changes would also impact the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program, which supports the global competitiveness of American automakers; the Energy Infrastructure Financing Reinvestment Program, which supports new clean energy generation and community revitalization for legacy energy communities; and the Tribal Energy Loan Program.

Key Impacts:

The E&C proposal would essentially eliminate the LPO. This would be a devastating move, especially amidst rising energy demand and a competitive global race to build and manufacture the energy technologies that will power the 21st century. Slashing the LPO would undermine American businesses and U.S. technology leadership. Not only that, over the long term, eliminating the LPO would cost American taxpayers money, as the successful program has already returned $5 billion in profit to the American taxpayer via interest on its loans.

16. Transmission Planning, Siting, and Financing

There are several IRA programs at DOE that support the expansion of electricity transmission infrastructure in the U.S, critical to providing affordable and reliable power for Americans. These include the Transmission Facility Financing program; Offshore Wind Electricity Transmission Planning, Modeling, and Analysis program; and Grants to Facilitate the Siting of Interstate Electricity Transmission Lines. These programs are especially important at a time of rising electricity demand, fueled by data centers to power the race for artificial intelligence (AI), increasing electrification of vehicles and buildings, and an American manufacturing renaissance.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

The bill rescinds any unobligated amounts for Transmission Facility Financing; Interregional and Offshore Wind Electricity Transmission Planning, Modelling, and Analysis; and Grants to Facilitate the Siting of Interstate Electricity Transmission Lines. Together, these programs held nearly $2.5 billion in unobligated funding at the beginning of 2025.

Key Impacts:

Republicans claim to care about energy dominance and cheap energy, but this nonsensical action would sabotage efforts to make our grid more affordable, reliable, and resilient.

17. Clean Ports Program

The EPA’s Clean Ports Program provides $3 billion in grants to fund zero-emission port equipment and technology and to assist U.S. ports in developing climate action plans to reduce air pollutants. Grants were awarded in 2024 to 55 projects across the country that will eliminate “more than 3 million metric tons of carbon pollution, equivalent to 391,220 homes’ energy use for one year.” The vast majority of those pollution reduction benefits will be felt in frontline and disadvantaged communities in heavily trafficked port corridors.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

The text proposes completely repealing section 133 of the Clean Air Act, the Clean Ports Program, with any unobligated funding rescinded.

Key Impacts:

Any cuts to the Clean Ports Program would mean more pollution at our ports, more harm to the health of our communities from toxic air pollution especially in frontline communities already burdened with higher rates of pollution-driven health impacts like asthma, and job losses from cutting these important projects already underway in states all across the U.S.

18. Advanced Industrial Facilities Deployment Program

The Advanced Industrial Facilities Deployment Program (AIFDP) was created in the IRA and funded with over $5.8 billion to advance industrial decarbonization and support American manufacturing’s global economic competitiveness. The program has provided funds for innovative low-carbon cement manufacturing projects in Indiana, Georgia, Texas, and Virginia, for next-generation aluminum manufacturing in Colorado, for low-carbon steel production in multiple states, and much more.

Changes in the Reconciliation Bill:

The E&C Committee proposes to rescind unobligated balances from the AIFDP, which is estimated to be hundreds of millions of dollars.

Key Impacts:

Rescinding unobligated balances from the AIFDP program would deal a major blow to U.S. global economic competitiveness as American businesses fight for market share in increasingly decarbonized steel, cement, aluminum, and other heavy industries.

19. Other IRA Programs Affected by the E&C Proposal

The Republican E&C Committee also repealed and/or rescinded any unobligated funds from the following IRA programs.

Air pollution monitoring program for schools in low-income and disadvantaged communities at EPA.

American Innovation Manufacturing (AIM) Act that aims to phase down hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)—potent greenhouse pollutants used in refrigeration, air conditioning, and other applications. The E&C proposes to eliminate funding that helps implement this important bipartisan law.

Funding for Efficiency, Accurate, and Timely Reviews at EPA to enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and timeliness of environmental reviews, permitting, and project approvals.

Enforcement Technology and Public Information at EPA.

Environmental Product Declarations at EPA for construction materials and products. This initiative aimed to enhance the standardization, transparency, and reporting criteria for EPDs, which include measurements of the embodied greenhouse gas emissions associated with materials and products used in construction.

Fenceline pollution monitoring program at EPA to monitor pollution, particularly in communities near polluting facilities.

Greenhouse Gas Corporate Reporting at EPA to enhance the standardization and transparency of corporate climate action commitments and plans to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions

Lowering Embodied Carbon Labeling for Construction Materials, including developing a program for identifying and labeling construction materials with substantially lower levels of embodied greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to industry averages. This initiative was designed to promote the use of low-carbon materials in construction projects, particularly in federal buildings and transportation infrastructure.

Renewable Fuel Program at EPA for grantmaking for advanced biofuels.

State-Based Home Energy Efficiency Contractor Training Grants at DOE that provides needed financing to states to train and procure a workforce that is able to install cost-saving home efficiency upgrades like heat pumps.

Conclusion

Let’s be clear-eyed about what’s happening here: Congressional Republicans are attempting to take money out of everyday people’s pockets to give tax breaks to billionaires. In the process, they’re taking a wrecking ball to dozens of programs that make energy affordable for households, reduce toxic pollution, combat the climate crisis, provide life-changing healthcare, and nourish families with food assistance.

Though this analysis has focused on Evergreen’s priority IRA climate programs found in the E&C and W&M draft bills, other life-changing federal programs are on the line. Evergreen will continue to track the House Committee markup and passage process for both W&M and E&C in the coming days. There’s still time to let Congress know that they must not attack these vital programs. Call your representatives now and tell them they cannot vote for a budget bill that repeals climate and clean energy programs, which protect our health, our pocketbooks, and our communities.

GM says it seeks to become the first automaker to deploy LMR batteries in EVs. Ultium Cells, a GM and LG Energy Solution joint venture, says it’s planning to start commercial production of LMR prismatic cells in the United States by 2028, with pre-production expected to begin at an LG Energy Solution facility by late 2027.

The final production-design of these LMR battery cells will be validated at GM’s Battery Cell Development Center in Warren, which is expected to open earlier that year, as well as LG Energy Solution’s facility.

Battery cathodes require materials like cobalt, nickel, and manganese, with cobalt being the most expensive. LMR battery cells use a higher proportion of more affordable manganese, while also delivering greater capacity and energy density, according to the companies.

Battery engineers at GM and LG Energy Solution say they have developed a new LMR prismatic battery cell that unlocks 33 percent higher energy density compared to the best-performing lithium iron phosphate (LFP) based cells — at a comparable cost.

“We’re pioneering manganese-rich battery technology to unlock premium range and performance at an affordable cost, especially in electric trucks,” says Kurt Kelty, vice president of of battery, propulsion, and sustainability at GM.

“As we look to engineer the ideal battery for each vehicle in our diverse EV portfolio, LMR will complement our high-nickel and iron-phosphate solutions to expand customer choice in the truck and full-size SUV markets, advance American battery innovation, and create jobs well into the future.”

GM claims its electric truck platform has segment-leading range using high-nickel chemistry today. By integrating LMR battery technology and the manufacturing and space efficiency benefits of prismatic cells, GM says it aims to offer more than 400 miles of range in an electric truck while achieving “significant” battery pack cost savings compared to today’s high-nickel pack.

“We’re excited to introduce the first-ever LMR prismatic cells for EVs, the culmination of our decades-long research and investment in the technology,” says Wonjoon Suh, executive vice president and head of the Advanced Automotive Battery division at LG Energy Solution. “GM’s future trucks powered by this new chemistry are a strong example of our shared commitment to offering diverse EV options to consumers.”

GM began researching manganese-rich lithium-ion battery cells in 2015, accelerating the technology development by prototyping LMR cells at its Wallace Battery Cell Innovation Center in Warren. In collaboration with partners, GM engineers advanced cathode materials, electrolytes, additives, form factors, and cell assembly processes to overcome LMR’s legacy challenges in performance and durability.",https://cdn.dbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2025/05/GM-LG800.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:42:27.870576

The measure is likely to end up as one of hundreds of clauses in a single large bill meant to reform the nation’s tax and immigration systems. A bill can change significantly between introduction and passage, so we can’t be certain the tax credit will end. However, the measure has the support of House leadership and President Trump.

Reuters reports, “The proposal, set for a House Ways and Means Committee hearing on May 13, would repeal a $7,500 new-vehicle tax credit and a $4,000 used-vehicle credit on December 31, although it would maintain the new-vehicle credit for an additional year for automakers that have not yet sold 200,000 EVs.”

How the Credit Works Today

Today, car shoppers can use the credit as a down payment on a new EV or include it when they file their taxes after buying a new car.

Related: How Do Electric Car Tax Credits Work?

Not every buyer qualifies — certain income limits apply, depending on filing status.

Not every car qualifies. Automakers must build a certain percentage of the vehicle and its battery in the U.S. to qualify for half the credit. They must use a certain percentage of minerals from the U.S. or its major trade partners to be eligible for the other half.

Those percentages increase yearly, a measure meant to encourage automakers to build EVs and supply chains domestically.

Some Dealers Already Stopping

The law has not changed, and the proposal could fail. But some car dealers are already minimizing use of the credit. The Detroit Free Press reports that some “have held back by not offering the credit to buyers who want it up front in the form of a rebate at the point of sale.”

Dealers must apply to obtain the money from the federal government in order to accept it as a down payment. Some may be reluctant to assume they’ll be paid on time if the credit is endangered.

Others, however, say they are still actively offering the credit. An IRS spokesperson said, “taxpayers should take advantage of all lawful credits that are available to them that make economic sense for them.”

Some Credits Would Continue Into 2026 Even if Bill Passes

As currently written, the proposal would continue the credit for an additional year for automakers that have not yet sold at least 200,000 EVs. That would mean EV startups like Rivian and Lucid, as well as large automakers that have been late to the EV game, could still offer the credit into 2026.

Proposal Could Fail in the Senate

Bills supported by House leadership tend to pass the House. The Senate, however, is a tougher prospect.

There, Republicans hold a slim majority. A few defections in states that benefit from the tax credit could kill the proposal. Ironically, the states that gain the most from the EV industry tend to have Republican senators.

The automotive industry has concentrated new EV and battery factories in Republican-led states, mainly because the United Auto Workers union has limited influence there. However, that results in many “red state” senators who know that killing the tax credit could cost their constituents jobs.

Industry Concerned About Chinese Dominance

The EV industry, meanwhile, objects that ending the tax credit could cede a growing sector to China.

Tragedy in Southwest Detroit

On Monday, Feb. 17., residents in a heavily Spanish-speaking community woke up to a river flowing outside their homes. With temperatures in the single digits, icy water covered cars and flooded residential streets and basements. More than 400 homes lost access to heat and water.

The city quickly sent out the emergency resources that it had on hand, which were police. There was a swift backlash.

After Trump’s inauguration, community members had organized Know Your Rights training sessions to inform our immigrant neighbors of their constitutional right to not open their door to police or ICE without a signed warrant from a judge.

My office had to quickly send out videos and graphics in Spanish for non-English-speaking residents: if you’re in the flood zone, the police are there to help you get to safety.

Once residents knew it was safe to leave their homes, I began calling on community members and organizations. Nonprofit leaders and organizations started to collect resources and set up processes for regular wellness checks as we waited for coordinated response plans from the city.

Impacted residents needed us to unite, and Southwest Detroit mobilized.

Amidst confusion, questions, and frustrations, residents called on their neighbors and friends to confirm their safety. People donated items, made meals, helped translate and interpret, provided transportation, helped wash clothes, and so much more. Our community was at the frontline of emergency response.

The mayor promised that impacted residents would be able to return home within six weeks. For those six weeks, families were scattered across metro Detroit. Some stayed with family or friends; others were provided temporary housing in hotels by the city. Ensuring the safety and protection of those impacted was everyone’s top priority.

While the city wasn’t adequately prepared, it and the Great Lakes Water Authority responded promptly, using every tool to clean basements, remove debris, and repair residents’ hot water tanks and furnaces. However, it was not enough. Many Detroiters lost precious items that held memories, or had their vehicles and basements destroyed. Some lost their housing altogether and will never be made whole.

Unprecedented, but unexpected?

What happened in Southwest Detroit was unprecedented and never should have happened. Unfortunately, though, it will so long as glaring challenges go unaddressed.

The federal government’s disinvestment in our communities has a detrimental impact on our day-to-day lives. Failing to fund infrastructure maintenance and improvements creates unsafe neighborhoods and feelings of insecurity.

How can this happen to 400 occupied residential homes in a city in the wealthiest country in the world? Who is at fault?

Every level of government is. Our local government lacked appropriate emergency response processes with local leaders and partners. Our state government does not adequately invest in our infrastructure. Our federal government is slashing budgets, taking our resources away from the working class, and padding the pockets of billionaires.

Detroiters – a resilient people – have been forced to adapt. After experiencing flood event after flood event, they are growing deep roots in mutual aid and emergency response. Why? Because as long as our government serves the wealthy few over the many, only mutual aid will save us.

Coordination and a culture of care

The question then becomes: how do we create these systems of care?

We need to start with trust and clear communication from trusted messengers.

During the mayor’s address to the city after six weeks of recovery, he mentioned that he wished the city had worked with community members sooner. I could not agree more. From the first day this incident happened, my office organized a daily call with nonprofit leaders and community organizers to discuss issues that impacted residents were dealing with.

Collectively, we also met with residents and conducted needs assessments. We then shared this documentation with the city to increase coordination and ensure a timely response to issues as they arose. We asked the city for accessible, bilingual communications.

On a call with the mayor, after a few weeks of frustrating discoordination between the city and community leaders, I told him we all had the same goal and needed to work together to meet the immense need and build trust with our residents. We could not let politics get in the way of serving people. People were scared and felt lost and in the dark. We needed to increase transparency, communicate in more than just English, and meet people where they were. The administration accepted our invitation to join our collaborative efforts in the second or third week of our daily meetings.

Lessons Learned

Relationships are foundational. We must build relationships during calm times, not only in crisis and chaos. Our relationships need to overcome our politics in times of emergencies. When we know our neighbors, we are invested in their safety and well-being.

Beyond your neighbors, get to know the nonprofits and businesses in your community. Do you know who they are and what services they provide? Do some research and make a list with names and numbers. Begin to get to know them and build meaningful relationships. Our relationships with our neighbors could save our lives one day.

Get information from trusted, verified sources. Timely, factual information is key in emergencies. One challenge during the flood in Southwest Detroit was social media. While powerful in that it can spread messages quickly and hold powers-that-be accountable, be sure the source is trusted and verified. (Misinformation will only create more chaos!)

Looking forward

While the city was not fully prepared, I witnessed city staff working long hours, going above and beyond to meet the public’s needs. New systems were created that will aid response efforts in a future emergency. Building the system in real-time is no easy feat. Amid all the challenges, they rose to the occasion, and for that, I am grateful. We must continue to learn from our emergencies, build relationships, and prepare for the next emergency. Council Member Latisha Johnson, Mary Waters, and I have established a Climate and Disaster Recovery task force to continue to learn from our crises and create community emergency response plans.

I plan to continue investing in and encouraging a culture of mutual aid. I invite you to join me on Wednesday, May 14, from 6-8 p.m. at St. Stephen AME for a Mutual Aid 101 training I am hosting with Detroit Hispanic Development Corporation, Urban Neighborhood Initiatives, Detroit Southwest Pride, and Unity In Our Community Timebank. We will share our experience responding to crises on the ground and our vision for a community centered on care. Register at bit.ly/bpts-register.

The legislation includes a provision that would allow energy developers to access an expedited permitting review if they pay $10 million or one percent of the anticipated cost of the construction of the project.

Another provision would have companies applying to export or import natural gas pay a nonrefundable $1 million fee and in return have their project ""deemed to be in the public interest.""

""The idea that corporate polluters can pay a fee to freely pollute our communities is beyond the pale,"" said Mahyar Sorour, a director of the Beyond Fossil Fuels Policy at the Sierra Club, on Monday.

""While it slashes much-needed support for clean energy and climate resilience, it would allow fossil fuel companies to pay to get their project approved. That's not just wrong, it's un-American,"" said Alexandra Adams, chief policy advocacy officer at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

According to E&E News, the legislation aims to rescind ""the unobligated balance"" of IRA funds for multiple Department of Energy programs, such as money meant for the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program.

""Republicans just proposed cutting thousands of jobs, billions of dollars in clean energy funding, and billions of dollars in healthcare funding from their own districts. Why?

Environmental groups warned the proposals would pave the way for more oil and gas industry activity on public lands and increase planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.

The House committees on Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means are set to discuss the plans Tuesday as part of the so-called budget reconciliation process. Several moves are aimed at clawing back billions in spending authorized by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, a Democratic measure intended to slow climate change and boost clean energy such as wind and solar power.

House Speaker Mike Johnson has set a Memorial Day deadline to pass President Donald Trump’s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts, and the GOP has scheduled round-the-clock hearings this week on various sections of the bill before they are stitched together in what will become a massive package.

Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce panel, said his committee’s bill, unveiled Sunday, would return $6.5 billion in unspent funds intended for climate programs included in the 2022 law. In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, he said the plan “ends spending on Green New Deal-style waste"" and claws back money ""headed for green boondoggles'' such as grants for environmental and climate justice.

“The legislation would reverse the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending in the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act,” Guthrie wrote.

The cuts to climate programs are part of a larger $880 billion in savings by 2034 proposed in the draft legislation that also covers communication and health-related policy, largely targeting Medicaid.

The cuts fit with Trump’s 2026 budget proposal, which looks to slash federal spending through a sweeping reorganization of federal agencies as well as steep cuts to disease research and, especially, clean energy and policies intended to address climate change. Congress ultimately decides the spending and tax plans.

In Trump’s first few months back in the White House, the administration has broadly gone after environmental and climate initiatives, many of which were put into place under the Biden administration, pledging to dismantle what Trump calls the Democrats’ “green new scam.”

Groups decry the proposals

The 10 Oldest U.S. Presidents

The GOP proposal “guts investments that are cutting energy costs"" for families, “powering a domestic manufacturing boom and delivering essential health care to the communities that need it most,'' said Lena Moffitt, executive director of the environmental group Evergreen Action.

The Republican move to loosen pollution standards “would mean more smog in our streets,” while cuts to environmental justice block grants “would force low-income communities to pay more for dirtier energy,"" she added. “Republicans are sacrificing clean energy on the altar of Big Oil to bankroll another round of tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy.""

Alexandra Adams, chief policy advocacy officer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the Energy and Commerce bill “gives polluters free rein to foul the air and water.” Cleaning up U.S. ports and reducing dangerous methane spewing from oil and gas wells have traditionally received bipartisan support, she said.

Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, said the moves would impact federal investments in domestic battery and mineral supply chain jobs.

“At a moment when our industry needs certainty more than ever, this legislation could slam the brakes on America’s progress towards global competitiveness in manufacturing, while ceding leadership to other countries,” he said.

The National Ocean Industries Association, which represents the offshore oil and wind industries, warned against what it called “premature repeal or phase-out of current tax credits.”

“Sudden changes to the tax code could inject significant uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, project planning and job creation” in offshore energy and the broader economy, said Erik Milito, the group’s president.

Climate programs targeted

The draft text from the Energy and Commerce committee would reclaim unused billions from several Inflation Reduction Act programs, repeal sections of the Clean Air Act and emphasize support for oil and gas drilling.

The plan also pulls back money for the Energy Department's multi-billion dollar loan program for clean energy, the Environmental Protection Agency's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund — commonly known as the “green bank” — and certain multistate and offshore wind development.

It would rescind funding for clean vehicles, loosen vehicle emissions standards and cut money for zero-emission port equipment and air pollution monitoring, while at the same time allow for an expedited permitting process — opposed by environmental groups — for natural gas drilling and increasing supply of the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

Republicans in the House Ways and Means Committee on Monday released their own proposal to repeal clean energy tax credits.

Proponents, including some Republicans, say credits boost demand for technologies, such as solar or electric vehicles, that reduce harmful emissions and help drive down their cost.

Under Trump, federal government agencies have bolstered fossil fuel investment, blocked renewable energy sources, rolled back landmark water and air regulations, cut support for electric vehicles and reconsidered scientific findings supporting climate action.

On May 12, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that it is amending the data submission period for the Toxic Substances Control Act’s (TSCA) per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) reporting rule to begin on April 13, 2026, and end on October 13, 2026. Small manufacturers reporting exclusively as article importers will have until April 13, 2027, to complete their reporting.

The interim final rule issued by the EPA states that the “change is necessary because EPA requires more time to prepare the reporting application to collect this data.” The interim rule also states that while the EPA is not making any other changes to the reporting rule at this time, it “is separately considering reopening certain aspects of the rule to public comment,” and the “delayed reporting date ensures that EPA has adequate time to consider the public comments and propose and finalize any modifications to the rule before the submission period begins.”

The interim final rule delaying the data submission period was published in the Federal Register May 13, 2025, and is effective immediately. However, the EPA is still accepting public comments on the interim rule for a period of 30 days.

In order to help parents, the Autism Alliance started a statewide grassroots coalition in 2021 made up of family advocates and attorneys who represent families in special education.","Sharon Kelso tries to do everything she can to help Detroit families navigate the often confusing and complicated world of special education.

The advocate is frequently on the phone, listening to parents complain that their child has yet to receive an individualized education program, or IEP, a plan that spells out what services and accommodations students with disabilities should receive, as required by federal law. Sometimes, families want her guidance for talking to teachers and school administrators.

She also gets calls from parents whose child has an IEP, but they need help.

“A lot of times I call the schools, have the parent come in, give their complaints, sit and look at the IEPs and work through them and try to help them as much as I can,” she said. “But I’m only one person.”

Kelso’s work highlights an issue that education advocates, school employees, and board members say has persisted for years in the Detroit Public Schools Community District and across the state: delays in conducting or complying with evaluations for special education services.

An IEP is a document for students with disabilities ages 3 through 25 that maps out educational needs and goals, as well as any programs and services a student’s school district will provide to help them, according to the Michigan Department of Education.

An initial IEP must be completed by a school and a notice provided to the parent within 30 school days after they provide consent for their child’s evaluation, according to the Michigan Department of Education’s Special Education Office. The timeline may be extended beyond those 30 days. DPSCD Superintendent Nikolai Vitti told BridgeDetroit that the process for Detroit’s district takes an average of 26 days.

James Stacy is among the Detroit parents seeking support. Stacy said he’s struggling to help his 13-year-old son, who is a sixth grader at Marquette Elementary-Middle School. Stacy enrolled his son at the east side school in 2023 and said he has run into issues ever since, particularly with school staff not complying with his son’s IEP and his son getting suspended.

Stacy said his son was a good student at his former school in the Berkley School District, where he received extra support in reading and math. But this school year, he is repeating the sixth grade and may not pass again because he does not have the support he needs for his learning disability, Stacy said.

Beyond the struggles with his schoolwork, Stacy’s son has been suspended three times this school year for behavioral incidents.

Stacy is now working with Kelso to arrange a formal review that addresses whether the behavior is caused by a disability and whether suspensions or an expulsion would be appropriate.

Stacy said he may pursue legal action against DPSCD if things do not improve for his son.

“I want to fight them (the district) holding him back because he didn’t have the support in place for him to succeed, and it’s done a number on him,” he said. “I hate to see my son hurting like this; he’s depressed. If I have to get a lawyer to bring a lot of things to light, that’s the next step for me.”

The district did not respond to questions about Stacy’s son or his IEP.

A statewide issue

Detroit school board member Sherry Gay-Dagnogo said delays with IEPs are mainly tied to staffing shortages. Students with disabilities make up nearly 14% of the population in DPSCD, and like many school districts across the nation, the Detroit district struggles to hire qualified special education staff.

DPSCD’s special education department is called the Exceptional Student Education Department. Staffing shortages came up during a January board meeting whereVitti reported that the district had 15 psychologist vacancies. In a recent email to BridgeDetroit, Vitti said the district has 31 full-time psychologists, 35 contracted psychologists and 17 vacancies.

While the district approved a teacher contract last year that provides an annual $15,000 bonus to new and current employees who support students with IEPs, Vitti said that it’s difficult to hire enough psychologists. The superintendent added that he has a plan to adjust the IEP process, but said details won’t be announced until sometime this spring.

“We’ve seen a bit of an increase in hiring by going up to $15,000 but I don’t know if a $15,000 bonus is even enough because the average psychologist can demand a very high wage, not only in the K-12 sector, but even more so the private sector,” Vitti said at the January meeting. “We have worked with universities to try to create pathways and internship opportunities, but the reality is that the IEP process requires a psychologist that’s mandated by federal and state law, and there’s no way around them.”

Heather Eckner, the director of statewide education for the Autism Alliance of Michigan, said IEP delays are a problem in school districts statewide and nationwide. The advocacy organization has a navigator program, which fields thousands of calls yearly from individuals with autism, parents and educators. Education issues are among those people call in about the most, Eckner said.

“A lot of times, it is questions and concerns in the education system around (the IEP) process and the steps in the process and the delays with it,” she said.

In addition, the Autism Alliance released its Special Education Experience Survey Report last October, which showed that the state’s special education system isn’t meeting the needs of students and families. Some of the top findings revealed that the workforce shortage is affecting students and that schools are not identifying disabilities early enough.

Eckner said she empathizes with school districts that are experiencing staffing shortages in special education, but she’s also seeing schools avoiding the IEP process by using “delay tactics.”

“For a lot of families, they report back to us that it almost feels like the evaluation plan was set up to not find the child eligible, like they don’t do as comprehensive of an evaluation as they could or should,” she said.

The evaluation delays persist amid President Donald Trump’s recent executive order aimed at shutting down the Department of Education, continuing a campaign promise to return education oversight to the states. Trump said that the Department of Health and Human Services would handle services for the 7.5 million students with disabilities in the nation. But many legal experts and advocates for children with disabilities say the president does not have the authority to shift oversight to another agency.

While Trump promised to preserve federal Pell grants for college students, funding for students with disabilities and Title I funding for schools in high-poverty communities, the firing of roughly 1,400 DOE employees could ultimately harm vulnerable children. This includes students with disabilities, children in poverty, children experiencing homelessness and English language learners, state superintendent Michael Rice, who is retiring later this year, told Bridge Michigan.

Special education advocate Marcie Lipsitt agrees that DOE cuts will impact students with disabilities, including the closing in March of the department’s seven regional Office for Civil Rights locations. The closings included the Cleveland office, which investigated violations of gender, race and disability-based discrimination in Ohio and Michigan.

Lipsitt has been an advocate for families across the country for 21 years and even longer for her family and friends, she said.

“I’ve had complaints sitting; parents haven’t heard from an attorney in months,” she said. “I’ve had mediations that were canceled with hours’ notice that have not been rescheduled. It’s (the federal changes) going to gut public education.”

Here’s what the IEP process look like

When it comes to an IEP request in DPSCD, a parent or district staff member may request an initial evaluation when a student is suspected of having a disability, according to district documents. When the request is made verbally, the school will support the parent in documenting it. Requests are then submitted to the school principal.

Within 10 school days of the request being submitted, the district’s school-based evaluation team must complete a review of the student’s educational record and other relevant information. When the review is completed, the team will evaluate if the request can move forward or if it will be denied. If it is denied, the parent will be notified in writing and receive an explanation.

When a request moves forward, the team will conduct a Review of Existing Evaluation Data (REED), and the parent is invited to participate. The REED is used to determine which evaluations are needed to diagnose the student with the correct disability.

Evaluations can include examining a student’s health, hearing, vision and communication skills. The evaluation team has 30 school days to complete the evaluation and create the IEP. The plan is reviewed at least once a year but can be adjusted when necessary.

Kelso said in her more than 30 years of being an education advocate in metro Detroit, she has seen kids receive the wrong IEPs, accommodations deviating from what was originally discussed or accommodations not being implemented at all.

“Some teachers’ reasons for why they don’t do them is because they feel it gives special ed kids an advantage over the other kids,” Kelso said. “…You’re trying to make them as equal as you can to the other kids to succeed.”

Lipsitt is also seeing Michigan districts not following IEPs, as well as children not receiving certain services like speech and occupational therapy.

One of the parents Lipsitt is helping includes Sheri King, who filed an Office of Civil Rights (OCR) complaint against DPSCD in September 2024. She said school staff repeatedly messed up the accommodations for her son, who’s a seventh grader at Mackenzie Elementary-Middle School.

King’s son, George Finley Jr., started having epileptic seizures a couple of years ago and experienced memory loss. Seizures can impact short and long-term memory, attention and multi-tasking as well as create language problems. Finley began receiving an IEP around the third grade and has had issues with schools complying with his plan, she said. King has made multiple complaints to DPSCD with Lipsett’s assistance over the years.

King and Lipsitt reached out to an attorney at OCR’s Cleveland office, and the attorney arranged a mediation between King and DPSCD last year. During the meeting, the district said they would provide outside tutoring aid for reading, Lipsitt said. However, King said that never happened, so her son is now seeing a tutor in Farmington.

Since the Cleveland office has shut down, Lipsett will have to refile the complaint with the OCR.

“The school’s not trying to do nothing,” King said. “They’re hoping that I forget. I keep asking them over and over, ‘When are you guys going to call these people so I can set up my son’s tutoring? When are you guys going to do this?’ If I didn’t have Marcie, I don’t know where I would be because she helps me out a lot.”

DPSCD officials said in response to King’s case that they “respect the challenges that all parents with students” with IEPs have.

The district said it will continue to “problem solve through the challenges they are facing to ensure their children succeed in school with the limited resources the District receives to educate each child with an IEP.”

Seeking solutions in Detroit

Gay-Dagnogo, the school board member, said some possible solutions the district should consider include seeking outside resources from the Merrill Palmer Skillman Institute at Wayne State University, which collaborates with families, children, and community partners to promote the healthy development and well-being of individuals. She also mentioned Michigan Rehabilitation Services, which develops customized workforce solutions for businesses and people with disabilities, and Wayne RESA, an agency that offers a wide range of services like special education to the school districts and public school academies in Wayne County.

“I’m not suggesting that these are all easy fixes or even possible, but I just think we have to explore ways that we might be able to share some level of services,” Gay-Dagnogo added.

Monique Bryant, another Detroit school board member, said the district should provide training for parents and guardians on navigating the assessment process so that they will have a clearer understanding of how the ESE department works. She added that there should be clearer communication between the district and parents on the timeline for an IEP.

“We need to better articulate what the expectations are, knowing that we have a shortage and then working with parents to navigate so that their students still receive the best possible classroom and educational experience that we can offer them,” Bryant said.

Another possible solution is making the special education space more equitable when it comes to parents advocating for their children, Eckner said. Many parents, like King and Stacy, face barriers within the school system because they are unaware of their rights or don’t have the “privilege, access, or money to really invest time into advocacy,” she said.

In order to help parents, the Autism Alliance started a statewide grassroots coalition in 2021 made up of family advocates and attorneys who represent families in special education. The group has almost 400 members, Eckner said.

“We’re trying to channel this collective advocacy movement to try to remove some of these barriers so that it doesn’t matter what your ZIP code is or what your household income is,” she said, “because that shouldn’t dictate whether or not a child gets access to the right kind of education support and services.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.bridgedetroit.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bridge-detroit-logo-small.jpg?fit=768%2C240&ssl=1,N,,2025-05-13 14:40:57.221546

House Speaker Mike Johnson has set a Memorial Day deadline to pass President Donald Trump’s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts, and the GOP has scheduled round-the-clock hearings this week on various sections of the bill before they are stitched together in what will become a massive package.

Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce panel, said his committee’s bill, unveiled Sunday, would return $6.5 billion in unspent funds intended for climate programs included in the 2022 law. In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, he said the plan “ends spending on Green New Deal-style waste” and claws back money “headed for green boondoggles” such as grants for environmental and climate justice.

“The legislation would reverse the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending in the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act,” Guthrie wrote.

The cuts to climate programs are part of a larger $880 billion in savings by 2034 proposed in the draft legislation that also covers communication and health-related policy, largely targeting Medicaid.

The cuts fit with Trump’s 2026 budget proposal, which looks to slash federal spending through a sweeping reorganization of federal agencies as well as steep cuts to disease research and, especially, clean energy and policies intended to address climate change. Congress ultimately decides the spending and tax plans.

In Trump’s first few months back in the White House, the administration has broadly gone after environmental and climate initiatives, many of which were put into place under the Biden administration, pledging to dismantle what Trump calls the Democrats’ “green new scam.”",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.tribtoday.com/images/2016/10/11191558/fblike.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 15:12:55.461278

Because of the exceptionally wide Republican majority on the Ways and Means Committee, and because many of the IRA’s more vocal Republican backers don’t sit on it, the draft that will go up for a vote today is probably in its most conservative iteration. It advances the phaseout of the wind and solar credits by three years relative to the IRA, and requires that they be operational by 2032, rather than merely under construction, to be eligible. Compared to the outright, immediate repeal a group of 38 House Republicans demanded this month, that’s not so bad.

The political animus many Republicans felt toward the IRA, as a manifestation of Biden’s “green new scam,” has been tempered by all the alarm bells that are now ringing about electricity shortages, which even US President Donald Trump has framed as a national “emergency.” Against that background, it’s less palatable to reflexively vote against tax incentives that put more electrons on the grid. Still, negotiations going forward will likely focus on the timing and the degree to which use of the credits should be constrained if the hardware contains parts from China or other problematic countries. It’s hard to imagine a bill reaching Trump’s desk in which the credits go unblemished.

“The goal for [Ways and Means committee chairman] Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.) is to cut enough from the IRA for conservatives, but still create a product that can potentially survive in the Senate. I think he’s gotten really close to the mark on that goal,” said Emily Domenech, senior vice president at the consulting firm Boundary Stone and former adviser to House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.).

Congressional Republicans, Domenech said, are more interested in solving the country’s energy problems through permitting reform than through spending taxpayers’ money. But it’s clear that if the solar and wind credits disappeared overnight, US power prices would jump up, because for most utilities renewables are the cheapest and fastest way to add power.

WASHINGTON — U.S. House Republicans plan to debate and approve the three final pieces of their “big, beautiful bill” in committee this week, including the tax measure, major spending cuts to Medicaid that will change how states run the program, and an agriculture bill.

The U.S. House will begin debate in committee this week on a bill that would cut Medicaid spending.

At least $880 billion over the next 10 years would be slashed under the piece of the bill that covers energy and health care, including from Medicaid. Republicans would add new Medicaid work requirements for some able-bodied adults; seek to penalize the dozen states that allow immigrants living in the U.S. without legal status in the program; and require states to more frequently check Medicaid enrollees’ eligibility, among other changes.

An estimate was not yet available for exactly how much that would save in Medicaid spending or how many people enrolled might lose coverage. Earlier projections of various other scenarios by the Congressional Budget Office had placed the number of displaced enrollees in the millions, and Democrats predicted the same effect from the newest plan.

House panels have already signed off on eight of the 11 bills that will make up the sweeping reconciliation legislation. And if all goes according to plan, that chamber should approve the entire package before the end of the month.

Debate is expected to begin Tuesday in each of the panels and last hours, possibly into Wednesday. Democrats will offer dozens of amendments seeking to change the bills and highlighting their disagreement with GOP policy goals.

Internal Republican disputes between centrists and far-right lawmakers over numerous tax proposals and funding changes to Medicaid will also likely lead to debate on GOP amendments.

With paper-thin majorities in the House and Senate, nearly every Republican needs to support the overall package for it to move through both chambers and to President Donald Trump.

If Republicans fail to reach agreement during the next couple months, it would put nearly every aspect of their agenda in jeopardy. GOP leaders would also need to negotiate a bipartisan debt limit agreement before the August recess, should the reconciliation package fall apart, since they plan to include debt limit language as well.

GOP divided over Medicaid cuts

Kentucky Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie, chairman of the committee that oversees energy and Medicaid, wrote in a statement last week announcing the markup that his panel’s measure would “end wasteful government spending, unleash American energy and innovation, and strengthen Medicaid for mothers, children, individuals with disabilities, and the elderly.”

But the bill released this weekend might not have support from far-right members in the House and seems to be running into opposition from some GOP senators as well.

Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy, of the hard right, wrote on social media that he hoped “House & Senate leadership are coming up with a backup plan…. ….. because I’m not here to rack up an additional $20 trillion in debt over 10 years or to subsidize healthy, able-bodied adults, corrupt blue states, and monopoly hospital ceos…”

Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, who has voiced concern for months about potential cuts to Medicaid, wrote an op-ed published in The New York Times on Monday highly critical of a “contingent of corporatist Republicans” who support lower federal spending on the program.”

“This wing of the party wants Republicans to build our big, beautiful bill around slashing health insurance for the working poor,” Hawley wrote. “But that argument is both morally wrong and politically suicidal.”

The entire House package will be open to amendment if the legislation makes it to the Senate, where several GOP lawmakers are expected to rework or even eliminate entire sections.

Work requirements

The Energy and Commerce Committee’s bill is the one that would cut federal spending by at least $880 billion during the next decade including on Medicaid, the state-federal health program for lower income people.

The legislation would institute work requirements nationwide for able-bodied adults between the ages of 19 and 65, with several exceptions, including for pregnant people, enrollees with certain disabilities or serious medical conditions, and parents of dependent children.

People not exempted from the requirements would need to work, engage in community service, or enroll in an education program for at least 80 hours a month.

A staffer on the panel told reporters during a background briefing Monday that Republicans tried to learn from challenges certain states had in the past when they implemented work requirements.

After discussions with current and former state Medicaid directors, the staffer said the committee wrote a bill that they are confident “states will be able to implement effectively.”

The work requirements take into account various unexpected circumstances, like if someone were to be hit by a bus and unable to complete the 80-hours-per-month requirement on time because they were hospitalized, the staffer said.

“We did try to be very thoughtful about any kind of circumstance that could happen,” they said.

Immigrant coverage, eligibility checks

The Medicaid legislation also seeks to encourage states that include undocumented immigrants in their program to stop doing so or lose some federal funding.

The federal government currently pays 90% of the cost of covering enrollees who are eligible for Medicaid under the 2010 Affordable Care Act expansion. That would decrease to 80% for the expanded population if states choose to keep covering undocumented immigrants.

The committee staffer said this would impact California, Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Utah, Vermon,t and Washington states if they don’t change their policies regarding undocumented immigrants.

Additionally, states would need to check eligibility for all of their Medicaid enrollees every six months, instead of once a year for the expanded population. This likely would lead to some people being kicked out of the program.

Committee staff members were unable to share exactly how each of the Medicaid provisions would affect the federal budget or how many people could lose access to the program if Congress were to implement the legislation as written.

But the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office wrote in a letter Monday that it estimates the Energy and Commerce Committee met its target of cutting at least $880 billion in spending “over the 2025-2034 period and would not increase on-budget deficits in any year after 2034.”

Staff on the committee said they don’t expect to have the full CBO score before the markup begins Tuesday and didn’t have an estimate for when that information will be out.

Energy and Commerce Committee Ranking Member Frank Pallone, D-N.J., wrote in a statement the GOP bill would lead to millions of people losing access to Medicaid.

“This is not trimming fat from around the edges, it’s cutting to the bone,” Pallone wrote. “The overwhelming majority of the savings in this bill will come from taking health care away from millions of Americans. Nowhere in the bill are they cutting ‘waste, fraud, and abuse’—they’re cutting people’s health care and using that money to give tax breaks to billionaires.”

Repealing clean-energy funds

The Republican proposal would repeal more than a dozen sections of Democrats’ 2022 reconciliation law related to energy and environment programs.

The law, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, included hundreds of billions in tax credits for renewable energy and energy-efficiency measures. It was considered the largest investment by the United States in tackling climate change.

The House bill would repeal sections including the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which helps finance clean-energy projects, and a $40 billion Department of Energy loan program meant to stimulate production of clean-energy infrastructure.

Sections targeting carbon emissions, air pollution, offshore wind transmission, and other programs would also rescind any unspent funds for those purposes appropriated in the Biden-era law.

The measure would allow pipeline builders to pay fees to bypass environmental review. Natural gas pipelines could pay $10 million to access an expedited approval process, and liquified natural gas exports could pay $1 million for the Energy Department to deem them “in the public interest.”

Rep. Kathy Castor, the ranking member on the Energy and Commerce Energy Subcommittee, said the proposal would sabotage efforts to drive down prices for consumers.

“Cleaner, cheaper energy for consumers gets left behind,” the Florida Democrat wrote in a statement. “Dismantling our landmark Inflation Reduction Act will kill jobs, hurt businesses, and drive up Americans’ energy costs.”

Tax cuts

The Ways and Means Committee released its 28-page starter bill late last week and the full 389-page version Monday afternoon, but Republicans on the panel could add to it during the Tuesday markup.

House GOP tax writers propose making the underlying 2017 tax law provisions permanent while temporarily expanding several of them, including the child tax credit and standard deduction.

The child tax credit would increase to $2,500, up from $2,000, until 2028. The refundable amount of the tax credit per child — meaning how much taxpayers could get back — would now reach up to $1,400. Taxpayers claiming the credit would now have to provide a Social Security number, as well as the SSN of a spouse.

The standard deduction for single and married joint filers would temporarily increase until 2029 up to $2,000, depending on filing status.

Trump’s campaign promises, including no tax on tips, also made it into the proposal, though only until 2028. Those claiming the tax break on tips will also need to provide a Social Security number as well as the SSN of their spouse, if married.

Trump’s promise to eliminate taxes on car loan interest, also set to expire in 2028, would not apply to any vehicle that was not finally assembled in the U.S.

Tax writers increased but ultimately left a cap on the amount of state and local taxes, commonly referred to as SALT, that households can deduct, an incredibly contentious issue for lawmakers with constituents in high tax areas like New York and California. GOP lawmakers increased the SALT cap to $30,000, up from $10,000.

That level, however, might not have the support needed among Republicans’ extremely thin majorities and will likely lead to heated debate during markup or on the floor.

Republicans from higher-tax states have repeatedly said they will not vote for the entire package unless they feel their constituents will benefit from raising the SALT cap.

The dispute has spilled over several times already, including in a statement last week from four New York Republicans, who wrote, “The Speaker and the House Ways and Means Committee unilaterally proposed a flat $30,000 SALT cap — an amount they already knew would fall short of earning our support.”

“It’s not just insulting—it risks derailing President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill,” they wrote. “New Yorkers already send far more to Washington than we get back—unlike many so-called ‘low-tax’ states that depend heavily on federal largesse.

“A higher SALT cap isn’t a luxury. It’s a matter of fairness.”

New York Republican Rep. Nick LaLota wrote on social media Monday afternoon: “Still a hell no.”

How much the tax proposal will cost has not yet been released, but government deficit watchdogs estimated a wholesale extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, without the enhancements, would cost north of $4 trillion over the next decade.

Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, said the proposal provides some certainty to individual taxpayers but it also adds complexity in many areas.

“You can clearly see the thinking here was probably just a straight-up extension (of the 2017 law), people wouldn’t feel like they got a tax cut because it’s just continuing. So they had to do something to make it feel like there’s a larger tax cut,” York said.

Ag cuts remain a mystery

The House Agriculture Committee, led by Pennsylvania Republican Glenn ‘GT’ Thompson, hadn’t released its bill as of Monday afternoon but was scheduled to begin the markup on Tuesday evening.

That panel is supposed to cut at least $230 billion in federal spending during the next decade, some of which will likely come from reworking elements of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.

Committee leaders are also planning to include elements of the much overdue farm bill, though those provisions could run into issues in the Senate if they don’t have a significant impact on federal revenue or spending.

Republicans are using the complex reconciliation process to move the package through Congress with simple majority votes in each chamber, avoiding the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster, which would otherwise require bipartisanship.

Reconciliation measures must address federal revenue, spending, or the debt limit in a way not deemed “merely incidental” by the Senate parliamentarian. That means the GOP proposals must carry some sort of price tag and cannot focus simply on changing federal policy.

The project is the company’s first large-scale installation in North America and is being conducted in partnership with FirstLight Power, which owns the plant.

The project follows earlier testing in spring 2024 at the Santee Cooper Hydroelectric Project in South Carolina. Both efforts aim to support migratory fish species such as American Shad and river herring, which are part of state and federal restoration programs.

For the first two to three years, the Fishheart system will operate at the Tunnel Hydropower Plant. If it performs successfully, the system may be moved to the Stevenson Hydropower Plant in Monroe, Connecticut, for permanent installation.

The purpose of the project is to test the Fishheart system’s ability to attract and guide fish safely past the hydropower facility. The system includes a floating fishway below the dam and a pipeline over the dam. It uses a siphon mechanism to create upstream attraction water that encourages fish to enter. According to Fishheart Ltd., this design reduces the need for permanent infrastructure and is more cost-effective and flexible than traditional fishways.

Fishheart systems have been in use at four river sites in Finland for several years. The company is also running a separate test project in Menindee, Australia.

The Connecticut project is being observed by agencies including NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. Approval from these agencies is necessary for the system’s future use in North America.

“For FirstLight, the long-term goal of the trial is to develop a successful, cost-effective solution for fish passage where it is required at its hydropower plants in North America,” the company said. It chose the Tunnel Hydropower Plant for initial testing because it is located on a small river with the presence of the target fish species, allowing for controlled testing conditions.

The incentives put in place by former President Joe Biden’s signature climate law have been ripe targets for lawmakers looking for trillions of dollars to help pay for extending Trump’s tax cuts. The president himself has had a bullseye on them, deriding them as part of the “green new scam.”

Under the Republicans’ proposal, a popular consumer tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of an electric vehicle would be fully eliminated by the end of 2026, and only manufacturers that have sold fewer than 200,000 electric vehicles by the end of this year would would be eligible to receive it in 2026, according to bill text. Tax incentives for the purchase of commercial electric vehicles and used electric vehicles would also be repealed, as well as a clean energy credit for homeowners that has benefited the residential solar market.

The electric vehicle incentive was expanded in Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act. Its cost is projected to balloon from an initial estimate of $12.5 billion made by the Congressional Budget Office in 2022. An analysis by consulting firm Capital Alpha Partners in March said the credit’s 10-year cost could total more than $200 billion.

Republicans are also proposing to eliminate a tax credit that provides as much as $3-per-kilogram for the production of hydrogen, a clean-burning fuel seen as critical for decarbonizing steel, cement and heavy transportation. Companies such as FuelCell Energy Inc. and hydrogen producer Plug Power Inc. have been closely watching the credits.

In addition, Republicans proposed repealing tax credit “transferability,” which allows a project sponsor to sell tax credits to a third party, for several of the credits, starting two years after the legislation becomes law.

But the draft legislation released Monday by House tax writers may not be as bad for producers of clean electricity from sources such as solar and wind, who feared a more aggressive phase out. First Solar Inc., the largest U.S. solar manufacturer, rose 11% on Monday. Sunrun Inc., the largest U.S. residential solar company, rose nearly 17%.

“The proposal is mostly a win for U.S. solar manufacturers and developers,” said Rob Barnett, senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “The fear is that the investment and production tax credits could have been gutted sooner.”

In the Republicans’ proposal, popular production and investment tax credits for clean electricity would be phased out by the end of 2031 and new requirements against using materials from certain foreign nations would be added.

Under the climate bill passed by Democrats in 2022, those credits weren’t set to expire until the later part of 2032 or until until carbon emissions from the U.S. electricity sector decline to at least 75% below 2022 levels, which analysts said would take decades. A tax credit for the production of nuclear energy would also be phased out by 2031 in the Republican plan.

House Republicans opted to keep other credits, such as an incentive for carbon capture that provides as much as $85 a ton and extended by four years an incentive that provides a per-gallon credit for makers of biofuels and other so-called clean transportation fuels based on the intensity of carbon production.

The legislation, which is set to receive a key vote by the House Ways and Means Committee later this week, is likely to be changed in the Senate.

Federal tax credits that benefit energy developers, manufacturers and utilities face an early phaseout in a budget proposal released Monday by a key GOP-controlled House committee.

The House Ways and Means Committee’s draft reconciliation package steps down the investment and production tax credits for nuclear power, wind, solar, batteries, geothermal and other clean energy technologies after 2028, and eliminates them completely after 2031. It preserves a comparatively generous credit for carbon sequestration and extends the clean fuels production credit.

Energy industry groups and customers slammed the proposal, saying it would raise electricity prices, quash a manufacturing boom spurred by the Inflation Reduction Act and erode the United States’ competitive advantage on artificial intelligence.

Dive Insight:

The Ways and Means budget gives clean energy developers and producers until 2028 to claim the full 45Y and 48E tax credits for clean energy investment and production. The credit values step down to 80% in 2029, 60% in 2030 and 40% in 2031 before zeroing out in 2032. A separate credit for nuclear power production would phase out on the same schedule.

As originally passed, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 allowed taxpayers to claim the full value of all three credits into 2032.

“While our industry is ready to engage constructively and find a workable path forward, the Committee’s approach simply goes too far too fast,” American Clean Power Association CEO Jason Grumet said in a statement. “With energy demand surging, this is not the time for disruption.”

The Ways and Means proposal also tightens eligibility for 45Y and 48E by requiring projects to be “placed in service” to qualify for the credit. The Inflation Reduction Act based eligibility on the year projects began construction, a more generous framework in a world where the timeline for grid interconnection and long-lead electrical equipment can stretch for years.

The placed-in-service requirement “severely crimps utility scale renewables” to the point that “the only projects that will get the full ITC and PTC are those already in the queue,” Advait Arun, senior associate for energy finance at the Center for Public Enterprise, said in an interview.

Clean energy advocates warned that the Ways and Means budget could disproportionately harm the “clean firm” technologies President Trump and House Republicans seem to favor, like advanced nuclear and geothermal.

“Some of America’s largest companies are attempting to advance critical new technologies like geothermal and advanced nuclear energy, but those technologies will not move forward if these tax credits are phased out,” Clean Energy Buyers Association CEO Rich Powell said in a statement. Powell’s organization represents major technology and industrial firms driving demand for clean electricity, such as Microsoft and Amazon.

A key nuclear power trade group whose April 30 plea to preserve key IRA tax credits attracted more than 100 signatories earlier this month said the Ways and Means budget would set back an industry critical to U.S. national security.

“Underlying conditions in the market have not changed and nuclear energy is not appropriately valued for its ability to provide reliable, secure, and affordable energy to an increasingly clean electric grid,” Michael Flannigan, vice president of governmental affairs at the Nuclear Energy Institute, said in a statement.

An early end to clean energy tax credits would compound the impacts of downsizing at the Department of Energy, particularly in the DOE Loan Programs Office and Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Arun said.

“If those [programs] are all going in the can, it will have just as much of an impact on the emerging technology landscape” as any changes to the tax code, he said.

A proposed two-year sunset of the IRA’s tax credit transferability mechanism could further curtail clean energy investment, Arun said. The IRA created a new pathway for project developers and asset owners with limited tax liability to raise capital by transferring tax credits — at a discount dependent in part on the deal’s perceived risk — to third-party buyers with greater tax liability.

The change would affect small and midsize clean energy developers the most, putting them at a disadvantage to incumbents closer to the big banks that dominate the more complex, gated world of traditional tax equity finance and have limited capacity to take on new clients, Arun said.

“Transferability is the biggest new development in clean energy markets … to shut that down will dry up a lot of the liquidity clean energy developers have been counting on,” he said.

On an earnings call last week, before Ways and Means released its draft budget, Sunrun Chief Financial Officer Danny Abajian said his distributed energy company would have to temporarily “[shift] how we source capital” were transferability repealed. But he said Sunrun could eventually benefit from a “flight to quality” in a tighter tax credit market.

Crux, an energy capital markets platform that has emerged as a key player in the nascent transferability industry, said in a subscriber email Monday that the Ways and Means proposal “is just the starting point and we anticipate that the final bill will take a more favorable stance on transferability and tax credits.”

Though both are subject to new restrictions on transferability and foreign ownership, the Ways and Means proposal treats the 45Q tax credit for carbon capture and sequestration and the 45Z credit for clean fuels production more favorably than the technology-neutral credits. The proposal maintains 45Q through 2032 and extends the 45Z credit through 2031, giving producers of biofuels like ethanol and sustainable aviation fuel four more years to claim it.

Hydrogen producers are not so lucky. The Ways and Means proposal eliminates the 45V credit for clean hydrogen production after this year, less than 12 months after the Treasury Department released final guidance.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/6sfGF4OzQ-ZaCl6Wt8X2lvf99GqpB5OUwVDdwg5FM00/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNzU0OTA3MjU3LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-05-13 14:35:07.857529

This is, of course, in reference to the $7,500 tax credit that has been available to buyers of new EVs as laid out by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The incentive helps close the cost gap between gas-powered vehicles and comparable electric vehicles, thus promoting the transition to more environmentally friendly EVs that don't produce any tailpipe emissions.

Some EVs are more compelling vehicles than their fossil fuel-powered, internal combustion engine (ICE) counterparts, but making Americans transition away from the only fuel source that most have ever used is a tough proposition. The tax credit can be the determining factor that makes consumers decide to go EV, but even with the tax credit, buying a brand-new EV might not be the smartest financial decision. EVs generally cost more than ICE cars upfront, but face steeper rates of depreciation than gas cars, so the prices of used electric vehicles are quite favorable. If the Trump administration revokes the EV tax credit, will it still be worthwhile to buy a new EV? In some cases yes, and some cases no. Here are some of the EVs that we think won't be worth buying new if the tax credit goes away.

If your budget is tight enough that you're concerned that the tax credit going away will put the Blazer EV above your price range, simply skip it. Chevrolet put itself in the unique position with the Blazer. The Equinox EV is a cheaper, slightly smaller but still family-sized electric crossover that will be a smarter choice for buyers who are concerned that the demise of the federal tax incentive will move the Blazer EV above their price range. I've driven both the Blazer EV and the Equinox EV, and I found the Equinox EV to be a more compelling choice.

The Equinox EV is only two-inches shorter than the Blazer EV, but it provides almost one cubic-foot more cargo capacity behind the second row of seats, and it provides less than one inch less rear legroom. Going for the cheaper Equinox doesn't mean sacrificing range, either. Equinox EV has a maximum estimated range of 319 miles, and Blazer EV's longest maximum range estimate is 334, so there's not a massive difference there, either. The cheapest Blazer EV you can buy starts at $44,600 before destination, and the Equinox EV starts at $33,600.

It's no secret that the various antics of the richest man on Earth and Tesla's CEO Elon Musk has single-handedly ruined his company's public image in recent months. If you must buy a Tesla, and you're concerned about losing the $7,500 federal tax incentive, you'll be happy to know that Teslas have some of the worst resale values of any vehicles on the used market. That means you can find killer deals on used Teslas. Alternatively, if you're in the market for a new electric vehicle, other automakers produce vehicles that are on this list that offer superior alternatives to a Musk mobile. Alternatives like the Hyundai Ioniq 5, Chevrolet Equinox EV, Blazer EV, Ford F-150 Lightning, and Kia EV9 are all great choices that don't put money into the pockets of the richest man on the planet. Some new EVs, like the Ioniq 5, even come from the factory with a NACS port, which means they have direct access to the Tesla Supercharger network. If you're concerned that the disappearance of the federal EV tax credit will make a new Tesla too expensive, either buy a used one and save big time, or buy from a different, less problematic brand.

If you're in the market for a General Motors-produced full-sized electric pickup truck and you're concerned about losing the help of the $7,500 federal tax incentive, then you should skip over the GMC Sierra EV. For the same reason as we recommend skipping the Blazer EV and going for the cheaper Equinox EV, if budget is your primary concern, skip the GMC Sierra EV and go for the cheaper Chevrolet Silverado EV.

For the 2026 model year, GMC introduced a new base Sierra EV Elevation that starts at $64,495. The federal tax incentive only applies to vehicles with manufacturer suggested retail prices (MSRPs) below $80,000, so no 2025 GMC Sierra EVs qualify since the truck is only offered in its extra fancy and expensive Denali top trim. If you're budget-focused and are worried about losing the $7,500 federal tax incentive, then you should consider the Chevrolet Silverado EV. The Silverado EV Work Truck trim starts at $57,095 including a $2,095 destination charge, so it's $7,400 cheaper than its GMC sibling. The numbers align almost perfectly; if you're worried about the $7,500 tax incentive on a GMC Sierra EV Elevation, buying a Silverado EV Work Truck saves you $7,400.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/these-cars-wont-be-worth-buying-if-the-ev-tax-credit-goes-away/l-intro-1747078137.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:42:35.589782

Stevenson said that she believes the seat is within reach for Democrats despite GOP Rep. Andy Barr’s recent landslide victories.
“I know how to win in a red seat,” Stevenson said in an interview with the Herald-Leader about the race.

The way she won her seat and flipped it in 2018 is that she knocked every single door,” Roberts said.","Former Lexington state representative Cherlynn Stevenson is running to flip the 6th Congressional District from red to blue in 2026, she announced Tuesday.

Stevenson said that she believes the seat is within reach for Democrats despite GOP Rep. Andy Barr’s recent landslide victories.

“I know how to win in a red seat,” Stevenson said in an interview with the Herald-Leader about the race.

So, how is it done? Stevenson said she’ll focus on aggressive in-person campaigning and hammering home the “meat and potatoes” issues of prices, education and health care.

A predicted backlash to the policies of President Donald Trump, whose undulating tariff strategy has stirred uncertainty and even discontent on Wall Street, is central to her argument. The available polling on Trump’s approval rating has been declining steadily.

“I think people are really scared by the chaos that they’re seeing in Washington right now,” she said.

“You know, we see tariffs that are hurting our local economies and threatening a lot of jobs. We see people that are worried that the Social Security benefits aren’t going to be there, that Medicaid and Medicare are in danger. You know, a carton of eggs cost more, and people’s nest eggs have gone down.”

Stevenson added: “I think that the environment is going to be right for somebody who’s out there not trying to talk about the things that divide us, but about the real issues that Kentucky families and working families are facing right now.”

But while Stevenson, 48, won her seat three times, she lost on the fourth effort to Rep. Vanessa Grossl, R-Georgetown, last year.

Grossl flipped the seat — which stretches across much of suburban and rural Fayette County as well a slice of Scott County — winning by about half a percentage point two years after Stevenson won reelection by an even slimmer margin.

Republican Party of Kentucky Communications Director Andy Westberry pointed the loss out in a statement on Stevenson’s candidacy.

“Cherlynn Stevenson must be a glutton for punishment. After getting rejected by voters in her own backyard, she’s now aiming higher—only to fall harder. Her entry into this race isn’t a serious campaign; it’s a one-way ticket to political career-ending humiliation.

“Let’s be clear: the 6th District is Trump Country —rock-solid Republican ground where liberal pipe dreams go to die,” Westberry wrote.

Indeed, Trump won the district by about 15 percentage points. Ever since a close three-point victory over Democrat Amy McGrath in 2018, Barr has won his last three elections by an average of 24 percentage points.

But Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, albeit with a different off-year electorate, won the district by about 20.

And Stevenson’s pledge to focus on the “real issues” over the divisive ones sounds a lot like Beshear’s classic pitch to voters, both in Kentucky and more recently on the national stage.

So where does Beshear stand on Stevenson’s run? She said she spoke to the governor before making her announcement, and he was “encouraging,”

“He was encouraging. We talked about the fact that I have been able to win in difficult districts. You know, he has endorsed me in every other race that I’ve ever been in, and I look forward to earning his endorsement this time,” Stevenson said.

She did not say whether she believed his endorsement would come during the primary for the seat.

A handful of other Kentucky Democrats have been mentioned as possibilities for the seat, especially since the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee listed the Central Kentucky-based district as one of their 35 Republican-held “Districts in Play” for the 2026 cycle.

Federal prosecutor Zach Dembo and former Lexington councilman David Kloiber are two names to watch; former secretary of state Allison Lundergan Grimes is also mentioned as a potential candidate.

Fayette County makes up about 44% of the district.

The other counties in the 6th Congressional District, in order of population, are Madison, Scott, Jessamine, Montgomery, Woodford, Mercer, Bourbon, Garrard, Fleming, Estill, Powell and Nicholas. Aside from Fayette, the other counties in the district generally lean Republican.

Stevenson’s background

When asked about her elevator pitch to voters, Stevenson gave a glimpse of how she feels her background – moving to the Lexington area from Eastern Kentucky, as many residents have – might help her.

“I was raised in Eastern Kentucky by a mom who was a teacher and a daddy who worked in coal and I know the values of hard work, and I know you know the struggles that everyday Kentuckians face, that I am not someone who Is there to represent a political party, but I am there to represent the people and take their hopes, their dreams and their worst fears to Washington and to fight for them,” Stevenson said.

Stevenson was raised in Knott County but has lived in Lexington for several years. She first ran for office and flipped the 88th House District in 2018. She won a close race in 2020, then won again by just 37 votes in a tight race to Republican Jim Coleman.

In Frankfort, Stevenson rose the ranks quickly to become House Democratic caucus chair four years into her time there. She was widely seen as a strong candidate for floor leader, the highest position in the caucus, before her loss.

Stevenson was the subject of a short-lived controversy last year due to an ethics complaint filed against her. The complaint centered around her co-purchasing a Frankfort condo with a lobbyist. It was swiftly dismissed by the Legislative Ethics Commission.

Stevenson’s political calling card has been education. She pushed back strongly against 2024’s pro-school choice amendment, which would have allowed the state legislature to fund charter and non-public K-12 schooling.

Stevenson represented the “anti” side on the amendment question at Fancy Farm, the state’s biggest political speaking event, in 2024.

The amendment ended up losing by a whopping 30 percentage points.

At the event

On Tuesday morning, Stevenson made her announcement public in front of television cameras and more than 50 supporters in Midway.

The setting was intentional. Stevenson held the event at Bluegrass Distillers, a bourbon distillery just off the I-64 exit. Tariffs have been top of mind for the industry, as bourbon has previously been in the crosshairs of retaliatory tariffs levied by other countries against the United States.

Her podium was set up inside the distillery with a row of bourbon barrels lined up behind her. Open garage bay doors behind Stevenson revealed a landscape of verdant Kentucky fields.

“We need economic policies that put working people first and take on billionaires rigging the system, not tariffs that risk sending us into another Great Depression. It’s time for trade policies that benefit Kentucky workers, families and our country,” Stevenson said. “We all want more American jobs, but these tariffs are hurting us right here at home. Bourbon is being taken off the shelves around the world.”

Stevenson’s speech covered a lot of territory, but some of the top items hammered on were GOP-backed health care spending cuts, tariffs and opposition to tax breaks benefiting the wealthy.

After her speech, she said she was against one of the GOP’s top priorities this year: extending the tax cuts implemented by the Trump-backed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

“We should not be giving billionaires a tax cut at the expense of veterans (and) families who depend on Medicaid and Medicare for their health care,” Stevenson said.

On foreign policy, Stevenson offered a glimpse of where she stands on some of the biggest issues of the day, like the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza.

“I support Ukraine and their ability to be able to defend themselves, and I think the United States has a role to play in trying to keep peace and protect democracy around the world,” Stevenson said.

While Democrats have been generally in agreement about Ukraine, the party line is less clear on the conflict in Israel and Palestine, which was kicked off by the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, that ended in nearly 1,200 people killed in Israel, many of them civilians. Israel’s response has led to tens of thousands of Palestinian deaths, with the Palestinian Health Authority estimating more than 50,000 dead.

“What happened back in October was horrendous, and the atrocities happening in the region need to stop. There are a ton of innocent people and children dying and starving to death, and and that really needs to come to an end,” Stevenson said. “We need peace in the Middle East and innocent lives have to be protected. Israel has the right to defend itself, but not at the expense of starving people and killing children.”

Stevenson supporters included a handful of Frankfort colleagues alongside community members.

Former state representative Rachel Roberts, a Northern Kentuckian who served in leadership alongside Stevenson, said that Stevenson was “absolutely the person” to flip the district because of her work ethic and the current political environment.

“Nobody worked harder than her. The way she won her seat and flipped it in 2018 is that she knocked every single door,” Roberts said. “As someone who ran as a Democrat in the state several times, she was always the high bar that the rest of Democrats running would try to meet as far as every door knocked and voter outreach. She will do the work.”

Rep. Adrielle Camuel, D-Lexington, a close ally of Stevenson, agreed. She said that one of Stevenson’s biggest assets was her personality.

“Anybody who has had a minute to talk with Cherlynn knows that she is as genuine as they come. She’s the real deal,” Camuel said. “Her passion for Kentucky, for the 6th District, but also everyone in Kentucky to try and improve life — when you talk to her, you know that’s who she is.”

That all depends on Slate’s successfully navigating a treacherous path for electric vehicle start-ups.
All are small cars or S.U.V.s, including the market’s lowest-price car, the $18,300 Nissan Versa.","When Slate Auto, a start-up, unveiled a roughly $25,000 electric pickup truck last month, social media lit up with comments. Many people saw the no-frills vehicle, with an easy-to-repair body and nostalgic hand crank windows, as a refreshing antidote to today’s overstuffed and increasingly unaffordable cars.

How unaffordable? Average monthly payments on new cars have soared to $739 in March from $537 in January 2019, according to Cox Automotive. The average new car costs $47,400, with electric models around $59,200. High interest rates, now around 9.4 percent for a 72-month loan, have made cars even more of a financial stretch.

“Prices and interest rates are both high and stuck,” said Mark Schirmer, director of industry insights for Cox Automotive. “If you haven’t been in the market since 2018, it’s got to be shocking what a car costs.”

President Trump’s tariffs of 25 percent on imported cars and parts have consumers scrambling to buy before prices rise even more. Cars that cost less than $30,000 are especially vulnerable — nearly 80 percent of those are subject to tariffs. They include consumer staples like the American-made Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla, which rely on imported parts. Supplies of budget models are expected to shrink, and automakers may stop importing certain models entirely.

Enter Slate, a company based in the Detroit suburbs backed by venture capital firms and Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder.

Chris Barman, a former Fiat Chrysler engineer and Slate’s chief executive, said the Slate Truck was expressly designed to ease sticker shock, although it won’t be available until late 2026. The company plans to produce the pint-size truck at a retrofitted printing plant in Indiana, with a capacity for 150,000 a year.

True to its name, the truck is designed to be a blank slate to which buyers can add more than 100 accessories, like power windows and heated seats, as their budgets allow or needs change. There is no built-in stereo or touch-screen display, but there are docks for phones or tablets, saving money and avoiding the digital obsolescence that often plagues auto entertainment and navigation systems.

“We think hardworking Americans are looking for good value for the money,” Ms. Barman said in a recent interview.

That message appealed to Liv Leigh, 41, who hopped inside a Slate Truck during its public debut at the Long Beach Airport in California in April. Ms. Leigh, a biomedical designer and electric-car enthusiast, paid $50 to reserve a Slate.

She watched the company’s employees transform the two-seat pickup into a five-passenger sport utility vehicle in about one hour, with a clever conversion kit aimed at do-it-yourself owners. Ms. Leigh appreciated the truck’s tidy size, shorter than a Civic, and its modest 150-mile range.

“I love the idea of an absolute base, beater truck, where I can stick a dog or muddy bikes or plywood in back,” Ms. Leigh said. “I don’t need a giant vehicle to haul stuff.”

Ms. Barman said efficient design and production were key to the company’s promised low prices. The truck’s gray plastic-composite body panels eliminate any need for a steel body-stamping plant or paint shop, which can cost automakers many millions of dollars.

“That all keeps costs down, but also feeds into giving customers freedom of choice,” Ms. Barman said. “They can outfit the vehicle the way they want it, not the way a manufacturer has designed it.”

Slate hopes that a U.S.-based supply chain, including batteries made by SK On, a South Korean company, will make the pickup eligible for a $7,500 federal tax credit. Republican lawmakers on Monday released a budget bill that would eliminate that incentive and dismantle other Biden-era climate and energy policies.

That all depends on Slate’s successfully navigating a treacherous path for electric vehicle start-ups. Several young automakers, including Fisker, Nikola and Canoo, have sought bankruptcy protection and shut down.

With or without subsidies, Slate has a viable business plan, Ms. Barman said.

The company hopes to price its truck in the mid-$20,000s before government incentives, which would undercut the Nissan Leaf, which is the most affordable electric car at $29,300 but no longer eligible for tax credits. Chevrolet plans to offer a redesigned Bolt S.U.V. by year end for roughly $30,000. The General Motors brand intends the Bolt to qualify for the tax credit, dropping its effective price to roughly $22,500.

Erin Keating, the executive analyst of Cox Automotive, praised the Slate Truck’s ingenuity. But she said a pickup with two seats, short range and a bare-bones interior might not appeal to American car buyers who have grown accustom to having many tech and creature comforts.

“There’s nothing wrong with trying to crack the affordability crisis, but I don’t see this as a massive volume seller,” Ms. Keating said. “Ultimately, this is an extremely small E.V. with almost nothing in it, in a market with a growing number of affordable choices with much longer range.”

The Ford Maverick is a potential rival that may argue for or against Slate’s prospects. That compact pickup is two feet longer than the Slate. It seats five passengers and offers many more features. A hybrid version can reach 40 miles per gallon and travel more than 500 miles on a full tank.

Ford sold 131,000 Mavericks last year, suggesting there is strong demand for small, energy-efficient trucks. The company has raised the starting price of the hybrid version of the truck by $4,200 since 2024, to $28,150, including an increase last week that Ford Motor acknowledged was partly a response to tariffs on the truck, which is assembled in Mexico. The company said it was not passing on the full cost of the tariffs to customers and would offer all of its cars for the same price it sells them to employees until early July.

As much as any vehicle category, America’s pickup trucks epitomize how cars have changed over the last several decades, mostly by becoming bigger, more powerful and a lot more expensive. Some lavish pickups can cost as much as large European luxury sedans. Electric trucks from Tesla, Rivian and Ford range from $70,000 to more than $100,000.

One big challenge for Slate, or other companies hoping to sell more affordable cars, is that despite what they say they want, many Americans don’t seem to buy such cars.

Ms. Keating noted that roughly two dozen models on the market start at less than $25,000. All are small cars or S.U.V.s, including the market’s lowest-price car, the $18,300 Nissan Versa.

Nearly every midsize family sedan starts at less than $30,000, including the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and Hyundai Sonata. But many Americans have rejected those cars in favor of bigger vehicles. S.U.V.s, pickups and minivans now account for more than 80 percent of the market.

Mr. Trump’s trade policies remain a wild card. Analysts expect tariffs will add thousands of dollars to the prices of new cars and drive up the demand and prices for used cars.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/06/multimedia/00biz-affordable-cars-01-fpqg/00biz-affordable-cars-01-fpqg-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:35:50.196265

The company said it would put the plan to build the EV supply chain in Alliston, Ont. — first announced with great fanfare by Canadian politicians in April 2024 — on hold for about two years.

""Due to the recent slowdown of the EV market, Honda Motor has announced an approximate two-year postponement of the comprehensive value chain investment project in Canada. The company will continue to evaluate the timing and project progression as market conditions change,"" Honda Canada spokesperson Ken Chiu told CBC News in an email statement Tuesday.

Honda also said the decision ""has no impact"" on current employment or production at the Alliston manufacturing facility.

Honda's EV project in Canada includes a retooled assembly plant, an electric vehicle battery plant in close proximity, as well as two key battery parts facilities located elsewhere in Ontario.

The project was expected to see the two main plants create 1,000 jobs on top of retaining the existing 4,200 jobs at the assembly plant.

Under the original plan, the plant was set to produce up to 240,000 vehicles per year when fully operational in 2028.

The project was first announced in April 2024 at an event that included then-prime minister Justin Trudeau and Ontario Premier Doug Ford and was to receive support from the federal and Ontario governments.

Ottawa was set to give the Japanese automaker around $2.5 billion through tax credits, while Ontario committed to provide up to $2.5 billion in support directly and indirectly.

Ford told reporters at a news conference that he was confident Honda would continue making cars in the province.

""When I talked to Honda, they promised us they're going to continue on with that expansion,"" Ford said of the pause. ""So we'll just see how that moves forward. But we're very confident that we'll continue producing Honda vehicles here in Ontario.""

The premier also said he would hold automakers that pull out of Ontario ""accountable,"" should that happen.

Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association, said Tuesday's decision shows how U.S. tariffs continue to be felt in the auto industry.

""We hope to find a solution for Canada soon that restores the confidence Honda had when it made its historic EV expansion decision here,"" Volpe wrote in an email statement.

Tariffs and smaller appetite for EVs having an impact

In reporting its latest financial results Tuesday, Honda Motor Co. said its profit for the financial year through March fell 24.5 per cent from the previous year and warned that U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs will worsen its earnings.

The Tokyo-based automaker said its annual profit totalled 835.8 billion yen (around $8 billion Cdn), down from 1.1 trillion yen in the previous year. Annual sales edged up 6.2 per cent to nearly 21.69 trillion yen (around $205 billion Cdn).

Officials stressed major uncertainties remain, but said they felt it was important to give a realistic projection, no matter how pessimistic it might be.

Chief executive Toshihiro Mibe said Honda will do its best to minimize the impact from tariffs. In the long term, Honda will transfer auto production to U.S. plants and rethink its investment plans. All decisions will be made ""very carefully,"" Mibe told reporters.

David Adams, president and CEO of Global Automakers of Canada, says that while tariffs were a factor in today's announcement, the slower than expected uptake of EVs also likely played a big role.

""Is electrification moving forward? Sure, it is. Are consumers continuing to buy EVs? Yes,"" Adams said. ""But we're not seeing the sort of [rapid] uptake of EVs that ... environmentalists and some in government anticipated.""

Despite that, Adams says EVs are still the way of the future — he says trillions have been spent globally to transition from traditional internal combustion engines to battery electric instead, and carmakers won't simply walk away from those commitments. ""But those investments might not just come to fruition as quickly as maybe originally anticipated.""",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7533439.1747140984!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/canada-economy.JPG?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-05-13 14:35:53.079236

“What inspires me most about working at the Detroit Zoo and the Nature Center is the opportunity to witness those ‘aha’ moments.","Detroit Zoo in Royal Oak, Michigan, is known for its forward-looking methods in animal care, engaging visitor experiences, and commitment to worldwide conservation efforts.

Visited by 1.3 million people annually, the AZA-accredited facility is operated by the Detroit Zoological Society, which also oversees the Belle Isle Nature Center.

Blooloop speaks to Randi Hamilton, chief experience officer at Detroit Zoo, about how the attraction is helping guests connect with nature, understand environmental issues, and make positive changes to protect the world around us – all while enjoying a fun day out.

Detroit Zoo’s mission

Speaking about what drives the Detroit Zoo team, Hamilton says:

“Our mission, vision, and values speak to the heart of who we are. Our purpose is to ignite positive change for animals and nature, and our mission is to do that by creating meaningful connections for people, animals, and the natural world. It all ties together, and we use that as our guiding principle, our filter for decision-making.

“We put a lot of intentionality into the decisions we make, the programmes we produce, and the experiences we work to develop.”

The team cares for over 2,000 animals representing over 200 species on a 125-acre campus at the zoo.

“It’s a big, beautiful space for our community to connect, not only with nature but with each other. On top of that, we focus heavily on animal well-being and educational initiatives, tying all that together to create unique connections that build empathy. That contributes to how people see us as a credible, mission-driven organisation.”

The zoo is also known for its transparency and fiscal responsibility, she adds:

“We’re well rated with our GuideStar participation as far as our charitable organisation status is concerned. Another exciting aspect is our economic impact. More than $167 million annually is contributed to the local economy through our operations. We also have a huge membership base, which contributes to why we’re so special and have such a loyal following, with more than 42,000 member households.

“Those individuals are the ones that keep us going and are a big part of why we’re here.”

A meaningful guest experience

When it comes to curating the guest experience, Hamilton says that, for a modern zoo, this work should be about shaping something intentional and meaningful for visitors.

“With such a broad audience, there are many ways to do that, and that’s what makes it exciting. I see my role as an absolute privilege, especially getting to work with our team’s incredible talent and passion. We approach things from every angle, thinking about members, long-term giving audiences, the next generation, and how they view the zoo.”

Creating experiences that are meaningful and genuinely immersive, allowing people to connect in a way that works best for them and that can inspire while still being inclusive, is critical for the Detroit Zoo team, she adds:

“It doesn’t matter whether someone is attending a keeper talk or a fundraising event; if they feel welcome and connected, we’ve done a good job.

“What we hope is that the experiences we create now can ignite action, whether that’s someone taking what they’ve learned and sharing it, changing something in their own home, starting to compost, building a rain garden, or contributing to a global animal relief fund.

“Anything we can do that creates a connection for someone, in a way that’s meaningful to them, is really what brings joy to my day.”

Education and entertainment go hand in hand at Detroit Zoo

Yet, there can be a challenge in balancing this educational element of the experience with the need to entertain.

“It’s tricky, but on the other hand, for us, it’s a very welcome challenge,” says Hamilton. “Because in our minds, it doesn’t have to be either fun or education. To us, they’re all intertwined.

“We’re very mindful of our audiences. We get a lot of input from them and lean on their feedback. Also, we rely on studies to better understand how people learn and what will make things stick, so to speak.”

For Detroit Zoo, it’s about designing hands-on experiences that elevate the stories; storytelling is critical. “That’s the stuff people remember. Those are the things they take away.

“Maybe it’s connecting someone to a memory they’ve had or a story that was important to them and then relating it to a story we’re sharing. The more we can create those kinds of opportunities, ones that are meaningful and approachable, the more I think people will take away about what they can do to support the natural world.”

Storytelling meets conservation

Recent examples of the zoo’s programming include initiatives that combine outdoor play with storytelling around wildlife conservation. “This past season, we had Wildlife Rescue [pictured, top], which was a climbing experience featuring small animal climbers spread throughout our campus,” says Hamilton.

“It was tactile and fun for kids, a great photo opportunity for families and visiting groups. But it also shared important stories about each animal, whether it was an orangutan or a red panda.”

These stories weren’t just displayed; there was an in-person encounter aspect, too, she adds: “We partnered with our education team and our volunteers to host pop-up interactions throughout the zoo. Guests could walk up during their visit and learn directly from our team.

“We also shared these stories online, allowing people who couldn’t visit in person to engage with the content and understand its conservation messages.”

This year, the zoo is launching Dragon Forest, an immersive, three-acre experience trail centred around dragons and mythical creatures.

“It’s a fun, imaginative way to connect people with nature. The idea is that nature has long influenced myth and storytelling, and this space lets guests explore that relationship. There are opportunities to climb, touch, smell, and listen to sounds within the space. There will be storytelling flowers, fairy gardens, and other elements that link to the flora and fauna of the area.

“It’s another creative way to inspire curiosity and connection.”

Accessibility at Detroit Zoo

Other guest experience innovations that Detroit Zoo is introducing include ReBokeh, an assistive technology tool designed for guests with visual impairments.

“It’s often used in museums, but we’re one of the first zoos to use it this way,” says Hamilton. “It enhances engagement with our interpretive signage and natural spaces, helping guests experience the zoo in a more accessible and meaningful way. We’re excited to roll that out.”

“We’ve also developed new mobile apps and are incorporating augmented reality on campus in different ways. We’re also expanding our engagement schedules at the zoo and the Nature Center so guests can plan for a more elevated experience, whether learning from our keepers, participating in special activations, or engaging beyond the traditional daytime visit.”

Conservation at home and abroad

Conservation is at the heart of everything that Detroit Zoo does.

“One of the things we continuously focus on is how we tell those stories because there is just so much happening, and we’re always looking for ways to elevate that,” says Hamilton.

“We have many programmes, not only in our backyard but also on all seven continents, all of which are critical. From a local perspective, we’re very active in rescuing and releasing piping plovers. Just recently, in 2024, we reached a milestone. I believe the total is now 17 piping plovers successfully hatched and released back into the wild, which is exciting.”

“We have team members who travel to Peru to support planting fruit trees, building connections with local communities, providing science education, delivering supplies, and helping with access to clean water resources.

“In the Falkland Islands, we’ve contributed to important penguin research — work that also informs what we do here at home in our Polk Penguin Conservation Center.”

“We’ve also made strides with our Partula snail conservation efforts. We recently did another release, and to date, we’ve helped return around 1,000 Partula snails to the wild in partnership with other zoos and organisations. We’re very proud to be part of that collaborative effort.”

Overall, Detroit Zoo participates in 12 AZA SAFE programmes. This stands for Saving Animals From Extinction and is an initiative spearheaded by AZA, the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. The zoo has numerous team members actively engaged, whether through boots-on-the-ground fieldwork, research support, or both.

Engaging the local community

Closer to home, the zoo team also works hard to engage its local community. With a strong membership base, it is a beloved institution for many who live nearby.

“Not only do we host opportunities here on the zoo grounds and at the Nature Center, but we also find ways to invite people to join us in other programmes out in the community,” says Hamilton.

“We’ve done everything from volunteering to community support. For example, we have a programme with The Greening of Detroit, where we participate in tree plantings throughout the city. We share those opportunities with our member base and invite them to join us.”

“We also take part in a number of community engagement events with other local organisations, where we can celebrate and elevate their mission alongside ours.”

Each year, Detroit Zoo hosts more than 72 ticketed and non-ticketed events that align with its mission. Member perks are tied to many of those events, from early access to exclusive experiences.

“From a membership standpoint, not only are they informed about opportunities in advance, but there are also many ways to get involved. We take their feedback seriously and always look for ways to continue enriching that relationship with our members.”

Sustainability

Sustainability is increasingly important for all types of visitor attractions, but at Detroit Zoo, it is embedded into operations, says Hamilton:

“Just like conservation and animal well-being are part of our planning process, sustainability is another essential element. We’re always asking: what are the sustainable factors we must consider? How will this impact the animals around us? If it’s a physical product being installed, what are the implications, and what are the stories or explanations we need to share with our guests?

A perfect example is Discovery Trails, which is opening in 2026.

“It’s a seven-acre site, and within that space, we’ll have 12 rain gardens, all planted with native species. We’ve put much thought into ensuring that our stormwater management process complements the new infrastructure, particularly because we’re part of a significant watershed area.”

“That watershed is critical to our region, so we feel it’s crucial to walk the walk, not just talk the talk when it comes to sustainability.”

The zoo also invests in the minds of the future, she adds:

“Our Tri-County Green Schools programme supports student-driven green initiatives in local school districts as part of our Green Prize programme. We help support their innovation and ideas for the future, and each year, we celebrate the winning schools here at the zoo.

“It’s a great way to infuse our practices into the broader community, from what we do on-site to how we support renewable energy. We’ve worked hard to reach 100% renewable electricity for our operations.

These efforts reflect the zoo’s commitment to being more than just a destination: “We aim to be a hub for the community and a catalyst for collective action around sustainability and the protection of the natural world.”

Inspiring the next generation at Detroit Zoo

One of the key responsibilities of a good modern zoo is to inspire the next generation to care about the planet around them.

“What we do know, especially with how people are receiving information today, is that the stories we tell need to be authentic, transparent, and purposeful,” says Hamilton. “They need to spark thought and, hopefully, inspire action.”

For Detroit Zoo, it’s about ensuring it tells stories with a long-term impact.

“We want to go deep enough to create real understanding, the “why” behind what we do. That also means pulling back the curtain. When we share all the exciting aspects of working with animals or highlight innovations, we also need to show how we got there. What’s the journey, and what insights did we gain along the way?”

It’s also important to consider where and how to share those stories, she adds: “Are we using the right platforms? Are we reaching people where they are in a way that resonates? Because that’s how we’ll make the greatest impact.

“It’s about creating open, welcoming conversations. Yes, there’s scepticism. Some people question the relevance of zoos today. But for us, it’s really about our responsibility to help people understand nature, why it matters and what role we play in ensuring it thrives into the future.”

The team tries to meet scepticism not with defensiveness but with honest dialogue. “We want to understand why someone might think a certain way and then meet them there in conversation.

“These are complex issues. How do we distil all that complexity into something palatable and understandable? Because it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. We don’t want people to feel defeated before they even get started. Instead, it’s about helping people take one step at a time.”

Discovery Trails

Looking to the future, Detroit Zoo will launch Discovery Trails in 2026.

“We’re very excited for Discovery Trails,” says Hamilton. “It’s the most expansive new experience in the history of the Detroit Zoo.

“Last year, we launched a new visual identity and brand in May 2024, which aligned with a refresh of our key commitments and core values. It brought our mission back to the forefront, and Discovery Trails will be the first significant expression of the future we’re working toward.”

“Every team here has played a critical role in creating environments that are not only innovative but deeply mission-driven. This space will feature new species we’ve never had before and the return of some species that haven’t been part of the zoo for a long time.

“There’s a lot of innovation in how visitors will experience these habitats, not just through animal encounters but also through meaningful connections to actions they can take to make a difference.”

The project also includes new amenities, entertainment features, and accessible experiences designed to be welcoming to all. This includes a wheelchair-accessible tree trail, an interactive goat yard, and opportunities to engage with stingrays and bamboo sharks.

“There will also be a strong art component, with installations by local artists and our team members. Overall, Discovery Trails will be a versatile, immersive experience that reflects the heart of who we are and where we’re headed.”

A passionate team

Finally, reflecting on her role and what inspires her about the work, Hamilton says:

“One thing people don’t realise about the zoo and aquarium world is the incredible talent and passion that runs through the entire organisation. So many different disciplines and career paths can be realised here, beyond what most people might expect.

“When I first joined, I was amazed by everything that contributes to achieving our exceptional goals, from storytelling to funding to care services. It’s a unique and special environment filled with people deeply committed to our mission.

“There are also many opportunities here, not just in traditional roles but also in science and hospitality fields, making zoos and aquariums a great place for a wide range of careers.

“What inspires me most about working at the Detroit Zoo and the Nature Center is the opportunity to witness those ‘aha’ moments. Whether it’s a group connecting, a child bonding with an animal, or an engaging interaction with a keeper, seeing the joy on people’s faces fills my heart.

“Those moments, whether it’s a realisation or laughter, mean we’re doing our job. They leave with a meaningful memory, potentially even creating a core memory that they’ll carry with them.

“We know that visitors find a sense of tradition here, and the legacy I hope to help build is one of authentic connection and shared purpose. I want our legacy to foster empathy alongside innovation, ensuring that people always feel welcome, included, and enriched, no matter the size of their experience.

“Above all, I hope they leave with a more profound compassion for nature.”

A powerful ridge of high pressure has built up over the continent, with a strong southerly flow amplifying high temperatures this week as it drags up a hot, dry, air mass. Environment and Climate Change Canada and the National Weather Service in the US have both issued heat alerts across their respective countries due to how extreme the temperatures are for the time of year.

Temperatures are set to soar nearly 19C above the seasonal average in southern Manitoba, with some models suggesting daytime maxima in Winnipeg could reach 36C on Tuesday. Tropical nights – those where temperatures do not fall below 20C – are likely for the city, with the overnight lows currently forecast to stay around 21C.

Remarkably, just three days later, on Friday, daytime maxima are set to plummet nearly 30C, with daytime temperatures expected not to exceed 7C.

In Texas, the heat is forecast to peak on Wednesday, with widespread record-breaking temperatures above 40C (104F), 11-13C above the average for the time of year.

Austin, the state capital, has a climate record spanning back to 1891, of which the record high temperature in May was recorded in 1925, at 104F (40C); some forecast models are hinting that the record is likely to be broken on Tuesday and Wednesday, when temperatures could hit 108F (42.4C).

San Antonio also looks likely to smash its current record of 104F (40C). While this record was set more recently, in 2004, temperatures are forecast to extend the record by a large margin, potentially reaching 109F (43C).

Fort Worth, in the north-east of the state, could experience 106F (41C) on Wednesday too, but this would be just shy of the 1927 May record of 107F (41.6C). It will however, beat the date record for 14 May, which currently stands at 95F (35C) set in 1955.

Central and north-western Europe are unlikely to have significant rainfall this week, edging closer to widespread drought conditions after such dry and warm weather through the late winter and spring so far.

Soil moisture indices are showing that many places are currently at the “permanent wilting point”, meaning available water in the soil has been exhausted leading to plants permanently wilting. It is not only widespread at the surface, but also seeping through the deeper layers of the soil, meaning that those plants with tap-root systems and trees will begin experiencing drought stress as the deeper soil moisture reserves dwindle.

High pressure is expected to remain dominant over the next couple of weeks, blocking the arrival of frontal systems from the Atlantic that would give much-needed rainfall.",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8b331c3af3394d4fdd6a0a81de76622f726a818/314_0_4593_3675/master/4593.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bc7f65c1574a474fc4577e1e43229698,N,,2025-05-13 14:45:51.765146

Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce panel, said his committee’s bill, unveiled Sunday, would return $6.5 billion in unspent funds intended for climate programs included in the 2022 law.
“The legislation would reverse the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending in the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act,” Guthrie wrote.

Republicans in the House Ways and Means Committee on Monday released their own proposal to repeal clean energy tax credits.","WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans are calling for billions of dollars in funding cuts for Biden-era climate and environmental programs, including clean energy tax credits, as lawmakers seek to reverse what one GOP leader called “the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending” approved under former President Joe Biden.

Environmental groups warned the proposals would pave the way for more oil and gas industry activity on public lands and increase planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.

The House committees on Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means are set to discuss the plans Tuesday as part of the so-called budget reconciliation process. Several moves are aimed at clawing back billions in spending authorized by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, a Democratic measure intended to slow climate change and boost clean energy such as wind and solar power.

House Speaker Mike Johnson has set a Memorial Day deadline to pass President Donald Trump’s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts, and the GOP has scheduled round-the-clock hearings this week on various sections of the bill before they are stitched together in what will become a massive package.

Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce panel, said his committee’s bill, unveiled Sunday, would return $6.5 billion in unspent funds intended for climate programs included in the 2022 law. In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, he said the plan “ends spending on Green New Deal-style waste” and claws back money “headed for green boondoggles” such as grants for environmental and climate justice.

“The legislation would reverse the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending in the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act,” Guthrie wrote.

The cuts to climate programs are part of a larger $880 billion in savings by 2034 proposed in the draft legislation that also covers communication and health-related policy, largely targeting Medicaid.

The cuts fit with Trump’s 2026 budget proposal, which looks to slash federal spending through a sweeping reorganization of federal agencies as well as steep cuts to disease research and, especially, clean energy and policies intended to address climate change. Congress ultimately decides the spending and tax plans.

In Trump’s first few months back in the White House, the administration has broadly gone after environmental and climate initiatives, many of which were put into place under the Biden administration, pledging to dismantle what Trump calls the Democrats’ “green new scam.”

Groups decry the proposals

The GOP proposal “guts investments that are cutting energy costs” for families, “powering a domestic manufacturing boom and delivering essential health care to the communities that need it most,” said Lena Moffitt, executive director of the environmental group Evergreen Action.

The Republican move to loosen pollution standards “would mean more smog in our streets,” while cuts to environmental justice block grants “would force low-income communities to pay more for dirtier energy,” she added. “Republicans are sacrificing clean energy on the altar of Big Oil to bankroll another round of tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy.”

Alexandra Adams, chief policy advocacy officer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the Energy and Commerce bill “gives polluters free rein to foul the air and water.” Cleaning up U.S. ports and reducing dangerous methane spewing from oil and gas wells have traditionally received bipartisan support, she said.

Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, said the moves would impact federal investments in domestic battery and mineral supply chain jobs.

“At a moment when our industry needs certainty more than ever, this legislation could slam the brakes on America’s progress towards global competitiveness in manufacturing, while ceding leadership to other countries,” he said.

The National Ocean Industries Association, which represents the offshore oil and wind industries, warned against what it called “premature repeal or phase-out of current tax credits.”

“Sudden changes to the tax code could inject significant uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, project planning and job creation” in offshore energy and the broader economy, said Erik Milito, the group’s president.

Climate programs targeted

The draft text from the Energy and Commerce committee would reclaim unused billions from several Inflation Reduction Act programs, repeal sections of the Clean Air Act and emphasize support for oil and gas drilling.

The plan also pulls back money for the Energy Department’s multi-billion dollar loan program for clean energy, the Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund — commonly known as the “green bank” — and certain multistate and offshore wind development.

It would rescind funding for clean vehicles, loosen vehicle emissions standards and cut money for zero-emission port equipment and air pollution monitoring, while at the same time allow for an expedited permitting process — opposed by environmental groups — for natural gas drilling and increasing supply of the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

Republicans in the House Ways and Means Committee on Monday released their own proposal to repeal clean energy tax credits.

Proponents, including some Republicans, say credits boost demand for technologies, such as solar or electric vehicles, that reduce harmful emissions and help drive down their cost.

Under Trump, federal government agencies have bolstered fossil fuel investment, blocked renewable energy sources, rolled back landmark water and air regulations, cut support for electric vehicles and reconsidered scientific findings supporting climate action.

Then, as now, the Trump administration’s plan was to repeal rules whose repeal would deliver the greatest cost savings.

Amending or repealing regulations that do not provide a net benefit to the American people is a laudable goal, but informing the decisionmaking process will require careful analysis that uses transparent methodology.

During an analogous deregulatory push during the first Trump administration, researchers at Resources for the Future developed a methodology, based on transparent economic analysis, for what we can call regulatory repeal impact assessment (RRIA). This analysis of a proposed repeal would differ from a regulatory impact assessment (RIA), which happens before a regulation goes into effect and aims to evaluate whether that new regulation is likely to produce benefits greater than its costs. The purpose of RRIAs would be to inform EPA’s decisions about which rules are not delivering net benefits to the American people and therefore should be repealed (other things equal), and which rules are delivering net benefits and should be kept on the books (other things equal). We applied this methodology across multiple regulations, described in our full Should It Stay or Should It Go series of studies back in 2018. This type of approach is relevant as more repeals are on the table in the second Trump administration, which prompts a summary of this approach for evaluating repeals along with some key lessons learned.

If: EPA wants to repeal regulations that do not benefit the American people on net,

Then: the agency must implement a structured analysis to identify and assess the regulations that are being considered for repeal.

Methods

In our prior work, we showed a critical distinction between considering the net benefits of a regulation versus only considering its costs, as the administration wants to do. Depending on which criterion gets used in RIAs, prioritizing regulations for reconsideration can lead to completely different recommendations for which rules to repeal.

In 2018, we completed six full RRIAs on energy regulations that we thought could be considered for repeal by the first Trump administration. Then, as now, the Trump administration’s plan was to repeal rules whose repeal would deliver the greatest cost savings. As noted, cost savings alone is not a proper criterion for repealing rules, which requires looking at both cost savings and forgone benefits. The more comprehensive approach of considering both cost savings and lost benefits even follows Circular A-4 as put forward by the Office of Management and Budget in 2003—guidance on regulatory analysis which has been endorsed by the second Trump administration. In our analysis of the six energy rules, we addressed the discrepancy in methodology by assessing the cost savings across the six rules compared to their net benefits.

The figures below, reproduced from our 2018 report, show how big a difference these two metrics would make in prioritizing which rules to repeal. (Note that differing assumptions for two of the rules led us to consider eight rules in total.) Figure 1 from the report shows that every rule ranks in a different order of priority for repeal, depending on which criteria are used in an RRIA.",https://media.rff.org/images/shutterstock_2605378245.width-600.png,N,,2025-05-13 14:38:37.346370

Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is expected to hold a news briefing at 12:45 p.m. EDT. Watch live in the video below.

The House Ways and Means Committee named its package “THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL” in all capital letters, a nod to Trump himself. It seeks to extend the tax breaks approved during Trump’s first term — and boost the standard deduction, child tax credit and estate tax exemption — while adding new tax breaks on tipped wages, overtime pay, Social Security benefits and auto loans that Trump promised during his campaign for the White House.

There’s also a tripling of the state and local tax deduction, called SALT, from $10,000 up to $30,000 for couples, which certain high-tax state GOP lawmakers from New York and California already rejected as too meager. Private universities would be hit with hefty a new tax on their endowments, as much as 21 percent, as the Trump administration goes after the Ivy League and other campuses. And one unusual provision would terminate the tax-exempt status of groups the State Department says support “terrorists,” which civil society advocates warn is a way to potentially punish those at odds with the Trump administration.

Overall, the package is touching off the biggest political debate over taxes, spending and the nation’s priorities in nearly a decade. Not since 2017 has Congress wrestled with legislation as this, when Republicans approved the Trump tax cuts but also failed to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. The cost assessments are only preliminary, and expected to soar.

“Republicans need to UNIFY,” Trump posted on social media before departing for a trip to the Middle East.

Trump said when he returns to Washington, “we will work together on any and all outstanding issues, but there shouldn’t be many — The Bill is GREAT. We have no alternative, WE MUST WIN!”

READ MORE: White House to reveal Trump’s 2026 budget, expected to reduce or eliminate many federal programs

But one key Republican, Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, implored his party not to impair Medicaid, arguing that cutting health care to pay for tax breaks is both “morally wrong and politically suicidal.”

“If Republicans want to be a working-class party — if we want to be a majority party — we must ignore calls to cut Medicaid and start delivering on America’s promise for America’s working people,” Hawley wrote in The New York Times.

Late Monday, the House Agriculture Committee released its proposals — cutting $290 billion from federal nutrition programs, in part by shifting costs to the states and requiring able-bodied adults without dependents to fulfill work requirements until they are 64 years old, rather than 54, to qualify for food aid.

Round-the-clock work ahead

As Republicans race toward House Speaker Mike Johnson’s Memorial Day deadline to pass Trump’s big bill, they are preparing to flood the zone with round-the-clock public hearings starting Tuesday and stitch the various sections together in what will become a massive package.

The politics ahead are uncertain. The bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation said Monday that tax breaks would reduce revenue by $4.9 trillion over the decade — and that was before Trump’s new tax breaks were included.

Texas Rep. Chip Roy, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, warned the price tag could climb to $20 trillion, piling onto the deficits and debt.

WATCH: Rep. Chip Roy says GOP leaders need to ‘show us the math’ in tax cut, Medicaid talks

“I sure hope House & Senate leadership are coming up with a backup plan,” Roy posted on social media, “…. because I’m not here to rack up an additional $20 trillion in debt over 10 years.”

House Republicans have been huddling behind closed doors, working out final provisions in the 389-page tax portion of the package.

The legislation proposes to boost the standard deduction many Americans use by $2,000, to $32,000 per household, and increase the child tax credit from $2,000 to $2,500 for four years. It adds a new requirement focused on preventing undocumented immigrants from benefiting from the credit even if the children are U.S. citizens, which the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, estimates would affect 4.5 million children who are U.S. citizens or lawful residents.

It would also increase the estate tax exemption, which is now $14 million, to $15 million and index future increases to inflation.

WATCH: People with disabilities explain how Medicaid cuts could impact their lives

As for the president’s promises, the legislation includes Trump’s “no taxes on tips” pledge, providing a deduction for those workers in service industry and other jobs that have traditionally relied on tips. It directs the Treasury secretary to issue guidance to avoid businesses gaming the system.

The package also provides tax relief for automobile shoppers with a temporary deduction of up to $10,000 on car loan interest, applying the benefit only for those vehicles where the final assembly occurred in the United States. The tax break would expire at the end of Trump’s term.

For seniors, there would be a bolstered $4,000 deduction on Social Security wages for those with adjusted incomes no higher than $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for couples.

But one hard-fought provision, the deduction for state and local taxes known as SALT, appears to be a work in progress. The legislation proposes lifting the cap to $15,000 for single filers and $30,000 for couples, but with a reduction at higher incomes — about $200,000 for singles and $400,000 for couples.

“Still a hell no,” wrote Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., on social media.

Battle over Medicaid, food aid

Meanwhile, dozens of House Republicans have told Johnson and GOP leaders they will not support cuts to Medicaid, which provides some 70 million Americans with health care, nor to green energy tax breaks that businesses back home have been relying on to invest in new wind, solar and renewable projects.

All told, 11 committees in the House have been compiling their sections of the package as Republicans seek at least $1.5 trillion in savings to help cover the cost of preserving the 2017 tax breaks, which are expiring at the end of the year.

The final section from the Agriculture Committee proposed cutting the Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program, known as SNAP, by expanding work requirements, limiting future expansions of the program and forcing states to shoulder more of the cost.

WATCH: People with disabilities explain how Medicaid cuts could impact their lives

Along with new work requirements for older Americans, it would also require some parents of children older than 7 to work to qualify, down from 18 years old. Only areas with unemployment rates over 10 percent would be eligible for waivers.

Some Republicans have already balked at the increased costs to the states, which be required to contribute at least 5 percent of the cost of SNAP allotments beginning in 2028.

At the same time, the legislation would invest $60 billion in new money for agriculture programs, sending aid to farmers.

On Sunday, House Republicans on the Energy and Commerce Committee unveiled the cost-saving centerpiece of the package, with at least $880 billion in cuts largely to Medicaid to help cover the cost of the tax breaks.

While Republicans insist they are simply rooting out “waste, fraud and abuse” to generate savings with new work and eligibility requirements, Democrats warn that millions of Americans will lose coverage. In the 15 years since Obamacare became law, Medicaid has only expanded as most states have tapped into federal funds.

A preliminary estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by 8.6 million.

To be eligible for Medicaid, there would be new “community engagement requirements” of at least 80 hours per month of work, education or service for able-bodied adults without dependents. People would also have to verify their eligibility to be in the program twice a year, rather than just once.

There are substantial cuts proposed for green energy programs and tax breaks, rolling back climate-change strategies from the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act.

The project is being pushed through as a ""utility"" despite not meeting the state's legal definition, bypassing public comment and zoning approvals.

Residents are protesting the project's potential strain on resources, including water consumption and energy usage, and its impact on agricultural land.

In the final days of the legislative session, language was added to a bill and passed before anyone in the public could look at it and learn more. That bill provides a massive tax incentive package to create a 267-acre data center in our county. No one asked us if we wanted such a noisy, environmentally destructive monstrosity. They knew not to ask. We would have told them no. And now, we are.

Through a series of open records requests we have obtained, we have learned that the powers that be have made the unilateral decision that a data center is a “utility,” which means they think the project can proceed without public comment or planning and zoning approval. Unfortunately, this blatant attempt at bending the law is being exercised on land that is zoned for agricultural use. The attorney on the case at a high-powered law firm is single-handedly making this assumption. She doesn’t live here. And she’s not one of us, but she’s gathering billable hours at our expense every day.

Data centers are springing up all over the country, and in almost every case, they are being shoved down the people’s throats with the same playbook they’re using here. No community wants a data center on prime agricultural land that can never return to its state once they start pouring concrete all over the county. They are associated with devastating environmental impacts, including alterations to important ecosystems as a result of the noise and light pollution and emissions they chug out. Further, they use vast amounts of water to cool their systems, because, well, they use a lot of energy. LG&E would love to sell it to them with their local monopoly. And a large data center can gobble up to 5 million gallons of water each day.

A data center is not a public utility

State law (KRS 278.010) makes absolutely no allowances for “data centers” as utilities, and as they provide nothing to the public, that makes sense. To be considered a utility, per state law, the project would have to generate energy “to or for the public.” We find that a stretch.

We, the people, have told our elected leaders we are opposed to the project. We have raised our voices at fiscal court meetings, at coffee shops and at community meetings. They think they can slide this under the rug and get it done before anyone notices.

We’ve noticed. We are unhappy with the lack of concern from the people elected by us to represent our interests. We call on them to speak up on our behalf now, before it’s too late.

Trump calls on Fed to cut rates, saying prices of 'practically everything' are down

Donald Trump has repeated his call for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, saying prices for gas, groceries and “practically everything else” are down, while also repeating his criticism of Fed chair Jerome Powell.

He wrote on Truth Social:

No Inflation, and Prices of Gasoline, Energy, Groceries, and practically everything else, are DOWN!!! THE FED must lower the RATE, like Europe and China have done.

What is wrong with Too Late Powell? Not fair to America, which is ready to blossom? Just let it all happen, it will be a beautiful thing!

As my colleague Lauren Aratani reported earlier, officials at the Fed feel that while the pace of inflation has slowed, they expect Trump’s tariffs to have an impact on prices, even if only temporary. Economists also expect price increases to get worse this year. Many companies have not had to increase prices yet, as many of the goods being sold now were imported before the new tariffs were implemented.

“Certainly the risks to higher inflation [and] higher unemployment have increased,” Powell said at a press conference last week, adding that tariffs could delay inflation from reaching the Fed’s target rate of 2% by at least a year. “We would, at least for the next, say, year, not be making progress toward those goals if that’s the way tariffs shake out.”

This is contrary to what Trump has been saying about tariffs and the impact they have had on prices. Trump insists that any inflation is a holdover from the Biden administration, though Trump has been in the White House for over three months.

Trump to 'say hello' to Syrian president Ahmed al-Sharaa in Riyadh on Wednesday - Axios

Donald Trump is expected to greet with Syrian president Ahmed al-Sharaa in Riyadh on Wednesday, Axios is reporting, citing two sources familiar with the plan.

Earlier in a pivotal announcement, Trump said he was lifting all sanctions on Syria to “give them a chance at greatness”, less than six months after the brutal regime of Bashar al-Assad was rapidly toppled.

Axios reports that, asked by journalists earlier if he expects to meet with al-Sharaa during his visit to Saudi Arabia, Trump replied: “Yes, I think so.” A White House official later told Axios:

The president agreed to say hello to the Syrian president while in Saudi Arabia tomorrow.

But this makes it no less significant. Per Politico:

It’s nonetheless a striking encounter with a man who’s still on the US terrorist list — and the first meeting between US and Syrian leaders since 2000. The US sanctions have weighed heavily on the Syrian economy, threatening al-Sharaa’s ability to rebuild the country since the rebel leader ousted the Assad regime five months ago.

Trump said during his speech at the US-Saudi investment forum that he had decided to lift sanctions on Syria following conversations with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as well as with Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. “Oh, what I do for the crown prince,” Trump said in reference to MBS before making the announcement.

The “brutal and crippling” sanctions had served their purpose at the time but were no longer needed, said Trump, adding:

Now it is their time to shine. We are taking them all off. Good luck Syria. Show us something very special.

In a further sign of normalizing US-Syria relations, Trump said his secretary of state Marco Rubio will meet with the Syrian foreign minister on Thursday in Turkey.

Key takeaways from Trump's keynote address in Riyadh

Trump pledged to remove all sanctions against Syria, saying they had served an important function, but it was now time for the country to move forward. He said: “I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness. It’s their time to shine. We’re taking them all off. Good luck Syria, show us something very special.” His secretary of state Marco Rubio will meet with the Syrian foreign minister in Turkey on Thursday, Trump said.

Rubio will be going to Turkey on Thursday to attend the Ukraine-Russia talks, Trump said, adding: “The talks could produce some good results.”

Trump called Iran the “most destructive force” in the Middle East and threatened that if the US’s “olive branch” to reach a nuclear deal is rejected “and [Iran] continues to attack their neighbors then we’ll have no choice but to inflict massive maximum pressure”. He reiterated that Iran can’t have a nuclear weapon. “The choice is theirs to make,” Trump said, adding: “This is not an offer that will last forever.”

Trump announced that his Middle East tour will add $1tn in investment to the US. In addition to the Saudi purchase of $142bn of US military equipment announced earlier, Trump said there will also be this week multibillion dollar commercial deals with Amazon, Oracle, AMD, Uber, Johnson & Johnson and others.

Trump said he hopes Saudi Arabia will “soon” join the Abraham Accords, a series of normalization agreements between Israel and Arab countries, but said they would do it in their own time.

US tech firms secure AI deals as Trump tours Gulf states

A swath of US technology firms announced artificial intelligence deals in the Middle East as Donald Trump announced $600bn in commitments from Saudi Arabia to American companies during a tour of Gulf states.

Reuters reports that among the biggest deals was a set signed by Nvidia, which said it will sell hundreds of thousands of AI chips in Saudi Arabia, with a first tranche of 18,000 of its newest “Blackwell” chips going to Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund-owned AI startup Humain. Cisco on Tuesday said it had signed a deal with G42, the AI firm based in the UAE, to help the company develop that country’s AI sector. The deals will flow both ways.

The White House said Saudi Arabian firm DataVolt will invest $20bn in AI data centers and energy infrastructure in the US. Alphabet’s Google, DataVolt, Oracle, Salesforce, Advanced Micro Devices and Uber will invest $80bn in cutting-edge transformative technologies in both countries, the White House said, without giving further details. Cisco said it had reached an agreement with UAE’s G42 “to assess the potential” to work together on cybersecurity technologies that use US AI as well as AI data centre technologies.

Trump plans to visit the UAE on Thursday. The New York Times on Monday reported that the Trump administration is nearing a deal to allow UAE to buy large volumes of Nvidia’s AI chips.

Saudi Arabia, which is seeking to make its economy less dependent on oil revenue, aims to position itself as a hub for AI and a leading centre for AI activity outside the United States. Crown prince Mohammed bin Salman on Monday launched Humain, a company to develop and manage AI technologies in Saudi Arabia.

The two companies said they will leverage Nvidia’s platforms to establish Saudi Arabia as a global leader in AI, GPU cloud computing and digital transformation.

“The biggest and most destructive force [in the Middle East] is Iran which has caused unthinkable suffering in Syria, Lebanon, Gaza, Iraq, Yemen and beyond,” he says.

I want to make a deal with Iran. But if Iran’s leadership rejects this olive branch and continues to attack their neighbors then we’ll have no choice but to inflict massive maximum pressure,” he says.

He adds he’ll drive Iranian oil exports to zero.

“Iran will never have a nuclear weapon,” Trump goes on.

“The choice is theirs to make,” he says, adding: “This is not an offer that will last forever.”

Trump says he hopes Saudi Arabia will “soon” join the Abraham Accords, a series of normalization agreements between Israel and Arab countries.

“It would be a special day in the Middle East with the whole world watching when Saudi Arabia joins us, and you’ll be greatly honoring me and you’ll be greatly honoring all of those people that have fought so hard for the Middle East,” he says.

He says it’s his “fervent hope” that Saudi Arabia would “soon” sign its own normalization agreement with Israel, adding:

But you’ll do it in your own time.

In addition to purchases of $142bn of US-made military equipment, Trump says there will also be this week multibillion dollar commercial deals with Amazon, Oracle, AMD, Uber, Johnson & Johnson and more.

“With this trip, we’re adding over $1tn more in terms of investment into our country and buying our products,” he says.

On domestic US politics, Trump says that the newly unveiled tax legislation is well-positioned to pass, following the release of the House Republicans’ tax plan details yesterday.

“I’m pleased to report that the United States Congress is on the verge of passing the largest tax cut and regulation cut in American history ... that will be like a rocket ship for our country,” Trump says.

Superior said the loss of contracts from “larger North American OEM customers"" following the end of the quarter, after President Donald Trump announced 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum Feb. 10.

“We will not give up and we will continue to pursue recovery of these customers given the recent tariff dynamics,” Superior CEO Majdi Abulaban said on an investors call Monday.

The company also said it is withdrawing its 2025 fiscal year guidance ""due to the uncertainties related to the current macroeconomic environment as well as the lost volume from certain customers.""

Despite tariffs challenging the automotive industry, Superior sees them as an opportunity for growth, Abulaban said in the statement.

“As the broader industry trends towards supply chain localization, global tariff dynamics have exacerbated the urgency from OEMs to localize production in region and seek more cost-effective manufacturing partners in both North America and Europe,” he said. “More than ever, our competitively advantaged local for local manufacturing footprint in Mexico and Poland is creating opportunity.”

Abulaban said Superior has seen “unprecedented” requests for quotes levels in the last four months “driven by accelerating localization momentum by our OEM customers in response to tariffs.”

The contract losses resulted in a liquidity restraint, according to the statement. Superior made an agreement with its term loan lenders in which it will gain access to up to $70 million of additional loans under its existing agreement, assuming it meets milestones and implements governance changes.

Abulaban said in the statement that the measures “are designed to enable the company to mitigate the impact of the abrupt loss of volumes while supporting continued growth with existing customers and new customers across North America and Europe.”",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/cd20250513-Superior%20Industries-Google-Screenshot.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:41:08.056739

At that same forum, Paul also said ""everything has to be looked at"" when it comes to reducing costs — including Medicaid.

U.S. House Republicans put forward a plan this week that would cut spending on Medicaid, though hurdles remain before it is approved.

Increased tariffs will cause prices at stores around the nation to rise, U.S. Sen. Rand Paul warned after a roundtable with Louisville business leaders Monday. But they aren't the only threat to your wallet, he said.

Speaking to reporters at Greater Louisville Inc.'s downtown headquarters, the Kentucky Republican continued his call for President Donald Trump to pump the brakes on his proposed worldwide tariffs, while expressing support for lowering spending on Medicaid and other programs.

The senator's comments on Medicaid came a day after Republicans on the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee released a proposal to cut spending on the health care program that covers nearly 1.4 million Kentuckians and more than 70 million people nationally. The plan — touted by committee chair and fellow Kentuckian U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie in an interview with the Wall Street Journal — would tighten up Medicaid eligibility and add work requirements for many able-bodied recipients, among other changes.

The proposal faces more hurdles ahead of full approval, and Guthrie said negotiations would continue, predicting it will face the most opposition from far-right Republicans seeking deeper cuts.

Democrats on the committee have said the bill would take an estimated 8.6 million people off the Medicaid rolls by 2034, according to a letter published late Sunday night.

The plan aims to save the federal government hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of the next decade, as the Trump administration works to cut costs across the board. And Paul said the proposed cuts are ""not as simple as people want to make it out.""

Medicaid, he said, is one several high-cost entitlement programs — including Medicare and Social Security — that need more scrutiny.

""Everything has to be looked at,"" he said. ""It isn't, 'Oh, you desire to kick people off Medicaid.' No, I want to get people on Medicaid jobs. I want to get them jobs with insurance. The way you do that, though, is you have to have some rules.""

Paul signaled support for work requirements, which were approved in Kentucky by the Republican-dominated state legislature during the most recent legislative session. While the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy has noted just over 50% of Kentuckians on Meidcaid are working but still qualify for the coverage because they don't make enough, the senator said many of those job providers don't want to provide insurance to their employees because the government is offering it.

""I can ensure Kentuckians that if we do not address the entitlement shortfall there will be a massive deficit,"" Paul said. ""The deficit will be financed through printing of money by the federal reserve that buys our debt, and then they will see higher prices at the store.""

Democrats have taken aim at potential cuts to Medicaid, including U.S. Rep. Morgan McGarvey of Louisville, who spoke in support of the program in the House Budget Committee meeting last week and argued cuts at the federal level would require states to increase funding, ultimately leading to ""a massive hole in Kentucky's budget.""

In a Monday social media post, Gov. Andy Beshear called the House committee's plan ""mean, cruel and wrong."" On a call with several other Democratic governors last week, he said significant cuts would be an ""attack on rural America"" that could cause local hospitals to close, affecting both employment and health outcomes across the commonwealth.

Some in the GOP have spoken up as well, including Republican U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who called cutting health insurance for low-income workers ""morally wrong and politically suicidal"" in a May 12 op-ed in the New York Times.

Paul spoke only briefly Monday about Medicaid but had more to say about Trump's tariffs, which have rocked the international stock market.

Like fellow Kentucky U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, he's been outspoken against the president's tariff decisions. Paul forced a vote in the Senate on a measure aimed at striking down the tariffs last month, but it ended in a 49-49 tie, with likely supporters McConnell and Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island absent.

International trade over the past 70 years has raised the standard of living in the U.S., he said — ""people have nostalgia for the 1950s, but I promise you, life is better than it was in the 1950s. People live longer, people are able to overcome illness better and there is more prosperity, frankly, per person.""

Trump's move Monday to suspend raised tariffs against China for 90 days is a good decision, Paul said, though the senator said he's heard ""various things"" about how far those rates would drop. He added widespread tariffs would affect nearly every industry in the state if they're in effect for lengthy periods, from the bourbon business and other exporters to the real estate and building market, which would be hit hard by rising lumber and steel prices.

""These are the decisions that should be left to the marketplace, to determine prices,"" he said. ""Adding a huge tax in the middle of the system — higher for some countries, lower for others, and then you lobby to try to get an exemption — I don't think it's a good way to run the government.""

Paul spoke downtown following a meeting with local business leaders inside the boardroom for Greater Louisville Inc., the city's chamber of commerce. Sarah Davasher-Wisdom, the board's CEO, said she's spoken to Louisville industry executives who say tariffs have created ""a lot of uncertainty for businesses, and that makes it very difficult to operate"" due to rising prices and questions over how long the rates will remain in place.

""If you get a tariff on five different parts that goes into something, then the overall cost is going to increase a lot,"" she said. ""And then the uncertainty itself creates some some challenges. 'Will my supplier have products for me to sell 90 days from now?' Those are all questions that have arisen.""

“We know what the Great Lakes fishery is like prior to European settlement from very early records from Indigenous fishers,” said Andrew Muir, science director with the Great Lakes Fishery Commission.
Testing that hypothesis is not something the Great Lakes Fishery Commission gave serious consideration because of the damage to the fishery.
There is still hope for funding for a barrier near Chicago to keep invasive carp out of the Great Lakes.
Marc Gaden at the bi-national Great Lakes Fishery Commission is optimistic that the GLRI, the carp barrier, and some programs to protect the Great Lakes fishery ultimately will be approved by Congress.","The Michigan Department of Natural Resources’ Charlevoix Fisheries Research Station is based in a building that was constructed in 1917, originally as a federal fish hatchery. It wasn’t the first on this site. An earlier hatchery was built in 1894.

The U.S. government was trying to replenish the fish population. Lake trout, whitefish, and walleye were not reproducing at rates fast enough to keep up with the demand of commercial fishing.

There were no limits on the number of commercial fishers and no limits on how much they could catch. State licenses were issued, but that was simply to make sure the states got some tax revenue from the fishing industry.

Federal fish stocking only slowed the decline. Then new technology opened up the markets for Great Lakes fish far and wide.

In 1868, a Detroit man developed a refrigerated rail car. It was cooled by an ice and salt mixture. Refrigeration changed everything for shipping food.

Refrigeration helped a little-known brewer named Adolphus Busch of Anheuser-Busch to ship beer across the nation. Refrigeration helped get beef from out West to the big cities in the East. And it gave commercial fishers in the Great Lakes new markets that had been unimaginable before.

“We know what the Great Lakes fishery is like prior to European settlement from very early records from Indigenous fishers,” said Andrew Muir, science director with the Great Lakes Fishery Commission.

“There’s a lot of records from Jesuit missionaries about the bounty of the Great Lakes, the plethora of species,” he added.

The Great Lakes supported some of the largest freshwater fisheries on the planet. For thousands of years, they sustained the native peoples of the region.

In less than a century after European settlements were built on Great Lakes shores, the fishery was in dire straits.

Today, at the Charlevoix Fisheries Research Station, the long pools of water where newborn fish were once raised are now covered up by a floor. The station is now made up of labs and offices on the second floor with equipment and work space on the first floor.

This past February, staff were analyzing the samples of fish they’d caught during the previous year.

“It’s basically counting what we call annuli, which show annual growth rings,” explained Steve Lenart, a fish biologist who manages the station.

It’s like counting tree rings. In this case, it’s counting growth rings on fish ear bones or fin bones, depending on the type of fish.

“This works well in areas like Michigan because growth slows down when the water gets cold. Growth rings squeeze together a little bit and that makes annuli every winter,” said Kris Snyder, a fisheries technician, as he put a new sample from a yellow perch under the microscope.

Snyder said the sampling last year pulled in more perch than he’d seen in a decade. Perch were plentiful in the 1980s, but then the population dropped substantially.

“There’s a nice array of age classes. I’ve got little four-inch perch all the way up to 14-inch perch,” Snyder said, adding, “We seem to be headed in the right direction.”

This kind of research on all kinds of fish is being done in labs around the Great Lakes region. The different state agencies have agreed to a Joint Strategic Plan that compiles their data for a big picture of the fisheries in the lakes. Lenart said this kind of cooperation is critical to understand what’s happening to the fisheries in the Great Lakes.

But the successes and the challenges are different for each of the lakes.

The Charlevoix research station on Lake Michigan is finding results for the fish populations somewhat similar to what the Alpena Fisheries Research Station is finding in Lake Huron. That makes some sense. The two lakes are, hydrologically speaking, one big lake. Some fish even swim back and forth between the lakes.

Lake Superior has seen its top predator fish, the lake trout, make a comeback. Last November, fisheries managers determined that lake trout population had recovered to the point it no longer needed to be stocked. The fish had dropped to extremely low levels and took decades to recover.

Lake Erie, with the least water by volume and being the most shallow of the Great Lakes, is where you’ll find the largest amount of fish.

It’s said that while Lake Superior holds 50% of the Great Lakes water; it has 2% of the fish. Lake Erie only has 2% of the water and 50% of the fish in the lakes.

“I mean, the walleye have been gangbusters,” said Chris Winslow, director for Ohio Sea Grant and Ohio State’s Stone Laboratory.

He noted that there are many variables in play: water levels, when storm events come through to stir up nutrients, what was ice cover like, how bad are the harmful cyanobacterial blooms in the western basin of Lake Erie.

“But, we can say for roughly the last almost decade, the walleye have been doing very, very, very well,” Winslow said.

That’s not the case for perch. In some parts of the lake the yellow perch population is doing well and in others the perch population is declining. Researchers are trying to determine why. Is it the decline of a smaller fish that perch eat, the emerald shiner? Is it dead zones — oxygen depleted areas — in the lake?

Then, there’s the nutrient issue. A vast area of farmland, covering a large portion of Ohio and parts of Michigan and Indiana, drains into Lake Erie, causing an increase in phosphorus. That’s primarily from applied fertilizer, including manure from large livestock farms. Phosphorus feeds the toxic cyanobacterial growth and nitrogen pollution increases the toxicity. Often called harmful algal blooms, they cover large areas of the western basin of the lake. That’s not good for fish, or wildlife, or humans.

Winslow said climate change is also a factor in the very complicated circumstances in Lake Erie.

“Whether it’s a nutrient poor system, or a nutrient moderate system, or an elevated nutrient system, it often goes hand-in-hand with temperature. We are seeing increased air temperatures in this part of the country and that matches with increased water temperatures.”

Hotter summers often mean larger cyanobacterial blooms.

Winslow said it’s important to remember the Lake Erie fishery is an important part of the economy for the states surrounding it — Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and New York — plus the province of Ontario.

“I mean, when I drive up there, the boats in the parking lot are North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky. It’s not just Ohio, right? It’s not just you and me walking down our dock, getting in our boat. These are new dollars to the region. It’s absolutely critically important.”

Climate change is affecting all the lakes to one degree or another. Lake Superior is one of the fastest warming large lakes in the world. That’s affecting fish populations. For example, the eggs of whitefish are deposited in rocky coastal areas of the lake. When there’s ice cover, there’s little or no wave action. Without ice, waves crash against the rocks and the eggs crash too, damaging them and contributing to the decline of whitefish populations.

The cycle of lake levels rising and falling over the years has led to higher highs and lower lows, and it’s happening faster which also causes problems for egg survival.

As a Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians Fisheries Management Program biologist once explained, the whitefish is not only an important source of protein, but it is also important to Anishinaabe culture. It’s a thread throughout their creation history.

The Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians is looking into low reproduction rates for the whitefish. The work is ongoing as they try different approaches to raising whitefish and restoring them to more natural habitats.

Invasive species devastating to some fish

Because of overfishing, the stocks of Great Lakes fish were already declining. But in the 1920s and ‘30s a new threat appeared. New canals connecting the lakes to other waters allowed other kinds of fish such as alewife and sea lamprey to infest the Great Lakes.

“The sea lamprey was really the death blow to the commercial fishery,” said Marc Gaden, executive secretary of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission (GLFC), a binational, treaty-based organization created in 1954. One of its primary efforts is working to suppress the sea lamprey population.

The sea lamprey is a parasitic fish that looks like an eel. It attaches to fish and sucks blood. On average, a single sea lamprey can kill up to 40 pounds (21 kg) of fish during its parasitic juvenile stage.

It was assumed that if the effort to kill sea lamprey was curtailed, the parasite’s population would quickly expand. Testing that hypothesis is not something the Great Lakes Fishery Commission gave serious consideration because of the damage to the fishery.

During the COVID pandemic, however, workers were not always able to get lodging or meals where they would travel to kill larval lamprey. The population increased. The COVID circumstances showed the sea lamprey suppression works.

The alewife infestation was managed by introducing another non-native species in the 1960s: Pacific salmon. Salmon became very popular with recreational anglers. But salmon populations are down, because the alewife population decreased because it was affected by yet another invasive species.

Zebra mussels and quagga mussels made their way to the Great Lakes by hitching a ride in the ballasts of ocean-going freighters entering the lakes. Ships would take up ballast water in eastern European waters as a way to stabilize the ship. Then some of that water and its stowaways would be pumped into the Great Lakes. Both the zebra mussel and the quagga mussel quickly spread throughout the lakes.

The mussels had no predators. While zebra mussels covered more shallow water, quaggas spread into deeper water by the hundreds of trillions if not quadrillions. Estimates are difficult to gauge.

These filter-feeders eat much of the bottom of the food chain, the phytoplankton, leaving little food for fish and other organisms in the Great Lakes. The damage is irreversible.

That lack of food has caused more damage to fish populations than most of the other challenges. It’s believed the primary reason whitefish populations have dropped so significantly is because they cannot find enough food.

More than 100 other invasive species were transported via ocean-going vessels until the U.S. and Canada required ships entering the region to take measures to flush out ballast water. It seems to be effective.

But Marc Gaden said there is an after-effect.

“We have to do something to curtail the inter-lake movements of these species and the U.S. EPA rules have essentially exempted the lakers (freighter ships that remain in the Great Lakes) from that.”

The allegation is that some invasive species might have been established in one Great Lakes port are being spread by Great Lakes freighters — that stay within the lakes — through their ballast water exchanges.

“We have great science that shows the lakers do move these things around,” Gaden said.

The organization representing the ships disagrees.

“There’s no validity to that statement at all,” responded Debbie DiCianna, Director of Environmental & Regulatory Affairs with the Lake Carriers Association.

The science that Gaden mentioned came from two sources:

1. Great Waters Research Collaborative’s study of eight Canadian and United States bulk carriers which participated in the study. It found “laker ballast water from the lower four Great Lakes that was destined to, or directly in, discharge to western Lake Superior ports contained non-indigenous species of aquatic organisms not previously recorded in Lake Superior.”

2. A Fisheries and Oceans Canada analysis found, “The movement of unmanaged ballast water by Lakers within the Great Lakes region is a high-risk pathway for spreading AIS (Alien Invasive Species).”

“The Canadians are always the ones bringing up the idea of spread and what can occur,"" DiCianna said, adding, “there were a lot of actions that were put into place by lakers, the U.S. flagged lakers, by changing how their sea chests were, how uptakes were, all of that to drastically reduce what could be the probability of things.”

DiCianna said nobody has shown her data on where spread has occurred.

She also said the suppliers of treatment systems are not willing to service Great Lakes freighters because there are so few of them compared to the thousands of oceangoing ships that are their customers.

DiCianna believes the spread of invasive species from port to port within the Great Lakes is much more likely to be caused by recreational and sport boating.

To stop the spread of invasive species, state agencies campaign to get recreational boaters to clean their boats after leaving a body of water to keep from fouling the next lake or river they boat in.

“They don’t want to do the little bit that some of the marinas ask them to do,” she said.

A very complicated and intricate web

Back at the Charlevoix Fisheries Research Station, vessel captain Patrick O’Neill is repairing nets that are used to take samples during the warm water season.

He said from his observations over the years, the lakes and the different fish populations are constantly changing.

“We have fish coming in; we have fish going out. We have environmental changes that are happening. And overall, a lot of what we’re seeing change is based on management.”

He said stocking lake trout in Lake Michigan has made a difference. They study the results and decide whether stocking is needed again in the same place or whether to stock where there’s lower abundance.

Fish biologist and station manager Steve Lenart said just stocking fish is not enough. You have to determine what is causing the bottleneck.

“For whitefish, I think we can surmise that it’s probably related to food availability,” he said.

Stocking more whitefish does not fix that problem.

That situation is not limited to whitefish.

Several years ago at a meeting between Michigan DNR personnel and anglers, things got heated. Some of the fishers were angry because the salmon population in Lake Huron had plummeted. They blamed the DNR, arguing that the agency didn’t want to spend the money to stock more salmon.

But the reason salmon populations were down was that their food in Lake Huron was diminished. Many were swimming to Lake Michigan because there was more food there. The DNR personnel explained that releasing more juvenile salmon would do no good. That’s because the small fish would just become a meal for the greater number of walleye that were benefiting from the declining salmon population in Lake Huron. The anglers were not happy with that explanation. They insisted that stocking would solve the problem.

Invasive species, a lack of food, climate change, and many other factors affect different fish species in different ways. Some benefit. Others decline. Because things are changing so fast, learning what is affecting fish populations and how management might help needs more study.

There’s been great collaboration between the Great Lakes states and the federal government. There’s also been cooperation between the U.S. and Canada to do what’s best for the fishery and lakes they share.

The fishery is a $5.5 billion a year benefit to the entire Great Lakes region because of commercial fishing and — especially on the U.S. side — recreational fishing.

But much of that research and the collaborations with Canada have not been a priority of the administration of President Donald Trump.

“The picture is grim. There’s no question that all the signals we’re getting is that we’re going to continue to see cuts that really impact the Great Lakes,” said Laura Rubin, director of the Healing Our Waters-Great Lakes Coalition.

Advocates for the Great Lakes are fond of saying fish don’t know international boundaries. Pollution such as PFAS and plastics can spread across the borders. The nutrient runoff into Lake Erie affects Ohio, Michigan, Ontario, and beyond.

“Our agencies have been told ‘Don’t work with Canada. Don’t work on joint research. Don’t work on joint treaties.’ These are the kinds of things that undermine research and undermine Great Lakes protection and restoration,” Rubin said.

She is optimistic about one project. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative has strong bipartisan support in Congress. President Trump did approve funding during his last administration. It could mean hundreds of millions of dollars a year to pay for boots-on-the-ground work and the scientific research needed to make the right decisions for the Great Lakes fishery.

However, there’s concern that if the Environmental Protection Agency budget is cut to the degree the administration wants, its capability to administer those grants could be handicapped.

That’s a concern that Michigan U.S. Senator Gary Peters shares.

“The Trump administration seems intent on gutting environmental protections, not just in the Great Lakes, but all across the country.”

Senator Peters said even members of Congress outside of the Great Lakes states understand the importance of protecting the source of 20% of the fresh surface water on Earth.

“But, I am very concerned about what that [EPA cuts] could mean for the administration of GLRI contracts,” Peters said, presuming the GLRI money would be approved.

The Healing Our Waters – Great Lakes Coalition outlined some of the cuts in the proposed budget from the White House:

$2.46 billion cut to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) programs that help communities fix and update their drinking water and wastewater infrastructure.

$235 million cut to EPA research and development that protects the health of communities.

$100 million cut to EPA initiatives that address pollution concerns in communities facing disproportionate environmental harm.

There is still hope for funding for a barrier near Chicago to keep invasive carp out of the Great Lakes. Last week, President Trump issued a memorandum that instructed several federal agencies to complete work on the barrier. Those four carp species have taken over long stretches of the Mississippi River system. The fear is that the invasive fish could devastate the fragile state of the fishery in the Great Lakes.

Marc Gaden at the bi-national Great Lakes Fishery Commission is optimistic that the GLRI, the carp barrier, and some programs to protect the Great Lakes fishery ultimately will be approved by Congress.

“We have political systems that are notoriously fractured right now. You get almost no agreement on anything. But the Great Lakes have been a notable exception to that.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5401a6a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3767x1978+0+881/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa3%2F1c%2F674ff5a748c29e38915cef720397%2Ffnlsalmon-series-photos-1-denoiseai-clear-topaz-upscale-2-7x.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:41:35.820150

The Detroit Police Department’s Crisis Intervention team has introduced two new comfort dogs, Atlas and Dequindre, who will assist officers on mental health runs across the city.

Sponsored by Marathon Petroleum’s Detroit refinery, the dogs are part of a broader initiative by the Detroit Public Safety Foundation to enhance community engagement and officer wellness.

Marathon Petroleum employee Whitney Walton, a former Detroit Police Department officer, secured grants for the comfort dogs and mountain bikes, emphasizing the importance of community trust and emotional support during police operations.

The Detroit Police Department’s Crisis Intervention team has welcomed two new comfort dogs, Atlas and Dequindre, who are currently in training. These labradoodles will soon assist officers on mental health runs across the city. Their sponsorship comes from a grant provided by Marathon Petroleum’s Detroit refinery to the Detroit Public Safety Foundation, a nonprofit organization that funds training, equipment, community engagement, and wellness initiatives.

“We are excited to have Atlas and Dequindre as the newest additions to the Detroit Police Department,” said Chief Todd Bettison. “They will assist our officers on follow-up calls and help people, especially children, relax during potentially stressful situations.”

Whitney Walton, Senior Security Specialist at the Detroit refinery, retired from the Detroit Police Department in 2019. With her deep understanding of the department’s culture and community support, Walton emphasized their focus on building community trust and ensuring officer wellness.

“[Atlas and Dequindre] will assist our officers on follow-up calls and help people relax during potentially stressful situations.”

The Detroit refinery has partnered with the foundation for many years, providing funds for various projects and requests. After reviewing a list of needs, Walton secured grants for the comfort dogs and dozens of mountain bikes and helmets for officers to use throughout the community.

“Having officers on bikes increases community engagement, while the comfort dogs provide emotional support to both officers and the community, alleviating stress and reducing anxiety during investigations and responses to incidents,” Walton said.

Once their training is complete, Atlas and Dequindre are expected to be certified comfort dogs.",https://www.3blmedia.com/sites/default/files/styles/carousel_2x/public/images/Comfort-dogs-join-Detroit-Police-Departments-Crisis-Intervention-Team_Marathon-Petroleum_51325.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:41:39.603464

""We just want the Governor's help to expedite the permit,"" said the project management director for Grand Haven, Derek Gajdos.

So it would really affect the regional economy, not just Grand Haven,"" Gajdos explained.","GRAND HAVEN, Mich. — Local leaders in the Grand Haven area are losing patience over delayed harbor dredging, sending a letter to Governor Gretchen Whitmer demanding action as concerns grow about economic impacts.

While dredging in Grand Haven's outer harbor begins May 13, dredging in Grand Haven's inner harbor has been put on hold.

Ottawa County Commissioner Josh Brugger drafted a letter calling on the Governor to help speed the process along. The letter was signed by Grand Haven mayor Robert Monetza, Ferrysburg mayor Richard Carlson, as well as the supervisor and president of Spring Lake Township — Jerry Rabideau and Mark Powers.

""We just want the Governor's help to expedite the permit,"" said the project management director for Grand Haven, Derek Gajdos.

The Grand Haven harbor brings in 2 million tons of aggregate every year, supplying road construction materials, gravel, and road salt across Michigan. Gajdos said he's concerned the port's $88.8 million in annual revenue could be in jeopardy and prices could increase, ""just because the harbor's not dredged.""

""[Freighters] don't have a solution to put those [materials] elsewhere. So it would really affect the regional economy, not just Grand Haven,"" Gajdos explained.

Dredging maintains navigable channels and depths for large vessels, but the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) found the inner harbor could contain cancer-causing chemicals called PFAS, halting the process to prevent additional environmental impacts.

""We still want to protect the public, just as much as EGLE and the Governor, but we need to do it in a manner where it doesn't bring the harbor's economy to a screeching halt,"" Gajdos said.

As long as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers gets approval from EGLE, they expect to be able to dredge the full harbor until fall of next year. Meanwhile, they're sending sediment data to EGLE, hoping to identify safe areas that will allow them to begin dredging sooner.

Chief of Environmental Analysis, with the Detroit division of the U.S. Corps of Engineers, Charlie Uhlarik, says sediment data of the upper portion of the inner channel that's already been sent to EGLE was determined to be free of PFAS.

""Below that, EGLE wanted some sediment to determine if there was any PFAS, so we just took that sediment sampling on Thursday,"" Uhlarik explained.

On Thursday, EGLE issued a 30-day public comment period starting May 8 that, when concluded, would allow dredging in certain portions of the harbor. The agency said in a letter, ""Assuming no major issues arise during the public comment period, EGLE expects to issue the certification in June.""

The teen, whose name has not been released, was charged Monday afternoon. Felonious assault is a felony punishable by up to four years in prison, a $2,000 fine or both. It was unclear Monday if the girl is being charged as an adult or juvenile.

The stabbing happened around 6:11 p.m. Saturday in the 1000 block of Woodward Avenue in downtown Detroit.

A verbal altercation between the teens escalated, and the 16-year-old girl used a pocketknife to stab the boy, a Detroit resident, multiple times in the stomach, according to a new release from the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office. An investigation by the Detroit Police Department led to the arrest of the girl a short time later.

Detroit Police Assistant Chief Charles Fitzgerald said there were thousands of people downtown enjoying the pleasant weather when the attack happened. He urged parents to refrain from dropping off their children unattended if they are likely to cause problems.

""If folks think they can come downtown and do silly things you will be apprehended quickly,"" Fitzgerald said. ""There are cameras everywhere ... ""When you have these kids and they're walking around and doing dumb things they're going to draw the attention of the police.""

He said DPD endeavors to have a sizeable, visible police presence downtown during warm-weather months.

""We also have officers you don't see. We have a lot undercover officers working the entire downtown footprint,"" Fitzgerald said. ""It is extremely important for us to make it a nice, safe environment, a fun environment for anyone who wants to come down, go to the restaurants, go to the bars, go to the game ... but you'll have to come down and behave yourself.""

A preliminary hearing was held Monday afternoon at the Juvenile Detention Facility in the Wayne County Criminal Justice Center. Further hearings will be held in Macomb County, according to the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office.

On Sunday, the victim was reported to be in temporary serious condition, the Detroit Police Department said in a statement. His condition wasn't available Monday.

The stabbing was the second violent incident involving teens at Campus Martius in recent years. In 2022, during the Christmas Tree lighting ceremony, two teens were shot in the area.

Leaders from labor unions, the forest products industry, farm organizations and small businesses groups are all hoping to testify at the hearing in support of Line 5.

“The DNR’s permit process was rigorous and included more than 200 environmental safeguards for Enbridge to follow—far exceeding typical regulatory standards. Claims that the project poses environmental risk are not only unfounded, but they are also a deliberate attempt to block energy infrastructure and, by extension, the industries and communities that rely on responsible land use,” said Henry Schienebeck, Executive Director of the Great Lakes Timber Professionals Association.

The hearing is being held in response to a letter sent by the Bad River Band to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers claiming construction of the Line 5 relocation project would impact water quality on the Reservation which is over 1 to 12 miles downstream of the project’s actual location. This follows a more than four-year review of the project, and permits issued by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources that affirm the project can be completed safely and following all environmental laws and regulations. The Wisconsin DNR’s permitting process included multiple public hearings, multiple public comment periods, and resulted in an 898-page environmental impact state.

The Band’s objection letter contends that the construction best practices Enbridge and its contractors will follow are harmful to far downstream water quality. Applying that logic to other projects would virtually shut down development and forestry in the region.

“Sadly, opponents of the project are now not only using the legal process to try and reverse the DNR permits, but they are also trying to get the federal government to stop the project by using absurd arguments that could impact any construction project throughout our region,” stated Neil Sickich, who is a Business Agent with the Steamfitters 601 and a resident of Bayfield County. “I have personally worked on Enbridge projects as well as countless other pipeline projects in and outside of Wisconsin. I have firsthand experience in the practices Enbridge uses to safeguard the environment during construction, and as a resident of the area, I have a vested interest in protecting our environment. I have complete confidence the Line 5 relocation project will be done safely and with minimal impact on the environment.”

“I appreciate and respect the desire of the Bad River Band to remove Line 5 from their reservation. However, it appears you are being asked to substantially alter basic construction practices – which follow environmental guidance from agencies like the EPA and Wisconsin DNR – in a way that would make it nearly impossible for development of any kind to move forward across much of Northern Wisconsin,” Terry McGowan, President and Business Manager of the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 139, plans to tell the Army Corps in his testimony.

Line 5 is unique because it not only moves crude oil that is refined into transportation fuels, but it also transports natural gas liquids that are made into propane. In fact, a public comment submitted to the DNR by major propane supplier Plains Midstream sent a critical warning that a rejection of the Line 5 relocation project would likely send Wisconsin into a propane state of emergency, leading to supply shortages and massive price increases.

In 2014, they overlaid the 364 area code on top of the 270 area code in western Kentucky.

Five public meetings across the region will give residents the chance to weigh in on what happens before a new plan is selected. The Kentucky Public Service Commission (PSC) is holding five public input meetings over the course of June to allow residents the chance to share their thoughts.

The North American Numbering Plan Administrator, the national group that monitors the phone number supply, said the area code will run out of numbers by the end of 2027, and the state needs to come up with a plan before then.

PSC Chair Angie Hatton said in a statement the process of creating the state’s sixth area code will be an open one.

“We want to hear from the telecommunications industry, from businesses that might be affected by the change, and from area code 502 residents,” she said. “We seek public input so that we will have a full understanding of the issues before we make a decision that may have a significant impact on the economy and on people’s daily lives.”

According to the PSC, the group submitted five possible “relief” plans in October 2024; however, they suggested a new overlay area code, which would replace the area code in all new numbers created, leaving old ones in place.

The PSC already recently added a new area code in Kentucky. In 2014, they overlaid the 364 area code on top of the 270 area code in western Kentucky.

There are other ways to solve the phone number shortage. A geographic split would break up the 502 area: one part would keep the 502 code and the other piece would get a new one. The PSC said that was the usual method in Kentucky until 2014.

More than 540 EPA staffers took those deferred resignations, which were open until early February.
“They’re showing that they don’t feel the environmental justice program staff are loyal to this administration.
Bush, a Republican, first created the Environmental Justice Program in 1992.
“Environmental justice communities are young children.","In a statement last month on its first 100 days under President Donald Trump, the Environmental Protection Agency celebrated 100 achievements.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the agency had taken “significant actions” to protect public health and the environment while working “to Power the Great American Comeback.” The agency said it was also working to fulfill Trump’s promises to revitalize the auto industry, “restore the rule of law,” and give decision-making power back to the states.

The EPA, the bosses were claiming, was succeeding in its mission of protecting human health and the environment.

In practice, the agency has done the opposite, several EPA staffers told The Intercept.

Environmental advocates and experts have criticized the administration for an “all-out assault” on the environment. Now, EPA staffers are speaking out in the wake of staff cuts and the gutting of a spate of programs to remove lead from drinking water, support rural wastewater treatment, and address racial disparities in environmental pollution.

“The mission of the EPA has been shifted,” said Amelia Hertzberg, an environmental protection specialist at the EPA.

“Americans are going to be less healthy. And frankly the EPA is going to be less efficient,” Hertzberg said. “If you’re less efficient, you’re wasting money. It’s working at cross-purposes with their stated goals.”

An EPA spokesperson disputed staffers’ characterization of its efforts to cut staff and weaken programs.

“At EPA, we are doing our part to Power the Great American Comeback, and we are proud of our work to advance the agency’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment every day since January 20,” EPA spokesperson Molly Vaseliou said in a statement to The Intercept.

“Not Our Mission”

Under Zeldin’s leadership, the EPA announced a set of newcore priorities that includes making the U.S. the artificial intelligence capital of the world and revitalizing the auto industry.

Staffers are concerned that instead of making communities healthier, under Trump the agency is now focused on serving industry, said Ellie Hagen, an environmental scientist at the EPA’s Environmental Justice, Community Health, and Environmental Review division.

It’s not clear how the EPA is supposed to serve those goals, said Hagen said, whose job is being terminated in July and was speaking on behalf of her local union, American Federation of Government Employees Local 704.

“A lot of us are really confused about what our new mission is, when they’re coming out with these pillars of serving the auto industry and bringing back auto industry jobs,” Hagen said. “I don’t know how we fit into that.”

The EPA’s role is not to create jobs; it’s to regulate and protect people from pollution, she said.

“Our mission is not to promote AI or energy dominance,” she said. “That’s not our mission.”

Deep Cuts

The EPA has said it is aiming to cut the agency’s budget by 65 percent and bring staffing levels to Reagan-era levels. As part of Trump’s efforts to gut the federal workforce under the auspices of government efficiency, the Office of Personnel Management sent the first round of deferred resignation offers to federal employees in January. More than 540 EPA staffers took those deferred resignations, which were open until early February.

Nine more employees were subject to a reduction in force as of May 7, according to a statement to The Intercept from the EPA press office; 280 employees in diversity, equity, and inclusion and environmental justice programs were notified last month that they were part of staffing cuts.

As of last week, more than 1,500 staffers applied for deferred resignation and a “voluntary early retirement” program.

The day the resignation offers were sent out, EPA staff also received notice of agency reforms including return to office and “enhanced standards of conduct,” including “loyalty.” The EPAreopened its deferred resignation program last month.

Last week, the agency said it is planning to dissolve the Office of Research and Development, which does life-saving research on toxicity and developing sampling protocols, and helped in emergencies after the East Palestine train derailment in Ohio and the Covid-19 pandemic.

As a result, more than 1,500 scientists will have to compete for 300 jobs, Hagen said.

“It’s essentially like lobotomizing our agency. If we don’t have the brain — the research behind protecting the environment — we can’t do that effectively, and I think that’s exactly what they want,” she said. “They’re doing all this under the guise of efficiency, but what they really are doing is dismantling this agency from doing its job.”

The EPA announced in March that it was ending its Environmental Justice Program and the agency’s “DEI Arms.” A few weeks later, the day before Earth Day, Hagen received notice that her tenured position was being terminated and that she would be removed no later than July 31.

“They did it on the eve of Earth Day to send a message,” she said. “They’re showing that they don’t feel the environmental justice program staff are loyal to this administration. They think what we stand for is different than what this administration stands for. So they’re making an example out of us.”

The agency said the term “environmental justice” had been used to advance left-wing politics.

“As Administrator Zeldin has repeatedly stressed, ‘environmental justice’ has been used primarily as an excuse to fund left-wing activist groups instead of actually spending those dollars on directly remediating the specific environmental issues that need to be addressed,” the EPA press office said.

The staffing cuts and resignation offers have had their intended effect, Hagen said: to scare career federal employees and push them out of the agency.

“They’re creating such an intense culture of fear that I think they’re pushing a lot of people in that direction,” she said.

Fewer people took deferred resignations in the first round because there was confusion around what direction the EPA was headed in. But Hagen expects many more to take the next round after leaders made clear they were completely shifting the agency’s agenda.

“Based on the mood in the office and hearing from my colleagues, I never thought would leave the EPA,” she said, “I think a lot of people are going to take it just because of how scared and traumatized we all have been over the past 100 days.”

Another EPA staffer who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their livelihood said they feared for their future after being placed on administrative leave in February for their work in the Environmental Justice Program.

“I’m a military spouse who worked to better protect all including those most vulnerable and least protected from harmful exposures to chemicals and pollution,” they said.

“Our family is having to relocate from our home and community we love. We’ve both served our country and now are afraid for both our livelihoods,” they said. “This is our story and what we’ve been living through. So many of our friends are in similar situations here and across the country.”

“Non-Political”?

Much of the administration’s attack on the EPA is tied up in the politicization of principles that historically had bipartisan support — like environmental justice, which staffers pointed out was until recently not viewed as a political project.

“Environmental justice is supposed to be non-political,” Hertzberg said. “It’s just about identifying the people most in danger of pollution so you can help them first.”

President George H.W. Bush, a Republican, first created the Environmental Justice Program in 1992.

“This is a program that has been standing for decades, has done life-saving work across both sides of the aisle, efficiently and effectively,” Hagen said.

The agency is now cutting other programs that have bipartisan support, she added.

“How can you say this program has bipartisan support or support from the administration when you’re intimidating people into taking this buyout?” she said. “I think a lot of EPA staff will be taking the second round of buyouts, and we have no idea how that’s going to gut these statutory — what they say is bipartisan — support programs.”

In their attacks on “DEI” and “wokeness” — for example, efforts to ensure civil liberties and equal protection under the law for communities that have historically faced institutional discrimination — Trump and his allies have distorted the concept of environmental justice into a political weapon, Hertzberg said.

“Environmental justice communities are young children. They’re pregnant women, the elderly, those with medical conditions, those without access to proper services, which is often rural communities and those living closer to polluters,” Hertzberg said. “This is really supposed to be a non-political part of the EPA, and it’s castigated as though we all have this axe to grind and are suspect in some way.”

Staffers said the government is now leaving communities they’ve built relationships with over the years vulnerable to life-threatening pollution and health hazards.

“The people who are still in the office are feeling worried about their jobs and feeling frustrated and heartbroken about the communities that we’ve served who are not being served anymore,” Hertzberg said.

EPA staff are now put in the position of betraying communities they’ve tried to build trust in, she said.

“Now you just have to let them down,” she said. “It’s the heartbreak of watching these people who you promised you were going to help be let down again, to have your hands tied behind your back, and at the same time being accused of being poor stewards of taxpayer funds.”",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2212190309-e1747078145277.jpg?fit=5365%2C2682&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-05-13 14:38:50.297670

Two programs are kicking off in June with the goal of increasing composting in the community.

""This is like the core principle of our work is composting. This is where we come from and this is where we return to,"" said Jon Kent of Sanctuary Farms on Detroit's east side.

Kent is familiar with closing the food loop through composting. The farm follows a six-month process to turn food waste into valuable compost.

""This is a pile in progress right now. Usually, we turn it two to three times a week for three months, and then we let it cure for another three months just by letting it sit,"" said Kent.

The result is what Kent calls ""Black Gold"" – nutrient-rich compost that helps grow new food and keeps waste out of landfills.

""We have to take care of home, and this is a part of that work in making sure that we continue to have one,"" said Kent.

Sanctuary Farms is part of the Detroit Community Compost Collection Project (DCCP), a coalition of seven Detroit-based food waste and environmental justice organizations. The group is launching a pilot program this summer focused on increasing equitable access to composting.

""We're going to be looking at 200 residents. 100 backyard composters and then another hundred community composters,"" said Kent.

The program will provide materials and financial incentives for participants with support from an Industrious Labs grant.

""There's going to be stipends for folks to participate, and also we'll be giving them the materials to compost,"" said Kent.

DCCPplans to collect data from the pilot to advocate for broader change in the city.

""We look at it as a microcosm. So that if we can at least activate these 200, how can we also activate the 700,000 citizens that are here to compost,"" said Kent.

Simultaneously, the City of Detroit's Office of Sustainability is launching its own community composting program this summer, which will include a free central drop-off location and training for participants.

""Our goal is to get between 100 and 200 people in the first pilot just to see how much food waste we can actually collect,"" said Tepfirah Rushdan, Director of Sustainability for the City of Detroit.

The central drop-off site will use a digester to reduce waste volume by 50-75% on-site. Residents will need to sign up for the program and go through education.

The program received $100,000 in funding from Carhartt. The city will measure success by tracking pounds of food waste diverted from landfills and share the data with the city's solid waste division.

The city's program aligns with the Office of Sustainability's long-term vision to create a citywide composting system with multiple drop-off locations and curbside pickup.

""I think it's gonna take us doing this pilot, and showing people the benefits of it, so that all of our city leadership can get on board with understanding this is something that residents want to do, this is something that is good for the planet and can be done in a healthy and good way for our city,"" said Rushdan.

The program is part of Michigan's broader goal to divert 50% of food waste by 2030.

Long-time Detroit resident Jacqueline Gilmore, who spent her day helping a friend care for hosta plants, says she supports the initiative.

""I just care about the earth and beauty and taking care of your community and it starts from your own property and you go from there,"" said Gilmore.

Gilmore plans to apply for the program this summer.

""I think it's awesome anything they can do,"" said Gilmore.

Brett Guthrie (R-Kentucky) said in the hearing announcement. “We are committed to delivering President Trump’s agenda and eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse, so the most vulnerable Americans can reliably access the care they need.”

Scoring political points

Democratic lawmakers held a press conference on May 12 to discuss looming cuts to Medicaid. The same day, Guthrie issued a statement claiming the Dems have mounted a “fear campaign” with incorrect claims about policies not even in that bill.

“From the moment a budget reconciliation bill was on the table, Democrats began their fear campaign to scare Americans without any of the details,” his statement said,

“This bill refocuses Medicaid on mothers, children, people with disabilities, and the elderly — not illegal immigrants and capable adults who choose not to work,” Guthrie said. “It is reckless that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle claimed an artificially high number in alleged coverage loss just so they can fear monger and score political points.

“This reconciliation is a win for Americans in every part of the country, and it’s a shame Democrats are intentionally reflexively opposing commonsense policies to strengthen the program,” he said.

‘Health care is not a luxury’

Even so, health organizations have been sounding the alarm about drastic changes in store if the nation’s next budget won’t cover health care via Medicaid. As of December 2024, more than 78.5 million people were enrolled in Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). The Congressional Budget Office has estimated the spending plan could increase by 13.7 million the number of people without health insurance by 2034, according to an analysis published by Rep. Frank Pallone, (D-New Jersey), the ranking member of the House Energy & Commerce Committee.

The congressional action is a sweeping attempt to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, said Mona Shah, JD, MPH, senior director of policy and strategy at Community Catalyst, a nonprofit health care access advocacy organization based in Boston, Massachusetts.

“Politicians are rushing to terminate coverage for millions of people to pay for tax breaks that only benefit the wealthy and big corporations,” Shah said in a statement. “The end goal is clear: Slash the programs that keep our communities healthy while doing nothing to rein in the corporate profiteering driving up costs. The result? Closed hospitals, more medical debt, and worse health outcomes — especially in communities already facing deep inequities. These consequences will hit red and blue districts alike.

“We won’t let them divide us,” Shah said. “Across the country, people are uniting to defend care, reject corporate greed, and demand a health system that puts people over profit. Now is the time to strengthen Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act — not tear them down. Health care is not a luxury — it’s a right.”

‘People will lose access’

The budget reconciliation will have measurable consequences for access to obstetric and gynecologic care across the country, said Stella Dantas, MD, FACOG, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). OB/GYN physicians are concerned the cuts will threaten the 12 months of postpartum coverage that physicians have advocated for pregnant patients, she said in her official statement.

“Because roughly 40% of births in the United States are covered by Medicaid, it’s natural to associate Medicaid cuts with harm to pregnant people,” Dantas said. “But as physicians who provide care to our patients throughout their lifetimes, we know what will happen if these Medicaid cuts are put into effect: People will lose access to the preventive care that keeps them healthy and facilitates access to treatment when conditions emerge.”

‘A devastating blow’

American Hospital Association President Rick Pollack said the budget will dismantle Medicaid and he urged Congress to reject that.

“The magnitude of the proposals contained in the Energy and Commerce reconciliation text represents a devastating blow to the health and well-being of our nation’s most vulnerable citizens and communities,” Pollack said in a statement. “There is no avoiding the real-life consequences they will create for hospitals serving our most vulnerable and hard-working families.

“These proposed cuts will not make the Medicaid program work better for the 72 million Americans who rely on it,” he said. “Instead, it will lead to millions of hardworking Americans losing access to health care and many of our nation’s hospitals struggling to maintain services and stay open for their communities.”",https://cdn.sanity.io/images/0vv8moc6/medec/59119c32388bd93640ac47342669d2d6688cc72d-1200x858.jpg?fit=crop&auto=format,N,,2025-05-13 14:48:11.930490

House Republicans are calling for billions of dollars in funding cuts for Biden-era climate and environmental programs, including clean energy tax credits, as lawmakers seek to reverse what one GOP leader called “the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending” approved under former President Joe Biden.

Environmental groups warned the proposals would pave the way for more oil and gas industry activity on public lands and increase planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.

The House committees on Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means are set to discuss the plans on Tuesday as part of the so-called budget reconciliation process. Several moves are aimed at clawing back billions in spending authorized by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, a Democratic measure intended to slow climate change and boost clean energy such as wind and solar power.

House Speaker Mike Johnson has set a Memorial Day deadline to pass President Donald Trump’s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts, and the GOP has scheduled round-the-clock hearings this week on various sections of the bill before they are stitched together in what will become a massive package.

Republican Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce panel, said his committee’s bill, unveiled Sunday, would return $6.5 billion in unspent funds intended for climate programs included in the 2022 law. In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, he said the plan “ends spending on Green New Deal-style waste” and claws back money “headed for green boondoggles’’ such as grants for environmental and climate justice.

“The legislation would reverse the most reckless parts of the engorged climate spending in the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act,” Guthrie wrote.

The cuts to climate programs are part of a larger $880 billion in savings by 2034 proposed in the draft legislation that also covers communication and health-related policy, largely targeting Medicaid.

The cuts fit with Trump’s 2026 budget proposal, which looks to slash federal spending through a sweeping reorganization of federal agencies as well as steep cuts to disease research and, especially, clean energy and policies intended to address climate change. Congress ultimately decides the spending and tax plans.

In Trump’s first few months back in the White House, the administration has broadly gone after environmental and climate initiatives, many of which were put into place under the Biden administration, pledging to dismantle what Trump calls the Democrats’ “green new scam.”

Groups decry the proposals

The GOP proposal “guts investments that are cutting energy costs” for families, “powering a domestic manufacturing boom and delivering essential health care to the communities that need it most,’’ said Lena Moffitt, executive director of the environmental group Evergreen Action.

The Republican move to loosen pollution standards “would mean more smog in our streets,” while cuts to environmental justice block grants “would force low-income communities to pay more for dirtier energy,” she added. “Republicans are sacrificing clean energy on the altar of Big Oil to bankroll another round of tax cuts for the ultra-wealthy.”

Alexandra Adams, chief policy advocacy officer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the Energy and Commerce bill “gives polluters free rein to foul the air and water.” Cleaning up U.S. ports and reducing dangerous methane spewing from oil and gas wells have traditionally received bipartisan support, she said.

Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, said the moves would impact federal investments in domestic battery and mineral supply chain jobs.

“At a moment when our industry needs certainty more than ever, this legislation could slam the brakes on America’s progress towards global competitiveness in manufacturing, while ceding leadership to other countries,” he said.

The National Ocean Industries Association, which represents the offshore oil and wind industries, warned against what it called “premature repeal or phase-out of current tax credits.”

“Sudden changes to the tax code could inject significant uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, project planning and job creation” in offshore energy and the broader economy, said Erik Milito, the group’s president.

Climate programs targeted

The draft text from the Energy and Commerce committee would reclaim unused billions from several Inflation Reduction Act programs, repeal sections of the Clean Air Act, and emphasize support for oil and gas drilling.

The plan also pulls back money for the Energy Department’s multi-billion-dollar loan program for clean energy, the Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund — commonly known as the “green bank” — and certain multistate and offshore wind development.

It would rescind funding for clean vehicles, loosen vehicle emissions standards, and cut money for zero-emission port equipment and air pollution monitoring, while at the same time allowing for an expedited permitting process, opposed by environmental groups, for natural gas drilling and increasing the supply of the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

Republicans in the House Ways and Means Committee on Monday released their own proposal to repeal clean energy tax credits.

Proponents, including some Republicans, say credits boost demand for technologies, such as solar or electric vehicles, that reduce harmful emissions and help drive down their cost.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ChatGPT-Image-May-13-2025-09_41_21-AM.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:46:04.182623

According to the American Stroke Association, about one in four people who survive a stroke end up having another one.
Data from the American Stroke Association show more than 53 million Americans serve as caregivers, including those caring for stroke survivors.","A new report from the Commonwealth Fund showed between 8,000 and 12,000 Kentuckians could lose their jobs as a result of the state implementing Medicaid work requirements, which would cause more people to lose health coverage.

Leighton Ku, professor of health policy and management at George Washington University and co-author of the report, said around half of job losses would occur in health care and the other half downstream, in other industries connected to hospitals and doctor's offices. He added many rural health care providers rely heavily on patients with Medicaid to operate, noting without the funds, they will have to make tough choices.

""Health care providers, they have to compensate for that by doing things like laying off staff and by buying less from people who they purchase things from,"" Ku pointed out. ""Whether it's medical equipment or whether that's how they pay the rent for their space.""

A new study from Michigan State University researchers revealed lasting PFAS effects in a Michigan community's drinking water near an old paper mill landfill.

PFAS are ""forever chemicals"" which enter the body and do not break down easily, often found in products like nonstick pans and waterproof gear.

The study focused on a southwest Michigan city where PFAS contamination in drinking water was first identified in 2018. It is the first study to examine PFAS in both tap water and blood in a community exposed to the chemicals.

Courtney Carignan, assistant professor of food science and human nutrition at Michigan State University and the study's lead author, shared key findings from the study.

""The levels that we see in blood, being elevated and for some people were above what the national academies have recommended in terms of where you would start to need additional medical screening for certain PFAS related health effects,"" Carignan explained. ""It's good that this community got that intervention.""

The study found PFAS compounds lingered in the body, even three years after switching to clean water. The findings give a starting point for understanding PFAS risks and how well intervention strategies work.

Study participants who drank contaminated water were divided into two groups: those with high exposure from city water and those with lower exposure from private wells. Blood PFAS levels rose with each year of exposure for both groups. Women in the low-exposure group had lower levels than men, likely due to biological factors. Carignan noted a separate study identified key sources of PFAS contamination.

""We found that closer proximity to airports, military fire training cites, wastewater treatment plants, were more likely to have PFAS contamination in those public water systems,"" Carignan pointed out.

Research shows PFAS compounds are found in the blood of most Americans. Those with the highest levels were people exposed at work or via contaminated drinking water.

At least two people have tested positive for measles in Illinois and public health officials are working to combat misinformation surrounding vaccines in an effort to curb the spread.

Health officials said the measles virus is highly infectious and especially concerning for babies and young children, as well as people who are pregnant or have compromised immune systems. It can cause pneumonia, brain damage and even be fatal in some cases.

Dr. Kiran Joshi, interim chief operating officer at the Cook County Department of Public Health, said it is also preventable through vaccination, with two doses of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine providing nearly 100% lifelong protection.

""Ninety-seven percent of people who got measles this year happened to be unvaccinated,"" Joshi pointed out. ""Vaccination is incredibly protective.""

Joshi added over the past 50 years, the measles vaccine has saved more than 150 million lives across the world. He noted the department has launched a campaign to counter some of the misinformation that is circulating.

Public health officials are focusing campaign efforts on unvaccinated people. Joshi explained it includes having multiple conversations with hesitant patients and providing evidence-backed information. He stressed misinformation about preventive measures like taking vitamin A is concerning and not scientifically proven.

""There are a lot of myths out there, such as 'vaccines can cause autism,'"" Joshi pointed out. ""I want to state categorically that is incorrect, that there's no credible evidence to support that, yet these myths continue to perpetuate.""

Joshi added the myths have potentially contributed to more than 900 measles cases reported across the country.

""When you look at the research, when you look at the evidence, all of that has been subjected to pretty rigorous standards,"" Joshi outlined. ""We also go to the nature of science, that you have to be able to repeat studies. You have to look at the research as a whole, instead of sort of cherry-picking.""

He advised anyone with questions to speak with their primary care provider about their vaccine records and ensure they are getting any health information from reputable sources.

May is American Stroke Month and the American Heart Association wants Missourians to know the signs and take action.

Stroke is the sixth leading cause of death in the state, and across the U.S., nearly 800,000 people suffer from one each year. In 2021, heart disease and stroke took more lives in the U.S. than all types of cancer and chronic lung diseases combined.

Lana Wilhelm, a registered nurse and caregiver advocate, was named the 2025 Caregiver Hero by the American Stroke Association after helping her husband recover from a stroke. She shared tips on how people can manage their risk.

""If you're diabetic, making sure that you are well-managed and you're following your physician's orders,"" Wilhelm outlined. ""High blood pressure: Are you taking your medicine? Are you watching your diet? Are you making sure that you're checking your blood pressure on a regular basis? Exercise, good nutrition.""

The Heart Association said to remember the ""FAST"" acronym when looking for warning signs: face drooping, arm weakness, speech trouble, and ""time to call 911."" According to the American Stroke Association, about one in four people who survive a stroke end up having another one.

Wilhelm stressed entire families are affected when a loved one suffers a stroke. She urged caregivers of stroke survivors to seek out support groups and other resources to help them navigate those challenges.

""Sometimes as a caregiver, you just want to throw in the towel,"" Wilhelm acknowledged. ""You're exhausted, you're tired, you're worried, and it's just nice to be able to talk to other men and women that get it, and can kind of help you through that whole process.""

Data from the American Stroke Association show more than 53 million Americans serve as caregivers, including those caring for stroke survivors.

The measure, which passed unanimously out of the Senate last week, would authorize the Department of Natural Resources to seek a search warrant to conduct investigations on otherwise off-limits government land. The bill also removes a $150,000 annual cap on how much the state can spend on an investigation and changes the rules governing the fund so that unspent money is not moved to another fund.

Money transferred to the fund could not be used for clean-up of any contamination found in the investigation. The waste was spread by federal contractors and should be cleaned up by federal authorities, state Sen. Nick Schroer, a Defiance Republican, said during last week’s debate.

“Let’s give them the data. Let’s see where that goes,” Schroer said. “And if they’re not willing to clean the mess up, I think we’re going to have a lot of lawsuits on our hands. But I think we’re gonna be back in this building, talking about it and if they’re not going to do it, we need to step up and protect our people.”

Records reveal 75 years of government downplaying, ignoring risks of St. Louis radioactive waste

St. Louis has struggled for decades with remnant radioactive waste from the World War II-era effort to build the world’s first atomic bomb.

While the presence of radioactive contamination in suburban St. Louis was known for years, an investigation by The Independent, MuckRock and The Associated Press revealed in 2023 that the federal government and companies handling the waste were aware of the threat to the public long before informing residents.

Uranium was refined in downtown St. Louis for use in the development of the bomb. After the war, it was trucked to St. Louis County, often falling off of trucks along the way. It was dumped at the airport, susceptible to the wind and rain, and contaminated the adjacent Coldwater Creek.

As suburban neighborhoods sprung up along Coldwater Creek, generations of children and families were exposed to the radioactive waste, elevating residents’ risk of certain cancers.

The waste was sold and moved to a site in Hazelwood, also along Coldwater Creek, so that a company could extract valuable metals. Eventually, the remnant radioactive material was dumped in the West Lake Landfill where it remains today.

“This has been a long time coming,” state Rep. Raychel Proudie, a Ferguson Democrat, said of the radioactive waste investigative fund legislation passed Monday.

Coldwater Creek is being cleaned up by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers while the Environmental Protection Agency is overseeing the cleanup of the West Lake Landfill.

The EPA announced earlier this year that it expanded the area of the West Lake Landfill that requires remediation by 40 acres after discovering contamination was more widespread than the agency previously thought. The cost of the project is now nearly $400 million, up from $229 million.

State Rep. Doug Clemens, a Democrat from St. Ann, said Monday that his community is ravaged by rare cancers that he attributes to the radioactive contamination left behind by development of the atomic bomb.

“We played our part in World War II,” he said. “This weapons project left waste behind. That waste is incredibly harmful.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Monday proposed killing the electric vehicle tax credit and repealing fuel efficiency rules designed to prod automakers into building more zero-emission vehicles as part of a broad-based tax reform bill.

The proposal, which is set for a House Ways and Means Committee hearing on Tuesday, would repeal a $7,500 new-vehicle tax credit and a $4,000 used-vehicle credit on Dec. 31, although it would maintain the new-vehicle credit for an additional year for automakers that have not yet sold 200,000 EVs.

The president of the Electric Drive Transportation Association, Genevieve Cullen, criticized the proposal, saying that plans ""to abandon U.S. leadership in energy innovation by gutting federal investment in electrification are catastrophically short-sighted.""

The proposal, she said, would deliver ""an enormous market advantage"" to competitors like China and threaten U.S. manufacturing and jobs.

The U.S. Treasury in 2024 awarded more than $2 billion in point-of-sale rebates for EVs.

The proposal leaves in place a key battery production tax credit for automakers and battery makers, but a new provision would bar the credit for vehicles produced with components made by some Chinese companies or under a license agreement with Chinese firms.

The provision, which would take effect in 2027, could bar credits for cars powered by Chinese battery technology licensed by American companies such as Ford Motor or Tesla.

House Republicans also propose to kill a loan program that supports the manufacture of certain advanced technology vehicles. It would rescind any unobligated funding and rescind corporate average fuel economy standards and greenhouse gas emission rules for 2027 and beyond. That portion will be taken up by the Energy and Commerce Committee.

Among outstanding loans finalized in President Joe Biden's last weeks in office are $9.63 billion to a joint venture of Ford Motor and South Korean battery maker SK On for construction of three battery manufacturing plants in Tennessee and Kentucky; $7.54 billion to a joint venture of Chrysler-parent Stellantis and Samsung SDI for two EV lithium-ion battery plants in Indiana; and $6.57 billion to Rivian for a plant in Georgia to begin building smaller, less expensive EVs in 2028.

In fact, we have approved numerous contracts for ongoing ORD research dating back to January,” an agency spokesperson said.
“At ORD and throughout the agency, EPA is continuing research and labs to advance the mission of protecting human health and the environment,” the spokesperson continued.
An EPA spokesperson declined to say whether its reorganization efforts will be impacted by that order, saying the agency doesn’t comment on pending litigation.","(The Hill) — Political leaders at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have told scientists there to apply for new jobs, implying that those who do not may be fired, according to an official with a union representing the agency’s employees.

“People in ORD [the Office of Research and Development] were told to apply for these positions,” said Joyce Howell, executive vice president of the union.

Howell recalled that the comment came from political officials during a meeting with EPA staffers. Someone asked during the meeting what would happen to those who did not apply to new positions and was told, “These are your opportunities,” she said, adding that the implication was that those who did not apply to or get a new position would be fired.

Howell said that employees were told 155 jobs were opening up in the agency’s chemicals office, 300 were opening up in the administrator’s office, and 50 would open up in the air and radiation office, while an unspecified number would open up in the water office.

But reports have indicated that some 1,500 people work in ORD.

Howell warned that if the rest of these jobs are lost, the agency could be losing not only “independent science” but also the “expertise” of those staffers.

Chris Frey, who led ORD under the Biden administration, raised concerns about the future of the research office — and what it may mean for the American people.

“Without the evolution of the science, …we would see a difference that EPA will do less to protect public health and the environment,” Frey said.

“We’ve seen announcements from the administrator of EPA to roll back basically all of the major standards that were set during the Biden administration for air pollution and water quality, contaminants in land and chemicals in commerce, and all of those decisions are made based on an assessment of what is the harm to public health and the environment,” he added.

Asked about whether employees in the agency’s science arm were instructed to apply for the new job openings, an EPA spokesperson said via email that “All EPA employees were provided this opportunity via an internal hiring authority.”

“The May 2 announcement was the next phase of organizational improvements and part of a larger, comprehensive effort to restructure the entire agency,” the spokesperson said.

“The Office of Research and Development was not part of this announcement. EPA’s Talent Hub went live Friday night (May 2) with new and open positions in offices impacted by this phase of reorganization … All EPA employees are eligible to apply,” continued the email.

The Hill also obtained an internal email, first reported by E&E News, that appears to detail changes to the agency’s Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment, which conducts studies to examine the impact of exposures to chemicals on people and ecosystems.

An email signed by the director and deputy director of the center says, “Lab research will wind down over the next few weeks as we will no longer have the capability to acquire supplies and materials.”

“We requested for an exemption for journal articles but have not heard if that is approved,” the internal email states. “ORD is shutting down their laboratory activities. We are unsure if these laboratory activities will continue post-reorganization.”

The EPA, however, described this email as “factually inaccurate.”

“No ORD funding requests to [the Office of Mission Support] have been denied. In fact, we have approved numerous contracts for ongoing ORD research dating back to January,” an agency spokesperson said.

“At ORD and throughout the agency, EPA is continuing research and labs to advance the mission of protecting human health and the environment,” the spokesperson continued.

The alleged changes are coming in the wake of a broad reorganization announced by the agency earlier this month, part of sweeping changes enacted by the Trump administration.

EPA said that it would be “shifting its scientific expertise and research efforts” to its program offices, including those that make decisions about whether to protect air and water and how to regulate chemicals.

The agency said at the time that this phase in its reorganization does not include layoffs, but that it hoped to eventually get staffing levels down to where they were in the Reagan era — meaning that around 1,000 to 3,000 of the agency’s 15,000 positions could ultimately go.

Democratic staff of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee reviewed a plan earlier this year indicating that the EPA has considered eliminating ORD entirely.

The Trump administration has indicated that it wants to cut jobs at agencies across the board — and that it intends to carry out mass firings across the federal government. On Friday, a federal judge ordered a temporary pause in the administration’s plans.

An EPA spokesperson declined to say whether its reorganization efforts will be impacted by that order, saying the agency doesn’t comment on pending litigation.",https://www.abc27.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/05/50501_protest_dc_021725gn28_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-05-13 14:39:36.450026

The company is working with U.S. EPA on a comprehensive fix to stop the problem, but construction isn't slated to start until 2027.

The city of Wyandotte's drinking water intake pipe is very near the site of the venting contamination, but testing over years has shown the water is safe, city officials said.

Toxin-laden groundwater is venting into the Detroit River — at a rate of up to 60 gallons per minute — from a longstanding chemical plant site in Wyandotte, according to state environmental regulators. And the plant's owner is in violation of a nearly 40-year-old federal court consent decree with the State of Michigan that's supposed to stop that from happening, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy alleges.

The plant, at 1609 Biddle Ave. in Wyandotte, is an American subsidiary of German chemical giant BASF. In a May 8 response letter to EGLE, company officials stated they ""respectfully disagree"" with the regulator, and question EGLE's interpretation of what's required of them. ""BASF has been and remains in compliance with the Consent Decree,"" BASF site director Michele Barney stated.

BASF is working with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on a long-term fix that would include a 1.7-mile barrier between the property's edge and the river, and 300,000 gallons in on-site storage tank capacity to better stop polluted groundwater from leaving the site. But construction on that project isn't expected before 2027.

That frustrates some residents and environmental groups.

""For whatever reason, BASF ... just decided that the city of Wyandotte isn't of enough concern to stop discharging illegally while they do the long-term, elegant engineering solution,"" said Carrie La Seur, legal director for For Love of Water (FLOW), a Traverse City-based environmental nonprofit.

In an emailed statement to the Free Press, BASF spokeswoman Marika Diamond reiterated that the company believes it has been and remains in compliance with its consent decree agreements with the state of Michigan, and that it continues to work on a comprehensive perimeter barrier project with EPA to address groundwater venting into the river.""BASF regards protection of health, safety and the environment as our most important responsibility,"" she said. ""We care about our employees and local communities and operate our facilities in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.

""To that end, BASF has already taken additional steps beyond those required by the Consent Decree to enhance existing measures at the property. These additional steps included installation of additional groundwater extraction wells and a pilot treatment system which began operating in July 2023.""

Mercury venting in groundwater from portions of the BASF Wyandotte site registered as high as 3,800 nanograms per liter in regulator testing in September 2006; up to 1,200 nanograms per liter in August 2012; and up to 1,800 nanograms per liter in June 2021. EPA and EGLE limit mercury in venting groundwater to 1.3 nanograms per liter — meaning the pollution is exceeding the standard to protect public health and the environment by many hundreds of times over.

According to EPA, exposures to some forms of mercury can lead to tremors, headaches, changes in nerve responses and disturbances in sensations, and poor performance on tests of mental function. Higher exposures can cause kidney damage, respiratory failure and death.

Wyandotte drinking water deemed safe

Other contaminants of concern are per- and polyfluroalkyl substances, or PFAS, the nonstick ""forever chemicals""; and volatile organic chemicals.

The groundwater pollution is happening with the city of Wyandotte's drinking water intake pipe downstream and ""about 800 to 1,000 feet east of the southern boundary of the (BASF) facility,"" a November 2021 briefing paper prepared by EGLE supervisor Dale R. Bridgford noted. But Wyandotte Mayor Robert DeSana, at a jointly held EPA and EGLE online meeting April 30, said the city's water system ""remains safe, well-monitored and well-managed.""

""Wyandotte's water intake is not located at the surface, nor is it anywhere near the shoreline,"" he said. ""It sits 1,200 feet offshore — the length of four football fields — and is positioned 30 feet below the surface. The distance and depth play a critical role in protecting our water supply from potential contamination and significantly reduce susceptibility compared to shoreline intakes.""

DeSana noted that water sampling results ""have been consistently non-detect (for harmful pollutants) since testing began, not just recently."" The city's raw water it takes in, and its finished water post-treatment, ""have continuously met or exceeded all water quality standards,"" he said.

FLOW last year helped Wyandotte-area residents secure a joint federal and state public health assessment in the vicinity of the BASF property. Work on that study, looking to see if any potential health concerns are concentrated in that vicinity along the Detroit River, is ongoing, La Seur said.

""There have been a lot of questions about whether people who are in contact with that local water in one way or another need to be concerned about health impacts,"" she said. ""It felt validating that state and federal public health agencies, in cooperation, would say, 'Yes, we are concerned enough to put some public resources into looking at the data available and trying to tell you if you ought to be concerned.'""

BASF disputes what it must do

Industrial activities have occurred on the Wyandotte site on the Detroit River site since the late 1800s. The riverbank and associated wetlands were filled for further industrial expansion over years, using soil, building materials and waste from the production of soda ash and propylene oxide, known as distiller blow off. BASF acquired the plant and its grounds on Biddle Avenue in 1969 from Wyandotte Chemicals Corp.

""Through historic releases to the ground, and the impacts from the made land, groundwater contamination is pervasive across the site,"" Bridgford stated in the November 2021 EGLE briefing paper on BASF Wyandotte North Works.

BASF is subject to two consent decrees, agreements reached with the state in U.S. District Court, from 1980 and 1986, as well as an administrative order on consent with EPA for corrective action. In a March 10 letter to BASF, EGLE officials contended the company is violating the 1986 consent order, intended to require groundwater pumping at three locations on the company property to change the gradient flow of groundwater away from the Detroit River.

The system requires pumping at a rate of 10 to 90 gallons per minute to be effective, EGLE officials stated. Records from an EGLE site visit and the local wastewater authority, however, showed pumping of less than 10 gallons per minute ""from 2019 through the 2nd quarter of 2023, with flows ranging from 0.01 to 1.4"" gallons per minute, EGLE officials stated. EGLE called for BASF to modify its operation of the remedial system, meet the systems design flows, and halt the venting of groundwater into the river from the respective locations.

In its May 8 response, BASF contended it does not have to pump 10 to 90 gallons per minute to meet the requirements of the consent decree, only to show groundwater is moving away from the river in the specified three locations in the decree.

EGLE spokesperson Josef Greenberg said the agency's enforcement and technical staff are reviewing BASF's response.

The comprehensive fix BASF has in the works with EPA is currently on schedule, with mobilization and construction to start in 2027, EPA spokesman David Shark said.

""This is a highly technical design plan that requires EPA review and approval at each design step prior to the commencement of construction,"" he said.

La Seur, however, questioned why BASF isn't required to do more immediately as the longer-term solution is in the works. ""An expert we have worked with told us there are technologies to bring in for extraction and treatment; you can bring these facilities on-site, do the pumping and sometimes take it off-site by tanker,"" she said. ""If they were willing to spend the money, within 30 days they could immediately reverse the gradient (flow of groundwater to the river) and then at least there wouldn't be this discharge happening.""

Shark, however, said there are several challenges to a more aggressive pumping and mobile treatment system as an interim measure.

""Due to the complexity of the soil layers, existing utility infrastructure beneath the property and the extent of contamination across the property, the most effective remedy is one that mitigates groundwater discharge from the entire border of the BASF property along the Detroit River,"" he said.

""EPA believes that the best path forward is to develop the comprehensive groundwater measure and implement a remedy that will effectively mitigate sitewide groundwater discharge from entering the Detroit River.""

Meaning that until such a system is in place, the polluted groundwater discharges into the river will continue.

does not reverse itself, the Department of Energy — which sets minimum efficiency standards for the home appliance industry — could step in to oversee Energy Star.
You can imagine the other conversations going on behind the scenes at each company that relies on the Energy Star label and its blessings.
Yes, any one company — or all of them together — could vow to restart Energy Star if necessary.
But would there be at least some benefit if different trade groups stepped in to maintain Energy Star?","There’s a good chance you’re part of the nearly 90 percent of American households that are aware of the Energy Star label that shows up on home appliances when you’re shopping for a new dishwasher or refrigerator. It’s a useful seal of approval, a signal of outsize efficiency and the lower utility bills that you’ll pay over time.

And now it’s in jeopardy thanks to the Trump administration’s desire to make cuts at the Environmental Protection Agency and eliminate the agency’s division that oversees the Energy Star program.

When the news emerged last week that there might soon be no more stickers on all sorts of appliances — from air-conditioning units to washing machines — one solution seemed obvious: The companies could pledge to set up their own version of the program, using independent third parties to assess their wares.

Simple, right? But none of the major appliance manufacturers that I approached would promise to do that. Many — including Frigidaire, Samsung and Sub-Zero — didn’t even respond to the multiple requests I made for comment.

Energy Star is a big deal, if you believe the E.P.A. According to a document on its website, the program has contributed to $500 billion — billion, with a “b” — in household and business energy savings since its 1992 launch.

Appliance manufacturers do not want Energy Star, in which participation is voluntary, to go away. They said as much in a March letter to the E.P.A., when they sensed that cuts might be coming.

But they don’t see the end of government support for the program to be a settled matter. A spokesman for Bosch’s home appliance group described the goings-on as “pending,” while an LG representative said any discussion of how it might promote superior efficiency to consumers in the future was premature.

Even if the E.P.A. does not reverse itself, the Department of Energy — which sets minimum efficiency standards for the home appliance industry — could step in to oversee Energy Star. The department did not respond to requests for comment on whether it would commit to doing so.

You can imagine the other conversations going on behind the scenes at each company that relies on the Energy Star label and its blessings.

Would it create consumer good will to be one of the first companies in this industry (or any competitive one) to stand up and say the cuts at the E.P.A. are absurd, given how useful Energy Star is? Sure. But would consumers, who don’t buy big appliances often, even remember who spoke up first? Probably not.

Moreover, this is an environment where silence can pay real dividends. President Trump ran on a platform of using his office to punish people he doesn’t like.

Yes, any one company — or all of them together — could vow to restart Energy Star if necessary. Being defiant about it, however, just makes you vulnerable to a tariff, an executive order or who knows what. And that goes doubly for reasonable people at the Department of Energy who might otherwise publicly and immediately announce their intention to step in to save the program.

All of that can look like cowardice, but it’s probably just prudence if you are steadfast in your commitment to preserving the program or something like it.

Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a nonprofit research group, raised his own objection to an industry-sponsored Energy Star replacement: It might not be credible.

“One of the reasons it is so popular is that people see the government as an unbiased source of information,” he said.

But would there be at least some benefit if different trade groups stepped in to maintain Energy Star? Almost certainly, even if they have to spend some money to do it.

There is a world in which someone in the Trump administration wakes up to the sheer lack of logic here. If a regulated industry wants its customers to save another $500 billion in the coming years by using less energy (and to pollute less as a side effect), then maintain the federal testing and rewards system that facilitates it.

One way or another, we’re about to find out whether we get to live in such a world.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/05/12/business/12money/12money-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-05-13 14:39:41.915077

Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Va., is leading the Republican effort, calling it a step toward protecting U.S. taxpayers and national security.

The Certainty for Our Energy Future Act, introduced May 9, would eliminate certain wind and solar tax incentives while restricting access to clean energy benefits for entities tied to countries like China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.

Kiggans framed the bill as a way to stop U.S. tax dollars from subsidizing rival nations and to push American energy into a more reliant, innovation-driven future. She said saving taxpayer money and boosting homegrown industry is key to maintaining national security.

Supporters say wind and solar have reached commercial maturity and, therefore, no longer need the same level of taxpayer-funded help to stay competitive.

If passed, the bill would pull the plug on new federal tax credits for wind and solar projects starting in 2031. Companies still have until the end of 2030 to begin construction and qualify under current rules. The new restrictions would officially take effect starting in January 2026.

“With electricity demand projected to increase by up to 50% over the next 15 years, we need an all-of-the-above energy strategy,” said Frank Macchiarola, Chief Advocacy Officer for American Clean Power Association.

It would also shut the door on companies with ties to foreign adversaries— specifically to China, Russia, Iran and North Korea — from receiving any U.S. clean energy tax benefits. That includes companies based in those countries or controlled by their governments.

“Right-sizing policies in parallel with offering business and investment certainty is both critical and commonsense. As America seeks to beat China in the global AI race, legislation like this strengthens our nation’s competitive edge while ensuring American energy remains abundant and affordable,” said Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions.

While this bill is forward-looking, Kiggans’ concerns are backed by years of federal spending data showing foreign-owned companies have already benefited from U.S. tax subsidies.

One of the most frequently cited examples is Iberdrola. This Spanish-owned wind company received over $2.2 billion in U.S. support between 2004 and 2014, according to reports. More recently, Chinese-affiliated firms like Gotion High-Tech and Trina Solar have drawn attention for seeking Inflation Reduction Act tax benefits while maintaining ties to the Chinese Communist Party, which led to the introduction of the federal “NO GOTION Act.”

Louisiana officials see this type of innovation as essential to transforming its economy. According to a recent economic roadmap presented by LED, professional, scientific, and technical services could yield the highest job growth — up to 26,000 new jobs — but the state faces a talent drain, with 40% of college graduates leaving Louisiana.

""This in-demand talent feels like it can't find or get opportunities in our state,"" said Ben Safran of McKinsey & Company, who is advising LED. ""But our businesses are saying, 'I can't get the talent I need.'""

To close that gap, LED leaders say innovation must be embedded across every industry. ""Innovation has to be the common thread running through all these identified sectors,"" said Bourgeois.

Widespread, blanket tariffs are new to the mainstream Republican party, which previously championed free and unfettered trade.
Paul and McConnell have joined forces with a couple other Senate Republicans to vote for resolutions aimed at stopping sweeping tariffs.
In early April, four Senate Republicans — including Kentucky’s two senators — voted to end the national emergency that created the Canadian tariffs.
“When you think about the traditional tent pole of the Republican Party in economic freedom and the idea that you would have open free trade that’s going back some decades for a republican party platform stance,” Cizmar said.","Kentucky’s Republican senators have set themselves apart as top conservative voices expressing opposition to President Donald Trump’s tariff announcements.

Sen. Rand Paul has spoken frequently on the airwaves and the Senate floor in recent months, decrying what he calls an “abuse of executive power.”

“I don’t want to live where my representatives cannot speak for me, and have a check and balance on power,” Paul said in the Senate during an April vote to push back on Canadian tariffs. “One person can make a mistake. And guess what? Tariffs are a terrible mistake.”

Paul and Sen. Mitch McConnell have joined Democrats to push back against Trump’s tariff measures. Widespread, blanket tariffs are new to the mainstream Republican party, which previously championed free and unfettered trade. Trump’s shift towards tariff policies creates some alignment between former party leaders like McConnell and the more libertarian-leaning Republicans who are occasional party outsiders on some issues.

Paul and McConnell have joined forces with a couple other Senate Republicans to vote for resolutions aimed at stopping sweeping tariffs. In early April, four Senate Republicans — including Kentucky’s two senators — voted to end the national emergency that created the Canadian tariffs. Canadian goods entering the U.S. are currently levied a 25% tariff, excluding energy products and a few other goods.

McConnell and Paul have found voting partners in Republicans like Alaskan Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Maine Sen. Susan Collins, both of whom are moderate Republicans. In a summit in Alaska last month, Murkowski said, “We are all afraid,” referring to the threat of political retribution for opposing Trump policies.

More recently, another resolution lost in a tie vote while McConnell was absent. Paul was the lone Republican co-sponsor on the resolution to end the national emergency used to impose global tariffs — although two other Republicans joined him in voting for it. In a statement to Kentucky Public Radio, a spokesperson for McConnell said he was “under the weather” and could not attend the vote, but has consistently opposed tariffs otherwise.

Paul says he opposes the misuse of emergency powers — besides taking issue with tariffs as an economic tool. McConnell has frequently spoken out against trade wars, which he says are not in Americans’ best interests.

“As I have always warned, tariffs are bad policy, and trade wars with our partners hurt working people most,” McConnell posted on social media. “With so much at stake globally, the last thing we need is to pick fights with the very friends with whom we should be working with to protect against China’s predatory and unfair trade practices. That includes what we do on trade.”

Kentucky overwhelmingly voted for Trump by a more than 30 point margin, and certainly not all of the state’s congressional delegation is opposed to his hallmark economic policy. Representative Andy Barr, a Lexington-area Republican who announced he would run for McConnell’s Senate seat next year, has expressed his unflinching support for Trump’s tariffs.

“We need the turbulence because in the long run, we’re gonna have access to markets. And we’re gonna have less disruption, and we’re gonna have more free trade,” Barr said at Churchill Downs on Oaks Day to WHAS11. “Thank goodness he’s doing it because it gives us a chance to level the playing field.”

Many of the candidates in the emerging Senate primary are already vying for Trump’s endorsement. Political watchers believe the endorsement could be the deciding factor in the Republican primary.

Political Science Professor Anne Cizmar of Eastern Kentucky University says the state — and the region — have a history of congressional members who aren’t afraid to be party outsiders.

“I do think you see this as a regional story in several different kinds of neighboring states and areas where you might have party members who are in Congress who are kind of toeing the party line,” Cizmar said.

That sort of moniker may have always been applicable to libertarian-leaning politicians like Paul and Representative Thomas Massie, but before the Trump political wave, it wouldn’t have normally applied to former party leaders like McConnell. But Cizmar says it’s not surprising to see McConnell taking up this mantle, especially on his way out of office.

“When you think about the traditional tent pole of the Republican Party in economic freedom and the idea that you would have open free trade that’s going back some decades for a republican party platform stance,” Cizmar said.

Caleb Ragland, the president of the American Soybean Association from Magnolia, Kentucky, said local farmers like himself will be the hardest hit by tariffs, especially with all the other factors already working against agriculture: rising prices, high interest rates and now trade wars.

He’s especially concerned about trade wars with China, which saw a major shift when a temporary deal saw levies from at least 145% to a base 30% on Chinese goods entering the U.S. Chinese levies will fall from 125% to 10% on American goods. China is one of the major exporters of American soybeans, and Ragland said farmers need to know politicians understand the importance of global trade for them.

“Our senators, while both, at times, have very differing political opinions, but I was very glad to see them come together on this issue and to have our backs as farmers,” Ragland said.

In farming, margins are often slim and many small farmers can’t handle the political headwinds blowing against them too, Ragland said.

“Farm economy is in a difficult place, and we don’t have a lot of room for error,” Ragland said.

Charles Aull, the vice president of policy with the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, said tariffs and trade wars are likely to be felt first by small businesses that don’t have the bargaining power of big chains, especially those that rely on specific overseas goods.

“At the end of the day, we’re talking about families, we’re talking about workers. Those are the ones that are ultimately going to feel the most negative impacts of this,” Aull said.

Aull said he and the chamber are encouraging business owners to communicate with lawmakers about how tariffs are specifically affecting their businesses.

U.S. House leadership has thus far avoided a vote on tariffs via a rules committee resolution. Masie was one of few Republicans to vote against the measures. He wrote on social media, “I want Congress to assert its authority to vote on tariffs.”

Kentucky’s sole democratic representative Morgan McGarvey also opposes Trump’s tariff plan, which he calls “half-baked.” Republican Rep. James Comer told KET that tariffs could be used to help the U.S. combat illegal drugs, creating deals with other governments to take more direct action.",https://hoptownchronicle.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Rand-Paul.webp,N,,2025-05-13 14:48:28.946652

The platform aims to advance the development, demonstration, and scaling of technologies critical to the reindustrialization and diversification of Louisiana’s energy sector.

Newlab New Orleans is catalyzed by a public-private partnership that includes Louisiana Economic Development (LED), the City of New Orleans, Future Use of Energy in Louisiana (“FUEL”, an NSF Engine), Louisiana State University, Greater New Orleans, Inc. and Shell.

The platform will attract leading startups and accelerate technology commercialization across three initial focus areas:

Industrial Power: Advancing low-cost hydrogen production, low-carbon energy generation, and thermal electrification, while enhancing grid resiliency through modernization, energy efficiency, and integration of alternative fuels

Carbon Management & Utilization: Enhancing carbon removal, point-source carbon capture, storage, and utilization such as converting captured carbon into high-value products including chemicals, sustainable aviation fuels and other low-carbon fuels, and clean construction materials

Shipping and Maritime: Accelerating solutions in critical port infrastructure and operations, alternative maritime fuels, energy efficiency, and other emissions-reduction technologies

“The launch of Newlab New Orleans is a milestone for Louisiana’s energy and industrial economy. By transforming a dormant federal site into a living laboratory for next-generation technologies, we are not only creating jobs and attracting new companies, we are building the narrative that Louisiana can lead the world in the global low-carbon economy. I have personally witnessed the positive impact of Newlab in other communities, and am thrilled to welcome their world-class operation to Louisiana,” said Michael Hecht, President and CEO of Greater New Orleans, Inc.

Newlab New Orleans will be anchored in a purpose-built, newly constructed hub at the Naval Support Activity (NSA) site located at the intersection of the Intercoastal Industrial Canal and the Mississippi River. The NSA complex formerly operated as a 1.5 million square foot logistics center for the U.S. Navy, with the last military personnel departing the base in 2011. As part of the master plan by local developers, EMDRC Partners, and the City of New Orleans to reimagine the NSA campus, Newlab New Orleans will help to reactivate the historic site by creating a center of gravity for critical technology startups to drive measurable economic impact in the state.

The hub will feature industrial scale-up spaces, outfitted with specialized equipment and capabilities, allowing startups to fabricate, assemble, and pre-commission demonstration-scale process units for in-field deployments. In addition to the new facility, Newlab is collaborating with key government, industry, and academic partners to align a statewide network of demonstration sites and regulatory sandboxes to enable testing of startup technologies across Newlab’s focus areas.

“We're bringing Newlab to strategic regions like Louisiana that have a competitive advantage for speeding up commercialization of critical technologies. Louisiana's legacy in commercial-scale energy projects, existing industrial infrastructure, and technical workforce create the perfect foundation to build a startup ecosystem that will future-proof the state's economy,"" said David Belt, Co-founder and CEO of Newlab.

“We’re excited to welcome Newlab to Louisiana as the state expands what it means to be an energy leader. By fostering collaboration between startups, industry experts, and policymakers, Louisiana is setting a benchmark for how reindustrialization can drive sustainable economic growth, energy innovation, and technology leadership on a global scale,” said Josh Fleig, Chief Innovation Officer at Louisiana Economic Development.

“Newlab’s expansion into New Orleans and Louisiana signifies to the rest of the nation that with partners like LSU, LED, GNO, Inc., and the City of New Orleans, energy innovation is happening here faster than anywhere else. Newlab’s proven approach to developing deep technology complements our research agenda and industry partnerships. LSU’s Future Use of Energy in Louisiana (FUEL) award, the largest in National Science Foundation history, is a key reason the Newlab project moved so quickly, and we’re excited to keep that pace for energy founders in Louisiana,” said Dr. Robert Twilley, Vice President of Research and Economic Development, Louisiana State University.

“The launch of Newlab New Orleans represents a major step forward in realizing the City’s vision for a vibrant, inclusive, and innovation-driven local economy. By attracting cutting-edge startups and aligning them with our unique industrial and logistical assets, this initiative will help diversify New Orleans’ role in the global energy sector while creating new opportunities for our people and businesses to lead in the transition to a more sustainable future,” said Mayor Latoya Cantrell, City of New Orleans.

Newlab’s work in Louisiana began last year through two U.S. Department of Energy-backed programs focused on accelerating the commercialization of clean hydrogen and carbon management technologies. Through these programs, Newlab structured commercialization projects in Louisiana with nine startups and industry partners including Shell, Battelle, and Carbonvert. Among the participants being supported by Newlab, Arculus Solutions is partnering with N2 Solutions, a Louisiana-based pipeline service provider to retrofit natural gas transmission pipelines for safe and cost-effective transport of CO2 and hydrogen. Another startup, Mantel Capture, is collaborating with Newlab and regional industry partners to deploy their point-source carbon capture technology in Louisiana.

“Where the rubber meets the road is at the state level. Our work with Newlab is our anchor in Louisiana, a state that has long been a center for energy in the U.S. and, as a result, a major hub for CO2 emissions. That makes it a strategic location for carbon capture projects. Newlab has been instrumental in getting these projects off the ground by connecting us with key stakeholders, including state and local governments and communities. It’s crucial we put their needs first and address them throughout the entire technology development and deployment process, and Newlab has been a key part of making that happen,” said Cameron Halliday, Co-founder & CEO at Mantel.

This announcement follows Newlab's recent expansion into the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region through the establishment of Newlab Riyadh, a public-private platform to accelerate the commercialization of critical technologies across mining, logistics, and energy.
