Second, Republicans in Congress are sitting quietly while Trump sends massive numbers of federal agents into an American city.
But top Republicans in Congress, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.)
These “completely self-neutered,” Republicans in Congress, wrote Thomas Friedman, the New York Times columnist, have left Americans wondering if they are being “ruled by a mad king?” Incredibly, even the most obsequious Republicans are being lashed by Trump.","Did you see that? A video from a Miami nightclub last week showed top-rated right-wing influencers partying to Kanye West’s Nazi song “Heil Hitler.” The crew included Nick Fuentes, famous for hating Jewish people, and the Tate brothers, famous for brutal approaches to women.

The video went to the top of right-wing social media. It is being widely condemned as obscene.

But what about the obscene muzzling of Republicans in Congress? Like hostages with their mouths taped shut they are unable to respond to reckless behavior by President Trump.

First, there was fear-filled silence from Republican leaders when Trump threatened military action to take over Greenland. His words led Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney to call for new alliances apart from the U.S. because Trump had ended the “Old-World Order.”

The Wall Street Journal’s conservative editorial page said Trump’s act was “dangerous,” because China and Russia want to see a “rift that blows up NATO.”

Most of the Republican Congress didn’t see or say anything.

Second, Republicans in Congress are sitting quietly while Trump sends massive numbers of federal agents into an American city. That incursion resulted in an ICE agent shooting and killing an unarmed woman. And in response to protests against the shooting, Trump threatened to send in federal troops.

Again, the loud silence among congressional Republicans is enabling bad behavior. It is another obscenity.

Third, Trump’s Justice Department is going after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

Powell announced that the Federal Reserve had been handed subpoenas and a threat of federal indictment for him. He called the possible “criminal charges” against him a crude threat against the agency’s independence.

It is obscene to see so many tongues being bitten bloody among the Republican majority in Congress.

Trump’s frantic, one-man takeover of the government is more in line with a king than a president. But top Republicans in Congress, Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.), have little to say about his abuse of power. Fear of Trump attacking them on social media or backing a rival in a primary race has them paralyzed. They are fixated on Trump’s dominance of the Republican base.

These “completely self-neutered,” Republicans in Congress, wrote Thomas Friedman, the New York Times columnist, have left Americans wondering if they are being “ruled by a mad king?”

Incredibly, even the most obsequious Republicans are being lashed by Trump.

Take the sad tale of Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.).

She has been humiliated repeatedly for her fealty. She was promised the U.N. ambassadorship, only to be told she had to stay in Congress to bolster the thin Republican majority. Then she planned to run as a Trump-endorsed candidate for governor. But Trump not only denied her the endorsement but openly embraced her political foil, the socialist New York City mayor, Zohran Mamdani.

Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) is another Trump supplicant in Congress now being targeted.

A physician, Cassidy provided the critical support to confirm Trump’s pick to be secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert Kennedy Jr. He stood by Trump’s pick despite Kennedy’s long record of spreading vaccine misinformation. Cassidy’s reward for that moral abdication? Trump endorsed Cassidy’s Republican primary challenger last week. And measles outbreaks are surging nationwide.

Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) also got nothing for acquiescing to Trump. Collins famously defended Trump against congressional efforts to stop his imperial actions by saying she believed Trump had “learned a lesson.”

Then, recently, Trump profanely berated Collins after she voted against his use of the military in Venezuela without congressional approval. He later declared on Truth Social that Collins, along with others expressing concern, such as Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), and Rand Paul (R-Ky.), “should never be elected to office again.”

Again, Collins’ only response was mild indignation — but no words or action to confront Trump’s indifference to the constitutional role of Congress.

The few Republicans willing to call out Trump’s behavior are retiring.

Sen. Thom Tillis (N.C.) voiced objection to Trump’s Justice Department going after Powell.

“If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none… I will oppose the confirmation of any nominee for the Fed — including the upcoming Fed Chair vacancy — until this legal matter is fully resolved.”

That did not prompt Trump to end the questionable probe of Powell.

Similarly, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) joined a bipartisan delegation to Greenland after Trump threatened to use military force to seize it.

“Safeguarding our relationships with our NATO allies should be paramount,” Murkowski said. “Greenland should be treated as a partner, not a possession.”

Notably, except for Murkowski, the Republicans who dared to join that delegation are retiring. Tillis and Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon took the trip. They found some courage after quitting Capitol Hill.

The Book of Matthew asks: “For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul?”

There are still ten months left in the 119th Congress.

What we need are Republican profiles in courage, not cowering.

Where is the end to the obscene fright being displayed by Republicans in the face of Trump’s threats to the constitutional order of American democracy?",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/AP26022429198890.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-27 04:00:02.544886

The proposed rule was delivered to the OMB by the U.S. Department of Treasury and Internal Revenue Service on Dec. 17. The OMB website indicates the agency scheduled 16 meetings with industry stakeholders in January to discuss the proposed guidance, with the final meeting held Jan. 23. Representatives of Amp Americas, WM, Fuels America, Continuum Ag, Growth Energy, NATSO/SIGMA, Aemetis Inc., Renewable Fuels Association, POET, National Grain and Feed Association, Clean Fuels Alliance America, RNG Coalition, Pivot Bio, American Soybean Association and Gevo Inc. and were among those to meet with OMB staff regarding the proposed 45Z rule.

According to information posted to the OMB website, the proposed rule was modified during the review process and is now moving forward. The OMB website estimates a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) is currently scheduled to be released for public comment in May.

The 45Z tax credit was first established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, providing a tax credit for the production and sale of low-emission transportation fuels. The original version of the credit started at 20 cents per gallon for non-aviation fuels and 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For facilities that satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the value of the tax credit was up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuels and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. Under the IRA, the 45Z credit was available for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

The 45Z credit was updated and extended as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was signed by President Trump in July 2025. Under the OBBBA updates, the “special rate” for SAF will is eliminated beginning in 2026, effectively capping the value of the credit at $1 per gallon for all fuels, including SAF. The OBBBA also extended 45Z for two additional years, through the of 2029. Legislative efforts are currently underway to reinstate the “special rate” for SAF and further extend the credit.

Although the 45Z credit was created in 2023 and entered into force in 2025, Treasury and IRS have failed to release full guidance. Guidance delays have been particularly harmful to the biobased diesel industry, with domestic production down significantly in 2025 when compared to the previous year.

Treasury and the IRS in January 2025 issued a notice of intent to propose regulations addressing the clean fuel production credit. A companion notice, also issued in January 2025, included initial guidance on emissions rates under the 45Z credit, including an initial table that sets forth emissions rates for similar categories and types of fuel.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/archived/biodieselmagazine/posts/web/2015/05/omb-logo_14313847528429_14314399266097.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 02:58:39.611183

Zoghlin,,,,,https://www.underbergkessler.com/post/epa-moves-to-repeal-greenhouse-gas-endangerment-finding,"What the Draft Final Rule Proposes to Do The draft final rule proposes to rescind the greenhouse gas endangerment finding entirely.
If finalized, it would mean that the EPA no longer has an active endangerment determination supporting greenhouse gas regulation under key Clean Air Act programs.
Even when administrations changed, they generally sought to revise or replace specific regulations rather than revoke the endangerment finding itself.
By rescinding the endangerment finding, the EPA would effectively remove the statutory trigger that requires or authorizes greenhouse gas regulation under multiple Clean Air Act provisions.
New York, for example, regulates greenhouse gas emissions under state statutes and regulations that are independent of the federal endangerment finding.","In early January 2026, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) submitted a draft final rule to the Trump administration for review that would repeal what is commonly known as the “endangerment finding” for greenhouse gases under the federal Clean Air Act. While the rule is not yet final, the submission marks a significant legal development with broad implications for environmental regulation, industry, and state and local governments, including New York.

To understand why this action is noteworthy, it is necessary to understand what the endangerment finding is, how it has functioned for more than a decade, and how the proposed repeal would alter the legal landscape.

What Is the Endangerment Finding?

The endangerment finding is a formal determination by the EPA that certain air pollutants “cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.” In 2009, the EPA concluded that six greenhouse gases—including carbon dioxide and methane—met this standard.

That determination did not, by itself, impose emission limits. Instead, it served as the legal foundation that allowed the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, power plants, and certain industrial sources under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act.

The legal basis for the finding traces back to a landmark Supreme Court decision in 2007, Massachusetts v. EPA, which held that greenhouse gases qualify as “air pollutants” under the Act and that EPA must determine whether they endanger public health or welfare. The 2009 finding was the agency’s response to that mandate.

Since then, the endangerment finding has served as the cornerstone for federal climate-related air regulations.

What the Draft Final Rule Proposes to Do

The draft final rule proposes to rescind the greenhouse gas endangerment finding entirely. In practical terms, this would remove the EPA’s determination that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare for purposes of the Clean Air Act.

Unlike prior regulatory actions, which often adjusted emission standards, compliance timelines, or sector-specific requirements, this proposal targets the underlying legal predicate itself. If finalized, it would mean that the EPA no longer has an active endangerment determination supporting greenhouse gas regulation under key Clean Air Act programs.

It is important to note that the rule is described as a “draft final” rule. Before it can take effect, it must complete Trump administration review and then be formally issued. Litigation is widely expected, but the proposal itself already has immediate legal and planning implications.

How This Differs from Past EPA Climate Rules

Most prior federal climate actions under the Clean Air Act accepted the endangerment finding as settled law. Regulatory debates tended to focus on questions such as:

How stringent emission limits should be;

Which sources should be regulated;

How compliance costs should be calculated; and/or

How federal rules interact with state programs.

Even when administrations changed, they generally sought to revise or replace specific regulations rather than revoke the endangerment finding itself.

This proposal is different in terms of both scope and strategy. By rescinding the endangerment finding, the EPA would effectively remove the statutory trigger that requires or authorizes greenhouse gas regulation under multiple Clean Air Act provisions. In that sense, the rule is structural rather than incremental.

Legal Consequences Under the Clean Air Act

If the endangerment finding is repealed and upheld, EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases under certain sections of the Clean Air Act would be significantly constrained. Regulations tied directly to that finding could be weakened, suspended, or rendered legally vulnerable.

However, this does not repeal the Clean Air Act itself, nor does it amend the statute. Congress would need to act to change the law. Instead, the proposal reflects a reinterpretation of how existing statutory terms, particularly “endangerment,” are applied to greenhouse gases.

The legal question is not whether climate change exists, but whether greenhouse gas emissions meet the statutory threshold that triggers Clean Air Act regulation. That distinction is likely to be central in any future court challenges.

Impacts on Industry and Development

For regulated industries, the proposal introduces both short-term uncertainty and potential long-term change.

Industries that have been subject to federal greenhouse gas permitting or emission standards—such as power generation, manufacturing, and large-scale development—may see changes in federal compliance obligations if the rule takes effect. However, the immediate effect is not deregulation across the board; existing rules remain in place unless and until they are revised or invalidated.

Developers and infrastructure sponsors should be aware that regulatory uncertainty can affect project timelines, financing, and permitting strategies. Lenders and investors often rely on stable regulatory assumptions; and so, shifts at the federal level can prompt closer scrutiny of risk allocation.

The Role of States Like New York

The proposed repeal does not eliminate state-level climate authority. New York, for example, regulates greenhouse gas emissions under state statutes and regulations that are independent of the federal endangerment finding. State environmental review, permitting, and climate laws would continue to apply regardless of federal action.

However, differences between federal and state regulatory approaches could widen. This raises questions about coordination, preemption, and the extent to which states may fill regulatory gaps left at the federal level.

For municipalities, the change may influence how local land use approvals, environmental reviews, and infrastructure planning are framed, particularly for energy, transportation, and industrial projects.

Why the Proposal Matters Now

The submission of the draft final rule signals that the EPA is moving beyond conceptual debate toward concrete legal change. Whether or not the rule ultimately survives judicial review, it marks a turning point in how the federal government approaches greenhouse gas regulation under the Clean Air Act.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/26d562_8586a8c3a2c54978a11751e5d7f3d16b~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_848,h_555,al_c,q_85/26d562_8586a8c3a2c54978a11751e5d7f3d16b~mv2.jpg",N,,2026-01-27 02:58:36.576965

For Trump, it might seem like Deja vu given that he came to Iowa in 2019 to sign an executive order creating year-round E15, but the rule drafted by EPA was thrown out by federal courts.

Iowa Corn and the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association (IRFA) on Monday released an open letter to the president, which thanked him ""for his constant support"" of E15 and asking the president to push E15 through Congress.

The groups took out a full-page ad that will be in the print edition of the Des Moines Register.

As DTN reported, Congress last week pulled E15 language from a funding bill and instead created the E15 Rural Domestic Energy Council, which is expected to develop bills and submit them to Congress no later than Feb. 15 with the House expected to consider such legislation no later than Feb. 25.

In a letter to Trump, Iowa Corn and IRFA stated, ""Without permanent access to this market, the long-term viability of our state's largest economic driver is at serious risk. Today, we are asking for your help to finally push E15 access through Congress.""

The letter continued: ""Removing the outdated regulatory hurdle for E15 is exactly the type of government efficiency you've worked for. We urgently seek your ongoing assistance as Congress debates E15 over the next month. Permanent nationwide access to E15 is a common-sense, no-cost solution to strengthen American energy dominance and provide a vital lifeline to Iowa's growers. We look forward to your continued leadership on this issue and remain ready to work alongside you to move this critical policy across the finish line. Now is the time.""

Separately, the American Soybean Association on Monday also raised concerns about the rural energy council and the scope of work for the ad-hoc congressional group.

""The American Soybean Association appreciates the continued work of the House of Representatives to champion domestic biofuel production, but the broad latitude provided to the E15 Rural Domestic Energy Council creates new threats to programs U.S. soybean farmers rely on to advance the production of soy-based fuels,"" said Ohio farmer Scott Metzger, ASA's president. ""ASA supports the sale of year-round E15 but is concerned about the Council's review of longstanding bipartisan policies that promote the production and consumption of biodiesel, renewable diesel, and other biofuels derived from soybeans. Congress and members of the Council must guard against all efforts that seek to weaken the Renewable Fuel Standard and other policies U.S. soybean farmers rely on for domestic market demand. The open-ended directives of this Council create a dangerous precedent that threatens the foundation of the U.S. biofuel industry. The Council should not open 25 years of RFS program success during only a few weeks of review.""

ASA praised the Trump administration's 2026-27 Renewable Volume Obligations draft rule and the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit. Still, ASA added, ""Instead of studying biofuel policies with longstanding proven success, Congress should be working with the administration to ensure the swift finalization of 45Z tax guidance, robust RVOs, and finalizing EPA's proposed rule to give preference to domestic feedstocks and fuels. The work of the E15 Rural Domestic Energy Council cannot distract from getting these policies across the finish line.""

Issued pursuant to Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, the orders authorize PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM) and Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC and Duke Energy Progress (collectively, Duke Energy), respectively, to deploy backup generation resources at data centers and other major facilities.

Today’s action follows a letter Secretary Wright sent Thursday to grid operators asking them to be prepared to use backup generation if needed to mitigate the risk of blackouts from the storm. DOE estimates more than 35 GW of unused backup generation remains available nationwide. The order will help PJM and Duke respond to extreme temperatures and storm damage across the Mid-Atlantic and Carolinas and reduce costs for Americans in the days following the storm.

These actions mark the second set of emergency orders issued to PJM and Duke during Winter Storm Fern, following earlier orders to run specified resources located within the PJM and Duke regions, regardless of limits established by environmental permits or state law.

“The Trump administration is committed to unleashing all available power generation needed to keep Americans safe during Winter Storm Fern,” said U.S. Energy Secretary Wright. “Unfortunately, the last administration had the nation on track to lose significant amounts of baseload power, but we are doing everything in our power to reverse those reckless decisions. The Trump administration will continue taking action to ensure that the 35 GW of untapped backup generation that exists across the country can be deployed as needed during Winter Storm Fern and in the future.”

On day one, President Trump declared a national energy emergency(link is external) after the Biden administration’s energy subtraction agenda left behind a grid increasingly vulnerable to blackouts. According to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC)(link is external), “Winter electricity demand is rising at the fastest rate in recent years,” while the premature forced closure of reliable generation such as coal and natural gas plants leaves American families vulnerable to power outages. The NERC 2025 – 2026 Winter Reliability Assessment(link is external) further warns that areas across the continental United States have an elevated risk of blackouts during extreme weather conditions.

Power outages cost the American people $44 billion per year, according to data(link is external) from DOE’s National Laboratories. These orders will help mitigate power outages in the Mid-Atlantic and Carolinas and highlights the commonsense policies of the Trump Administration to ensure Americans have access to affordable, reliable and secure electricity.

The PJM order is in effect from January 26—January 31, 2026.

The Duke order is in effect from January 26—January 30, 2026.

BACKGROUND

To achieve this target, accelerating the development of wind and solar energy is essential.

Expanding wind and solar energy at this scale means making choices about where and how to build. Choices that will shape landscapes, communities and ecosystems for generations to come.

The Nature Conservancy's smart siting approach offers a practical roadmap for decision-makers, renewable energy actors and civil society to identify the optimal locations for renewable energy development, whilst avoiding conflict with areas of high biodiviersity or social value.

This study and guide brings together the best available science, policy context and local knowledge to answer a central question:

How can Montenegro accelerate renewable energy while protecting biodiversity and respecting social values?

The Smart Siting Approach

TNC's smart siting approach uses a robust data collection, analysis and presentation methodology to identify locations for solar and wind energy development that avoid conflict with areas of high biodiversity or social value.

Launched by TNC and local NGO Eco-Team in October 2024, the Montenegro Energy Growth and Acceleration (MEGA) project implemented TNC's smart siting approach to develop a low-conflict solar and wind siting scenario for the entire country.

Gathered around the Advisory Committee, the project was supported by the line ministries of the Government of Montenegro, International Financial Institutions and the Energy Community Secretariat, through data sharing, oversight of the study development process, verification and endorsement of the results.

The primary product of the study is granular mapping of renewable energy development potential across Montenegro, including sites suitable for Renewable Acceleration Area (RAA) designation.

Applying the approach in Montenegro can be broken down into four steps:

Identifying and applying constraints: Areas with factors that prevented utility-scale (>5MW) wind or solar development were eliminated, either for environmental reasons such as slope and terrain or legal reasons such as residential zones and zones of strict protection in national parks.

Calculating development potential: Parameters that affect the feasibility of wind and solar projects such as resource availability, (e.g. average wind speeds and solar irradiance), availability of infrastructure (e.g. proximity and capacity of electrical grids, roads) or proximity to load centers were assessed and assigned weighted values in calculations according to detailed expert input.

Estimating conflict potential: An array of datasets related to different conflict categories were compiled, such as places important for biodiversity (e.g. Important Bird Areas and other ecologically significant areas), areas of heightened socio-cultural value (e.g. sacral architecture, high landscape value viewsheds) or natural resources (e.g. valuable forests and high-value agricultural land).

Bringing all the data together: Steps 1-3 were visualised and overlaid onto maps to identify optimal locations, prioritizing places with a low potential for conflicts and high development potential.

Whilst the process was data intensive, this methodology produced a detailed and actionable mapping of renewable energy development potential and generated datasets on grid capacity, brownfield sites and rural settlements that added value beyond the project.

Contextual Challenges

Developer and investor interest is already high in Montenegro. However, development progress faces challenges that could stifle or prevent the fulfilment of the country's renewable energy potential.

These challenges - financing gaps, lengthy permitting processes and grid capacity - are magnified when projects intersect with other land uses and values, risking delays or cancellations.

These are all factors that have been highlighted as shaping the renewable energy development process and have been engaged with as part of this study

Breaking the Gridlock: The proximity of a prospective renewable energy project to high-voltage infrastructure means nothing if it's already carrying as much power as it physically can. Because the connection capacity of the electrical grid was repeatedly identified as one of the main bottlenecks, special attention was given to this criterion.

Montenegro's transmission system operator (Crnogorski elektroprenosni sistem-CGES), provided expertise and data to produce a bespoke nation-wide capacity model that was used to refine the study's development potential calculations.

Shaping Development Priorities: When identifying priority areas for development, asking the right people is just as important as having the right methodology. The MEGA project team comprised of national experts in energy, geospatial analysis, biodiversity, spatial planning and social values.

The methodology and results were verified by an independent peer-review panel, a high-level advisory board with representatives from all relevant institutions.

Two groups of subject matter experts were consulted to calculate weighting factors for Step 2 and 3 of the smart siting approach process using the well-supported Analytic Hierarchy Process. These weights were used to combine criteria into single development potential and conflict maps.

Using Brownfields to their Full Potential: Brownfields, i.e. already converted and underutilized or abandoned areas such as landfills and former industrial sites, are widely recognized as a sensible first target for development of renewable energy, firstly because their use for this purpose avoids conversion of more valuable natural or agricultural areas and secondly because they frequently possess the necessary infrastructure for development.

For these reasons, brownfields are recognized in the revised Renewable Energy Directive (RED) as priority areas for new renewable energy projects. In this analysis, particular attention was paid to brownfields by calculating their total potential separately from the other areas, but still taking into account the possible conflicts associated with their development.

MEGA Project Findings

The findings of the MEGA project are encouraging. Based on the identification and mapping of low-conflict, high development potential sites, Montenegro can meet its 2030 renewable energy targets by developing just 1/5th of the available low-conflict sites into new solar and wind plants.

Furthermore, the potential combined capacity from developing low-conflict sites, for solar and wind, is approximately 17 times larger than the current installed capacity of all energy plants in Montenegro.

Through smart siting and proactive investment, Montenegro can surpass its 50% renewable energy share target using exclusively low-conflict sites and scale up its energy production using purely renewable energy sources.

These findings strongly complement TNC's partnership agreement with the Energy Community Secretariat, supporting coordinated action on sustainable and just renewable energy deployment across the region and providing a strong analytical foundation for policy alignment.

Recommendations

Montenegro can emerge as a regional leader in accelerating renewable energy development, with a special emphasis on the potential of brownfield locations.

The approach used in Montenegro could inspire other countries in the Southeast Europe to adopt a similar strategy that balances decarbonization with biodiversity priorities, contributing to Europe’s progress towards a more sustainable energy future.

Following the findings of this study, TNC and Eco-team have developed a set of call-to-actions for stakeholders in Montenegro to help the country fulfil its renewable enery potential:

To improve the regulatory and institutional frameworks, we call on:

The Government of Montenegro to use these results as a basis for designating RAAs in national legislation and to integrate them into decarbonization measures within the national strategic documents.

Spatial planning authorities to take into account these maps when mapping locations for renewable energy development in both national and local spatial plans.

National grid operators to use the maps to inform grid optimization and development planning.

The Ministry of Energy and Mining to consider incorporating maps in the design of auctions, either as a tool for selecting locations for site-specific auctions or for assessing the sustainability of projects proposed by developers.

Competent authorities involved in renewable energy permitting to leverage the study maps to prioritize projects with low environmental and social conflicts over those following a business-as-usual approach.

To unlock investment potential, we can call on:

The Montenegrin Investment Agency to use the study findings to promote the renewable energy investments towards low-conflict locations.

Investors and commercial banks to consult maps to identify projects that are financially viable, climate neutral and sustainable, leading to reduced risk from public opposition and accelerated permitting.

financial institutions and donors to use the study results as a decision-making tool for directing financial and technical assistance to initiatives that contribute to the sustainable achievement of the national renewable energy targets.

Yet instead of expanding low-cost, reliable clean power, Trump is making it worse.","Clean energy is still winning. These 10 charts prove it. Solar and wind are beating new power demand, steelmaking is slowly getting off coal, and more clean energy victories are clear. Despite Trump, clean energy is leading the way even in the US.

The Republicans kneecapped America's clean energy sector. Now Trump aims to squash it. The policies Trump is targeting were enacted to help US firms compete. Trump “doesn’t understand or doesn’t care that solar, wind, and batteries are the cheapest, quickest, made-in-America energy we can deploy.""

Trump’s Opposition to Clean Energy Is Costing You Money. Until this year, America was set to embark on its largest investments in history toward clean and affordable energy and good-paying jobs. Trump has tossed that progress out the window. It’s time for Congress to intervene.

Is the US headed toward an electricity crisis of its own making? Electricity demand will clearly outpace supply in the coming years, and Trump's policies are further reducing that supply. “Just get out of the way and stop blocking solar and wind permits.""

How clean energy could save us trillions. As clean energy prices fall, a fast transition to renewable energy is the cheapest option on the table. It could save us trillions in energy costs alone. Solar energy is half the cost of the cheapest fossil option and the gap will continue growing.

There’s a $10 Trillion Antidote to Trump’s Climate Backlash. An influx of at least $10 trillion in clean technology investment is offering promise that progress can still rapidly accelerate.

Green power is the cheapest power — despite what Trump says. Analysis shows states that are growing their wind and solar power typically have lower power costs. The findings undermine Trump's main justification for his aggressive rollback of federal clean energy policies.

Trump Is Cutting Billions in Clean Energy Investments—But the Savings Are Overstated. As prices for wind and solar drop, favoring fossil fuels means the US is “putting all of our money on a horse that’s already lost.” “So let’s be clear, this is a big step back for American competitiveness.""

How the Trump Administration is Obstructing Clean Energy – and Why it Raises Your Costs. Electricity prices are rising across the US. Yet instead of expanding low-cost, reliable clean power, Trump is making it worse. Wind and solar are the cheapest and fastest ways to provide electric power today.

Chart: Clean energy remains dominant in the US — despite Trump. Trump spent much of 2025 boosting fossil fuels and blocking renewables, but 92% of new additions were solar, wind, or batteries. Trump is playing with fire by trying to limit renewable energy right when electricity demand is spiking.",,N,,2026-01-26 23:58:54.503320

Today’s Good News (And Other Updates):

EPA Funded for FY26 Well Above President Trump’s Proposed Budget

– Trump signed a government funding bill on January 23 that funds the EPA at $8.82 billion – $4.7 billion above Trump’s original budget proposal and $1.8 billion above the House Republicans’ bill, both of which would have decimated the agency. Congress also rejected a number of policy proposals that, if enshrined into law, would have further undermined EPA’s long-term public health mission. EPN’s statement and a fact sheet from the appropriations committee can be found on our website. Note: There may still be a partial shutdown this week after Senate Democrats pulled their support for the last set of funding bills that includes Homeland Security (and ICE), which would not impact EPA or the other agencies that already had funding bills signed into law.

Legal Challenges Continue

– L4GG filed a reply brief in the Appalachian Voices v. EPA case challenging the agency’s elimination of the Section 138 program (Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants). Oral argument before the DC Circuit will take place on March 16.

– L4GG successfully quashed a DOJ subpoena demanding the medical records of over 3,000 transgender youth at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles by arguing that the government’s request violated patients’ constitutional right to privacy and exceeded the government’s legal authority. Read more here.

– Related Litigation Update: We received a not-so-great ruling from the 4th Circuit in Sustainability Institute et. al. v. Trump et. al. (4th Cir. Docket No. 15-1575, January 21, 2026). The Appeals Court vacated the South Carolina District Court’s finding that EPA and USDA violated the Administrative Procedures Act in terminating EJ grants on Tucker Act jurisdictional grounds, and expressed skepticism regarding the merits of the plaintiffs’ Constitutional and statutory claims. The Southern Environmental Law Center is litigating this case and looks forward to arguing on the remand to the District Court.

(DTN) -- With the Trump administration having completed its review of proposed rules for the 45Z Clean Fuels Production tax credit ahead of President Donald Trump's visit to Iowa this week, a national biofuels group asked Trump in a letter to release the proposal.

Trump is scheduled to speak during an event in Jan. 27 in Clive, Iowa, where he is expected to talk about energy and the economy.

On Monday, Clean Fuels Alliance America made the case to Trump that biodiesel, renewable diesel and the sustainable aviation fuel industry are important to rural Americans and need federal support.

""Just last week, your administration completed interagency review on proposed rules for the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit -- we hope they will be publicized this week,"" Kurt Kovaric, vice president of federal affairs for Clean Fuels, said in a letter to Trump.

""This credit came into effect in January 2025 without sufficient guidance from the prior administration. Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July last year, Congress made substantial improvements to the credit that also need to be finalized. Again, moving forward quickly to provide reliable guidance would add certainty to the market, driving new demand for fuels and feedstock, adding jobs and economic activity in rural America.""

Kovarik said America's soybean and canola farmers, oilseed processors, livestock industry, and biodiesel, renewable diesel and SAF producers need these policies finalized.

""Regulatory delays create intolerable market uncertainty, putting the biodiesel and soybean industry's investments and planned growth at risk,"" Kovarik told Trump.

""Providing market certainties through 45Z guidance and final RVO's would have a near-immediate impact on fuel production and domestic commodity demand.""

Kovarik said the three industries have built more than 6.5 billion gallons of fuel production capacity in the U.S. In 2024, the industries produced more than 5 billion gallons.

""U.S. biodiesel, renewable diesel and SAF production represents 10% of the value of every bushel of soybeans grown in the United States,"" the letter said.

""In the most recent market year, Iowa produced more than 595 million bushels of soybeans worth nearly $6 billion dollars. However, due to market uncertainty, Iowa's biodiesel production has fallen by a third this year. Producers are already idle or planning to idle. Our progress is threatened by delays in policy decisions that should have been made by the preceding administration. We anticipate that you will quickly finalize these policies and secure your promise as the most pro-biofuel president in history.""

What to expect during restoration

We understand how frustrating it can be to see crews leave an area before power is restored. Restoration follows a specific sequence based on how electricity flows through the system and prioritizes critical facilities such as hospitals. Crews will return as soon as upstream repairs are completed.

If you don’t see crews working nearby, they may be repairing another part of the system that must be restored before power can safely reach your home.

For safety reasons, customers are asked not to approach workers at job sites, as these areas can be dangerous and interruptions may slow restoration progress.

Workforce safety protocols

To protect worker safety and manage fatigue, restoration personnel generally do not work more than 16 hours in a 24-hour period and do not exceed 13 consecutive days without a rest period. These protocols ensure crews can work safely and effectively while restoring power as quickly as conditions allow.

Entergy Louisiana remains focused on restoring power as safely and quickly as possible and appreciates customers’ patience during this challenging winter weather event.

Customer safety and community resources

Customers should continue to prioritize safety while outages persist.

Now Beam has announced the sale of ten EV ARC off-grid EV charging systems to a new residential development in New York—the company’s largest sale of EV ARC systems into a residential development to date.
The EV ARC systems will provide on-site EV charging for residents without the need for construction, trenching, electrical upgrades or utility coordination.
The EV ARC systems also offer property owners more flexibility than fixed charging installations do.
“Beam Global is so much more than an American EV charging infrastructure company,” said Desmond Wheatley.","Beam Global makes portable off-grid solar-powered EV charging systems. Some of the company’s most reliable customers have been government agencies and municipalities. During 2025 however, the company diversified its customer base, and saw increasing demand from commercial customers.

Now Beam has announced the sale of ten EV ARC off-grid EV charging systems to a new residential development in New York—the company’s largest sale of EV ARC systems into a residential development to date.

As the company explains, many residential developments, particularly in dense urban environments like New York, face significant challenges deploying conventional EV charging due to lack of utility circuit capacity, complex permitting processes, long timelines and high construction costs. The EV ARC systems will provide on-site EV charging for residents without the need for construction, trenching, electrical upgrades or utility coordination.

The EV ARC systems also offer property owners more flexibility than fixed charging installations do. The systems can be relocated easily as parking layouts, tenant needs or vehicle demands change over time.

“Historically, Beam Global’s customer base has been led by federal, state and municipal agencies, but we are now seeing increasing interest from residential and commercial developers,” said Beam Global CEO Desmond Wheatley. “The tens of millions of apartments and condominiums in the US represent another excellent growth opportunity for Beam Global which we have previously not addressed aggressively. This deployment in New York demonstrates that EV ARC is well suited to dense urban residential environments where traditional charging infrastructure is often impractical.”

Beam Global recently announced preliminary fourth quarter revenue for 2025—revenue increased over 50% from the prior quarter, driven by new products, expanded international activity and increased sales to commercial customers.

In prior periods, US government sales have contributed the majority of Beam Global’s revenues, but non-government commercial revenues represented approximately 84% of revenues in the fourth quarter. EV ARC sales increased in Europe—international sales accounted for approximately half of Q4 revenue. Non-EV ARC products accounted for approximately 70% of fourth quarter revenue.

“Beam Global is so much more than an American EV charging infrastructure company,” said Desmond Wheatley. “We make energy security products, we make batteries for drones and robots, we are developing secret solutions for the defense industry, our smart cities infrastructure products are expanding, we are opening new markets in the Middle East and Europe. 2025 was a challenging year as the new administration paused the electrification of the federal fleet, but Beam Global transitioned from US government-generated revenues to a truly global footprint with an expansive product portfolio. We grew Q4 revenues by 50% by selling new products into new markets.”",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/A1-4-Beam-Global-Announces-Largest-Residential-Sale-of-EV-ARC™-Systems.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 21:58:49.664581

Front-month futures soared above $6 per million British thermal units for the first time since 2022. That followed a 70% rally last week, the biggest weekly advance in records going back to 1990.

The winter storm is estimated to have knocked offline almost 10% of US natural gas production, just as demand for the heating and power-plant fuel jumped. The big freeze has strained electricity grids and crippled transport links, grounding thousands of flights.

Traders are closely watching how long the disruption to US gas output will last as the storm sweeps in, and some were caught off guard by the scale of the disruptions in key export hubs such as Louisiana and Texas. Global gas markets have seen a volatile start of the year and a bigger impact than what’s already priced in could continue to send prices higher.

A massive winter storm reached the US Atlantic Coast on Sunday, bringing heavy snow and ice, straining power grids and grounding thousands of flights at levels not seen since the pandemic.

The largest US grid operator is pushing power plants to secure natural gas supplies through the week on expectations that frigid temperatures will drive electricity usage to a winter record. Gas flows to US liquefied natural gas export plants have dipped to the lowest in a year as the winter storm disrupts output.

Natural gas prices hit the highest since December 2022, when European demand for US liquefied supplies was booming after it lost supplies from Russia following the country’s invasion of Ukraine earlier in the year.

“US gas price volatility is set to become a much bigger driver of LNG market value and risk across the next five years,” Timera Energy analysts wrote in a note.

The impact on front-month prices is also being exacerbated because the February contract expires on Wednesday, leaving liquidity relatively thin. Open-interest was less than 25,000 contracts on Monday, compared with 340,000 contracts for March futures.

The March contract climbed as much as 11% to $3.997 per million Btu, while the one for February gained as much as 19%.

In the UK, the Construction Leadership Council’s Zero Diesel Sites Route Map sets a target to cut diesel use on construction sites by 78 percent by 20354, highlighting the urgency to replace conventional generators with cleaner alternatives.
Hitachi Energy supports these hubs with its broader offering, which includes mobile BESS, charging infrastructure, and advanced energy management systems.
HyFlex, an award-winning solution, plays a key role in making hybrid energy hubs practical and scalable for zero-emission construction sites.
During these initiatives, Hitachi Energy’s HyFlex®-powered construction sites, including electric construction machinery, operated in areas without access to the power grid.","Hitachi Energy has completed the deployment of a zero-emission construction site in the United Kingdom. For four weeks, the company powered its own construction site as part of a National Grid 400 kilovolt (kV) grid connection project in Rugeley, Staffordshire, mitigating emissions from conventional diesel generators. The self-funded initiative reflects the company’s commitment to sustainability and the targets of achieving net-zero by 2050¹.

During this time, the site relied on Hitachi Energy’s HyFlex® hydrogen-powered generator supplied with clean green hydrogen from Air Products, together with a battery energy storage system (BESS). Based on an estimated electricity consumption of up to 5.2 megawatt-hour (MWh), the project avoided around five tonnes of CO₂ emissions compared to conventional diesel generators during the four-week period—roughly equivalent to two round-trip economy-class flights between London and New York. This achievement demonstrates the technology readiness for real-world application and marks a significant step toward fossil-free construction.

Green hydrogen is becoming increasingly central to the energy transition. Its versatility as a clean energy carrier offers strong potential to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors and indirectly electrify industrial processes. The construction sector alone accounts for over a third of global energy-related CO₂ emissions3, and the footprint of building operations continues to rise.

Policy momentum is accelerating this shift. In the UK, the Construction Leadership Council’s Zero Diesel Sites Route Map sets a target to cut diesel use on construction sites by 78 percent by 20354, highlighting the urgency to replace conventional generators with cleaner alternatives. As emission-free construction requirements expand across Europe, flexible energy hubs are a key enabler for sites that need affordable, reliable, and clean power. Hitachi Energy supports these hubs with its broader offering, which includes mobile BESS, charging infrastructure, and advanced energy management systems. HyFlex, an award-winning solution, plays a key role in making hybrid energy hubs practical and scalable for zero-emission construction sites.

The Rugeley case builds on the success of earlier pioneering HyFlex® deployments across Europe in collaborations involving leading companies such as Kanonaden, Volvo, the Port of Gothenburg, and Dura Vermeer. During these initiatives, Hitachi Energy’s HyFlex®-powered construction sites, including electric construction machinery, operated in areas without access to the power grid. It also enables zero emission of pollutants such as NOx and SOx, delivering very low noise and vibrations, which contributes to the wellbeing of site workers.",https://dynamicassets.hitachienergy.com/adobe/assets/urn:aaid:aem:edc28f52-658d-4997-bd57-677298415d54/as/hyflex.jpg?width=1440&height=810&smartcrop=16-9,N,,2026-01-26 21:58:36.371554

“The monument management plan was created by local officials, Tribes, and communities working together to provide certainty in how this national treasure is managed and protected.
The Trump administration eliminated the two most recently created national monuments in California, but then walked back that decision.
The administration’s threats to the nation’s national monuments have been met with protests across the country.
“Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument reflects a truth we hold sacred: the land is inseparable from who we are.","A recent, non-binding opinion from the Government Accountability Office may pave the way for Congress to begin rescinding management plans for national monuments across the country, environmentalists and experts say, potentially leading to protected areas being further opened up for resource extraction. And Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southern Utah is yet again at the center of the renewed threats to the nation’s monuments.

Designated by President Bill Clinton in 1996 and spanning 1.87 million acres of public land, it protects scores of wildlife, archeological resources and sacred sites for local tribes. Despite vast public support for the monument, Utah Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration for years worked to dismantle and downsize it, with the first Trump administration cutting 900,000 acres from the monument before the Biden administration restored it to its original size.

The monument’s resource management plan, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) opinion finds, must undergo Congressional review. Local tribes and environmental groups expect Utah’s congressional delegation to introduce a “resolution of disapproval” in the House of Representatives to overturn the monument’s management plan using the Congressional Review Act (CRA)—a 1996 law that Congress enacted to overturn certain federal agency actions through a special review process. Then Congress would have 60 days to vote on the matter. If the management plan is rescinded, the CRA requires any new plan to be substantially different from the current one that prioritizes conservation.

“Utah politicians are at it again, doing whatever they can to erode protections for our public lands,” said Tom Delehanty, senior attorney at Earthjustice, in a statement. “The monument management plan was created by local officials, Tribes, and communities working together to provide certainty in how this national treasure is managed and protected. Now Utah’s elected officials want to flush that effort down the toilet — a situation that benefits no one.”

Downsizing or rescinding national monuments has been a major goal of the Trump administration. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum issued secretarial orders calling for the review of national monuments to determine which should be downsized or eliminated to make way for more resource extraction. The Department of Justice, at the White House’s request, issued an opinion that the president has the power to review and eliminate national monuments. The Trump administration eliminated the two most recently created national monuments in California, but then walked back that decision.

The administration’s threats to the nation’s national monuments have been met with protests across the country. Polling has shown that presidential use of the Antiquities Act to create national monuments is widely popular, and polling in Utah shows that three-fourths of registered voters support Grand Staircase-Escalante.

Last year, the GAO issued similar opinions regarding resource management plans issued by BLM field offices, which Congress then struck down. But those previous decisions were all for general, multi-use public lands, not national monuments.

Steve Bloch, legal director at the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, said the newest GAO opinion is a major escalation of efforts to upend land management plans, and targets national monuments specifically rather than public lands in general. This month, Congress has extended the use of the CRA to include overturning protections from mining for Minnesota’s Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, an unprecedented move to rescind an executive mineral withdrawal to allow a mine to be permitted in the area.

Resource management plans are the blueprint for how the Bureau of Land Management, which manages Grand Staircase, and other land agencies oversee protected lands, he said, guiding everything from how to protect endangered species to where new bathrooms can be built. Unlike other overturned management plans under the CRA, the overarching priority for monuments is protecting resources, he said.

For Grand Staircase, those include preserved fossils, cultural sites and unique biology and geology, Bloch said. Overturning the plan will only lead to confusion.

“We know in a place like Grand Staircase, confusion can breed on the ground impacts,” he said.

Last June, Utah Rep. Celeste Maloy, a Republican representing the district encompassing Grand Staircase-Escalante and a vocal opponent of the Antiquities Act that allows presidents to designate national monuments, wrote a letter to the GAO requesting its opinion on whether the recently approved management plan for the monument was a formal “rule”—a legally binding decision issued by federal agencies. Management plans issued by the Bureau of Land Management or other land agencies have historically not been viewed as such and have consequently not been subject to the CRA.

But the GAO’s opinion found that a resource management plan is a formal rule because it has a “future effect” on how the land within the monument is managed and has “substantial effect on non-agency parties,” such as limiting cattle grazing, mining, logging and the use of off-highway vehicles in sensitive areas.

Many of the monuments targeted are significant to local tribes, which has been a top consideration in their management. Last year, the Hopi Tribe, the Navajo Nation, the Kaibab Band of Paiute Indians, the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah, the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe and the Zuni Tribe formed the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument Inter-Tribal Coalition to advocate for the protection of the monument and help shape how it is managed. The coalition has strongly denounced the GAO’s opinion and has urged members of Congress not to overturn the current resource management plan.

Without a strong plan, the coalition said, the tribes’ ancestral lands and cultural sites will be at risk of looting and degradation.

“Whether it is through the careful stewardship of sacred sites, educating others about our respective cultures, or the deliberations that guide the balance between access and protection, our active participation in these processes reflects our sovereignty and our commitment to a shared future,” said Cassidy K. Morgan, programs and projects specialist with the Navajo Nation Heritage and Historic Preservation Department who is a member of the coalition, in a statement. “Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument reflects a truth we hold sacred: the land is inseparable from who we are. No matter the complexity of today’s debates, our guiding principle is clear: these places must be protected and honored as part of our shared heritage and as part of the life-giving system of Mother Earth.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Grosvenor-Arch-GSENM-c-Tim-Peterson.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 20:59:12.183572

-30- Washington’s Attorney General serves the people and the state of Washington.","In a multi-state lawsuit co-led by Washington, California, and Colorado, a federal judge issued a final ruling that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) illegally withheld about $1 billion in funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program from 20 states and the District of Columbia.

“All across the state, Washingtonians are embracing clean energy and switching to electric vehicles, and they need a robust network of charging stations,” Attorney General Nick Brown said. “That’s why my team and I have fought so hard to make sure the federal government follows the law and provides the funding that Congress intended.”

In the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), Congress appropriated $5 billion for the NEVI Formula Program to facilitate nationwide deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure and improve charging reliability for the public. States developed and were carrying out plans to build that network when President Trump, on day one of his administration, issued an executive order directing federal agencies to immediately stop releasing NEVI funds. Following that directive, DOT abruptly halted the NEVI program. A coalition of states led by the attorneys general of Washington, California, and Colorado sued in May and won a preliminary injunction from U.S. District Court Judge Tana Lin in June. Seven environmental non-profit organizations also joined the litigation.

Now, in her summary judgment order, Judge Lin said DOT and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) acted outside the law and their actions were arbitrary and capricious. She barred DOT and FHWA from suspending or revoking the plaintiff states’ approved electric vehicle infrastructure plans in the future and from withholding their NEVI Formula Program funds for any reason not expressly authorized by Congress in the IIJA.

“Such capriciousness runs counter to the Administrative Procedure Act; it is simply not how things are lawfully done,” Judge Lin wrote in her order.

Energy Justice Leaders are impacting Oregon energy policy.
The Energy Justice Leadership Program is environmental and energy justice in action.","Decisions related to energy utility services typically happen in spaces removed from the community members who those decisions impact — namely the everyday residential consumer, especially people with limited means. However, in the last three years, a noticeably higher number of community members have voiced their thoughts, questions, and concerns to energy decisionmakers.

Various factors have supported this surge in interest: rising utility rates; increased awareness of the many impacts of our energy system; and the work of partner organizations like the Citizens Utility Board of Oregon, the Community Energy Project, the Coalition of Communities of Color, and Verde that prioritize outreach and raise public awareness of important energy decisions.

Also driving this emerging engagement is the Energy Justice Leadership Program and the community leaders participating in it. Together, the participants have been working to make our energy system better serve Oregonians.

Now in its third year, the Energy Justice Leadership Program brings its participants, known as Energy Justice Leaders, together with advocates who engage in energy justice conversations as part of our work. The program fosters mutual learning about policy decisions ripe for community input, and about the priorities, needs, and solutions that the leaders see as crucial for the communities they work with. The leaders participating in this program are grassroots community activists from all over the state who bring a wide variety of perspectives and share the goal of making sure that decisions around Oregon energy utilities serve environmental justice communities and center their needs. Participants over the years have come from a stunning range of experiences and identities, including youth, elders, Tribal citizens, BIPOC community members, people living in rural communities, people experiencing disability, people with low incomes, environmental activists, local community activists, and more.

The obscure world of energy utility regulation

Multnomah County residents get their gas and electricity from utilities that have monopolies over their service territory, or the exclusive right to serve a particular area. That means that if a community member is unhappy with their gas or electric utility, they cannot switch to a competitor.

To make sure that customers are served well, states like Oregon established public entities to regulate these utilities. In Oregon, that regulator is a state agency called the Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC). The OPUC’s three commissioners make final decisions on many utility-related matters, including whether to approve utilities’ requests to raise rates.

The OPUC holds meetings to hear from interested parties before making decisions. However, few people know about the commission, and even fewer participate in its complex and jargon-filled processes. Although a growing number of advocates representing environmental justice communities participate (and encourage community members’ participation), those representing the interests of industry are often significantly better resourced to attend and influence the meeting outcomes.

Supporting community leadership in energy decision making

Because of the way meeting awareness, participation, and attendance is tilted, OPUC commissioners do not hear often enough from community members most impacted by their decisions. But the Energy Justice Leadership Program has set out to change that.

Energy Justice Leaders are impacting Oregon energy policy. They have voiced their communities’ needs and concerns directly to the OPUC, as well as energy utilities and the Legislature, helping shape policies and outcomes on resilience, rates, the landscape faced by low-income customers, clean energy planning, and more.

The program’s model breaks down accessibility barriers in energy policy decision-making. The Multnomah County Office of Sustainability is proud to facilitate this program along with the Coalition of Communities of Color, Verde, the Oregon Just Transition Alliance, and the NW Energy Coalition.

“This Program has increased energy decision-makers’ and advocates’ awareness of the lived experience and priorities of community members that they would often not get to hear and learn from,” said Silvia Tanner, Senior Energy Policy and Legal Analyst at the Multnomah County Office of Sustainability. “As an energy justice advocate, I owe much to this program and to the expertise that the leaders so generously share.”

As the Office of Sustainability’s co-facilitator of the program, Silvia has been engaged since Day One and has co-designed curriculum and materials, presented on utility-related topics, led participants conversations in Spanish and English (translating and interpreting from English to Spanish when needed), contributed to fundraising applications, and helped build how the program engages with participants and how the facilitators work together.

Yet despite significant progress on accessibility, much work remains to ensure that OPUC processes are accessible and well-suited to incorporate the feedback and needs of impacted community members who engage. As a result, the programs’ participants and facilitators continue to dedicate significant time and energy to supporting more accessibility at the OPUC.

The Energy Justice Leadership Program is environmental and energy justice in action. The Office of Sustainability is committed to this program because we believe in the power of rooting policy in the realities of the people they impact — an essential part of our mission of centering the priorities of frontline communities.

“The clean energy transition is vital to protecting our climate and getting to a stronger and more stable economy, but we need more than decarbonizing our energy systems,” said Silvia.

“We need a just energy transition that recognizes the needs and realities of all of our community. Getting to 100% while too many in our community continue to be disconnected is not how we should define success.”

The Northwest Energy Coalition has been leading this work with support from the Office of Sustainability and other partners. Funding from Portland Energy Conservation (PECI) and Meyer Memorial Trust has supported this program in its last three years. Meyer Memorial Trust recently announced that it will provide important funding, with NW Energy Coalition as the lead organization, to sustain the program for an additional two years. We look forward to securing additional resources to ensure the continued success of the Energy Justice Leadership Program, and to two more years of ensuring that grassroot community voices shape our energy future!",https://multco.us/sites/default/files/2026-01/20251020_113916-cropped.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 23:59:01.540799

The nuclear power industry is experiencing renewed momentum in 2026, and recent federal actions—including bipartisan support, new tax credits, and regulatory streamlining by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)—aim to reduce permitting delays and encourage investment.

Project developers and hyperscalers face ongoing risks related to permitting, fuel procurement, interconnection logistics, and complex power purchase agreement (PPA) structures, especially as they navigate evolving market rules and supply chain uncertainties.

These developments signal a strategic bet by leading technology companies that nuclear energy will be essential for meeting long-term, reliable power needs, even as they accept the risks associated with new technologies and regulatory changes.

After a busy 2025 for the nuclear power industry and its federal regulators, the opening days of 2026 have made clear that this trend is only accelerating in the year ahead. With data centers, cloud computing, and AI driving electricity demand to previously unseen levels, and hyperscalers increasingly willing to think creatively about sources of clean, reliable, baseload power, the nuclear sector—including new and existing large-scale reactor sites and innovative small modular reactors (SMRs)—is poised for a decade of rejuvenation and reinvention. To do so, however, it must capitalize on recent developments at the NRC and DOE to overcome the regulatory red tape and cost overruns that have defined the industry in recent years, while securing the trust of local communities.

The first hyperscaler to move forward in 2026 is Meta, which announced on January 9 that it would procure up to 6.6 gigawatts (GW) of nuclear energy in the PJM market from three different partners, Vistra, TerraPower, and Oklo. This includes signing 20-year PPAs with Vistra to extend the life of two existing Vistra-owned plants in Ohio totaling more than 2.1 GW, and to uprate the capacity of both facilities and another plant in Beaver Valley, Pennsylvania, by 433 megawatts (MW) of cumulative additional power.

Also in the PJM market, Meta announced a new partnership with TerraPower to fund development of at least two 345 MW next-generation Natrium reactors to generate firm power as early as 2032, along with rights to procure up to a further 2.1 GW from six additional reactors later in the decade, paired with up to 1.2 GW of built-in energy storage capacity. Finally, Meta agreed to prepay Oklo for power offtake from a new 1.2 GW Aurora powerhouse situated on the former site of the decommissioned and decontaminated Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Ohio, which served as a nuclear enrichment facility for more than 60 years, ending in the early 2000s. Oklo plans to use this funding to support buildout of this flagship facility and to support fuel procurement.

Together, these partnerships build on a busy 2025 by Meta and other hyperscalers, with numerous announcements of offtake agreements for new, existing, and expanded or extended existing nuclear projects. This includes Meta’s 20-year PPA with Constellation for 1.1 GW of power from the Illinois Clinton Clean Energy Center (announced in June 2025); Amazon’s 1.9 GW deal with Talen Energy for nuclear power from its Susquehanna, Pennsylvania, facility (also announced in June 2025); and Google’s October 2025 announcement of its agreement with NextEra to restart and procure power from the previously decommissioned Duane Arnold facility in Iowa.

Taken together, these offtake agreements and investments in the nuclear fission industry, most of which will not come into effect until the first half of the 2030s, represent a clear calculation by some of the largest and most valuable technology companies in the world that the surge in demand for reliable energy and capacity that defines the current moment will extend well into the next decade. It is also a sign that GW-scale stable, reliable baseload is worth enough to these data center and AI operators that they will take a chance on new and untested SMR technologies and the kinds of larger-scale reactors that have run into extended and expensive regulatory and supply-chain delays.[1]

Part of the calculus for these new investments may be an emerging and seemingly bipartisan commitment to the nuclear industry at the federal level. After the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act created Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Tax Credits (aka 45U credits) for existing nuclear plants[2] and new incentives for SMRs, the Trump administration has doubled down on nuclear energy—a rare area of consensus and continuity.

The Trump administration’s support for nuclear energy has taken multiple forms and is closely connected to its prioritization of AI and data center buildout as a national security priority. On May 23, 2025, President Donald Trump signed four Executive Orders (EO) aimed at reinvigorating the American nuclear power sector, with a focus on speeding the permitting process for new reactors. Since then, DOE has sought to co-locate large AI data center complexes and new generation sources on federal lands, with an emphasis on using existing federal nuclear sites to build out new nuclear generation. Additionally, President Trump issued EO 14270 on April 9, 2025, directing certain agencies, including the NRC, DOE, and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), to enact new rules to “sunset” many older regulations to streamline permitting and other processes for industry.[3]

In its most recent action on January 8, 2026, the NRC promulgated sunsetting rules pursuant to EO 14270[4] and established a default one-year sunset date for certain federal nuclear regulations on January 8, 2027, unless those rules are extended on a case-by-case basis by the NRC before that date following a public comment period. Most NRC regulations, including all those relating to its core statutory missions of protecting public health and safety and providing for the common defense, will remain unchanged by the new sunset rule. A number of duplicative and obsolete rules, however, such as those governing gaseous diffusion plants, which have been inoperable for decades (and are part of DOE’s plans to upcycle new nuclear sites), are now slated to be removed from the Federal Register early next year. Additionally, consistent with recent U.S. Supreme Court guidance in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo,[5] the NRC has targeted for removal a handful of regulations that are not directly grounded in statute, such as a rule stating that only written interpretations of NRC regulations issued by the NRC’s general counsel are binding on the commission.

One rule that was proposed for sunsetting attracted significant public comment and ultimately was reversed by the NRC upon publication of the direct final rule. The Aircraft Impact Assessment Rule was implemented in the wake of September 11, 2001, and requires each applicant to construct a new nuclear reactor in the United States to evaluate the impact of a large commercial aircraft colliding with the facility and to implement design features to keep the nuclear reactor and spent fuel areas cool and contained following such an impact.

Insights

Although efforts by the administration, NRC, and DOE to streamline regulations may bear meaningful fruit for nuclear project developers, permitting will remain a critical challenge. This is especially true for SMRs and other advanced nuclear technologies that lack an established permitting pathway for regulators to follow. Even as tech giants jockey for offtake from new nuclear projects in the coming years, project timelines will not leave much room for delays around permitting and financing, which are often issues for first-of-a-kind technologies. Additional hurdles may arise for projects built on federal DOE sites, where a history of nuclear activity and contamination may complicate both permitting and construction, and where environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act will proceed under new and untested DOE implementing procedures published in June 2025. New technologies that require design approval by the NRC also face uncertain timelines, even with the administration’s clear intent to move quickly. Accordingly, both nuclear project developers and AI and data center operators looking to partner with them must consider the risks associated with delays, especially in the context of hyperscalers who cannot accommodate significant delays to powering up new co-located facilities.

As discussed in several previous posts, FERC is currently very focused on the issue of interconnecting data centers behind the meter at existing generation sites. DOE has directed FERC to expedite rulemaking asserting jurisdiction over large load interconnections to the transmission grid. For developers and operators of large load sources like data centers, the ability to efficiently interconnect with large, co-located generating resources varies significantly by market and is often a black box with few published rules for interested parties to follow. With the recent surge in interest, this is beginning to change, as regional transmission organizations (RTOs) and independent system operators (ISOs) explore a variety of new mechanisms to fast-track critical new generation—such as MISO’s new Expedited Resource Addition Study process—or pair generation and load for study.

In an era increasingly defined by global instability, issues may arise regarding future nuclear fuel procurement, especially given that as much as 40% of global uranium supply continues to be sourced from Russia, with roughly another 17% coming from China. DOE clearly recognizes the challenge this represents and has announced a $2.7 billion investment in strengthening domestic uranium enrichment capabilities over the next decade. Even so, given the long time-horizon of the investments and PPAs under consideration, some inescapable risk exists with respect to future cycles of reactor fuel procurement. In light of this, both large load offtakers and nuclear operators will need to negotiate who bears the risks associated with the costs of fuel procurement, when those costs are incurred, and who bears the risk of cost increases associated with procuring fuel from nations free of sanctions in an evolving market.

For projects connecting new load centers with restarted or uprated nuclear reactors, additional important nuances will exist in certain markets, such as MISO or PJM, where offtake must be “sleeved” through a local utility. Some of these utilities have small existing footprints and customer bases that make the addition of a new GW-scale data center a significant portion of their overall demand. This, in turn, introduces new risks for parties around RTO/ISO market participation, transferring power via the RTO/ISO markets, and managing financial carry costs, given the potential for large pricing impacts to load serving entities that buy from the market to serve their load and have to balance the timing of payments from the customer with the timing of settlements with MISO or other system operators for both demand and power. Extended nuclear reactor outages, such as for a refueling cycle or maintenance, are typically longer in duration than other kinds of resources that smaller utilities deal with, presenting unique challenges to supply power and capacity during these outages.

Although firm, reliable power supplying data center demand is a principal benefit of procuring power from a nuclear generator, common contracting concepts for firm power resources can create accounting challenges for offtakers. Specifically, offtakers must craft provisions around the impacts of a failure to deliver that do not create a notional quantity of power expected for each measurement period—which is more challenging to achieve with a firm resource than renewable intermittent resources—while still providing comfort to the offtaker that they will get the power that they need. Crafting PPAs that have appropriate teeth without creating a notional value requires careful balancing.

Finally, where generation sources like SMRs sign behind-the-meter PPAs co-located with load before the load is served by the grid (i.e., islanded for some period of time pending system upgrades), generators often seek capacity payments for that behind-the-meter generation, which can raise lease accounting concerns for buyers.

What is Environmental Safety Consulting?

Environmental safety consulting is a service designed to help businesses navigate the complex and evolving landscape of environmental regulations. A professional environmental consultant works with you to ensure your operations comply with federal, state, and local laws, while also identifying potential hazards that could impact your employees, the community, or the environment.

The main goal of consulting is not just to meet compliance requirements, but to proactively identify and manage risks that could otherwise harm your business. This approach not only minimizes risks but also improves operational efficiency and sustainability.

At OSEA, we focus on delivering practical, actionable strategies that directly address your environmental safety concerns, ensuring you stay compliant, avoid penalties, and create a safer working environment for your employees.

How Does Environmental Safety Consulting Protect Your Business?

1. Ensuring Compliance with Complex Regulations

Staying compliant with environmental laws can be daunting, especially with constantly changing rules and standards. Non-compliance can lead to hefty fines, legal issues, and even operational disruptions. Environmental safety consultants are experts in navigating the complexities of laws such as:

EPA regulations (Environmental Protection Agency)

OSHA safety standards (Occupational Safety and Health Administration)

State and local environmental laws (varied by jurisdiction)

Our consultants review your operations, ensuring that your practices align with these regulatory requirements. With their help, you can avoid violations, protect your business from legal consequences, and foster a reputation as a responsible corporate citizen.

2. Identifying and Mitigating Workplace Hazards

Every workplace is unique, and so are its environmental and safety risks. Our consultants conduct thorough environmental risk assessments to identify environmental and safety hazards specific to your operations in areas like:

Air quality

Waste management

Water contamination

Hazardous chemical exposure

Once identified, these risks are addressed through tailored safety plans that reduce accidents and health issues. By mitigating these risks proactively, your business can prevent costly accidents, avoid employee sick days, and protect its reputation.

3. Improving Operational Sustainability

Sustainability is no longer just a buzzword; it's a necessity for businesses looking to thrive in an eco-conscious world. Environmental safety consulting helps businesses not only meet regulatory requirements but also reduce their environmental footprint.

Our consultants work with you to implement pollution prevention strategies, waste reduction measures, and energy-saving practices that align with sustainable business practices. By adopting these measures, your company will reduce its carbon footprint, conserve resources, and become more energy-efficient, all while staying compliant with industry regulations.

Key Steps in Environmental Safety Consulting: A Strategic Partnership

Environmental safety consulting isn’t a one-time service; it’s an ongoing partnership that helps your business continuously improve and stay compliant. Here’s a breakdown of the typical consulting process:

1. Initial Environmental Risk Assessment

The journey starts with a comprehensive environmental risk assessment, which serves as a ""health check"" for your business. This assessment reviews your operations, identifies potential risks, and provides insight into areas that may need immediate attention. Our consultants will evaluate:

Workplace hazards (chemical spills, air quality issues, etc.)

Waste management processes

Past compliance records

This thorough evaluation gives your business a clear picture of its environmental responsibilities and helps set the stage for future improvements.

2. Regulatory Compliance Review

With the risk assessment complete, the next step is a regulatory compliance review. This involves ensuring that your company’s operations comply with all relevant environmental laws and regulations. Our consultants meticulously cross-check your processes against federal and state regulations, including those from the EPA, OSHA, and local environmental agencies.

3. Create a Tailored Environmental Management Plan (EMP)

Once risks and regulatory gaps are identified, the next step is to create a tailored Environmental Management Plan (EMP). This plan includes specific procedures for:

Waste disposal

Pollution prevention

Emergency response protocols

Staff training

An EMP acts as a living document that outlines how your business can manage environmental risks in day-to-day operations. It ensures that your team has clear guidelines to follow, reducing the likelihood of accidents and ensuring compliance with environmental laws.

4. Implementation Support and Staff Training

Having an effective EMP in place is only part of the solution. For successful implementation, your employees need the right training. OSEA provides hands-on training programs that empower staff with the knowledge and skills necessary to implement safe practices and comply with environmental regulations.

Environmental groups are challenging the emergency orders by contending the plants are old, outdated and expensive to run.
Environmental groups say that wind, solar and other energy sources can generate enough electricity without as much pollution and carbon emissions.","Seven environmental and consumer advocacy groups filed rehearing requests Thursday in response to the U.S. Department of Energy's December order to extend the life of NIPSCO's R.M. Schahfer Generating Station in Wheatfield and another coal-fired power plant in southern Indiana.

Just Transition Northwest Indiana, the Sierra Club, Environmental Law and Policy Center, Earthjustice, Citizens Action Coalition of Indiana, Hoosier Environmental Council and Public Citizen are challenging the Department of Energy's order mandating Merrillville-based NIPSCO keep Unit 17 and Unit 18 operating for 90 days past retirement that had been planned for the end of 2025, and that CenterPoint Energy keep running its 103.7 MW Unit 2 at the F.B. Culley Generating Station in Warrick County near Evansville in southern Indiana.

“This is a needless, last-ditch effort to resuscitate a dying industry to power the AI boom,” said Ashley Williams, executive director of Just Transition Northwest Indiana. “Our communities are organizing and confronting the Trump administration’s shameful actions. This order will have irreversible consequences, locking in generations more of climate-devastating pollution and toxic coal ash waste contaminating the waterways of Jasper County and beyond. It exacerbates an affordability crisis where families are sacrificing their basic needs to pay escalating utility bills, a reality Hoosiers know all too well.”

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright declared in late December that there was an emergency in portions of the Midwest due to energy shortages and ordered NIPSCO to keep Unit 17 and Unit 18 operating for 90 days past the end of 2025. Unit 18 has already been down since July and would likely need six months to get back online, NIPSCO has disclosed. A spokeswoman last week said the company had no updates on how it is working to carry out the federal order.

""As coal-fired facilities, it would be difficult for the Schahfer Units 17 and 18 to resume operations once they have been retired,"" the Department of Energy said in its order. ""Specifically, any stop and start of operation creates heating and cooling cycles that could cause an immediate failure that could take 30-60 days to repair if a unit comes offline.""

It added that other practical issues, such as employment, contracts and permits, may greatly increase the timeline for resumption of operations. There would be significant challenges if Schahfer were to begin disassembling the plant or other related facilities.

The R.M. Schahfer plant has been operating since 1976, and the F.B. Culley generating station has been running since 1966.

Environmental groups are challenging the emergency orders by contending the plants are old, outdated and expensive to run.

""The federal government has invented a grid reliability crisis in a transparent and illegal attempt to commandeer uneconomic, dilapidated power plants, force them to operate and stick us with the bill,"" said Ben Inskeep, program director at Indianapolis-based Citizens Action Coalition. ""We are fighting back against the federal government's unprecedented overreach that will cause our utility bills to soar and choke Hoosier communities with more toxic pollution from coal.""

The DOE order said that there was not enough electric generation capacity to keep up with demand.

""Large quantities of existing generation capacity are projected to be retired each year while, at the same time, the demand for electricity is projected to increase at an accelerating pace,"" according to the order. ""Although the survey projects generation capacity to continue to increase in the coming years with the addition of new potential generation assets, the increase in capacity is largely offset by the projected retirements, and does not keep up with the growth in demand.""

Environmental groups say that wind, solar and other energy sources can generate enough electricity without as much pollution and carbon emissions.

“Cleaner power sources are available, and Schahfer and Culley were ready to stop burning coal, so the federal order for them to continue burning coal is an unwarranted extension of coal and coal ash pollution in Indiana,” said Indra Frank, coal ash advisor at Hoosier Environmental Council.

Essentially, they were reallocating a portion of the 'safety margins' within these plans. This reallocation, in turn, would lead to an increase in these MVEBs.

What's interesting here is the EPA's approach. They intended to approve this revision as a 'direct final rule' without a prior proposal. This usually signals that the agency views the submission as non-controversial, anticipating no significant objections. The detailed reasoning behind this approval was laid out in the full text of the direct final rule. The idea was simple: if no adverse comments came in by the deadline – December 1, 2008, in this case – the approval would stand. If, however, concerns were raised, the direct final rule would be withdrawn, and all comments would be addressed in a subsequent final rule. No second comment period would be opened, so it was important for interested parties to voice their opinions promptly.

For anyone wanting to dive deeper or submit their thoughts, the EPA provided clear instructions. Comments could be submitted online via www.regulations.gov, by email to febbo.carol@epa.gov, or through traditional mail or hand delivery to the EPA Region III office in Philadelphia. The key was to identify comments with Docket ID Number EPA–R03–OAR–2008–0746. The EPA also made it clear that all comments received would be part of the public docket, available online, and would include any personal information provided, unless specifically marked as Confidential Business Information (CBI).

It's a reminder that environmental regulations, while complex, are a collaborative effort. Public input is a crucial part of the process, ensuring that decisions about our air quality are made with transparency and community involvement. The Parkersburg ozone maintenance plan is just one piece of this larger puzzle, but it highlights the ongoing work to protect our environment.",https://www.oreateai.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a6p7qra6p7qra6p7.png,N,,2026-01-26 19:58:37.250411

The North Sea has been one of the largest producers of oil and methane in the world since 1975. Today, there are as many as 500 drilling platforms in the area, although not all of them are in active production. It is fair to say the area has been a vital part of the economic engine that has powered the economies of many European countries for decades.

But fossil fuels have one significant drawback — their supply is finite and it takes millions of years to make more. Humans have blown through much of the available supply in less than 100 years with little thought for what will replace them when they are exhausted.

On January 26, 2026, nine European nations that border the North Sea — the UK, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Norway, plus Iceland — are scheduled to meet in Hamburg, Germany, to sign an Offshore Wind Investment Pack For The North Sea that will lead to the creation of a 100 GW network of wind turbines in that area. The total investment between now and the end of the decade is expected to exceed $11 billion.

Part of the agreement between the ten countries and over 100 industry suppliers is to harmonize and rationalize the specifications for wind turbines and the distribution systems that will bring the electricity ashore. The goal is to reduce the cost of offshore wind by 30% through more efficient design and permitting.

A Clean Energy Hub

When complete it will be “one of the world’s largest clean energy reservoirs,” according to UK energy minister Ed Miliband, who said the UK was “standing up for our national interest” by pushing for clean energy and getting “off the fossil fuel roller coaster.”

The new wind energy platform in the North Sea could help attract well over a trillion dollars in offshore wind investment by 2040, according to WindEurope. It says the Investment Pact will provide planning and investment security and de-risk offshore wind projects. It includes a commitment to provide two sided Contracts for Difference as the standard for offshore wind auction design. Those contracts are key to unlocking investments and reduce financing costs by providing greater clarify about expected revenues.

It also advocates for remove regulatory obstacles to power purchase agreements, the direct contractual understandings between electricity producers and corporate end-consumers. “The steady pipeline of offshore wind projects will bring the needed confidence to invest in new capacity for manufacturing, ports infrastructure and vessels,” WindEurope says. It projects the wind expansion in the North Sea will create more than 90,000 jobs for workers in clean energy industries.

“Today Europe doubles down on offshore wind. Government cooperation on offshore wind buildout can help crowd in €1trillion of investments in the next decade. This is the best possible response to those who doubt Europe. And our drive to deliver energy that is homegrown, secure and affordable.” said WindEurope CEO Malgosia Bartosik.

An Answer To Davos Tirade

The signing of the new agreement comes less than a week after the squalling man-child who is the alleged president of the United States harangued world leaders at the World Economic Conference in Davos, Switzerland and criticized the plans by the UK to phase out production of North Sea oil and gas.

“There are windmills all over Europe,” the mentally deranged doofus said. “There are windmills all over the place and they are losers. One thing I’ve noticed is that the more windmills a country has, the more money that country loses and the worse that country is doing.”

Katherina Reiche, the economic minister for Germany said this week’s North Sea conference is a “nice answer” to those lunatic ravings. “Today’s investment pact provides reliable perspectives for the offshore sector, secures creation of value in Europe and brings future-proof jobs,” Reiche added.

Bloomberg reports this latest agreement reaffirms Europe’s commitment to 300 GW of renewable energy by the middle of this century. Miliband will also sign a statement of intent with Germany, Belgium, Denmark, and the Netherlands to open up cross-border offshore electricity projects, with a focus on joint planning and cost sharing.

Energy UK, the sector’s trade association in the UK, said it fully backed the “landmark efforts … to transform the North Sea into a truly regional clean power hub.” Its executive director Dhara Vyas said, “This deeper cooperation on supply chains, standardization and shared infrastructure is not just a strategic necessity, it is the most effective way to bring down energy costs for households and businesses while fueling sustainable economic growth and high-value jobs for years to come.” Last year, wind and solar overtook fossil fuels in the EU’s power generation by generating 30% of its electricity.

Challenges

The governments involved in the North Sea wind energy pact are also pledging to bolster the push for clean power with their own domestic initiatives. While the UK has stepped up support for the technology, which resulted in a record wind auction earlier this month, the most recent zero subsidy tender in Germany attracted no bidders. Upcoming rounds also risk failure, Bloomberg said.

“In this respect, we will adjust the tender design and areas so that we can offer a good investment framework,” said Reiche, adding that the changes will be paired with so-called contracts for difference, which provide a minimum subsidy and an upper cap.

The North Sea summit follows two similar gatherings in the past three years in which countries bordering the North Sea set out plans to install 300 GW of capacity — up from about 35 GW currently — in response to the energy crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. NATO and the European Commission are also taking part, with Iceland joining despite not being a North Sea nation.

Oil and gas extraction in the North Sea accounts for more than 9% of historical global greenhouse gas emissions, said climate non-profit 350.org, citing calculations by Oil Change International. “Transforming the North Sea into a renewable energy hub would not erase that damage, but it could begin to correct it,” said Clémence Dubois, the group’s campaign manager.

Closer cooperation between countries might also help protect conservation areas, according to Felix Schmidt, policy advisor for WWF Germany. “At the moment, biodiversity doesn’t have the priority in marine-protected areas in the North Sea, given the numerous economic uses that continue to take place within these areas,” he said.

Among its other advantages, the new offshore wind agreements will help deliver more clean energy at lower prices for people and businesses all across Europe. It’s hard to see why that would bother some people so much — unless they have a personal financial stake in selling fossil fuels.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/offshore-wind-farm-construction-maersk-vessel-800x416.png,N,,2026-01-26 18:59:16.764428

-30- Washington’s Attorney General serves the people and the state of Washington.","In a multi-state lawsuit co-led by Washington, California, and Colorado, a federal judge issued a final ruling that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) illegally withheld about $1 billion in funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program from 20 states and the District of Columbia.

“All across the state, Washingtonians are embracing clean energy and switching to electric vehicles, and they need a robust network of charging stations,” Attorney General Nick Brown said. “That’s why my team and I have fought so hard to make sure the federal government follows the law and provides the funding that Congress intended.”

In the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), Congress appropriated $5 billion for the NEVI Formula Program to facilitate nationwide deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure and improve charging reliability for the public. States developed and were carrying out plans to build that network when President Trump, on day one of his administration, issued an executive order directing federal agencies to immediately stop releasing NEVI funds. Following that directive, DOT abruptly halted the NEVI program. A coalition of states led by the attorneys general of Washington, California, and Colorado sued in May and won a preliminary injunction from U.S. District Court Judge Tana Lin in June. Seven environmental non-profit organizations also joined the litigation.

Now, in her summary judgment order, Judge Lin said DOT and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) acted outside the law and their actions were arbitrary and capricious. She barred DOT and FHWA from suspending or revoking the plaintiff states’ approved electric vehicle infrastructure plans in the future and from withholding their NEVI Formula Program funds for any reason not expressly authorized by Congress in the IIJA.

“Such capriciousness runs counter to the Administrative Procedure Act; it is simply not how things are lawfully done,” Judge Lin wrote in her order.

EV lease returns are projected to exceed 300,000 units in 2026, driven by heavy leasing in 2022–23.

Most off-lease vehicles will be low-mileage and warranty-backed, supporting CPO and retail opportunities.

Dealers who align acquisition and pricing with local demand are best positioned to capitalize on the influx.

More than 300,000 electric vehicles are expected to return from lease in 2026, representing an increase of more than 200% from the 123,000 units projected for 2025. The surge stems largely from elevated leasing activity in 2022 and 2023, when federal and state incentives sharply reduced monthly payments, according to CDK Global data.

That leasing wave was driven in part by provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act that allowed leased EVs, classified as commercial vehicles, to qualify for the full $7,500 federal tax credit regardless of domestic sourcing requirements. Dealers were able to pass those savings on to consumers, even when the same vehicles did not qualify for incentives if purchased outright.

Sign up for CBT News’ daily newsletter and get the latest industry stories delivered straight to your inbox.

When combined with aggressive state-level incentives, lease payments fell dramatically in many markets, in some cases approaching zero dollars per month. As a result, EV lease penetration climbed from about 15% in 2022 to 67% by March 2025. During that period, nearly 1 million EV leases were written, accounting for close to half of all franchise EV sales.

Most vehicles returning in 2026 will be two- to three-year-old models from the 2022 and 2023 model years, typically with about 25,000 miles. Many will still carry factory warranties, including federally mandated battery coverage of eight years or 100,000 miles. That remaining coverage is expected to support resale demand, particularly among first-time EV buyers.

At the same time, the pre-owned EV market has begun to stabilize after several volatile years. Average used EV list prices hovered near $37,000 in 2025, with nearly one-third of listings priced below $25,000. As the market matures, depreciation rates have moderated, improving value retention for some models.

For dealers, acquisition dynamics are also shifting as many leases written in 2022 and 2023 assumed residual values near 50%, while current market estimates place actual residuals closer to 35% to 40%. That gap is expected to push more off-lease vehicles to auction, creating buying opportunities for retailers that understand their local demand patterns.

As the supply of used EVs grows, dealerships’ success will increasingly depend on a combination of local market insight and customer education. This is because demand is variable, influenced by factors like charging infrastructure, available incentives, and consumer familiarity. By providing customers with a clear understanding of ownership costs and warranty coverage, dealers will be better positioned in this evolving market.

Energy efficiency could lower power bills for households and reduce energy burdens in low-income communities.
But given the rapidly evolving risks that data centers pose to the grid, scaling up these programs now is instrumental in mitigating their impacts.","In November, the Kansas Corporation Commission approved a groundbreaking settlement agreement that establishes a new rate structure for large-load customers like data centers. The agreement brought together a diverse group of perspectives, including NRDC, the Data Center Coalition, Google, staff from the Kansas Corporation Commission and Kansas’s largest electric utility, Evergy.

The settlement agreement includes robust financial requirements, including up-front deposits, a minimum 12-year contract term, 80 percent minimum demand charges, and exit fees. Evergy’s approved rate also allows large-load customers to voluntarily invest in their own clean energy generating resources, similar to the terms that Nevada approved in NV Energy’s Clean Transition Tariff in May 2025.

What makes this settlement especially innovative is that in addition to bringing their own clean energy supply, large customers can also invest in distributed resources, including energy efficiency (EE), battery storage, and other demand-side management (DSM) programs.

Electrical grids are designed to meet electricity demand at its peak, which only occurs a few hours a year. These peaks determine how much generation, transmission, and distribution must be built, and how much customers must ultimately pay. The system often relies on the most expensive and often polluting resources to meet peak needs.

Massive data centers, most of which operate near full capacity 24/7, significantly raise these peaks, straining the grid and driving up costs. Programs that reduce demand during peak hours could defer or avoid the need for new generation and infrastructure investments, lowering bills for all customers.

To that end, the Kansas settlement incentivizes data centers to participate in demand response programs. However, only a small subset of data centers can currently reduce or shift their load, making it critical to look at other peak-reduction strategies.

Distributed resources are proven, cost-effective, and fast to deploy. EE, DSM, and battery storage bring with them grid benefits—they can help mitigate peak demand, enhance grid reliability, and reduce the need to rely on higher-emitting resources during peak hours or periods of system stress.

Importantly, well-designed, customer-sided programs can deliver benefits directly to the communities that need them the most. Energy efficiency could lower power bills for households and reduce energy burdens in low-income communities. Large-load customers are uniquely positioned to contribute to these outcomes by directly investing in community-focused programs.

Customer-funded EE and DSM programs are not new. But given the rapidly evolving risks that data centers pose to the grid, scaling up these programs now is instrumental in mitigating their impacts.

The settlement establishes these critically important pathways, yet participation remains voluntary. Realizing its potential depends on how data centers and regulators implement these programs.

Many data centers have corporate social and environmental goals aligned with these programs. Given the significant impacts of data center developments and the enormous wealth behind these developers, now is the time for data centers to deliver on the economic benefits they have promised by opting into these programs.

Demand-side solutions are gaining increasing attention in other states. Legislation recently passed in Minnesota makes it a requirement for data centers to pay into an energy conservation and weatherization fund to benefit low-income customers. And data centers might be required to curtail their load or provide capacity resources to reduce peak demand, such as in Texas’s passed legislation or in FERC’s recently issued order to PJM.

Data centers are reshaping our energy future. They can either deepen the challenges or help solve them. The Kansas settlement has shown that collaboration and innovation can create win-win solutions that protect affordability, reliability, and our climate.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2023-05/nrdc-media-logo-teaser.png?h=ec041e41&itok=UFakqxFX,N,,2026-01-26 21:58:41.039481

Dear Administrator Zeldin:

The undersigned conservative organizations want to commend you for your leadership in 2025 and look forward to working with you in 2026.

In your first year, you faced an incredible challenge to undo the damage from the previous administration. You have been successful in making this happen while simultaneously advancing a proactive agenda that recognizes environmental protection doesn’t require ignoring the rule of law or sound science.

A significant amount of attention has rightly been paid to the EPA’s decision to reconsider the 2009 endangerment finding. You didn’t back down from the scare tactics and handwringing from climate extremists over revisiting the flawed 2009 finding. Instead, the agency proposed a detailed rule outlining the problems with the endangerment finding. It also made an overwhelming case based on numerous legal arguments as to why the EPA doesn’t have statutory authority to promulgate greenhouse gas standards for new motor vehicles.

Your strong leadership goes well beyond the work on the endangerment finding. You led the fight against the Inflation Reduction Act’s abuse of taxpayer dollars, such as through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. In March 2025, you announced 31 deregulatory actions in what you called “the greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen.” This was not some mere announcement but a clear blueprint detailing what to expect from the agency. And you are delivering on this ambitious agenda.

The use of sound science is critical across the federal government, especially at the EPA. President Donald Trump has demonstrated his commitment to sound science through his May 2025 executive order “Restoring Gold Standard Science.” The executive order also demonstrates a commitment to properly consider risk. The executive order states “Highly unlikely and overly precautionary assumptions and scenarios should only be relied upon in agency decision-making where required by law or otherwise pertinent to the agency’s action.”

You have also demonstrated this commitment to sound science and proper risk assessment on issues ranging from Clean Air Act regulation to pesticide regulation. In the past, one of the biggest problems at the EPA has been statutory overreach. Another major problem though has been the agency’s use of junk science, unreasonable risk assessments, and the lack of transparency. The EPA under your leadership appears to recognize this problem.

Imposing an air standard that can have severe economic effects or not approving a chemical that can improve the day-to-day lives of Americans can hurt Americans, drive up prices, and restrict freedom. Therefore, it is critical that such an action is only taken when gold standard science has been the foundation of that action.

As we look back though on what you have accomplished, we want you to know that you have exceeded any reasonable expectations we could have had for a strong EPA administrator.

Please also know that we are available to help make 2026 at the EPA even better than 2025.

While rare earths are not, in fact, rare, it is harder to find them in high enough concentrations to economically mine and process them.
The heavier rare earths are even more difficult to extract in large enough amounts.
The government also has a deal with critical minerals processor, Indiana-based ReElement Technologies, for the rights to buy stock.
Lynas is the world’s largest rare earths player outside China and is currently considering developing projects in Texas.","Since Trump began his second term, the federal government has acquired ownership—or the right to purchase shares—in at least 10 companies. These include a “golden share” in Nippon Steel–owned U.S. Steel and becoming the largest shareholder in USA Rare Earth’s rival, MP Materials. The wave of dealmaking increasingly makes Trump the CEO-in-chief.

Six of the 10 pertain to the critical minerals industry, including rare earths, as the U.S. increasingly tries to break China’s near monopoly on a sector that’s vital to manufacturing everything from military equipment to cars to high-powered computing and data centers. Since Trump initiated tariff wars worldwide, China has leveraged its critical minerals and high-powered, magnet-manufacturing dominance.

“USA Rare Earth’s heavy critical minerals project is essential to restoring U.S. critical mineral independence,” said U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in a statement. “This investment ensures our supply chains are resilient and no longer reliant on foreign nations.”

USA Rare Earth’s (USAR) stock jumped about 6% on Jan. 26 by afternoon trading after the deal was announced, increasing its market cap to about $3.7 billion. The stock is up 125% since the beginning of the year.

The government’s ownership stake could range from 8% to 16% depending on whether all the warrants are executed, according to an SEC filing Jan. 26. The deal includes $277 million in direct federal funding and a $1.3 billion loan through the CHIPS Act. USAR also announced a PIPE (private investment in public equity) deal for $1.5 billion led by large mutual fund players. In PIPE deals, public companies raise fast capital by selling securities directly to private, institutional investors at a negotiated price, typically at a discount.

Industry analyst Neal Dingmann of William Blair said in a note there’s a likely “assumption that there is more government rare earth funding to come” for other companies.

The USAR deal gave the U.S. government a nearly 31% discount on its shares compared with its Jan. 23 closing price. The agreement triggered a subsequent jump in the share price.

While the USAR deal comes through the Commerce Department, the previous one with MP Materials was via the Defense Department, showing a lack of consistency in how the deals are negotiated as the administration takes a bespoke approach.

Likewise, the government built a guaranteed price floor into the MP Materials deal, while the USAR agreement includes no such pricing mechanism—yet. The argument is the rare earths to be mined by USAR are less common and less subject to price dumping by China.

Future of USA Rare Earth

USAR doesn’t produce much yet either, but it’s on the cusp of doing so. Its Round Top rare earths mining and processing project in West Texas is slated to open by the end of 2028—two years earlier than prior projections—and its high-powered magnet manufacturing plant in Stillwater, Okla., is slated to open by the end of this spring.

Last year, USAR bought U.K.-based Less Common Metals, giving the company a processing and metal-making hub in the U.K. with a new facility beginning construction soon in France.

The goal for USAR is to become the only domestic mine-to-magnet manufacturer specializing in the rarer heavy rare earths, especially the dysprosium and terbium metals that are key to high-powered magnets. While rare earths are not, in fact, rare, it is harder to find them in high enough concentrations to economically mine and process them. The heavier rare earths are even more difficult to extract in large enough amounts.

MP Materials is currently the nation’s only mine-to-magnet manufacturer, but MP specializes in mining the lighter rare earths at its Mountain Pass hub in California.

As for the U.S. government’s other investments in critical minerals, the Trump administration has invested in two Canadian players, Lithium Americas and Trilogy Metals—both of which are developing U.S. projects—and in North Carolina–based magnets manufacturer Vulcan Elements. The government also has a deal with critical minerals processor, Indiana-based ReElement Technologies, for the rights to buy stock.

Dingmann suggested keeping an eye on other players the administration could invest in, such as mining developers NioCorp Development, United States Antimony, and even Australia’s Lynas Rare Earths. Lynas is the world’s largest rare earths player outside China and is currently considering developing projects in Texas.","https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2247701721-e1769452471162.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2026-01-26 18:59:41.574915

Our Mission

Provide pertinent climate data and information services to State agencies and the public

Partner with the National Weather Service and the Rhode Island Water Resources Board to monitor drought

Advance the state's knowledge of climate change in alignment with the Act on Climate

Our History

2014 - Present

The Resilient Rhode Island Act was signed into law in 2014, which required the state to adaptively plan for and manage the impact of climate change. The position of State Climatologist was transitioned from URI to DEM's Office of Emergency Response to support the implementation of this new law. The transition from academia to a state agency was a pivotal moment, as the program's mission shifted from climate-agricultural research to operational climate services. Lenny Giuliano served as State Climatologist for over 10 years and formally established RISCO.

In 2021, the Resilient Rhode Island Act was succeeded by the Act on Climate, which requires the Rhode Island Executive Climate Change Coordinating Council (EC4) to “Advance the state’s understanding of the effects on climate change…” To aid the EC4 in this directive, the position of State Climatologist and the purview of RISCO was transitioned to DEM’s Office of Air Resources in 2025.

Since at least 1995, ALEC members have coalesced around common principles to guide state recycling policy, particularly on source reduction.
Some states are considering a regulatory tool called extended producer responsibility (EPR) to address recycling and solid waste consumers in the paper and packaging sectors.
First and foremost, packaging EPR programs should be a collaboration between the packaging industry and government—not driven by bans, mandates, or excessive regulation.
Meanwhile, California’s packaging EPR program will kick off in 2027 but not fully phase in until 2032.","Chairman Reeves, Chairman Todd, and Members of the Task Force:

My name is Jake Morabito, and I serve as Senior Director of Policy at the American Legislative Exchange Council. Thank you for the opportunity to speak before your committee today to share more about ALEC’s nonpartisan research and analysis on matters of recycling policy and solid waste management, as well as the efforts of our members across all 50 states to develop sound environmental policy rooted in market incentives and industry partnerships to achieve both a robust economy and the conservation of our nation’s precious natural resources and agricultural land.

In my capacity as Senior Policy Director, I also serve as director of ALEC’s Energy, Environment, and Agriculture Task Force, which consists of legislative leaders and policy experts from across the country committed to developing pragmatic and evidence-based model policy solutions across the EEA jurisdiction, including energy affordability and reliability, public lands policy and private property rights, chemical regulation and ensuring clean air to breath and fresh water to drink, and much more.

I hope you find this testimony valuable as Tennessee considers how to approach some of the emerging challenges facing not only everyday Tennesseans, but also the many small and medium-sized businesses that depend on healthy and dependable energy, environment, and agriculture to survive and thrive.

ALEC’s foundational principles of limited government, free markets, and federalism are crucial to developing effective solid waste policy in Tennessee, solving landfill capacity and strengthening Tennessee’s solid waste and recycling infrastructure for the future, all while avoiding unintended consequences for consumers and businesses.

And that brings me to the purpose of this task force and today’s meeting to address the urgent solid waste concerns facing the State of Tennessee. First, I will explain more about ALEC’s long-standing values on solid waste and recycling policy and our support for a market-oriented regulatory approach driven by incentives and partnership with industry instead of top-down government restrictions, prohibitions, or taxes. I will then dive deeper into ALEC’s model Resolution in Support of Recycling, which acknowledges the importance of sustainable product manufacturing and circularity of materials from both an environmental health and national security lens, while also ensuring that policy solutions are transparent, financially and environmentally sustainable, and grounded in tangible outcomes and measurable results, with the private sector playing a leading role. Finally, I will provide a snapshot of the state regulatory landscape as many jurisdictions work to implement new extended producer responsibility laws for the paper and packaging industries, and some lessons learned that Tennessee should keep in mind.

I should note that recycling and solid waste management are not new to the ALEC community. Since at least 1995, ALEC members have coalesced around common principles to guide state recycling policy, particularly on source reduction. ALEC’s model Resolution on Packaging and the Municipal Solid Waste Stream acknowledges that it was private sector innovation, market incentives, and public-private partnerships that helped achieve effective, integrated solid waste management programs across the country through the use of minimal packaging materials. Inefficient government prohibitions, restrictions, or new taxes on consumer packaging and solid waste only create barriers that limit industry’s ability to meet market demands.

Leading companies are already embracing what is often referred to as the “circular economy,” encouraging the reuse and recycling of materials to extend the life cycle of products, reduce the need for new resource extraction, and keep perfectly good products and resources out of the local landfill. In the technology sector, companies like Apple, Lenovo, LG, and Samsung are responding to strong signals from customers and shareholders who recognize that sustainable practices and repurposing consumer products and packaging materials just makes economic sense.

Fast forward to today. Some states are considering a regulatory tool called extended producer responsibility (EPR) to address recycling and solid waste consumers in the paper and packaging sectors. While some EPR laws have already been implemented in some sectors such as consumer electronics, batteries, and paint, the concept is now being tested in a handful of states in the paper, consumer, and commercial packaging industries.

Now, what exactly is EPR, and why is it considered a possible solution to address solid waste? In short, extended producer responsibility programs, as the name implies, seek to hold manufacturers and producers more responsible for the “end-of-life” of their products and packaging across the supply chain.

By shifting the cost and operational burden of recycling from municipalities and government entities to the product manufacturers themselves, proponents of EPR believe the program will incentivize producers to minimize packaging while adequately protecting expensive consumer goods, increasing recycling rates, promoting sustainable production, and easing pressure on landfills.

However, I will caution that not all packaging EPR laws are created equal. As I mentioned earlier, ALEC members developed a model Resolution in Support of Recycling in December 2024 that contains key principles and best practices for states considering EPR targeting the packaging industry.

First and foremost, packaging EPR programs should be a collaboration between the packaging industry and government—not driven by bans, mandates, or excessive regulation. ALEC recommends that EPR should not be administered by the Department of Environment or another government agency, but should instead be managed by a producer-led Producer Responsibility Organization (PRO).

As states select a PRO to implement EPR, all affected industry stakeholders and producers that EPR laws would regulate must be fairly represented at the table. To date, the majority of states undergoing implementation of EPR have selected one nonprofit organization to serve as their single PRO, the Circular Action Alliance (CAA), which states that they are “the only organization approved to implement U.S. EPR laws for paper and packaging.”

One of the PRO’s primary responsibilities is to collect producer fees from manufacturers and reinvest them in strengthening domestic recycling infrastructure. However, ALEC cautions that under no circumstances should these funds be diverted to general state funds or otherwise reallocated to other projects not related to EPR investments. EPR programs must be transparent and are not meant to be a piggy bank; such a move could erode trust and participation in the program among producers and consumers.

Next, EPR programs should make recycling convenient and simple for consumers to use, complement and optimize existing recycling efforts, and minimize financial burdens on both the manufacturers and consumers. Affordability should be a top priority, and states should be wary of any EPR proposals that would directly cause unreasonable price increases on the essential products and consumer brands that Tennessee families and businesses consume on a daily basis.

Instead of rushing into a full-fledged EPR program right off the bat, states may consider beginning with a needs assessment of the state’s recycling system to understand the ramifications of implementing such a program. And as some packaging EPR programs like Oregon’s begin to go online, state legislators and regulators should pay close attention to how implementation is faring, learn from their successes, and avoid repeating the mistakes of those who came before. Choosing smaller bites at the apple could be a prudent decision for states like Tennessee to begin, unlike California, which had some setbacks that caused implementation to move in fits and starts.

Finally, EPR programs should be grounded in tangible, measurable environmental outcomes, reducing packaging waste and minimizing environmental harm. Aligning state EPR programs in this way will help achieve both economic and ecological resilience while maintaining affordability and accessibility for consumers.

Before I close, I will quickly provide a snapshot of the current state legislative landscape on packaging EPR. As of January 2026, seven states have enacted new packaging EPR legislation: California, Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington. Oregon’s EPR took effect beginning last July, while requirements in other states like Colorado and Maine will begin to phase in as early as this year. Meanwhile, California’s packaging EPR program will kick off in 2027 but not fully phase in until 2032. Programs in Minnesota and Washington state are still far away from full implementation in 2029 or 2030.

As the task force considers solutions to address the pressing solid waste and recycling needs of your constituents, I encourage you to keep in mind that collaboration and partnership among state government, counties, and the private sector will be critical to getting this right. Tennessee can learn in real-time to see whether EPR programs in states like Oregon are living up to the promise of reducing packaging pollution and landfill excess without burdening businesses or raising prices for consumers. Buy-in from consumers and industry will be critical for the success of any recycling initiative or solid waste management reform. Thank you for the opportunity to speak this morning, and I welcome any questions.

For the majority of turbine subcategories, EPA determined the best system of emission reduction (BSER) for NOx remains advanced combustion controls (e.g., dry low‑NOx burners), while for new large, high‑utilization units (capacity factor above roughly 45%) BSER is combustion controls plus post‑combustion SCR.
For lower‑efficiency and medium‑sized units relying on combustion controls alone, the Rule imposes less stringent Nox limits.
Temporary turbines under this subcategory are subject to BSER of combustion controls and a NOx emission standard of 25 ppm when firing natural gas, reflecting achievable performance while recognizing their intermittent, short‑term role.
However, temporary units can substitute for offline permanent generators.","On Jan. 9, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a final rule to amend the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for Stationary Combustion Turbines and Stationary Gas Turbines, also known as the Rule. The Rule became effective on Jan. 15, and it comes nearly 20 years after the standards were last updated in 2006. According to EPA, the Rule is intended to reflect current control technology performance, reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) pollution, and streamline compliance and permitting for certain units.

Specifically, the Rule includes the following key components:

Tightens and restructures NOx limits for gas turbines and combustion turbines constructed, modified, or reconstructed after Dec. 13, 2024;

Creates a new “temporary turbine” subcategory;

Leaves sulfur dioxide (SO₂) limits largely unchanged; and

Includes a new NSPS subpart—40 CFR part 60, subpart KKKKa—and amends existing turbine NSPS subparts GG and KKKK to address technical and editorial issues.

Notably, in its Economic Impact Analysis, EPA also changed how it evaluated potential public health benefits from the Rule, which was widely reported and discussed in a number of recent media stories.

Expected Emissions, Cost, and Industry Impacts

EPA projects that the NSPS will reduce annual NOx emissions by up to roughly a few hundred tons by 2032 compared with a no‑action baseline, although this is significantly less than reductions forecast under the more stringent 2024 proposal that required selective catalytic reduction (SCR) controls on more units. EPA also emphasizes that the Rule focuses SCR requirements on a narrow slice of large, high‑utilization turbines where control costs per ton are lowest, while allowing combustion‑controls‑only compliance for the majority of new, modified, or reconstructed turbines.

Of note, EPA did not quantify or monetize public health benefits for the Rule. Historically, EPA routinely estimated and monetized public health benefits from reduced air pollution under Clean Air Act rules, often finding that these benefits far exceed compliance costs. EPA previously analyzed the benefits of reducing pollution, including but not limited to improved health outcomes, avoided healthcare costs, fewer missed workdays, and the compliance costs for industry.

While commenters and public‑interest groups argued that omitting monetized health benefits in the Rule marks a departure from that long‑standing practice, and downplays the health value of NOx reductions that contribute to lower ozone and fine particulate levels, EPA stated that the health benefit estimates from changes in NOx (and resulting ozone and particulate matter) are too uncertain to rely on in a formal regulatory context, and that assigning dollar values to lives saved or health improvements from reduced air pollution can create a “false sense of precision.” See EPA’s Economic Impact Analysis for the New Source Performance Standards Review for Stationary Combustion Turbines: Final Rule, PDF p. 41. Ultimately, EPA limited its formal economic analysis to compliance costs and cost savings relative to a no‑action baseline, while qualitatively acknowledging that NOx reductions can improve air quality and health. EPA estimates that the Rule will save power plant owners approximately $87 million over eight years.

Subcategorization and BSER Determinations

The Rule establishes multiple subcategories based on turbine size (MMBtu/hr heat input), utilization (e.g., 12‑month capacity factor), fuel type, and design efficiency, with 38% efficiency on a higher heating value (HHV) basis used to distinguish “higher” from “lower” efficiency units. For the majority of turbine subcategories, EPA determined the best system of emission reduction (BSER) for NOx remains advanced combustion controls (e.g., dry low‑NOx burners), while for new large, high‑utilization units (capacity factor above roughly 45%) BSER is combustion controls plus post‑combustion SCR. The Rule maintains existing SO₂ limits while making limited clarifications and flexibilities in how SO₂ compliance is demonstrated, based on the determination that current SO₂ standards already reflect achievable control.

Amended Nox Standards and Performance Levels

The Rule revises NOx performance standards for selected subcategories to align with what EPA finds achievable using BSER, tightening the limit for some large high‑duty turbines and setting different limits for high‑ and low‑efficiency units. For new large turbines (greater than approximately 850 MMBtu/h) with high utilization and higher efficiency, the Rule includes a stringent NOx limit (on the order of single‑digit ppm when firing natural gas) based on combustion controls plus SCR. For lower‑efficiency and medium‑sized units relying on combustion controls alone, the Rule imposes less stringent Nox limits. The Rule, generally, specifies hourly NOx standards based on the assumption that natural gas firing and operation are above 70% of base load. There are separate provisions for non‑natural gas fuels and part‑load operation, and the Rule provides a table of size‑ and duty‑based ppm limits.

New Temporary Turbine Subcategory

The Rule creates a distinct subcategory for “stationary temporary combustion turbines,” covering small and medium turbines up to 850 MMBtu/h that operate in short‑term, temporary applications (e.g., to provide power during outages or maintenance at permanent units). Temporary turbines under this subcategory are subject to BSER of combustion controls and a NOx emission standard of 25 ppm when firing natural gas, reflecting achievable performance while recognizing their intermittent, short‑term role. The Rule restricts how long a unit can be treated as temporary turbine (typically up to 24 months on‑site) and prohibits serial replacement of one temporary turbine with another solely to extend “temporary” status beyond the intended period. However, temporary units can substitute for offline permanent generators.

Monitoring, Recordkeeping, and Permitting Flexibilities

The Rule substantially reduces monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements for temporary turbines, in recognition that full NSPS‑level compliance programs can exceed the duration of temporary deployments and discourage use of such units for short‑term reliability needs. For temporary units, owners and operators must maintain on‑site documentation that each turbine is manufacturer‑certified to meet a 25‑ppm NOx rate and underwent a performance test at least once in the prior five years (for units older than five years since initial sale), rather than conducting frequent stack tests. The Rule also exempts certain combustion turbine sources from title V operating permit requirements and clarifies that some portable turbines regulated as nonroad engines under Title II are outside the scope of this NSPS, thereby reducing permitting burdens for qualifying units.

Looking Ahead

Project developers planning new large, baseload‑type gas turbines should consider whether their turbines must treat combustion controls plus SCR as the default design basis where its units exceed EPA’s high‑utilization threshold and efficiency criteria and should consider whether the turbine must meet the tighter single‑digit‑ppm‑range NOx limits in subpart KKKKa.

Owners of smaller, peaking, or intermediate‑duty turbines will, generally, meet revised limits through advanced combustion controls, but should confirm subcategory assignments (size, capacity factor, efficiency, and fuel use) early in project design to ensure the correct NSPS standard is applied.

Utilities and developers relying on short‑term power solutions should consider the use of the new temporary turbine subcategory to deploy certified low‑NOx temporary units with streamlined monitoring and permitting, while carefully managing deployment duration and documentation to maintain compliance with the temporary status limitations.

That’s according to SEMCOG planner Tyler Klifman, who spoke at a recent engagement session held in Detroit by the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy.

The SEMCOG plan proposes an $83.4 billion investment in climate work by 2050 to reach net zero emissions in the region, he said.

The council’s executive committee adopted the Southeast Michigan Healthy Climate Plan at its meeting Friday, a SEMCOG spokesperson told Planet Detroit. The plan will be submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency.

Grosse Pointe Park Mayor Sheila Tomkowiak and Detroit City Council President Pro Tem Coleman A. Young II led the task force of about 80 that developed the plan.

In Southeast Michigan, 1.4 million residents living in 500 census tracts across 60 municipalities meet or exceed the criteria for equity and environmental justice burdens, according to his presentation.

Sixty-four-percent of Southeast Michigan’s greenhouse gas emissions are from residential and industrial buildings, the SEMCOG report said.

At the same time, SEMCOG found through engagement with the public that reducing utility costs is a priority, and the actions taken “should prioritize weatherization, no-cost energy audits, expanded rebates/grants, and equitable energy.”

EGLE director: Michigan is committed to climate work

Last year was “rough” in terms of federal support, but Michigan is staying the course on its climate goals, according to the state’s top environmental regulator.

“We’re just going to have to be more innovative in certain areas, and that’s part of why we’re here,” Phil Roos, the director of the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, said at the Jan. 14 Detroit gathering that focused on the role of justice and equity in Michigan’s climate work.

The 2022 MI Healthy Climate Plan sets a goal of 100% carbon neutrality by 2050.

The impact of climate change in the state is far from abstract, Roos said, giving the examples of basement flooding due to weather, severe heat events, and increased air pollution that exacerbates asthma and other conditions.

“That’s the beauty of this and the sadness of this, that we’re already there and experiencing this right now.”

The state is doing climate work for a reason, said Jordan Power, senior climate action officer in EGLE’s Office of Climate and Energy: “It’s to improve the lives of Michiganders.”

Power detailed Michigan’s 2021 greenhouse gas inventory at the engagement session, held at the IBEW Local 58 Zero Net Energy Center in Corktown.

The largest contributor to Michigan’s greenhouse gas emissions is electric power generation, Power said.

“As we look to decarbonize the grid, we also have opportunities to increase the resiliency of the grid.”

‘Positive and timely connection’

Attendees at the EGLE gathering held discussions at their tables on what they’re doing now as it relates to the MI Healthy Climate Plan; what the ideal future looks like; and what’s needed to get there.

Will Kitchen is new to Detroit, and told Planet Detroit he hopes to support and help move forward the climate goals as an individual and with the water technology nonprofit where he works, AquaAction.

Audra Carson, a lifelong Detroiter, said she’s a community advocate and entrepreneur in the climate action space.

“If there’s a downward trend in interest for solar, that means more smaller, residential installers may have to close or lay people off.”","RICHMOND — Clean-energy advocates are asking Virginia’s utility regulator to reject a proposal from Dominion Energy to change metering rules for new solar panel users.

The proposal by Dominion Energy means people with solar panels installed might end up having to pay the company, even when they generated enough electricity to cover their usage. It would also change how excess energy is measured – from a yearly measurement to one every 30 minutes.

That means it would be virtually impossible for people to bank kilowatts during low-usage months to make up for high-usage months – and lead to higher energy bills for solar users.

Brandon Praileau, the Virginia program director with Solar United Neighbors, said the proposal could make solar a bad investment for individuals and communities.

“They would then have to pay a little bit if they were to produce the same amount and consume the same amount,” said Praileau. “The new rate that Dominion is proposing would leave them with some financial balance to pay to Dominion towards their energy bill.”

Dominion has framed the issue as a matter of fairness to those who are not solar users – and reflects the real-time realities of energy usage that face the grid.

According to Environment Virginia, the Commonwealth is a leader in renewable energy generation. Solar arrays in Virginia generated enough electricity to power 750,000 homes in 2024.

Praileau added that if Dominion’s proposal is approved, it could force many solar installers, often local businesses, to cut jobs.

“This proposal would literally have an outsized impact on people’s abilities to feed their families,” said Praileau. “If there’s a downward trend in interest for solar, that means more smaller, residential installers may have to close or lay people off.”",https://images.wydaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AdobeStock_489679479-scaled.jpeg,N,,2026-01-26 21:58:45.447528

Among the most significant changes in the new updated Taxonomy is the addition of categories focused on climate transition, expanding the Taxonomy from its initial focus on only green categories.
In the updated Taxonomy, the HKMA said: “The inclusion of transition elements in the Taxonomy is critical for driving the decarbonisation of the real economy.
It enables the mobilisation and scaling up of transition finance to high-emitting sectors, such as energy and manufacturing, to shift systematically towards more sustainable practices.
Another key change in the Taxonomy is the introduction of a Climate Change Adaptation category.","The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), Hong Kong’s central banking institution, announced the release of the Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance Phase 2A, expanding its classification system for identifying environmentally sustainable economic activities to include transition activities, climate adaptation, and a significantly broader range of sectors and economic activities.

The release of the new update follows the launch by the HKMA in May 2024 of its initial Taxonomy, aimed at providing a framework to allow investors to identify and invest in activities that generate a positive impact on the environment, and to avoid those with a negative impact, as well as to align investments with climate goals, and reduce the risk of investing in assets that are not aligned with a low-carbon future.

At the time, the HKMA said that it aimed to use a phased approach to establishing the Taxonomy, adding more sectors and categories over time, and the central bank subsequently launched a consultation on its proposed “Phase 2A” in September 2025.

Among the most significant changes in the new updated Taxonomy is the addition of categories focused on climate transition, expanding the Taxonomy from its initial focus on only green categories. With the update, the Hong Kong Taxonomy now categorizes climate mitigation activities as Green, indicating that they either already operate at net zero emissions or are aligned with a 1.5°C pathway; Transition, indicating that they are carbon-intensive activities that are on a time-bound decarbonization pathway to align with a 1.5°C trajectory that will ultimately reach net zero in 2050, or; Exclusion, indicating that they are not currently eligible under the Taxonomy, as they are either not aligned with Green or Transition criteria, are incompatible with a 1.5°C future, or are of low climate materiality, with minimal relevance to climate objectives.

In the updated Taxonomy, the HKMA said:

“The inclusion of transition elements in the Taxonomy is critical for driving the decarbonisation of the real economy. It enables the mobilisation and scaling up of transition finance to high-emitting sectors, such as energy and manufacturing, to shift systematically towards more sustainable practices. By defining credible pathways for these sectors to align with net zero goals, the Taxonomy strives to minimise economic disruption in carbon-intensive industries and promote an orderly transition, with a view to balancing environmental imperatives with economic growth.”

The updated Taxonomy introduces two classifications under the Transition category, including “Transition Activity,” which refers to economic activities that are not yet aligned with a 1.5°C pathway but are progressing towards alignment, or enable significant short-term emissions reductions, and “Transition Measure,” referring to specific activity components that could partially improve the emission performance of the activity, such as the purchase of low-carbon energy for aluminum production.

Notably, the criteria utilized for the updated Taxonomy’s transition category include a requirement for the activity to be “time-bound,” with eligibility limited to a prescribed sunset date, which varies by sector and activity based on factors such as technological readiness, environmental impact, and regulatory policies, among others.

Another key change in the Taxonomy is the introduction of a Climate Change Adaptation category. The new category initially includes “adapting measures,” or subcomponents of activities rather than complete standalone activities, such as technologies, processes, materials, practices, or services that positively contribute to the resilience and adaptation of broader activities. The category also launches with a “whitelist” approach, with a curated list of measures that are automatically deemed eligible without the need to meet specific criteria. The HKMA said that in the future, “as global and local understanding of adaptation improve and Hong Kong-specific criteria and thresholds are more robustly established, other more sophisticated assessment approaches… may be explored.”

The update also significantly expands the sectors covered under the Taxonomy from 4 to 6, adding Manufacturing, and Information & Communications Technology, and more than doubles the number of economic activities from 12 to 25, adding activities including transmission and distribution of electricity, district heating and cooling, and low-carbon transport infrastructure, among others.

The HKMA said that development of the next phase of the Taxonomy is already underway, with additional activities such as nuclear and natural gas-fired power generation, hydrogen for electricity generation, sustainable aviation fuel, among others being considered for future development, as well as sectors such as Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage and waste and wastewater treatment, alongside further work on adaptation and the exploration of the role of “Do No Significant Harm.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Hong-Kong-MA.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 19:58:29.798113

This legislation would establish a temporary low-emission cement, concrete, and asphalt program at the U.S. Department of Energy.","Key Takeaways:

Cement, the main building block of concrete, is responsible for about 8% of global carbon dioxide emissions.

Limestone calcined clay cement, algae-based bio-cement, and carbon-negative cement from seawater are all innovative solutions that could help reduce emissions.

Sustainable concrete provides economic benefits like lower maintenance and life-cycle costs, as well as higher durability. The global green concrete market is projected to grow from $39 billion in 2024 to $102 billion by 2032.

The most-used substance on Earth after water is concrete. In fact, the world produced over four billion metric tonnes of cement, the binder in concrete, in 2023 alone. Concrete fuels industrial growth as it provides the physical foundation of schools, hospitals, and other critical buildings, as well as transportation infrastructure.

Concrete is formed by mixing aggregates (sand and gravel) with water and cement to bind the materials together. Portland cements are the most commonly used in the United States and are very energy-intensive. Both calcination itself (the chemical process triggered by heating limestone, which is part of the cement-making process) and the burning of fossil fuels to heat cement kilns emit carbon dioxide. Producing one kilogram of cement results in one kilogram of carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere. If the cement industry were a country, it would be the third-largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world. In total, cement is responsible for most of the carbon dioxide emissions associated with concrete and about 8% of carbon emissions globally. Mixing concrete releases additional greenhouse gases, including sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which can exacerbate local air pollution.

In 2019, the carbon intensity of U.S. cement production was around 20% higher than in the rest of the world, indicating a significant opportunity for domestic innovation in this space. One way to produce lower-carbon cement is to replace clinker, the main ingredient in cement, with supplementary cementitious materials. These materials are usually industrial byproducts like fly ash, slag cement, or silica fume. The American Cement Association plans to decrease its clinker-to-cement ratio using such alternatives, from its current average of 0.88 to 0.75 by 2050. The Global Cement and Concrete Association expects the global ratio will decrease from 0.76 to 0.52 by 2050.

Some companies and universities are getting ever more creative in trying to develop low-emission cement. For example, limestone calcined clay cement is made from blended limestone and calcined clay. Other efforts are focused on bio-cement, which can be made from algae-grown limestone, while Northwestern University created a carbon-negative cement from seawater, electricity, and carbon dioxide. As for concrete, low-carbon alternatives include aerated concrete (or aircrete) made from air bubble chemical reactions, green concrete from discarded materials, and hempcrete from biocomposite materials.

One barrier to innovation is the need to update codes and standards related to concrete. According to Abigail Regitsky of Blue Horizons Foundation, current concrete standards are largely prescriptive. “You can think of this like a recipe. You are told exactly how much water, how much cement, how much aggregate, and other things to mix into your concrete. That is really limiting to innovation of these new materials. And so there are efforts to change this from a prescriptive specification to performance specifications.” Performance-based standards, which would directly consider qualities like compressive strength and chloride permeability, would create a safe and uniform system for low-carbon concrete to be produced at scale.

Using low-emission green concrete offers long-term economic benefits as durability increases, energy efficiency improves, and maintenance costs decrease. Qatar University researchers found that buildings made with a concrete mix consisting of treated wastewater, recycled concrete aggregates, and 20% fly ash saw maintenance costs decrease by 60% and life-cycle costs by 19% because the final material is stronger and less vulnerable to corrosion. The global green concrete market was valued at $39 billion in 2024, and its revenue is expected to reach nearly $102 billion by 2032. Switching to low-emission concrete can increase profits for builders by 3% to 21%.

Technology companies are also making investments. Amazon Web Services uses low-carbon concrete from American Rock Products in its new U.S. data centers, while Meta has a similar data center partnership with CarbonBuilt. Central Concrete has partnered with CarbonCure to recycle carbon dioxide waste, which CarbonCure then injects into fresh concrete.

In addition to material innovation, increasing energy efficiency is key to driving down emissions. Kiln operations can implement waste heat recovery systems, which capture and reuse waste heat from the kiln exhaust. Fuel switching is another promising strategy, though it can be challenging because cement ingredients are heated to over 2,500°F. Biomass, industrial waste, and hydrogen have potential as alternative fuel sources, and carbon capture and utilization technologies can be used to safely dispose of remaining carbon emissions.

Congress has indicated interest in low-emission cement and concrete. Sens. Chris Coons (D-Del.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), and Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) introduced the Concrete and Asphalt Innovation Act (S.1067) in March 2025 to accelerate the use of low-emission concrete and asphalt. As Sen. Tillis explained, “the Concrete and Asphalt Innovation Act is a smart, bipartisan investment in America’s industrial future, and it will strengthen domestic manufacturing, create jobs, and reduce emissions.” Meanwhile, the House passed the Innovative Mitigation Partnerships for Asphalt and Concrete Technologies (IMPACT) Act (H.R.1534), which was reintroduced by Reps. Max Miller (R-Ohio) and Valerie Foushee (D-N.C.). This legislation would establish a temporary low-emission cement, concrete, and asphalt program at the U.S. Department of Energy. According to Rep. Foushee, “We have a critical opportunity to reinvigorate our nation’s transportation infrastructure while making significant strides to reduce global emissions.” Both pieces of legislation underscore that investing in low-emission cement will keep the United States globally competitive and encourage economic growth.

With the global demand for concrete expected to increase 48% by 2050, the industry is ripe for investment to ensure that greenhouse gas emissions do not grow with it. Some companies are already finding ways to optimize concrete formulas and increase concrete recycling or material recovery. Sustainable concrete and cement production is a practical switch that can save money by building longer-lasting structures.",,N,,2026-01-26 16:59:12.678579

This interdependence is crucial: though 80% of EV charging happens at home, EVs require accessible public charging infrastructure to make long-distance travel feasible for drivers, while charging stations depend on growing EV adoption to sustain their operations. The Southeast U.S. has emerged as a critical region in this ecosystem, leading the nation in EV manufacturing and posting strong sales growth, making the buildout of robust regional charging networks especially vital to sustaining momentum.

Pulling the Plug

This critical relationship between the EV and charging infrastructure markets is what inspired the 117th Congress to fund the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program in 2022 as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The NEVI program’s goal was to jump-start a reliable, accessible cross-country interstate charging network along America’s highways.

Beginning in 2022, NEVI funds were made available to state Departments of Transportation (DOTs), including $679 million to the states SACE works in: Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. State DOTs engaged stakeholders to create state-specific EV infrastructure plans, had the plans approved by the federal government, and, by the end of 2024, began installing the NEVI network at scale.

While the NEVI program was advancing, the EV and charging infrastructure markets were growing rapidly. From 2020 to 2024, EV sales averaged 47% annual growth, while the number of public EV charging stations doubled, reaching 200,000. Which is why it is no surprise that, as the Trump Administration took the reins and ramped up its efforts to slow the country’s transition to electric transportation, it unlawfully froze funding for the NEVI program, a literal attempt to pull the plug on EVs.

Not so Fast, Mr. President

Like many of the Trump Administration’s efforts to claw back clean energy funding that Congress had appropriated and that only Congress has the legal authority to reconsider, the freezing of NEVI funding was ripe for a court challenge. The lawsuit was brought by attorneys general of nearly two dozen states, including North Carolina, and a handful of nonprofit groups representing states without participating attorneys general, including SACE. We were granted standing to represent our members in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee because they reside in those states, drive or want to drive an EV in our region and beyond, and were willing to testify about the negative impacts the funding freeze had on them.

Last week, U.S. District Court Judge Tana Lin of the Western District of Washington entered final judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, requiring the federal government to honor its commitment and fully fund the NEVI program. The Court’s order clears the way for states to implement the NEVI plans they have worked for years to develop, and permanently bars the federal government from unlawfully withdrawing states’ funds or interfering with states’ implementation.

The Court’s ruling is a victory for the plaintiffs, EV drivers, and for the EV, battery, and charging infrastructure companies that have invested over $193 billion in domestic manufacturing, and the over 211,000 American workers that are filling the jobs these investments are creating, including in the Southeast—a critical manufacturing hub for electric vehicles.

Dr. Stephen A. Smith, Executive Director of Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, said, “This is a great victory for clean energy while also overcoming an unnecessary roadblock to critical funding on the road to bringing the United States and our Southeast region into the 21st century. Electric vehicles, both large and small, are more efficient, have lower maintenance and fuel costs, and perform better than fossil fuel-powered vehicles. Electric mobility, with the significant electric vehicle manufacturing and growing battery supply chain infrastructure in the Southeast, brings good-paying jobs and makes our region and our country competitive as the world moves to an electric future. We are proud to be a part of the coalition that defeated this administration’s unlawful harassment of legally appropriated funds to grow the charging infrastructure necessary to build consumers’ confidence in driving electric.”

SACE Members Speak Up to Unlock NEVI Funds for Southeast States

As a region manufacturing EVs for the nation, the Southeast needs a reliable charging network that matches its production capacity. This is especially important now when many Southeastern families face affordability challenges. Access to reliable charging infrastructure removes a key barrier to EV ownership, and EVs offer a clear affordability solution—cheaper to operate and maintain than gas cars.

While 17 states initiated the legal challenge in April, no Southern states joined at the outset. Because only states that were formal parties to the lawsuit were guaranteed to benefit from the court’s ruling, this created a real risk that the Southeast would be left out if the court declined to grant nationwide relief. That is where SACE came in.

SACE is a member organization with over 35,000 members across the Southeast. We reached out to EV-driving and would-be EV-driving members in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee who were harmed by the NEVI program’s cancellation. Members from each state provided SACE’s legal partner, the Southern Environmental Law Center, with witness testimony describing how the lack of reliable, accessible fast charging along the region’s highways negatively impacts their ability to safely and securely own and operate an EV and reap the affordable, clean transportation benefits they sought.

Because of member testimony, SACE was granted standing in the lawsuit and served as a proxy for the states whose attorneys general chose not to participate, thereby allowing Southeastern states access to the region’s $679 million of NEVI funds. SACE and our members’ participation helped hold the Trump Administration accountable for its unlawful actions.

The successful outcome of this lawsuit ensures that the national EV fast-charging network will run through, not around, the Southeast. This is a win for the future—supporting the region’s job-creating EV supply chain manufacturers and helping remove a critical barrier to EV adoption by expanding drivers’ access to clean and affordable electric transportation through an accessible and reliable charging network.",https://cleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/cropped-sace-favicon-32x32.png,N,,2026-01-26 18:00:33.196331

So, his Aurora Solar and EV Charging Rebate Program will give residents the opportunity to reduce their own impact on global warming and other negative environmental effects, White said.
Because it is a rebate program, any work should already be complete before an application is made, according to White.
And when he was previously an alderman at-large, Laesch had a similar rebate program to the one White recently launched.","An Aurora alderman has launched a citywide program offering rebates to those who have installed solar panels or electric vehicle charging stations at their homes or businesses.

Ald. Will White, at-large, recently announced that this year he’d be committing up to $10,000 in city funds toward the Aurora Solar and EV Charging Rebate Program. Qualifying residents, businesses and nonprofits can get up to $1,000 for installing solar panels or up to $500 for installing electric vehicle chargers.

“If we all work together towards sustainable living, I think Aurora can really be a frontrunner in the state of Illinois when it comes to energy conservation and energy efficiency,” White told The Beacon-News.

He noted that Aurora already has several high-level initiatives related to sustainability, such as its 2019 Sustainability Plan, the newly-created sustainability division and the planned CEJA Workforce Development Hub. With that in mind, he started to consider how residents could get involved.

So, his Aurora Solar and EV Charging Rebate Program will give residents the opportunity to reduce their own impact on global warming and other negative environmental effects, White said.

Because it is a rebate program, any work should already be complete before an application is made, according to White. To qualify, the work needs to have been done last year or this year, so between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2026, by an electrician or contractor who is licensed by the city and provides evidence of paying prevailing wage, according to the application.

Those who apply must also be in good standing with the city and present a proof of purchase. Plus, they must have obtained all necessary permits, passed required inspections and tried to obtain a quote from a business located within Aurora.

Applications can be found on White’s alderman webpage: yourvoice.aurora.il.us/aldermanatlarge2

“My goal is to have as many people apply now, so towards the end of the year I can explore what this rebate program looks like next year,” he said.

In recent years and particularly under Mayor John Laesch, Aurora has made sustainability a key goal. The city earned a statewide award last year for its commitment to making its fleet of vehicles more sustainable by adding electric and hybrid vehicles, created the first-ever director of sustainability role, started looking into energy stretch code adoption and placed a temporary moratorium on data centers, partially citing environmental reasons.

City staff members are also developing loan programs to support sustainable upgrades for commercial and residential properties. One such program, the Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy financing program, commonly called C-PACE, is set to go before the Aurora City Council for final approval Tuesday evening.

Sustainability, particularly through green building, was a large part of Laesch’s campaign platform last year. And when he was previously an alderman at-large, Laesch had a similar rebate program to the one White recently launched.

After Laesch was sworn in as mayor and White was appointed to take his place, White said he heard from people who were interested in seeing Laesch’s program continue, so he made some changes and launched it again.

Aldermen are allocated funds each year from the city’s tax on the local Hollywood Casino to spend on those they represent, and White is committing half of his yearly amount to this program.

As for the rest of the funds, White said he has other initiatives he is exploring. One high on his priority list is permanent supportive housing for the city’s homeless population, he said, and another is centered around job opportunities for those who graduate from the planned CEJA Workforce Development Hub.

By Rachael Rossmeissl-Stone, Senior Project Manager, Partner Engineering & Science, Inc.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has finalized stronger requirements about how lead dust hazards are identified and addressed in homes and child-occupied facilities built before 1978. These changes are part of the agency’s effort to reduce lead exposure, especially for young children who are most at risk from even small amounts of lead. The changes are part of EPA’s lead hazard standards and clearance levels under the Toxic Substances Control Act.

The rule became effective in 2025, and full compliance with key elements is required starting January 12, 2026.

Basics of the New Requirements

Under the updated standards, any detectable level of lead in dust on surfaces like floors and windowsills counts as a lead hazard for the purposes of a risk assessment if it is reported by an accredited laboratory. Known as Dust-Lead Reportable Level (DLRL), this is a significant change from the past when EPA used specific numerical thresholds to determine if lead dust qualified as a hazard.

In addition, after lead cleanup or abatement work, the amount of lead that can remain before EPA considers the work complete has been lowered. For example, the allowable lead dust on floors is now 5 micrograms per square foot, with stricter amounts also set for window sills and window troughs. These post-abatement levels are now referred to as Dust-Lead Action Level (DLAL).

Who and What is Covered

These rules apply to target housing and child-occupied facilities built before 1978. Target housing generally includes residential buildings built before lead-based paint was banned, with some exceptions, and places where young children are regularly present. The standards do not themselves require evaluations or abatement, but they do set the thresholds that define when a hazard exists and when cleanup has been satisfactorily achieved.

For commercial real estate buyers, owners, lenders, and property managers, this means that when you are conducting due diligence, managing leasing and occupancy, or planning renovation or maintenance in older buildings, lead dust assessments must take into account the new, stricter levels. If a risk assessment or clearance test shows any detectable lead dust above the laboratory’s reporting limit, professionals will consider that a lead hazard for disclosure. Once the hazard has been identified, the hazard must be addressed, even if the loan or transaction that triggered the lead assessment falls through.

Practical Implications for Commercial Real Estate

These changes matter in several common CRE scenarios:

When planning renovations that disturb painted surfaces in pre-1978 residential/child-occupied properties, certified lead professionals are required by EPA’s other lead rules to use lead-safe work practices and to conduct appropriate testing before and after work. The new action levels mean post-work cleanup must be more thorough to meet the updated criteria.

Lenders should be aware that lead hazard reports based on the new limits could influence appraisals, underwriting, and risk profiles for older properties.

Managers of childcare facilities or residential spaces need to ensure compliance and protect occupants by evaluating existing lead hazards under the new reporting framework.

Complying with the New Standards

A qualified lead assessment professional can provide accurate testing, interpretation, and documentation of the new EPA standards. These experts understand how the new standards apply in real-world situations and can help owners and managers meet regulatory obligations, protect occupants, and avoid potential liabilities.

Given the complexity of EPA’s lead regulations and how they interact with other rules, such as disclosure and renovation requirements, engaging a trained consultant early in the transaction, renovation planning, or property management process is an investment in clarity and compliance.",https://www.partneresi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/New-York-Multifamily_resized.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 20:59:32.675554

Solid-state batteries are standing at the critical point of this transformation.","As global competition in the electric vehicle (EV) industry enters deeper waters, Toyota is quietly betting on a core technology that could reshape the industry: solid-state batteries.

According to The Cool Down website, Toyota’s top management recently sent a clear signal: its solid-state battery research has entered a stage of substantial progress, and future models are expected to achieve generational improvements in range, charging efficiency, and safety. If successfully implemented, this technology could redefine the competitive boundary between electric and fuel-powered vehicles.

Technological leap: the reality of 10-minute charging and 700-mile range

According to Yahoo Finance, citing Toyota, EVs equipped with solid-state batteries could theoretically:

Reach a range of about 745 miles (~1,200 km)

Reduce charging time to about 10 minutes

Achieve significantly higher energy density than current lithium-ion batteries

Substantially lower fire risk

If these figures materialize, they would directly address the three core pain points of today’s EVs: range anxiety, charging time, and usage safety.

Compared with current mainstream liquid lithium-ion batteries, solid-state batteries use a solid electrolyte, which is not only more heat-resistant and stable but also better suited for high-power fast charging. This is the key reason traditional automakers like Toyota, BMW, and Honda have increased investment in this technology in recent years.

Consumer reality: EVs still haven’t crossed the ‘psychological barrier’

Despite optimistic technological prospects, the market still faces significant hurdles.

A joint survey by The Washington Post and the University of Maryland, involving 1,404 respondents, found:

74% believe fuel vehicles are more reliable for long-distance travel

Only 10% think pure EVs are “convenient enough” for refueling

This highlights a key issue: technological progress in EVs has not fully translated into consumer trust. Range anxiety, charging queues, and inconsistent charging standards remain major obstacles to widespread adoption. This also explains why Toyota has maintained a cautious approach to “full electrification” in recent years, rather than aggressively transforming like some other automakers.

Toyota’s realistic approach: technology maturity before market hype

At an October 2024 press event, Toyota President Koji Sato told the Financial Times: “The most important thing right now is to first truly bring solid-state batteries to market before considering scaling up.”

This statement reflects Toyota’s characteristic “engineer mindset”—preferring to move slowly rather than take risks. Unlike some new automakers who adopt a “launch first, improve later” strategy, Toyota emphasizes reliability, yield, and cost control. This means solid-state batteries will not rapidly proliferate in the short term, but once mass-produced, their stability could be higher.

Integration with Tesla’s system: strategic compromise in practice

At the infrastructure level, Toyota has begun aligning with industry realities.

In October 2024, Toyota announced it would adopt Tesla’s North American Charging Standard (NACS) and integrate into Tesla’s network of roughly 12,000 Supercharger stations.

This move was regarded by Reuters and Bloomberg as an industry turning point—Tesla is effectively becoming the de facto standard-setter for North American EV charging.

The decision not only alleviates charging anxiety for Toyota users but also demonstrates traditional automakers’ heavy reliance on the broader “ecosystem” in their EV transition.

Environmental and policy perspective: solid-state batteries could be a key emission-reduction variable

Data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shows that even when accounting for battery manufacturing, EVs’ lifetime carbon emissions remain significantly lower than those of fuel vehicles.

As battery recycling technology matures and the recycling rates of critical metals like lithium, cobalt, and nickel rise, the environmental advantages of solid-state batteries will expand further.

Multiple research institutions note that solid-state batteries:

Have longer lifespans

Use resources more efficiently

Pose lower fire risks

Help reduce the overall carbon footprint of EVs

If this technology scales between 2027 and 2030, the global auto industry’s pace of emissions reduction could accelerate markedly.

If the past decade was a “proof-of-concept” period for EVs, the next five years could mark a true structural replacement phase.

States adopted restructuring in the 1990s largely because monopoly utilities made errors in technology choice and overinvested based on exaggerated demand forecasts.
Virginia, home of Data Center Alley, has entertained this strategy to avoid new, risky monopoly generation to cover data-center load growth.
Retail competition is essential for customers to take full advantage of generation competition.
Retail competition is also associated with improvements in service quality and fosters innovation in product development and customer energy-management services.","For Hoosiers, the only thing as electrifying as Indiana University football is the literal need to electrify new industry. Powering data centers and manufacturers quickly, reliably, and cost-effectively fuels Indiana’s economic development engine. Furthermore, insulating existing customers from electric costs caused by new customers is key for new industries to secure a social license to operate.

To meet modern needs, Indiana must modernize its electric policies. Hoosiers remain wedded to an outdated electric supply model where the state grants a utility an exclusive franchise over the vertical supply chain to serve captive customers. Indiana adopted this arrangement in 1913 based on assumptions that are plainly outdated today. In exchange for monopoly rights, a utility would be subject to strict cost-of-service regulation by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC).

The role of the IURC in monopoly utility oversight is to substitute for competition. Such regulation is necessary because monopolies have a motive to overcharge customers, and the cost-of-service model creates a perverse incentive for the utility to overcapitalize its assets—upon which it earns a regulated rate of return—while socializing risk on captive ratepayers. This regulatory model does not work well for power generation and retail services because they are not natural monopolies. As witnessed in other states, competitive markets tend to outperform monopoly utilities. Transmission and distribution wires have some natural monopoly characteristics; thus, a more hands-on role for cost-of-service regulation is prudent to induce economic discipline.

Wisely, Indiana allows its utilities to participate in either the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) or the PJM Interconnection. Both MISO and PJM are independent system operators (ISOs) or regional transmission organizations (RTOs) that operate wholesale electricity markets and plan regional transmission. ISOs/RTOs induce cost savings and enhance reliability by playing the role of air traffic controller for regional grids.

The Merits of Markets

There are three main paradigms for wholesale and retail electric service. The most effective is the restructured model, wherein competitive markets prevail at both wholesale and retail levels. In other words, customers can choose a competitive retail supplier to buy power on their behalf on an ISO/RTO wholesale market consisting of competitively owned power plants. Most states, including Indiana, fall under the hybrid paradigm. This comprises a competitive wholesale market run by an ISO/RTO but with power generation and retail services remaining primarily under monopoly utility control. A dwindling number of states retain monopolies and do not participate in ISOs/RTOs.

The economic case for restructuring is convincing. Evidence clearly shows that competitively owned power plants operate more cost-effectively and induce innovation, including major efficiency gains in the fossil and nuclear fleets. Yet the core of the restructuring thesis—improving incentives for investment in new power plants—is chronically understudied. In 2025, an Indiana University scholar delineated the first causal evidence that competitive reforms affect investment patterns, suggesting economic efficiency gains. This is consistent with evidence from the practitioner domain. For example, competitive electricity markets are responsible for low-cost, high efficiency natural gas plants replacing higher-cost legacy power plants in PJM during the 2010s.

Importantly, these market advantages occurred in an era of fairly straightforward investment decisions between conventional power plants. States adopted restructuring in the 1990s largely because monopoly utilities made errors in technology choice and overinvested based on exaggerated demand forecasts. The resulting costs were not internalized by utilities; rather, they were socialized among captive customers.

Today’s technology landscape involves far more complex capital-investment decisions. Unconventional supply resources like wind, solar, and storage have reached economic parity, while demand-side resources remain largely untapped. This causes a breakdown in integrated resource planning (IRP) within monopoly states. State regulators like the IURC face a growing information deficit regarding which centrally planned utility investments constitute least-cost service. The return of highly uncertain levels of demand growth compounds this, creating a major risk that utilities will not identify the correct level of investment needed.

Under the monopoly model, such risks are borne by captive ratepayers. Under the market model, those risks are borne by competitive suppliers with a record of superior risk management. Although monopoly utilities strongly lobby to retain exclusive control over generation, a single utility often lacks the balance sheet to finance new investment. Conversely, independent producers are equipped to tap a robust private capital market for more expeditious, cost-effective, and lower-risk generation investments.

Markets are also better at insulating existing customers from the costs of servicing new industries, as they exclusively assign supply costs and risks to the competitive supplier and counterparty (e.g., data center). Traditional monopoly service socializes costs and risks across their customer rate base, prompting blowback of monopoly service for new loads from existing customer groups. Unsurprisingly, native customers and growing industries have attempted to serve new customers under a market model. Virginia, home of Data Center Alley, has entertained this strategy to avoid new, risky monopoly generation to cover data-center load growth.

Retail competition is essential for customers to take full advantage of generation competition. It has also produced an array of retail options that lets consumers choose supply arrangements best suited to their preferences regarding price, budget (e.g., payment structure), risk tolerance (e.g., fixed versus variable rates), and fuel or environmental factors. Retail competition is also associated with improvements in service quality and fosters innovation in product development and customer energy-management services. It requires well-informed consumers as well as protections from deceptive advertising or marketing practices.

With this in mind, R Street issued a state retail electric scorecard in 2025, with Indiana receiving a “D.” The state could improve its score by passing legislation that provides opportunities for customers to engage third parties for services currently available only through the utility. Further improvement is possible if the IURC ensures that utilities give consumers greater choice, avoiding monopoly activity beyond what is necessary to provide basic service.

Indiana’s neighbors all scored higher on R Street’s scorecard, with Illinois and Ohio each earning a “B+,” Kentucky a “D+,” and Michigan a “C.” A review of these and other hybrid states in MISO and PJM reveals momentum toward expanding retail competition:

Illinois restructured and experienced economic benefits. The Illinois Manufacturers’ Association has been a long-time proponent of retail choice. They and other consumer groups are largely concerned with the state’s tendency to interfere with markets.

Ohio also experienced economic benefits after restructuring. The state has had problems with ring-fencing distribution monopoly utilities, who engage in self-dealing with competitive affiliates in a manner that undermines the competitive generation and retail marketplace. Utilities now seek legislation to re-regulate power generation, which customer groups like the Ohio Manufacturers’ Association strongly oppose.

Michigan caps its retail choice to 10 percent of the market. The choice program is fully subscribed, and thousands of customers remain in the queue—a strong demonstration of market demand for choice. Michigan’s large energy users group, the Association of Businesses Advocating Tariff Equity, has consistently pushed for expanded market competition through retail choice.

Kentucky utilities mostly reside in MISO or PJM and generally lack retail choice. However, large power users in the western part of the Commonwealth were given special disposition to procure power directly from the market.

Other MISO states (and some PJM states) fall under the hybrid model. Customer groups including the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group, Louisiana Energy Users Group, West Virginia Energy Users Group, Iowa Economic Alliance, Missouri Industrial Energy Consumers, and Virginia Customers for Energy Choice have been pushing for retail competition in their states for years

The clock is ticking in Indiana, which has seen the seventh-fastest increase in electric rates in the country from 2008 to 2023. Indiana’s energy competitiveness is falling behind nationally and regionally. In 2023, a peer-reviewed study found that restructuring decreased average electricity prices across the Midwest.

Although economic considerations take center stage, the environmental and governance advantages of competitive power markets are also worth noting. Markets lower emissions by enabling capital stock turnover, inducing operating efficiencies, integrating unconventional clean energy, spurring innovation, and letting environmentally inclined customers voluntarily pay a premium for cleaner supply options. Competitive markets are also associated with lower environmental compliance costs, while monopoly utilities have historically lobbied for higher-cost environmental compliance policies in order to justify expansion of their regulated rate base.

It is important to appreciate that the instrumental business interest of a cost-of-service monopoly is to secure favorable regulatory and political treatment. This perverse incentive structure has induced dozens of ethics scandals involving utilities, regulators, and legislators, including one in Indiana that resulted in the firing of the IURC chairman and three Duke Energy Indiana officials. Flipping this incentive is key to avoiding cronyism and corruption. Indeed, “accountability through competition” was part of the original restructuring thesis. The last two decades have provided evidence that competition is “the antidote for bad behavior.”

Transmission Scrutiny

Indiana is also overdue for transmission reform. Transmission expansion lags economic needs driven by load growth and generation changes, thereby increasing grid congestion costs. Meanwhile, transmission expansion costs are overly high. Transmission is the fastest-growing segment of industry capital costs over the last two decades. In the eyes of consumers and independent economists, the fault lies with a deeply flawed cost-of-service regulatory architecture.

Ideally, transmission investment policy would leverage economies of scale, advanced technologies, cost-efficient planning techniques, and competition. However, utilities centrally plan over 90 percent of new and replaced transmission expansion without economic criteria, competition, or effective cost-of-service oversight.

This results in:

Overbuilt inefficient, local transmission

Underbuilt efficient, regional and interregional transmission

Underutilization of competitive forces

Underuse of innovative technologies

Utilities are incentivized to overcapitalize their transmission rate base and stunt interstate transmission development in order to avoid lower-cost generation imports that could erode the utility’s justification for its generation rate base. A 2024 paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research quantified this perverse incentive in the MISO footprint.

Unlike generation and retail supply, which reside squarely within state authority, transmission regulation is a mixture of state and federal responsibility. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has authority over the interstate transmission planning and cost allocation rules implemented by MISO and PJM. The IURC and similar organizations in other states play a prominent role in influencing MISO and PJM practices, and primary siting authority resides with states as well.

The best practice in independent transmission planning for regional and interregional transmission is to use robust cost-benefit analysis to identify needs before putting those needs out for competitive bid. Both MISO and PJM are updating their cost-benefit analysis approach to comply with a recent FERC rulemaking. The IURC could advocate for higher-quality analysis (especially transmission cost-savings accounting), as well as improved transparency and the use of independent expertise. All of this was mentioned in a 2025 FERC complaint on MISO’s current process.

Indiana undercut transmission competition in 2023 by passing a law giving incumbent utilities a right of first refusal (ROFR) to build new lines before those projects open to competitive bidding. Passed in response to a utility lobbying effort (over objections from consumers and the Indiana chapter of Americans for Prosperity), this law will prove costly. An R Street analysis estimated the added cost of Indiana’s ROFR at $129 million for just one set of MISO transmission projects, known as Tranche 1. The ROFR has faced a series of legal challenges, with a pending request for a permanent injunction. The case lies before the same judge who granted a preliminary injunction a year ago, making it likely that the courts will toss the ROFR law.

Not only is new transmission inefficiently developed, upgrades to the existing transmission system are grossly underused. Advanced transmission technologies (ATTs) are often highly cost-effective for expanding capacity on the existing system and reducing congestion costs. This, in turn, can accelerate new power plant development by alleviating the grid constraints that create generator interconnection queue backlogs. For example, one ATT pilot in MISO netted over $100 million in savings in 2024, while another in PJM saved $1 billion in annual production costs while unlocking six gigawatts of new generation interconnection. Unlike competitive markets, in which companies adopt cost-saving technologies voluntarily, the cost-of-service model’s perverse incentive means regulation must compel utilities to adopt ATTs consistent with “good utility practice.”

Given the interstate nature of most transmission, ATTs are best adopted by state leadership and coordinated within a regional context. Although FERC issued a rule requiring utilities to adopt one type of ATT, the catalyst of ATT adoption is more likely a bottom-up regional approach. Engagement with other MISO and PJM states by the IURC and the governor’s office is key to driving more independent assessments and connecting them with state utility prudence mechanisms.

Passed in 2025, Indiana’s SB 422 requires utilities to evaluate ATTs in their IRPs, makes ATTs eligible for cost recovery, and compels the IURC to issue a study on ATT use by 2026. This is a productive step, but insufficient by itself. IRPs alone do not directly translate into investment decisions in Indiana, and there is no prudence mechanism forcing utilities to adopt ATTs. This is largely because the IURC has little functional oversight over transmission.

The IURC has no process for scrutinizing transmission projects and lacks the institutional capacity to engage adequately with MISO and PJM on transmission or oversee local transmission within state jurisdiction. Leaders must work with their state counterparts to coordinate with FERC in closing the informational and regulatory gap over local transmission projects identified in 2022 as a core transmission cost management problem, triggering a flood of consumer complaints.

The IURC is not alone in lacking state capacity; in fact, only one of 15 MISO state utility regulators has a transmission expert on staff. Whether overseeing local transmission or engaging MISO and PJM on their regional transmission processes, the IURC needs proper staff, processes, and authority to ensure cost-effective transmission.

The Options Ahead

Indiana must avoid distractions in order to move forward. Last year, the IURC approved a proposal by the Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO) to create a separate entity (“GenCo”) to serve data centers, which the utility claims will isolate the cost of new growth. However, GenCo functionally creates an inferior monopoly within a monopoly, forcing data centers to deal with a new monopoly without the cost-of-service safeguards applicable to NIPSCO. GenCo will have reduced IURC oversight over new utility generation, and the utilities’ finances will be more opaque.

The notion of any “ring-fencing” benefits of GenCo to protect existing customers is an accounting illusion. GenCo and NIPSCO still share the same parent company. Any risk GenCo incurs (e.g., costs for a failed data center deal) still falls on the balance sheet of the parent company, with credit rating and borrowing cost increases passed on to NIPSCO’s other customers. True ring-fencing would entail removing the supply risk off the utility’s books entirely by letting new business choose a competitive supplier. In other words, monopoly utility reorganization is not a substitute for retail competition.

Nationwide, the main trend in monopoly states like Indiana is to enable retail choice for business customers. Although full restructuring of generation and retail competition for all customers would be best, political economy factors sometimes favor only business customers securing competitive reforms. In fact, Indiana Industrial Energy Consumers has long called for competition. Now is the time to get it over the finish line—and two bills introduced into the Indiana assembly this January would do just that.

SB 272 would let businesses over 1 megawatt (MW) choose their electric supplier while utilities continue their role in power delivery. Businesses under 1 MW could aggregate their demand to qualify. The bill contains provisions for utility transparency and to protect against cost-shifting between choice-eligible and ineligible customers, which would elevate Indiana from laggard to on par with most states.

HB 1276 would propel Indiana to leadership status by taking competition even further, letting all customer classes choose their supplier in a phased manner: industrial customers in 2028 and residential and commercial customers in 2029. It would functionally separate competitive supply from monopoly delivery services and require utilities to divest their generation assets. This is crucially important for restructuring correctly—referred to as “quarantining the monopoly” by economists—which Ohio paid the price for not doing.",https://www.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Powerlines-Energy-Sunset-Power.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 16:59:25.065919

HOUSTON, Jan 26 (Reuters) – U.S. oil producers lost up to 2 million barrels per day or roughly 15% of national production over the weekend, analysts and traders estimated, as a winter storm swept across the country, straining energy infrastructure and power grids.

Oil production outages peaked on Saturday, consultancy ‍Energy Aspects estimated, with the Permian Basin likely to have experienced the largest share of that decline at around 1.5 million barrels per day. Production losses eased on Monday, with Permian shut-ins estimated at about 700,000 bpd and production set to be fully restored by January 30.

U.S. oil and gas producer ConocoPhillips’ Permian crude production was down by 175,000 bpd as of Sunday owing to frigid weather, according to a source familiar with the matter, who was not authorized to speak on the record.

ConocoPhillips typically does not comment on day-to-day operations, ‌a company spokesperson said.

Output in North Dakota, the third-largest oil-producing state, was estimated to be ‌down around 80,000 to 110,000 bpd as of Monday morning, said Justin Kringstad, Director of North Dakota Pipeline Authority. Associated wellhead natural gas production was estimated to be down by 0.24 to 0.33 billion cubic feet per day.

U.S. crude futures were trading at around $60.60 a barrel at 2:00 p.m. EDT, roughly 50 cents down on the day.

Chevron reported hatches were frozen open during the storm ​on Sunday in Midland, Texas, according to a regulatory filing, while several refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast reported issues related to the freezing weather. Exxon Mobil shut units at its Baytown, Texas, petrochemical complex on the east side of Houston.

There were ‍around two dozen reports of upsets at natural gas processing plants and ​compressor stations in Texas, according to regulatory filings over the weekend, but that paled in ​comparison to the more than 200 reported upsets during the first five days of a severe winter storm in 2021, TACenergy analysts ‍said in a note on Monday.

Average gas output in the Lower 48 states dropped to 106.9 bcfd so far in January, down from a monthly record high of 109.7 bcfd in December, according to LSEG, as producers shut in production.

Front-month gas futures were on track for their highest close since December 2022, rising 80 cents, or 15.2%, to $6.075 per million British thermal units.

POWER SECTOR UNDER STRAIN

Some 810,000 customers across the U.S. remained without power on Monday following the Arctic blast over ‍the weekend that brought heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain from the Ohio Valley and mid-South to New England. Cold temperatures are expected to persist for parts of the country in coming days.

The weekend snow and ice storm knocked out power to more ‍than a million homes and businesses along ‍the U.S. Gulf Coast and Southeast, including in Texas.

The largest U.S. power grid, PJM, ​anticipated generation outages for Monday would rise to 22.4 GW, or about 16% of total ​committed capacity. ⁠Most of those outages are expected in Dominion Energy’s Mid-Atlantic territory, according to PJM data.

Demand ‌on PJM was 124 GW on Monday morning, above the forecast of 123.3 GW, but PJM continues to meet demand, PJM operations data show.

Spot wholesale electricity prices were around $200 per MWh, recovering from temporary spikes over the weekend that topped $3,000 per MWh.

Next-day prices in New England soared about 82% to $313 per megawatt hour, while PJM West prices in Pennsylvania and Maryland soared about 360% to around $413, their highest since January 2014.

In the brief, the attorneys general urge the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts to grant a preliminary injunction on the grounds that the Agencies’ actions are arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because they unreasonably and unjustifiably target wind and solar development and no other energy sources.

“Wind and solar energy are more than just power sources — they lower energy bills and create good jobs, cleaner air, and a stronger future for our communities,” said Attorney General Bonta. “We will not stand by as federal actions attack these projects and take away opportunities for people to access reliable, affordable, and sustainable power. While the federal administration rigs the system for their fossil-fuel friends, we remain committed to ensuring that every family, community, and business has the chance to benefit from a clean energy future.”

The Agencies’ challenged actions make it harder to develop wind and solar projects. Each challenged action changes longstanding agency processes and legal determinations with the effect of delaying and preventing the permitting and construction of wind and solar facilities on both private and public lands. Together, the actions impose substantial and unprecedented obstacles to renewable energy development. The challenged actions include:

DOI’s unprecedented departmental review procedure, which requires wind and solar projects to be approved by three senior officials, including personal approval by the Secretary of the Interior, effectively freezing and delaying renewable energy permitting. This jeopardizes renewable project timelines and federal tax incentives.

DOI’s changes in project approval criteria to prioritize “capacity density,” a metric that inherently disadvantages wind and solar projects and effectively biases federal land permitting in favor of conventional energy sources.

Army Corps' changes in project approval criteria to consider capacity density and aesthetic impacts that systematically disadvantage wind and solar projects, including on private land, by favoring higher density conventional energy sources.

USFWS arbitrarily prohibiting wind facilities from obtaining eagle incidental take permits under Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act while allowing other energy technologies to receive such permits.

DOI arbitrarily denying wind and solar developers’ access to the publicly funded USFWS Information for Planning and Consultation database, impairing their ability to identify protected species and obtain necessary permits under the Endangered Species Act, while not imposing the same restriction on other energy technologies.

DOI’s reinstatement and reinterpretation of the Outer Continental Shelf Act, which reinterpreted the law in a narrow way to block new offshore wind projects, even though the law does not require such a prohibition.

In the amicus brief, Attorney General Bonta and the coalition support the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, asserting that the Agencies’ actions fail to provide a reasoned explanation, exceed their statutory authority, and are procedurally deficient because they were implemented without the required notice and comment process. The Agencies’ actions will not only derail the clean energy transition nationwide but will also threaten to increase consumer energy costs.

Take action: Urge Public Pensions to Adopt Climate Investment Principles

The report identifies six key takeaways that show how pensions can better manage climate risk and strengthen long-term retirement security.

1) Investing must focus on real-economy impacts, not portfolio metrics.

Because public pensions are long-term, diversified investors, their returns depend heavily on the overall health of the economy. To protect retirement savings from climate-related risks, pensions must address the root of climate-related financial risk: real-world climate impacts. One critical strategy is directing capital to projects and technologies that decarbonize the economy, build community resilience, and support a just transition.

Unfortunately, too many pensions prioritize achieving net-zero portfolio emissions over real-world emissions reductions, an approach that mostly shifts numbers on a balance sheet without reducing the underlying risks. Only investments that drive real-economy decarbonization can meaningfully protect beneficiaries’ long-term financial security. It’s critical that more pensions focus on strategies that help drive real-economy decarbonization and climate resilience, like investing in climate solutions.

2) More pensions need to set targets for climate-solutions investments.

While only a handful of pensions are taking meaningful steps today, important leadership is emerging. Five pensions have adopted time-bound, quantitative targets to invest billions in climate solutions over the next 5-10 years. Three pensions have disclosed strategies for climate-solution investments, but lack measurable targets to guide or scale these investments.

The fact that pensions of varying sizes, staffing structures, and political contexts are making these moves and setting targets demonstrates that fiduciaries view this strategy as prudent and fully consistent with fiduciary duty.

This report underscores that setting targets for climate-solutions investing is not only possible, but already underway across the public pension landscape.

3) Not all targets are created equal. Guardrails are needed.

While more pensions are beginning to set targets, not all targets are equally credible. They vary widely in scale and in whether they allow controversial technologies or false climate solutions to count toward their goals.

The most effective way for pensions to avoid greenwashing and to ensure their strategies are credible is to adopt the Principles for Climate Solutions Investments. Such policies clearly define what qualifies as a climate solution and what does not. Strong guardrails help prevent situations like classifying investments in major fossil fuel companies as “climate solutions” (which CalPERS is currently doing) and instead ensure that climate-solutions investments help drive real-economy decarbonization.

To ensure investments also support a just transition, pensions should pair these guardrails with strong labor and just transition principles.

4) Pensions need to realize that ""climate solutions” means more than clean energy.

The analysis revealed a clear trend: pensions are more heavily pursuing investments in clean energy than in any other category of climate solutions. This suggests that most pensions, and their fund managers, treat climate solutions primarily as an energy-sector issue, while overlooking other areas where investment is critically needed.

Clean energy investments are vital, but investment is needed across many sectors, including nature and biodiversity, just transition, and climate resilience.Broadening the scope of climate solutions also supports portfolio diversification, further strengthening risk management.

5) Pension boards need to be more involved in climate-risk investment strategies.

The analysis found that only 26% of pensions have boards actively engaged in a comprehensive climate strategy. Another 7% have boards focused solely on climate-related stewardship and proxy voting. This is a helpful first step, but not enough.

Boards are ultimately responsible for setting the pension’s direction and strategy, and are accountable as fiduciaries. As climate-related financial risks grow, it’s critical for boards to be actively involved in overseeing strategies that manage these risks across all investment decisions, not just stewardship.

6) Transparency and regular reporting are critical.

Regular progress reporting is essential for credible climate-strategy implementation. It enables fiduciaries, beneficiaries, and the public to understand whether commitments are being met and whether climate-related financial risks are being effectively managed.

Only four pensions analyzed provide consistent progress reports on stated climate-related targets. But even these leaders need to improve transparency, because without detailed holdings disclosures, it can be difficult to assess whether investments genuinely advance climate solutions or are greenwashing, such as counting fossil fuel investments toward climate goals.

The 2016 version of TSCA requires the EPA to affirm the safety of each new chemical before the substance enters the market.
“EPA does not meet the 90-day review deadline for the vast majority of all new chemicals submitted for EPA review,” Palmer said.
The draft bill is aimed at speeding up this process, he added.
Palmer said the draft bill will be revised in the coming weeks and eventually will be formally introduced in Congress.","Republicans and Democrats in the House of Representatives generally agree that a 2016 law is slowing the entry of new chemicals into the US market, including materials needed for artificial intelligence and military applications.

But they are at loggerheads on draft legislation that Republicans are promoting—and that the chemical industry is backing—to accelerate the pace of the US Environmental Protection Agency’s review of new substances before they enter commerce.

The EPA conducts those reviews under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), which governs industrial chemicals. When Congress updated TSCA in 2016, both industry and environmental advocates initially praised the revised statute.

But within a year, industry began complaining about delays in getting new chemicals into commerce. The 2016 version of TSCA requires the EPA to affirm the safety of each new chemical before the substance enters the market. The requirements of the revised statute have slowed premanufacture review at the agency.

“This important law is still not working as Congress intended,” said Rep. Gary Palmer (R-AL), chair of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Environment, at the panel’s Jan. 22 hearing on the draft bill to change TSCA. He deemed the process for reviewing new chemicals broken.

“EPA does not meet the 90-day review deadline for the vast majority of all new chemicals submitted for EPA review,” Palmer said. The draft bill is aimed at speeding up this process, he added.

Rep. Paul Tonko of New York, the top Democrat on the subcommittee, said he has deep concerns about part of the draft bill that would require the EPA to prioritize the use of industry-generated information in chemical reviews. Not allowing the EPA to use its expertise and experience to determine what kind of scientific data needed for a chemical review “will lead to a biased regulatory program,” Tonko said.

The draft bill would require the EPA to minimize any unreasonable risk posed by a new chemical to an extent that is reasonably feasible, said Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the Energy and Commerce Committee’s top Democrat. The current standard in TSCA is for the agency to ensure that all unreasonable risks are eliminated.

Changing this standard to feasibility would mean the extent of risk-reduction requirements from the EPA, such as requiring that workers use certain types of protective equipment, would hinge on how much they cost a company, said Tracey J. Woodruff, a professor at University of California, San Francisco, medical school. Testifying at the hearing, Woodruff said such a change would endanger people’s health.

The agency’s current practice on worker exposure drew criticism from a representative of the American Chemistry Council (ACC), the largest lobbying group of US chemical manufacturers.

“EPA has been making a fundamental mischaracterization of workplace exposure” in its new chemical reviews, said Kimberly Wise White, an ACC vice president. The agency currently assumes noncompliance with safety regulations, such as requirements that workers wear personal protective equipment, White testified at the hearing.

Instead, the EPA’s decisions “should be driven by empirical evidence, not default or overly conservative assumptions,” White said. The agency needs to consider whether existing workplace protections and Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other federal regulations are sufficient to control risks, she added.

Pallone suggested that lawmakers should call on EPA officials to discuss the review process for new chemicals and provide further insight for the next version of the draft bill.

U.S. House of Representatives

The Honorable Gary Palmer

U.S. House of Representatives

Washington, DC 20515

Dear Representatives Crenshaw and Palmer

On behalf of the undersigned organizations, representing a broad coalition of taxpayer, free-market, and consumer advocates, we write to express our strong support for H.R. 6566, the Recycling Technology Innovation Act. This important legislation provides much-needed regulatory clarity for advanced recycling technologies, giving businesses the long-term certainty necessary to develop and succeed. We are proud to endorse H.R. 6566 and urge all Members of Congress to co-sponsor and support this legislation.

Plastics are a critical input for nearly every major manufacturing sector, including electronics, automotive production, medical equipment, and consumer staples. One of the key advantages of plastics is their ability to be broken down and recycled into new products. While plastics are initially derived from petroleum, recycling keeps these finite materials in circulation and reduces strain on local waste management systems that often depend on taxpayer funding. Advanced recycling technologies not only help divert plastic from landfills, incinerators, and the environment, but also keep valuable materials within the domestic economy—strengthening U.S. supply chains and supporting American jobs.

Aligning federal policy with existing state frameworks would promote regulatory consistency, reduce confusion, and enable businesses to plan and invest with greater certainty. Indeed, many have noted that the greatest barrier to expanding advanced recycling today is not a lack of technological capability, but burdensome and outdated government regulations.

While free-market actors have successfully built this important industry, the regulatory framework governing it has not kept pace. Federal regulators have applied inconsistent interpretations of the Clean Air Act, leaving companies uncertain about how advanced recycling will be regulated and exposing them to costly and protracted litigation. In addition, some states classify advanced recycling as “waste incineration,” a designation that often prevents new facilities from becoming operational.

The Recycling Technology Innovation Act addresses this problem by providing the regulatory certainty businesses need. H.R. 6566 clarifies that advanced recycling is not waste incineration, but a manufacturing process that converts used plastics into new materials. This clear distinction would prevent unnecessary regulatory barriers that increase costs, stifle innovation, and deter investment in modern recycling technologies. With 25 states already recognizing advanced recycling as manufacturing rather than incineration, updating federal policy would promote consistency and harmonize regulations nationwide.

As Congress considers comprehensive permitting reform to streamline government reviews of infrastructure and energy projects, we believe that this legislation would be a worthwhile inclusion in any such package. Many communities would benefit from new recycling facilities, but long and unpredictable review timelines often delay construction and increase costs. A more predictable and transparent permitting system for everything would help projects move forward on schedule, support better planning for local leaders, and reduce the financial risks that often discourage private investment.

Passing the Recycling Technology Innovation Act is a practical way to support economic growth, improve recycling, and encourage private sector investment. Pairing this effort with more reliable permitting processes would help ensure that new facilities can be built efficiently and begin delivering value to communities across the country. We are proud to support your proposal and look forward to working with you to help it become law.

Sincerely,",https://www.ntu.org/library/imglib/2026/01/AdobeStock-130292720.jpeg?v=20260126112200,N,,2026-01-26 17:59:57.973398

General Motors EV owners can now delete a charging app from their phone without getting range anxiety.

Over 5,000 DC fast chargers have been integrated into the company’s own apps.

In total, GM EV drivers can access over 250,000 public chargers in the U.S. and Canada.

General Motors just made life a little easier for the owners of its electric cars. That’s because over 5,000 Electrify America DC fast chargers in the United States have been integrated into the car company’s own smartphone apps.

In other words, Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac EV owners can use the native myChevrolet, myGMC or myCadillac app instead to find chargers, initiate charging and pay for the top-up. Nothing's stopping anyone from using the Electrify America app or PlugShare or something similar, but now, more options can be found in one place on GM's suite of apps.

That’s a small win, but a win nonetheless, especially for those who say it’s frustrating to manage so many charging apps at once.

In addition to Electrify America, GM has integrated other charging operators, too, including Ionna and Tesla’s Superchargers. All in all, GM says its EV drivers now have access to more than 250,000 public chargers across the U.S. and Canada.

“As EV travel continues to grow, so does the need for convenient charging experiences,” said Robert Barrosa, CEO and president of Electrify America. “Through this integration, GM EV drivers have more Hyper-Fast chargers to choose from and a seamless experience they can count on nationwide, helping them get to the places that matter.”

The apps provided by General Motors allow owners to find charging stations and see their real-time availability, plan routes with charging stops, monitor a charging session and pay for charging directly in the app.

Last year, GM set a new EV sales record, securing its place as the second largest EV maker in the U.S. The Chevy Equinox EV was the country’s best-selling non-Tesla EV in 2025, doubling its volume compared to 2024.

Meanwhile, Electrify America is not slowing down, despite headwinds in the industry. The company now has 1,116 stations in the U.S., with 5,405 ports open for business, according to the Department of Energy’s Alternative Fuels Data Center.

The Trump administration controversially halted EV requirements in the United States' largest auto market last year. But Stellantis — seemingly — remained bound through 2030 by a prior settlement agreement promising to comply with Golden State policies, regardless of any “judicial or federal action” preventing its latest rules from taking effect.

That might no longer be the case.

Stellantis dealers in California now have more flexibility in what vehicles they can sell, while state regulators are no longer projecting certainty over whether the company known for its gas-guzzling trucks will be held to account. Additionally, the automaker recently decided to kill plug-in hybrid Jeep and Chrysler models for the 2026 model year, making it all but impossible to meet a 35% ""zero-emission vehicle"" sales requirement.

That figure rises to 68% by 2030, the final year of Stellantis' settlement agreement with California. The 2024 deal, inked under embattled former CEO Carlos Tavares, was made in exchange for California forgiving past regulatory compliance shortfalls, and helped avoid potentially lengthy litigation between the two sides.

""Stellantis will continue to comply with applicable regulations,"" spokesperson Jodi Tinson said in a Jan. 16 statement. ""We remain committed to freedom of choice for our customers in 2026 with the all-new, fully electric Jeep Recon and range-extended Grand Wagoneer.""

Asked whether Stellantis still considered California's regulations ""applicable"" under its settlement agreement with the state, Tinson said the company is ""not going to elaborate further.""

The California Air Resources Board, which regulates vehicle emissions in the Golden State, declined to comment for this story. The agency previously told The Detroit News in June that the settlement agreement ""remains in place, and we fully expect Stellantis to comply.”

Less plug-in, more V-8

Sean Hogan, vice president of Sierra Auto Group in Southern California and the chairman of Stellantis' national dealer council, said this week that Golden State retailers are confident that they now have flexibility in which models they can sell.

That includes, he said, a recent shift allowing California dealers to sell the company's popular gas-guzzling V-8 and supercharged V8-powered models.

Stellantis recently advertised that its Hemi V-8 Jeep Wrangler Moab 392, which gets just 14 miles per gallon, is ""now available for order in all 50 states, including California, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Washington."" All are states that had adopted California's stricter emissions requirements before Trump halted them.

Many V8-powered Ram 1500 pickups and Dodge Durango SUVs are also currently listed for sale in California; the automaker previously was phasing out the larger engines on its trucks and SUVs due in part to the state's strict regulations. Under the Trump administration, the V-8 is back for the automaker, apparently even in California.

Stellantis isn't fully moving away from plug-in models. Despite killing the plug-in hybrid lineup, the automaker will soon sell an electric model called the Jeep Recon, and also plans to soon release range-extended hybrid Jeep and Ram models that have an option to run entirely on electricity.

But without its plug-in hybrid Jeeps and Chryslers — many of which were funneled to California in recent years to meet the stricter requirements — it's unclear how the automaker could meet the terms of its settlement with the state.

Daimler difficulties

Since issuing the statement in June that ""we fully expect Stellantis to comply"" with the settlement agreement, CARB has undergone a legal setback in a separate but related matter.

Truck makers Daimler North America LLC, International Motors LLC, Paccar Inc. and Volvo Group North America LLC sued California over attempts to enforce emissions regulations despite a Trump administration maneuver to cancel them. That maneuver, notably, is also being challenged in court by California and several other states with Democratic attorneys general.

Veteran environmental lawyer David Pettit of the Center for Biological Diversity said that an initial ruling in the Daimler case “did not go well” for CARB and could have implications for the Stellantis deal, too.

In the Daimler case — which the Trump administration joined as an intervenor on behalf of the plaintiffs — federal attorneys argued that a California agreement with truck-makers called the Clean Trucks Partnership is ""a regulatory enforcement tool styled as a 'contract' with certain truck manufacturers.""

A judge issued a preliminary injunction in October that effectively halted California from enforcing its rules via the partnership, though the case is still pending a final decision.

One factor in that decision: the question of whether California can do by contract what it is forbidden to do by regulation.

Pettit said in an interview that CARB has made missteps in its legal defense and is no longer in a strong position to enforce the previously agreed-upon EV targets for Stellantis.

“I've always thought as a lawyer — I've been a lawyer a long time — it's very bad karma to get too cocky about your case, especially in public,” the California-based attorney said, commenting on CARB’s projected confidence about Stellantis last year.

“History has shown that maybe being a little more nuanced would have been a good idea,” he added. “Now they don't seem confident about how they're moving in this area.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gmtoday.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/f1/9f1d702e-fd9f-48cf-8dae-547b698b4c04/69778221751a6.image.jpg?crop=1662%2C873%2C0%2C187&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2026-01-26 15:08:08.129802

“We’re honored to earn the ENERGY STAR for superior energy performance at Saint Mary's and appreciate the efforts of everyone who has been involved in its efficient operation,” said Craig Neal, Director of Plant Operations at Saint Mary’s. “Saving energy is just one of the ways we show our community we care, and that we’re committed to doing our part to protect the environment and public health, both today and for future generations.”

Neal attributes this achievement to a series of strategic energy-efficiency initiatives at the hospital, including replacing outdated screw-drive chillers with advanced magnetic-bearing chillers, upgrading lighting systems and fostering mindful energy practices among all staff.

On average, ENERGY STAR certified buildings and plants use 35 percent less energy, cause 35 percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions, and are less expensive to operate than their peers—all without sacrifices in performance or comfort.

To date, tens of thousands of buildings and plants across all fifty states have earned the ENERGY STAR.

According to the Department of Energy’s Alternative Fuels Data Center, Electrify America represents 5,405 of these, placed within 1,116 stations.

Drivers of Chevrolet, GMC and Cadillac vehicles can now access over 5,000 DC fast chargers across the US.

The app integration lets users see real-time charger availability, plan routes with charging stops, track the progress of their charging sessions, and pay for charging — all in one place.

“Owners can navigate to the Public Charging page in their myBrand app and look for supported networks, enabling fast and convenient charging while traveling throughout the US,” the Detroit automaker explained.

Previously, the Electrify America charging network was also included within Rivian’s in-vehicle navigation app.

A recent Rivian software update allows the mobile app to suggest available chargers, display their power levels and user ratings. It also lets owners use Plug & Charge at Electrify America stations.

Charging Network

According to GM Energy’s VP Wade Sheffer, the company is “collaborating across the industry to deliver not just more chargers, but better public charging experiences.”

Across the US and Canada, GM drivers can access more than 250,000 public charging stations.

According to the Department of Energy’s Alternative Fuels Data Center, Electrify America represents 5,405 of these, placed within 1,116 stations.

But the network also includes over 3,100 Tesla Supercharging stations with more than 35,000 chargers in North America alone.

The automaker opened up access to Tesla Superchargers in late 2024, allowing owners to purchase a GM-approved NACS (North America Charging Standard) DC adapter for the chargers.

At that time, GM noted that Tesla operated about 17,800 Superchargers, which indicates that the company roughly doubled the number of chargers in the US and Canada in the past year.

Due to Tesla‘s lead in the charging industry, several automakers are now replacing their CSS (Combined Charging System) ports with the NACS standard.

EV Business

In the last quarter of 2025, electric vehicle sales in the United States fell overall, following the end of the federal EV tax credit.

General Motors’ EV sales declined by 43% in the final three months of 2025, after a steady increase in the first two quarters.

The total electric vehicles sold in 2025 have increased by 48% year over year, however, making GM the second best-seller in the EV segment last year, just after Tesla.

The company sold 169,887 electric vehicles last year, for a total of 2.85 million — representing a share of just 6% of the total units registered by the brand in 2025.

In October, ahead of its third-quarter earnings report, the Detroit automaker announced that it would take a $1.6 billion hit as it was restructuring its business, after the termination of the federal EV tax credit.

The company warned that it could face additional significant cash and non-cash charges in the future, which may affect its financial results and cash flow.

Last year, GM stopped production of several EV models, restructuring manufacturing operations for hybrid and internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles instead.

The measure led to thousands of workers being laid off, including over 1,000 employees who worked at its CAMI plant in Canada, producing the BrightDrop commercial vans — which were also cancelled.",https://eletric-vehicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GM_converted.webp,N,,2026-01-26 13:59:43.569537

Eliot wrote in “The Waste Land” that “April is the cruelest month.” But today in America, January may prove to be the cruelest of all.

Why? January is the convergence of three highly disruptive and destructive forces. The first is the budget deadline. The continuing resolution expires at month’s end. It is not a good sign that the Senate was out of session last week. Suppose Congress cannot agree and is deadlocked. The government will shut down again, possibly for longer than the 43 days last fall.

Although it is in no one’s interest for this to happen again, Democrats and Republicans may be unable to compromise on what programs should be cut or funded. Health care is obviously a 5,000-pound gorilla. Huge increases for medical insurance have taken hold, by itself making this an explosive issue with the political effect of a thermonuclear bomb.

What people do not understand is the pernicious damage a continuing resolution does. The uncertainty of when a full budget is finally approved and signed into law makes planning virtually impossible for the executive branch.

Every day a continuing resolution is in place, the government loses about 15 percent of its purchasing power. In the corporate world, any company that operated this way would be out of business. But this is the way our government operates, as incredible as it may sound.

And at the end of the month, disruptive force number two activates — or, in this case, does not. On Feb. 5, the New START nuclear arms control agreement permanently expires. New START kept U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear weapons limited to 1,550 warheads each. The treaty cannot be extended, although Moscow and Washington could honor those limits.

That is not the same guarantee as a legal document. Russia, which has been noncompliant with New START since 2022, could more easily expand its warhead count than the U.S. And the Trump administration’s emphasis on Golden Dome defense that could counter most or all attacks against the U.S. will almost certainly cause Moscow to increase its number of warheads and nuclear delivery systems.

Do we really want another nuclear arms race, especially when our replacement submarine, missile and bomber force replacements will cost many hundreds if not trillions of dollars? The answer would seem obvious.

Then there was Greenland, the third force. President Donald Trump has long held that Greenland is vital to American defenses. His arguments are not self-evident. The idea that the Arctic is strategically more vital due to the melting of ice and new sea routes that will cut transport costs substantially is fine. But the U.S. already has Alaska on the Arctic, as well as nearly unlimited restrictions on increasing its forces on Greenland, based on a 1951 treaty. And Russia and China are not that heavily engaged yet.

After Trump threatened to use military force to seize Greenland, the stock markets reacted and recorded huge losses. At the World Economic Forum last week, Trump withdrew the threat of military intervention. But the damage had already been done, even though the markets recovered. NATO’s Article Five states that an attack against one member is considered an attack against all. Greenland, belonging to Denmark, is part of NATO. Had anyone in the White House informed the president of the implications of his threat? Probably not.

With that matter now resolved, the reactions of European members of NATO cannot be reversed. This is not 1956, when NATO allies Britain and France, in concert with Israel, occupied the Suez Canal and defeated the Egyptian army. President Dwight D. Eisenhower rebuked America’s NATO allies in that case and the invading forces were withdrawn. The alliance was shaken as a consequence.

Now, the threat to invade Greenland has similarly shaken the alliance. The reason is simple: Allies can no longer depend on the U.S. under Trump. And this may be unfixable, no matter who is elected president in 2028. Trump, having additionally invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to join the Gaza peace panel, may accomplish what five Soviet and three Russian leaders failed to do: end the NATO alliance.

Arms control, budgets and Greenland have been unlikely cohorts and comrades in challenging America. How this turns out obviously is a work in progress. But I do not believe this will turn out well.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/trump_donald_01232026_AP26023097050864-1.jpg?w=1280,N,,2026-01-26 15:07:57.659194

Dive Brief:

Renewable energy developer Exowatt has launched a business arm focused on providing land and energy infrastructure to support large or hyperscale data centers, the company announced Wednesday.

The company’s new arm, “ExoRise,” will lean on land, power and its novel P3 solar and battery technology — which stores energy in the form of heat and converts it to electricity on demand — to provide data centers with reliable power around the clock, Exowatt said in a press release.

The Miami, Florida-headquartered startup is backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and others, and said it will develop the projects in areas with high solar exposure across the U.S. Southwest, such as New Mexico, west Texas, Arizona, and Nevada. Exowatt said the region offers ample land and solar resources which allows for faster deployment and has a minimal impact on local communities.

Dive Insight:

ExoRise will provide the startup’s customers with infrastructure that supports “behind-the-meter and off-grid deployment” based on remote land, a method Exowatt said is able to deliver large-scale power without increasing electricity costs for local ratepayers. The company said the approach will also encourage domestic growth of artificial intelligence and boost energy resilience.

Data centers consume increasing amounts of power, especially as companies in the tech sector continue to turn to AI. U.S. data center power demand could reach 106 gigawatts in 2035, according to a recent report from BloombergNEF. BNEF’s latest forecast is 36% higher than its April 2025 estimate released — a jump it attributed in part to the higher average size of the 150 significant U.S. data center projects announced in 2024, over a quarter of which are larger than 500 megawatts.

“The growth of AI is colliding with real limits on grid capacity,” Exowatt’s Chief Data Center Officer Nic Bustamante said in the release. “ExoRise is designed to solve that problem by delivering dependable power at the speed AI requires. We’re not just solving a business problem — we’re enabling the future of American AI leadership.”

Bustamante will lead partnerships with offtakers for hyperscale data centers and infrastructure financiers, Exowatt said.

Last year, the startup raised $70 million to commercialize its P3 solar technology. The funding round for the technology — marketed as a modular, always-on clean energy solution for data centers and other large industrial loads — was backed by HSBC’s venture capital arm, actor Leonardo DiCaprio and several prominent Silicon Valley investors.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/ZdBhHW5atKyRzmekIlVbwXd1BpmdS1QlRTUO1h2hQr4/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjQyMjk3MzE4X0wxeU5QcEkuanBn.webp,N,,2026-01-26 13:59:47.508437

Data centers with contracts or existing tariffs in place would be able to rely on their current agreements for a time.
The idea is to ensure the data centers pay for additional grid infrastructure they require to meet their massive demand.
And, he noted that during times of insufficient energy supply, data centers can’t simply be turned off.
Data centers have taken over as a huge boon for the local economy and additional regulation could place that cash flow at risk.","Staring down a dwindling energy supply and cracks in the grid’s reliability, Washington lawmakers aim to reel in the largely unregulated industry sucking up much of the region’s power: data centers.

A set of bills making their way through the statehouse propose a sweeping set of regulations to raise rates for data centers, require them to disclose the natural resources they use and ensure they’re among the first electrical users cut during energy shortages.

The time is now, said state Sen. Sharon Shewmake, D-Bellingham. Data centers are popping up across the country. They’re drawing vast quantities of energy and water and driving up costs for neighboring ratepayers. And their thirst for electricity will only continue to rise.

“The growth is coming,” Shewmake said. “And we need to be prepared.”

Others, however, warned that additional regulation could drive future data centers out of the state, costing rural communities the tax boosts on which they’ve come to depend.

The companion measures — House Bill 2515 and Senate Bill 6171 — started off with public hearings in committees last week.

Early in his term, Gov. Bob Ferguson convened a working group to investigate the effects of data centers on Washington’s economy, tax revenue, energy use and environment. The decision came after a 2024 Seattle Times and ProPublica investigation into the clean energy and economic impacts of the state’s data center industry. The group included lawmakers, utilities, environmental advocates, tribes and scientists. They published their findings and recommendations in November, some of which are reflected in the measures now under consideration.

The bills would require public and private utilities to propose a new set of tariffs for data centers, effectively higher electric rates. Data centers with contracts or existing tariffs in place would be able to rely on their current agreements for a time.

The idea is to ensure the data centers pay for additional grid infrastructure they require to meet their massive demand. It would also aim to offset any rate increases from the facilities that might otherwise be pushed onto regular ratepayers.

This trend has been felt across the country. As data centers gobble up much of the available, less-expensive power in their regions, utilities must rely on more expensive options (often generated by fossil fuels) to meet rising demand, resulting in higher rates for people living in the area.

Data centers need to pay their fair share, Shewmake said, and ensure they don’t jack up electric rates on “grandma.”

Advertising

Utilities would have to propose their increased rates for data centers by October, the bills say.

The data centers would also have to shoulder a flat fee, half a penny for every kilowatt hour of energy they use, said Zachariah Baker, regional and state policy director for the NW Energy Coalition. That money would go toward low-income bill assistance, weatherization projects and artificial intelligence education programs.

While data centers are known to draw large quantities of power and water, state officials don’t have a comprehensive understanding on the specifics. Often, that information can only be found between disparate utilities or service providers. The proposed measures would require new sustainability reporting on water and chemical use, Shewmake said. This would help state officials understand the size and scope of the problem before taking further action.

In support of the bill, Jeremy Takala, a council member with the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, testified Friday before the state Senate Committee on Environment, Energy & Technology. The rapid growth of data centers will increase the chance of power blackouts or brownouts more than 13% in a given year, Takala said.

The space between energy supply and demand is thinning in the Pacific Northwest with each passing year. Experts have warned that as early as 2030, energy demand could outpace supply during heat waves or cold snaps.

Baker pointed to a 2025 report from the Northwest Power and Conservation Council, which found that within the next five years, energy demand from the tech sector — largely driven by data centers — will increase so much that it would be as if two to four cities the size of Seattle had been added to the grid.

The proposed measures would ensure that during times of energy shortages, data centers would take power cuts before other, more critical customers like hospitals, said Shewmake, who chairs the Senate committee.

Laws like the Clean Energy Transformation Act already require utilities to shift away from fossil fuels but the proposed measures would expedite those rules for data centers, Baker said. By 2030, 80% of their power would have to come from new and renewable sources and five years later they’d have to consume exclusively renewable energy.

Sure, these measures pack in a lot of new regulation for the burgeoning industry, Baker said. But such a comprehensive approach is needed to protect ratepayers, grid reliability and the environment.

Not everybody agrees.

During the House and Senate’s public hearings last week, industry representatives alongside some local government officials testified against the package. They called the bills overly prescriptive and said that despite rising energy use and rates across the country, the tech industry is already doing enough to protect their neighbors.

Dan Diorio, vice president of state policy for the Data Center Coalition, said the new regulations would unfairly single out data centers when instead all large energy users should be treated the same. Such a sweeping package would make Washington state a standout across the country. And, he noted that during times of insufficient energy supply, data centers can’t simply be turned off. Instead they’d be forced to rely on backup generation.

Others, representing local governments in Eastern Washington, also spoke against the measures. Data centers have taken over as a huge boon for the local economy and additional regulation could place that cash flow at risk.

Pat Haley, city administrator for Quincy, referred to the explosion of data centers in his community as the “Quincy miracle.” To date, nearly half of the city’s family-wage jobs stem from the industry and around 57% of its property tax base comes from data centers, he said.

These bills would inject uncertainty into the fast-growing industry and make Washington a less-appealing destination for new projects, opponents said.

Shewmake and Baker pushed back, though. Electricity in Washington is pretty affordable, compared with much of the rest of the country, they said. While these bills would increase rates for data centers, the state would remain a competitive destination for the industry.

Conversations surrounding the proposed data center regulations are sure to continue and face tweaks. While House and Senate committees held public hearings on the package last week, the measures have not yet gone to a vote.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01232026_TZR_Quincy-Data_Center-2024_tzr_133048.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2026-01-26 13:59:51.806708

The Environmental Law & Policy Center (“ELPC”) along with 5 other organizations filed a Title V Petition to Object (“Petition”) before the United State Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) related to the BP Products North America, Inc. (“BP”) refinery.

The refinery is located in Whiting, Indiana.

A Title V renewal permit is stated to have been issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (“IDEM”).

Title V of the Clean Air Act requires certain stationary sources of air pollution to obtain Operating Permits. States that administer Title V do so through adopted implementation plans. These plans are submitted to and approved by EPA.

The intent of a Title V Permit is to organize into a single document all of the requirements that apply to the Permit holder. 42 U.S.C. § 7661 requires that states submit each proposed Title V Permit to EPA for review. Section 505(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act requires that EPA object to the issuance of a proposed Title V Permit in writing within 45 days of the receipt of the proposed Permit (and all necessary supporting information) if the agency determines it is not in compliance with the applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act.

If EPA does not object to a Permit, Section 505(b)(2) provides that any person may petition the EPA Administrator within 60 days of the expiration of the 45-day review period to object to the Permit.

The BP (Whiting Refinery) is stated to have operated since 1889 and is the largest such facility in the Midwest. It is stated to process up to 440,000 barrels of crude oil every day, producing:

10 million gallons of gasoline.

4 million gallons of diesel.

2 million gallons of jet fuel.

7% of all asphalt in the U.S.

The refinery is stated to be composed of multiple emission units and associated equipment.

ELPC argues that the EPA must object to the renewed Title V Permit because it fails to include and/or assure compliance with all requirements of the Clean Air Act. The arguments include:

Fails to include the PM10 limit contained in 326 IAC 6.8-2-6(a) of the Indiana State Implementation Plan, which is an applicable requirement that applies to all PM10 emissions from each boiler stack;

Fails to include the required Preventive Maintenance Plan; and

Fails to include adequate monitoring, recordkeeping, or reporting requirements for NOx for No. 11 Pipe Still.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15833_1120.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 13:01:49.080125

An $80 billion deal to deploy Westinghouse AP1000 reactors across the U.S. could boost the country’s nuclear supply chain and turn nuclear into a top energy provider for the data center boom.

January 26 - An agreement in October between the U.S. federal government and Westinghouse owners Brookfield Asset Management and Cameco was a key step by the Trump administration towards its goal of increasing nuclear capacity from around 100 GW today to 400 GW by 2050. The deal calls for 10 new large reactors under construction by 2030.

“We’ve eliminated the AP1000’s first-of-a-kind challenges and the American nuclear supply chain is ready now, following the completion of two AP1000 units at Plant Vogtle in Georgia,” said Brian McCrone, communications manager at Westinghouse, referring to the last two pressurized water reactors (PWRs) built in the U.S., which were brought online in 2023 and 2024.

The supply chain is “capable of handling multiple projects simultaneously,” he told Reuters Events.

In June 2025, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) extended the duration of the AP1000 standard design certification to 40 years, with an expiration date of February 2046.

“Our AP1000 reactor is the only fully licensed, construction-ready advanced reactor available in the U.S.,” McCrone noted.

Cameco said that under the deal, the government will provide near-term financing of long lead time items, which include Reactor Pressure Vessels (RPVs), steam generators, and coolant pumps.

The deal includes “unprecedented” government involvement in both financing and risk mitigation, which contrasts with typical nuclear projects where private companies bear most construction and regulatory risks, said Zoe Sulmont, Research Analyst, Energy Transition at Wood Mackenzie.

“The U.S. government will help Westinghouse secure land and permits, potentially offer loan guarantees, and assist with international business development,” Sulmont told Reuters Events.

This level of government backing could help revive U.S. nuclear competitiveness after decades of under-investment, ""as it effectively de-risks large capital expenditures, accelerates permitting timelines, and provides long-term policy certainty,” she added.

Sulmont said that the new AP1000s would restart the supply chain for specialised components.

“Repeat builds of the same design is an investment in standardization which reduces downstream risk and allows suppliers to operate more efficiently,” she added.

This would benefit Westinghouse's existing supply network, which includes major partners such as Curtiss-Wright, which manufactures coolant pumps and Siemens Energy, which produces massive steam turbines and generators.

But how fast the supply chain will grow and in what capacity is uncertain because the Trump administration has yet to announce details of the agreement, including a timeline or how the federal government would provide funds, said James Richards, manager of the Economics and Project Development Program at think tank Nuclear Innovation Alliance (NIA).

“How this takes shape is unclear without knowing some of the ins and outs of the deal,” James told Reuters Events.

In addition, this partnership is tied to a framework trade agreement signed between the U.S. and Japan in October. Under the deal, Japanese companies agreed to invest ""up to $332 billion to support critical energy infrastructure in the United States, including the construction of AP1000 and small modular reactors (SMRs), in partnership with Westinghouse,” the White House said at the time.

Historically, Westinghouse has a deep partnership with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), which has manufactured many of the large-scale components for AP1000s built abroad. The deal also considers the involvement of Japanese suppliers with a history in heavy industry manufacturing, such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Toshiba Group and IHI Corporation.

""The Japanese investment speeds up capital deployment reducing supplier financing risk ... [and] could ramp up supply chain development. However, it will take time,” Sulmont said.

Cost risks

Construction of Vogtle 2 and 3 was completed seven years behind schedule, and costs more than doubled from the initial projection of $14 billion.

Cost controls for Vogtle 2 and 3 improved after Southern Company took over the project in 2017, Richards said. However, the industry has to show additional improvements, or the risks of financing nuclear projects could become insurmountable, he added, citing the supply chain delays, the delivery of faulty components and workforce shortages that plagued the Vogtle projects.

CHART: US nuclear capacity additions by year of initial operation

But following completion of the reactors, “the workforce that built these units exists, which is an advantage over competitors,” Richards noted.

This workforce could benefit companies that announced plans in 2025 to build AP1000 reactors amid increasing demand for power from data centers.

Fermi America has filed applications with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to build four AP1000 at its “Hypergrid” project in Texas. According to the filing, construction of the first unit is projected to begin in 2026 with the initial unit expected to start producing power by April 2031.

South Carolina's state-owned utility and project owner Santee Cooper in October said it will install two AP1000 reactors at its VC Summer 2 and 3 nuclear power complex. When construction of Summer 2 and 3 was cancelled in 2017 due mainly to cost overruns and the bankruptcy of the primary contractor, Westinghouse, over $9 billion had been spent to complete less than 50% of the reactors.

Because the AP1000 design has already been approved by the NRC, obtaining construction permits should be “smooth as long as there is sufficient NRC staff,” James said.

Another advantage for the AP1000 is that it uses standard Low-Enriched Uranium (LEU), which has a solid supply chain that could be easily expanded.

Westinghouse manufactures LEU at its Columbia Fuel Fabrication Facility in Hopkins, South Carolina and began providing LEU+, which has a higher concentration of uranium, to Vogtle 2 in April 2025.

Cameco is a leading producer of uranium and has a 49% stake in the Global Laser Enrichment (GLE) project, which is working toward commercial production of LEU at its Paducah, Kentucky site.

The funds are included in the budget for the Department of Justice, signed Friday by President Trump.

The new center was included in a set of recommendations from the nonpartisan Council on Criminal Justice Veterans Justice Commission, which found that the justice system fails to consistently identify veterans and steer them away from incarceration.

“The lack of coordination between programs for justice-involved veterans results in the duplication of efforts, a lack of proper program evaluation, and an inability to disseminate best practices,” the Commission said in its 2023 report. “As a result, justice-involved veterans seeking assistance often confront a confusing and disjointed network of untested interventions.”

The national center marks a major milestone for efforts intended to address these shortcomings. The Commission said the center should be responsible for:

Enhancing the coordination of information, data, and best practices between and among programs serving justice-involved veterans

Identifying research gaps in veterans’ programs, and

Funding original research and technical assistance to fill those gaps and encouraging programmatic innovation to expand evidence-based practice for justice-involved veteran interventions.

“Service-related trauma and other legacies of deployment push too many veterans on a path toward our criminal justice system, and our nation has a responsibility to better understand and interrupt that trajectory,” said Brigadier General David “Mac” MacEwen, the commission’s director. “This center honors veterans’ sacrifices and will help us address their unique risk factors by serving as a hub for best practices, research, and coordination of federal, state, and local programs.”

The CCJ Veterans Justice Commission was comprised of 15 of the nation’s top military, veterans, and criminal justice leaders. It examined the risk factors that contribute to veterans’ involvement in the justice system, the adequacy of transitional support for service members reentering civilian life, and the effectiveness of justice system responses when veterans break the law. The commission produced a wide range of research and issued 11 recommendations.

The legislation is H.R. 6938 (Commerce, Justice, Science; Energy and Water Development; Interior and Environment Appropriations Act, 2026).

CMI also convenes the flagship Annual Critical Minerals Institute Summit, a global gathering of government leaders, institutional investors, and industry executives.","As the global minerals race intensifies, the landscape is no longer merely defined by supply and demand curves—it is being redrawn by geopolitical fragmentation, industrial strategy, and economic nationalism. The upcoming Critical Minerals Institute (CMI) Masterclass, “The Competition for Critical Minerals in a Deglobalized World During the Next Decade (2026–2035),” could not be timelier. With Western governments moving from reactive policymaking to active market participation, and with China recalibrating its own leverage through pricing power and outbound capital, this session will bring overdue clarity to what lies ahead.

Moderated by geopolitical and macroeconomics expert and CMI Co-Chair Melissa “Mel” Sanderson and featuring strategic veterans such as Constantine Karayannopoulos and heralded international critical minerals expert and CMI-Co-Chair Jack Lifton, the Masterclass will dissect how emerging trade blocs, security-first supply policies, and rising export controls are transforming critical minerals from commodities into sovereign instruments. For those of us observing these shifts unfold in real time, the themes of this week’s report echo many of the questions this Masterclass intends to answer: What happens to market access when cooperation falters? Where is capital safest—and where is it most needed? And how will the next decade’s winners be defined not by reserves, but by the resilience and autonomy of their supply chains?

As the Masterclass preview makes clear, the 2026–2035 period will not be defined by globalization’s efficiencies, but by its unraveling—and what nations and industries choose to build in its place.

Now for this week’s Critical Minerals Report….

The global scramble for critical minerals hit a new inflection point this week. In Washington, the U.S. government made an unprecedented move by taking a direct 10% equity stake in USA Rare Earth, Inc. (NASDAQ: USAR) as part of a $1.6 billion package to develop a Texas rare earth mine and an Oklahoma magnet plant. This deal – to be unveiled today – marks the largest U.S. investment in the sector and follows last year’s government stakes in MP Materials Corp. (NYSE: MP), Lithium Americas Corp. (TSX: LAC) and Trilogy Metals Inc. (TSX: TMQ). The White House has signaled more “historic deals” ahead to boost domestic output of lithium, rare earths, and other strategic materials.

The same strategic urgency is evident in a newly finalized U.S. rule to speed up deep-sea mining permits for critical minerals. The Trump administration ordered regulators to consolidate and shorten reviews for companies hunting metals on the ocean floor – a controversial bid to counter China’s dominance, even as environmental groups warn of “irreversible” damage to seabed ecosystems. And looking abroad, Washington is leveraging diplomacy: after brokering a minerals pact in Africa, Kinshasa has sent the U.S. a list of state-owned mining assets – from copper-cobalt deposits to lithium projects – now available for American investment. This joint U.S.-Congo initiative is the most tangible sign yet of U.S. efforts to pry critical supply chains out of China’s orbit in Africa. It also comes as Brazil emerges as a coveted partner: Preliminary talks between the Trump and Lula administrations are exploring a rare earths alliance, part of negotiations over U.S. tariffs on Brazilian steel. Brazil sits on the world’s second-largest rare earth reserves (about 21 million tonnes), and both Washington and Brussels are courting Brasília’s cooperation on lithium, nickel, and rare earth projects. Notably, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is convening a first-ever Critical Minerals Ministerial in Washington on February 4 with Brazil, Argentina, and other allies in attendance. The goal: to cement new supply partnerships and ensure Western economies are not beholden to a single foreign supplier in the future.

Major corporate moves are reinforcing these geopolitical shifts. Energy Fuels Inc. (NYSE American: UUUU | TSX: EFR) announced a USD$299 million acquisition of Australia’s Australian Strategic Materials Ltd. (ASX: ASM), aiming to create the largest fully integrated rare earth producer outside China. The deal will link Energy Fuels’ rare earth processing plant in Utah with ASM’s critical metals facility in Korea, establishing a “mine-to-metal” supply chain spanning from raw minerals to magnet alloys. It directly addresses a longstanding weakness in the West’s supply chain by combining upstream mining and separation with downstream metal-making capacity, a capability largely monopolized by China today. Industry experts note that in 2025 the U.S. still imported 56% of its rare earth needs, so moves like this are crucial for reducing dependency. Meanwhile, Lynas Rare Earths Ltd. (ASX: LYC) – the world’s top producer outside China – reported a 43% surge in quarterly revenue despite output disruptions. CEO Amanda Lacaze credited government policies for “improving the function of the market” by supporting floor prices for non-Chinese rare earth suppliers. U.S. programs to ensure minimum prices (for example, stockpiling agreements benefiting producers like MP Materials) have lifted rare earth oxide prices to more sustainable levels. Lacaze told investors that geopolitical tailwinds – from export controls in China easing oversupply to multilateral discussions on pricing support – have turned policy into a real market driver. The result: rare earth prices in January are strengthening further and giving Western projects a fighting chance against China’s low-cost competitors.

Beijing, for its part, is hardly standing still. New figures show China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) investment hit a record high in 2025, as Beijing pours cash into energy and mining projects worldwide in what observers call a “global resources grab.” Notably, about $18 billion of BRI financing went into wind, solar and waste-to-energy projects last year, underscoring China’s lead in exporting clean technology. At the same time, Chinese funding for overseas metals and mining projects surged to new heights, as China seeks to lock in long-term supplies of minerals from Latin America to Africa. This strategy was on display in Africa recently, where Chinese companies dominate cobalt and copper output in the Congo – a dominance the U.S. is now directly challenging via the new DRC-U.S. minerals pact. On the financial front, China moved to boost its influence over commodity pricing: regulators announced that foreign investors will be allowed to trade China’s domestic nickel and lithium futures for the first time. By opening these contracts on the Shanghai and Guangzhou exchanges to global participants, Beijing aims to internationalize its benchmarks for battery metals and erode the primacy of London and New York markets. This comes amid a rally in Chinese metals markets, where open interest in Shanghai base metals futures has hit record levels as investors bet on an EV-driven demand boom. In short, China is positioning itself not just as the world’s biggest buyer of critical minerals, but as a price-setter.

One arena where China’s strategy is unfolding in real time is the electric vehicle market. Chinese automakers, led by BYD Co. Ltd. (HKG:1211), have now eclipsed Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) in global EV sales, thanks to aggressive pricing and scale. This week brought a wake-up call for Detroit: Canada slashed its tariff on Chinese EVs from 100% to just 6%, effectively flinging open the door to China’s low-cost electric cars. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney had imposed the steep duties in solidarity with the U.S. (which cites national security to bar Chinese cars), but Ottawa reversed course in a bid to lower vehicle costs and spur competition. The implications for U.S. manufacturers are profound. Canada’s auto market is tightly integrated with America’s, so Chinese EVs gaining a foothold up north could be a trojan horse into the United States. Industry analysts say it’s likely just a matter of time before Americans are buying Chinese-made cars. In fact, President Donald Trump himself struck a surprisingly open tone, saying he welcomes Chinese automakers to build factories in the U.S. if they create American jobs. Such a shift would have been unthinkable a year ago. Now, with Chinese models already grabbing ~10% of new car sales in Europe and 20% in Mexico by undercutting Western rivals, Detroit’s Big Three – General Motors Company (NYSE: GM), Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and Stellantis N.V. (NYSE: STLA) – may be forced to reinvent their EV offerings. Cheaper Chinese models like BYD’s ~$8,000 Seagull have exposed a price gap in the market. U.S. automakers will either have to drive down costs (perhaps via their own partnerships in China or new supply deals) or risk ceding ground. For critical minerals, this trend has a dual edge: it threatens Western carmakers even as it could spur more localized battery supply chains (for instance, Chinese firms might build battery plants in North America to avoid tariffs). Either way, the EV supply chain is becoming ever more globally entwined, blurring the line between foreign and domestic when it comes to sourcing lithium, nickel or rare earth magnets.

Europe, too, is rewriting its playbook to secure strategic minerals. After 25 years of talks, EU member states approved a landmark free trade accord with Mercosur this month – explicitly to “secure access to critical minerals” and offset China. The deal, set to be signed on January 17, will slash import tariffs and give Europe privileged access to South America’s vast lithium, copper, nickel and rare earth reserves. European officials argue that partnering with resource-rich democracies like Brazil is vital for the clean-energy transition (Brazil, for example, holds 90% of the world’s niobium and is a rising lithium supplier). Brussels also inked a cooperation agreement with Japan this week to coordinate investment and financing for mineral supply chains. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Japan’s industry minister and an EU commissioner affirmed they’ll “accelerate collaboration” – across both public and private sectors – to diversify supplies of rare earths and other materials away from China’s grip. Yet even as Europe reduces one dependency, another persists uncomfortably: Russian nuclear fuel. A Financial Times investigation found that nearly four years after the Ukraine invasion, Russia still supplies about 23% of Europe’s enriched uranium for power reactors. Western fuel executives warned that cheap Russian uranium and a lack of political will in the EU risk locking Europe into this strategic dependency for decades. While the U.S. has banned Russian nuclear imports effective 2028, the EU’s proposed ban is stalled by internal divisions (Hungary and others rely on Rosatom’s fuel and oppose cutting ties). This split was evident as some EU states quietly stockpile Russian fuel rods for their Soviet-designed reactors, even as countries like Sweden have eliminated Russian uranium from their supply. The EU’s dilemma over uranium parallels its past reliance on Russian gas – underlining that energy security and mineral security are now two sides of the same coin. It also highlights why Europe is racing to develop alternate sources, from funding uranium enrichment capacity in-house to supporting mining projects in Africa and Latin America.

Finally, on the metals front in the Americas, there was a notable investment in copper. Mitsubishi Corporation (TYO: 8058) agreed to spend nearly $600 million for a 30% stake in the Copper World mine in Arizona, a major new project by Hudbay Minerals Inc. (NYSE: HBM). The deal, closed earlier this month, will make Copper World one of the largest U.S. copper producers by 2029 and boost Hudbay’s output by over 50%. It’s a striking example of Asian capital (in this case Japanese) helping develop American critical mineral assets. Mitsubishi’s investment will fund the mine’s final feasibility studies and initial construction, and in return the Japanese trading house secures a long-term supply of “Made in America” copper for the clean-energy supply chain. The partnership was lauded by Hudbay as a “long-term strategic” alignment that validates the project’s value. It also dovetails with Japan’s broader critical minerals strategy: Tokyo has been striking deals from Canada to Africa to ensure access to battery metals and rare earths, often teaming up with western allies. As for copper, demand is projected to soar (for electrification infrastructure, EVs and beyond), so securing new sources in politically stable regions is paramount. We see similar logic in other tie-ups, like BHP in Ecuador or Rio Tinto in Serbia; this week’s Arizona deal stands out because it directly strengthens a North American supply hub with foreign financing.

Across all these developments – U.S. public investment in mines, Chinese financing blitzes, trade alliances, and corporate mergers – the through-line is unmistakable. Critical minerals are now treated as strategic assets on par with oil. Governments are taking equity stakes and striking diplomatic accords once reserved for energy security. Companies are restructuring themselves to offer end-to-end supply chains outside of China. And new policies, from export controls to price supports, are rewriting the rules of global trade for metals. This past week’s cascade of news underscores an emerging consensus: the road to net-zero and advanced manufacturing runs through mines and mineral processing plants. Whether it’s rare earth magnets for fighter jets, lithium for batteries, or uranium for reactors, control of these inputs is shaping up to be a defining factor in economic and national security. The world’s major powers clearly recognize this – and they are acting with urgency, each in their own way, to ensure they won’t be left behind in the new resource race. In the process, the century-old resource order (long dominated by oil and gas geopolitics) is rapidly evolving. Critical Minerals have taken center stage, and the events of this week show that the scramble to secure them is only accelerating.

These forces now define what the Critical Minerals Institute describes as the New Critical Minerals Economy — an environment shaped less by geology than by policy, security considerations, and strategic alignment, and one that will increasingly determine how capital, industry, and governments interact across the global minerals landscape. CMI Summit V: The New Critical Minerals Economy will take place May 13–14, 2026, in Toronto. Click here to register or email tracy@criticalmineralsinstitute.com for further information.

Many of them would say the sooner the world can go all-zero emissions, the better off we’ll all be, and that hybrids risk prolonging our collective dependence on fossil fuels.

As for me, I’m generally pro-hybrid: I say don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good, and if buyers want electrified power, less gas use and fewer emissions, they should go for it. But I’ve never been a huge fan of plug-in hybrids—I’d rather own a car I have to plug in or fill with gas, but doing both feels rather cumbersome. Still, PHEVs make a ton of sense for a certain segment of buyers, even if that segment hasn't been very large in America.

But as the EV and regulatory landscape shifts, the case for PHEVs might not be as strong as it once was.

25%: Think The U.S. EV Market Is Weird? Plug-In Hybrids Are Even More Uncertain

PHEV EV Drivetrain

I do get the argument for PHEVs. You get a small amount of electric range for most of your daily driving because you plug in the car while it's parked, then you use the gas engine for your longer trips. Unfortunately, studies show many drivers just don’t plug them in, negating many of their benefits.

Now, something unexpected is happening in the U.S. market. Not only did EV tax credits go away last year, but they also vanished for PHEVs. And so did stricter fuel economy rules pushing automakers to build more efficient and electrified cars. At the same time, if you’re open to a plug-in car, a modern, 300-plus-mile EV may negate the case for some PHEVs entirely.

This has automakers and analysts asking: Are PHEVs even worth it anymore? That leads to this great Automotive News story today. Some highlights:

Instead, automakers are increasingly turning to traditional hybrids that don’t have a plug and extended-range electric vehicles, which also ease anxiety about needing to recharge but with less cost and complexity.

Long after General Motors introduced Americans to the segment with the 2011 Chevrolet Volt, consumers still haven’t shown much interest. Plug-in hybrids were less than 2% of the new-vehicle market last year, according to S&P Global Mobility registration data through November.

Automakers have used plug-in hybrid vehicles to help comply with emissions regulations set by California and, to a lesser extent, the federal government.

But without regulations and tax incentives pushing the segment toward that level of popularity, some automakers are deciding there isn’t enough demand to keep developing and building plug-in hybrids.

“It’s still confusing for consumers, and they don’t really fully get it,” said Stephanie Brinley, associate director of AutoIntelligence for S&P Global Mobility. “And the changes in regulatory requirements and compliance do mean it’s less necessary, or it’s a solution that you don’t necessarily need to push as hard.”

That story is worth a read in full. It’s like the current “EV slowdown” situation on steroids—except that automakers are probably less under the gun to make PHEVs as a long-term mobility solution, whereas most experts believe electric cars will have a more permanent place in the automotive landscape.

So automakers are now taking different approaches to their PHEV plans. Stellantis? Dead. General Motors? Studying the matter, and plans to release some in 2027. Toyota and Volvo? Much higher hopes, especially since they know PHEVs are a bigger deal in Europe and China.

The industry may soon move on to EREVs, or extended-range electric vehicles—EVs with gas engines as generators. But if automakers couldn’t solve the PHEV user confusion problem, how would they do the same for those cars? I haven’t heard a great answer there yet.

50%: The Rivian R2 Arrives This Spring. Prototypes Are Road-Tripping Right Now

Rivian R2 Manufacturing Validation Build

Photo by: Rivian

The Rivian R2 is getting its kicks on Route 66.

The electric automaker announced in a blog post Friday that “validation build” vehicles—essentially, advanced prototypes—have set off on a cross-country journey across the iconic Chicago-to-California freeway route. (Fun fact: Route 66 is now a historic designation, not an active part of the “official” highway system, as has been the case since the 1980s. I didn’t know that!)

Rivian’s post also gave us a clearer idea of when customers can expect the R2, and it’s coming soon:

These early builds represent an important phase in development where we validate and perfect the quality of vehicles coming off the line at our factory. As we head toward the start of production in spring, this continuous feedback loop of testing, refining and updating ensures we are delivering repeatable quality at scale building vehicles that exceed our customers’ expectations.

The R2 we drove across Route 66 is one of many early builds already out for real-world validation. The information we gather goes directly back to our engineering, software and manufacturing teams for optimizations. Every piece of information brings us a step closer to delivering R2 to customers.

The Rivian R2 is quite possibly the biggest EV debut of 2026. It’s a smaller, more affordable and more profitable electric SUV from Rivian that also boasts a considerably more advanced platform than the original R1S and R1T. Rivian has touted a $45,000 price tag for the EV, although Launch Edition models are expected to be more expensive.

Sales of the R2 are widely seen as crucial to Rivian’s ability to thrive as a mainstream, volume automaker—much as Tesla once achieved with the Model 3 and Model Y. And with Tesla losing interest in the EV field to focus on Robotaxis and robotics, Rivian is hoping the R2 can pick up the slack.

75%: On Tesla’s Earnings Call Wednesday, Investors Want Robotaxi Progress

Speaking of Tesla, its fourth-quarter and full-year-2025 earnings call happens on Wednesday. EV sales—still its core business—were down for the first time in a long time last year as Tesla handed its sales crown to BYD, but CEO Elon Musk is as adamant as ever that the future isn’t in builing cars anyway, but in autonomous driving.

Tesla has removed safety drivers from some of its Robotaxi vehicles in Austin and it hopes to expand that service more throughout the U.S. this year. Is that enough to keep investors happy, and to maintain Tesla’s sky-high stock price? Reuters explains:

But much of Tesla's $1.49 trillion market value rests on Musk's vision for self-driving vehicles and humanoid robots.

""Investors are largely looking past the near-term fundamentals. Market sentiment is being driven by Tesla's broader autonomy ambitions, including progress on the robotaxi platform and anticipation of the Cybercab entering full production in 2026,"" said Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, who personally holds Tesla shares.

With ""earnings likely to look soft, keeping the narrative firmly anchored on future growth is crucial in supporting Tesla's still-lofty valuation,"" he said.

Tesla's profit margins—the fact that it can make a profit on EVs—has long been core to its investor appeal, but this year the focus could turn to sales, after two years of decline. Wall Street broadly expects Tesla to return to deliveries growth in 2026, with about an 8% rise.

""The key signal for 2026 is that Tesla is intentionally trading near-term automotive margin for fleet scale since Elon understands that the value of the platform is not maximizing per-unit vehicle profitability today but maximizing the installed base that can later be monetized through autonomy and software,"" said Shay Boloor, chief market strategist at Futurum Equities.

As I’ve written before, there are two distinct companies in play here: Tesla and $TSLA. One is an electric car company that earns its profits selling electric cars while making huge investments into autonomous vehicle technology.

The other is a $1.41 trillion market cap robotics and AI company that just hasn’t delivered on that stuff quite yet, but (hopefully) will someday.

Will we see an explanation of the roadmap to get there on Wednesday, or just more hype?

Published as part of The Headwaters Report

This article will provide an overview of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) hydropower licensing process, focusing on leverage points for Tribal engagement. Following a brief introduction on the relationship between Tribal Nations, hydropower dams, and FERC licensing, the first section provides a general description of FERC’s authority and structure, followed by a second section outlining the timeline of a FERC hydropower licensing process and how Tribal Nations can participate in these processes. The third section highlights several strategies for protecting Tribal rights and resources. The final section briefly addresses other important federal and state agencies involved in FERC licensing proceedings and how Tribal Nations may work with those agencies to accomplish their goals. This overview is not intended to discuss all the opportunities and challenges facing Tribal Nations in hydropower licensing processes, but instead to provide a starting point for Tribal Nations seeking to engage.

Introduction:

The same water resources that are sacred to Tribal Nations are often impacted by hydroelectric power projects such as hydropower dams and pumped storage projects. These projects have decimated salmon runs and disrupted other ecosystem functions on Tribal homelands by degrading water quality and blocking fish passage outright. Although hydroelectric energy has long been touted as a “clean” energy, hydropower projects have devastated Tribal Nations’ treaty-protected rights and resources—particularly salmon and other endangered fish species runs. Notably, fish runs on the Columbia, Snake, and Klamath Rivers in the Northwest plummeted after significant hydroelectric projects were built on those rivers. And over 1 million acres of Tribal lands have been flooded over 1.1 million acres by hundreds of dams built for hydropower and irrigation, displacing Tribal communities and destroying access to their traditional hunting and fishing grounds.

Hydropower project design has advanced to reduce some of these impacts, including by eliminating the need for dams, improving fish passage, and creating flexibility in dam management to ensure sufficient, consistent flows for all stages of the fish life cycle. Hydroelectric energy production does not inherently run counter to Tribal interests, and some Tribal Nations own and manage hydropower projects that provide electricity and revenue for their communities. But Tribal Nations have also spent decades advocating for protection of their Tribal resources in the face of unchecked public and private hydropower development in their watersheds and have consistently advocated for protection of their Tribal resources.

All non-federal hydroelectric power projects in the United States are permitted and regulated by FERC under the Federal Power Act (FPA).[1] These projects make up the majority of hydropower capacity in the country.[2] As sovereign governments with legal rights in FERC hydropower licensing processes, Tribal Nations can influence current management and operations and help shape the future of hydroelectric energy development in the United States.

Nearly 40% of all existing FERC licensed hydropower projects will be relicensed in the next decade.[3] Over the past several decades, relicensing has brought to the foreground many of the issues engrained in the early development of the federal hydropower permitting framework, including the complete exclusion of Tribal Nations from the original permitting decisions. As that regulatory framework has evolved to include Tribal involvement, Tribal Nations have engaged in successful campaigns to protect Tribal resources.

However, the process for hydropower licensing and relicensing is burdensome for Tribal Nations that seek to be involved. And recent changes eroding required environmental impacts analysis under the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA), as well as a push by the Department of Energy (DOE) to reverse FERC’s 2024 policy decision to deny preliminary permits on Tribal land that are applied for without Tribal consent, threaten to make it significantly more difficult for Tribal Nations to protect their natural and cultural resources in hydropower permitting processes.

Section 1: Overview of FERC

Under the FPA, FERC possesses the exclusive authority to grant licenses permitting private and municipal developers to construct and operate hydropower projects. Many hydroelectric projects in the country were constructed between the 1940s and the 1960s,[4] and those operating permits were typically for between 30-50 years. For the past several decades, the bulk of FERC’s work on hydropower has been in permit relicensing processes, even as new projects continue to be developed.

FERC’s approach to licensing decisions is shaped by balancing requirements that can provide Tribal Nations with pathways to protect their rights and resources. The FPA was originally enacted to establish a federal regulatory framework for hydroelectric power projects. In 1986, the Electric Consumers Protection Act amended the FPA to require FERC to consider not only power production needs, but also the interests of fish, recreation, and environmental quality. When making licensing decisions FERC is now required to balance its purpose of energy production with “equal consideration to the purposes of energy conservation, the protection, mitigation of damage to, and enhancement of, fish and wildlife (including related spawning grounds and habitat), the protection of recreational opportunities, and the preservation of other aspects of environmental quality.”[5] In its amended form, the FPA includes three significant sections for Tribal Nations—sections 4(e), 10(a), and 10(j). These sections, along with section 18, which deals with fishways, will be discussed in further detail below.

FERC operates as a federal agency made up of five commissioners who are appointed by the president. The agency is quasi-judicial, meaning its decision-making process is set up to resolve disputes among multiple parties, and those parties may challenge FERC decisions and seek review of FERC decisions by a federal court of appeals rather than going to a district court.

Because FERC operates as a quasi-judicial agency, it limits the communication that its decision-making staff can have with parties to a licensing proceeding. FERC’s goal in limiting communication is to ensure that all participants in a proceeding have access to the same information. In technical terms, this is called a restriction on ex-parte communication. This means that once a project proponent has submitted a licensing or relicensing application, FERC will restrict its staff from communicating with one party, without other participants present. Instead, FERC wants communication to be in writing and submitted to the publicly available docket.

All final decision-making authority technically rests with the commissioners. However, throughout a licensing process, lower-level FERC staff will make determinations and prepare documents, such as the environmental review documents under NEPA. Each project will have FERC staff assigned as project coordinators, and those project coordinators can answer procedural questions about the specific FERC process for that project. However, they cannot answer substantive questions, due to their “decisional” role once an application has been submitted.

Given the ex-parte communication constraints applied to FERC proceedings, it is important for Tribal Nations to know when and how they can communicate with FERC, as well as what resources are available to support Tribal engagement:

For additional questions from Tribal Nations, FERC’s Office of External Affairs interfaces with Tribal governments.

FERC’s Office of Public Participation can assist individual Tribal members with questions, and its staff are considered non-decisional.

FERC also established a Tribal Liaison position. The Tribal liaison position is intended to educate the Commission and Commission staff about Tribal governments and cultures, to serve as a guide for Tribal Nations navigating Commission processes, and to ensure that consultation requirements are met.

FERC has put together a Tribal Participation Guide for FERC Environmental Reviews resource that provides key information for Tribal Nations.

Section 2.1: How FERC Licensing Works

A project proponent can choose to follow one of three license processes: the Integrated License Process, the Traditional License Process, or the Alternative Licensing Process. Each process has different timelines, deadlines, and order of actions. The Integrated License Process (ILP) is the default, and this article focuses on the ILP framework, as defined in 18 C.F.R. Part 5.

The formal FERC licensing process is divided into two distinct periods: pre-application and post-filing activity. The pre-application period can be viewed as the information gathering phase, while the post filing period is FERC’s decision-making phase.

The pre-application period begins when the project proponent submits a notice to FERC proposing a new project or initiating the relicense of an existing project. The process next includes a scoping phase and a study plan determination phase to understand the impacts of the proposed project. Once there has been a determination on the study plan, the project proponent undertakes a two-year study process. Throughout this period, Tribal Nations, agencies, and all other members of the public can comment on study reports and otherwise engage in study development.

After completing the studies, the project proponent files a license application, which signals the start of the post-filing period. Once the application has been filed with FERC, Tribal Nations, agencies, and members of the public can submit proposed license conditions that create the rules for how the project proponent will construct and operate the project. FERC considers these license conditions when reviewing the project but is only obligated to accept those that are mandatory under sections 4(e) and 18 of the FPA. FERC then begins its environmental review under NEPA, which relies on the project proponent’s studies and information included in the application. The environmental review must include consideration of the draft license conditions. Next, FERC issues a final license order deciding whether to issue the license. If FERC does issue a license, the final order will include the conditions on that license.

In addition to the formal process discussed above, settlement negotiations can occur at any time before FERC issues a final license order.[6] Settlement negotiations allow the project proponent and other participants to come together and collaborate on an agreement for how the proposed project will operate. By engaging in the settlement process, Tribal Nations can have more influence on the license application and the conditions placed on the proposed project. A project proponent has an incentive to participate in the settlement process because certain federal and state agencies that have the authority to issue mandatory license conditions may come to the table for a more mutually beneficial outcome. Those agencies will be discussed in Sections 3 and 4, below. In general, FERC has a policy favoring settlement because it can resolve conflicts in highly contested hydropower licensing proceedings. However, Tribal Nations also face ongoing challenges with settlement inclusion and settlement enforcement.

A Recent Settlement on the Skagit: In December 2025, after over seven years, a comprehensive settlement was reached amongst the three Skagit River Tribes, Seattle City Light, the State Departments of Ecology and Fish & Wildlife, and federal regional leaders at the National Marine Fisheries Service, U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs and National Park Service Seattle for a new 50-year federal hydroelectric dam license for the City of Seattle’s three dams on the Skagit River. The settlement will “guide how Seattle will invest approximately $4 billion dollars in the Skagit River watershed for estuary and mainstem habitat restoration, flow protections for salmon at all life stages, adaptive management and scientific research, and fish passage.” (Statement from Chairman Edwards, Swinomish Indian Tribal Community.)

For each project, FERC creates an online docket that makes available all the applicant submissions, responses from FERC, and comments from Tribal Nations, agencies, any other participants, and the public. The docket system is difficult to navigate, unfortunately, but FERC provides instructions on how to file a comment. Alternatively, Tribal Nations can submit comments by mail.

Section 2.2: Tribal Engagement in FERC Proceedings

FERC’s Tribal consultation policy recognizes its trust responsibility to Tribal Nations.[7] The Policy requires the Commission to “assure that tribal concerns and interests are considered whenever the Commission’s actions or decisions have the potential to adversely affect Indian tribes, Indian trust resources, or treaty rights.”[8] And in addition to the provisions of the FPA, FERC licensing processes must also comply with other federal laws, including NEPA, the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), the Clean Water Act (CWA), and the Endangered Species Act (ESA), each of which have its own Tribal consultation requirements.

During the pre-application phase, FERC is obligated to initiate consultation with affected Tribal Nations.[9] Tribal Nations also have the right to request government-to-government consultation by contacting FERC’s State, International, and Tribal Affairs Division, the point of contact listed in a letter or notice they received from FERC staff, or FERC’s Commissioners.[10] FERC outreach “extends both to federally recognized Tribal Nations located in the project area and to those Tribes with a historic interest in the project area,” and the consultation can address NEPA, NHPA, and other relevant analyses that FERC must consider in its decision-making.[11]

However, FERC’s restrictions on ex-parte communication create a major challenge for Tribal Nations seeking government-to-government consultation once an application has been submitted. As noted in Section 1, because FERC operates as a quasi-judicial agency, FERC limits the communication that its decision-making staff can have with Tribal Nations and all other parties to a licensing proceeding.

And even before a project proponent submits a final license application, FERC’s restrictions on consultation are poorly defined. Even in the pre-application phase, FERC will sometimes refuse to consult on issues that it believes are likely to be disputed later in the process. FERC’s policy does not define when it will deny a consultation request in the pre-application phase and instead decides on a “case-by-case” basis. The lack of guidance makes it difficult to predict when FERC may refuse to consult about an issue.

When to Seek Government-to-Government Consultation? It is important for Tribal Nations to be strategic about when they seek government-to-government consultation with FERC to make that consultation most effective. FERC typically does not intervene during the pre-application stage except as required by regulation to resolve disagreements and amend the approved study plan as appropriate, after the initial and updated study reports are filed. However, situations may arise in the pre-application phase where the project proponent is taking actions that actively harm Tribal interests. If the project proponent is acting in a way counter to a Tribal Nation’s interests and refusing to engage with the Tribal Nation, the Tribal Nation may consider requesting consultation with FERC.

Once a project proponent submits a final license application, FERC will no longer conduct government-to-government consultations with Tribal Nations off the record. FERC may agree to meet with a Tribal Nation, but anyone else will be allowed to come to the meeting, and FERC will issue a transcript or summary of the meeting for the public docket. However, Tribal Nations may still have off-the-record discussions with decisional FERC staff if they participate in the NEPA process as a cooperating agency. Regardless of the phase of the process, anyone can continue to ask FERC staff about procedural matters.

In addition to consultation, at every step of a FERC proceeding Tribal Nations can submit comments on the record. Tribal Nations should submit comments in response to specific documents during their relevant comment periods, but they can submit comments on the record at any point. Submitting comments on the record is critically important because FERC will respond to comments and make its decisions based on the information in the record. The Commission won’t necessarily raise an issue independently; for example, if a project proponent is failing to follow study requirements laid out in its approved study plan. There will typically be at least seven comment periods throughout the process. This provides an opportunity for Tribal Nations to participate in the licensing process but also requires substantial capacity.

Each licensing process will have different nuances that make engagement at individual stages particularly critical. Here we highlight three stages that are consistently important:

Study Plan.

FERC has its own requirements for studies, but by engaging in the process, Tribal Nations can seek to have additional studies included in the FERC-approved study plan, such as environmental, cultural resources, and economic studies. For example, FERC will not independently require studies considering climate change, its impact on future water flows, and how climate change might impact fish or the economic viability of a project.[12] This remains true even though changing weather patterns are impacting the reliability of hydropower projects. However, Tribal Nations can submit suggested studies on these topics and work with the project proponent to include them in the proposed study plan.

The project proponent submits a study plan to FERC in two phases: first a proposed plan that lays out the scope of the project proponent’s pre-application studies forming the basis for FERC’s environmental and cultural reviews of the proposed project, and second, a revised study plan that responds to comments. Commenting on both phases of the study plan provides an opportunity for Tribal Nations to shape the studies.

During the study period FERC often authorizes the project proponent to initiate informal consultation with Tribal Nations and other requisite state and federal agencies under Section 106 of the NHPA and Section 7 of the ESA, although FERC remains legally responsible for all findings and determinations.[13] Tribal Nations are not required to consult with the project proponent, but they may propose natural and cultural resource studies on the basis of FERC’s federal obligations.

Intervention and/or Participation as a Cooperating Agency under NEPA.

Tribal Nations and all other parties must formally intervene in a licensing proceeding to challenge a final FERC licensing decision. Intervention is required both to bring an agency rehearing challenge, and to bring a challenge in court. Intervention must occur during the 60-day comment period after an applicant submits a final license application.

A Note on Process: If a Tribal Nation is authorized by the Environmental Protection Agency to issue water quality certifications under Section 401 of the CWA, it may file a timely notice of intervention rather than a motion to intervene. See Section 3, Part B below for more information on the role of Section 401 certification in FERC hydropower processes.

Challenging a FERC decision starts with a request for an agency rehearing after FERC issues a final license order. If FERC denies the rehearing request, then an intervenor can appeal the decision to court.

Generally, intervention comes with no additional obligations other than a requirement to provide all other intervenors with copies of any documents filed on the FERC docket. However, due to the ex parte communication restrictions, FERC prevents agencies acting as cooperating agencies in the NEPA process, including Tribal Nations, from also intervening in the proceeding. Despite this general rule, in some instances, FERC will allow a Tribal Nation to participate as both an intervenor and a cooperating agency. However, Tribal staff working on the intervention must be separated from Tribal staff working on the environmental documents, and they cannot exchange information. FERC has discretion to approve or deny such an arrangement. Participating as both an intervenor and a cooperating agency gives Tribal Nations the maximum opportunity to advocate for their interests in the permitting process, but it requires significant capacity that many Tribal Nations do not have.

License Conditions.

License conditions place requirements on how a project proponent must construct, operate, and maintain their facility. License conditions are the primary method FERC uses to achieve its obligation to balance power and non-power values. FERC issues these conditions when it issues a license. Tribal Nations and all other participants can suggest conditions during the 60-day comment period after an applicant submits its final license [14]

License conditions will become the final rules that can serve to protect Tribal interests. For example, a license condition could protect fish passage by requiring fish screens on the intake or requiring ongoing fish monitoring. Some conditions can protect both fish and water quality through limits on the amount of flow that can be diverted or requiring a minimum amount of flow to be released. Additionally, for projects that create a reservoir, FERC typically requires the project proponent to construct recreational facilities such as a boat launch. Tribal Nations should submit proposed license conditions to ensure that the project proponent and FERC consider their interests and should engage with relevant agencies with license conditioning authority to advocate for conditions that protect Tribal interests.

License Conditions Can Lead to Salmon Restoration: In one of the most prominent campaigns to protect Tribal fishery resources through FERC relicensing, the Yurok, Karuk, Hoopa Valley, and Klamath Tribes fought for decades to restore salmon to the Klamath River and its tributaries. This effort ultimately led to the decommissioning and removal of four hydropower dams on the Klamath River. FERC issued the original dam licenses in 1954 which allowed the project to completely block salmon from returning to their spawning grounds in half of the basin. In the early 2000s, the project owner, PacifiCorp, filed a relicensing application. Right before the relicensing application was filed, the Klamath River experienced one of the largest fish kills recorded in United States history in 2002. After integrating recommendations from the Tribal Nations along the Klamath River, FERC’s draft license conditions demanded new provisions for fish passage.

PacifiCorp determined that implementing those conditions would require operating the project at a loss, which led the parties to begin settlement negotiations. Those negotiations eventually led to a revised proposal for the decommissioning and removal of dams. The dams were finally removed from the river in October 2024, freeing 420 miles of the Klamath River and its tributaries in California and Oregon. Since the dam removals, the Tribal Nations have seen the salmon return.

Amy Bowers Cordalis, Executive Director of the Ridges to Riffles Indigenous Conservation Group and former General Counsel for the Yurok Tribe, recently published a book on her family’s contributions to this campaign to restore the salmon, entitled The Water Remembers.

Section 3: Avenues for Protecting Tribal Rights and Resources

Despite the various requirements to consider Tribal interests at different stages of a FERC hydropower licensing process, the barriers to entry are high, and there are significant gaps in the statutory and regulatory framework that prevent Tribal Nations from protecting their rights and resources. Engaging in a licensing process requires substantial capacity and technical expertise. And even when Tribal Nations possess the necessary resources, it is difficult to know how to put them to efficient use. This section covers four opportunities that Tribal Nations should consider when deciding how to engage.

Mandatory Conditions Applying to Projects Located within a Federal Reservation

Section 4(e) of the FPA[15] places additional requirements on FERC when a proposed hydropower project is located within a federal reservation, including Tribal lands held in trust by the United States, or most federal public lands. To license a project on Tribal land, FERC must first find that the license will not “interfere or be inconsistent with the purposes for which the reservation was created or acquired.”[16] Second, FERC must include all the license conditions that the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) determines are necessary for the “adequate protection and utilization of such reservation.”[17] The BIA has this authority because it is the agency within the Department of the Interior that manages Tribal trust lands on behalf of the federal government.

The BIA does not possess veto power for a hydropower license, but its conditions are mandatory. And unlike other participants, agencies with 4(e) authority can formally dispute the study plan determination, giving these agencies more sway at an earlier stage in the process.[18] The BIA Hydropower Compliance Program is the office that develops and imposes conditions deemed necessary for the adequate protection of Tribal rights and resources. Tribal Nations should reach out to this office as early as possible in the process to communicate the conditions that are necessary to protect their interests. Once a license has been issued, the BIA is also responsible for monitoring the project to ensure the final license conditions are implemented sufficiently to protect Tribal interests. The BIA also has limited funding available for Tribal technical support.

An additional challenge faced by Tribal Nations in Alaska is that only one out of 229 federally recognized Tribal Nations in the state has a reservation. This limits the potential for the 4(e) mandatory license conditions to be applicable for most Alaska Tribes.

Looking Forward: There has been at least one attempt to propose legislative reform shifting 4(e) mandatory conditioning authority away from the Department of the Interior and to the relevant Tribal Nation. The reform package did not pass, but these reforms remain potential solutions to some limitations that face Tribal Nations in FERC hydropower proceedings.

Leveraging Water Quality Certification under CWA Section 401(a)

FERC may only issue a hydropower license if the project is certified by the state or Tribal Nation with jurisdiction over the affected water body under CWA Section 401. If a Tribal Nation has “Treatment as a State” (TAS) authority under Section 401, FERC must include in its license any conditions that the Tribal Nation requires to certify that the project will not violate the applicable water quality standards.

More information on how a Tribal Nation obtains TAS jurisdiction under the CWA and what authority that grants Tribal Nations is available at An Introduction to the Clean Water Act.

If a Tribal Nation also has its own water quality standards under CWA Section 303, it may place conditions on the hydropower project based on those Tribally defined water quality standards, which may be set to protect ceremonial uses and culturally significant resources. A certification may establish a minimum flow schedule or flow storage or require certain types of fish passage. As with FPA Section 4(e) or 18 conditions, these are mandatory, and FERC may not amend or delete them from the license.

Protecting Properties of Traditional, Religious and Cultural Significance through NHPA Section 106

Prior to issuing a license, FERC is required to conduct an analysis under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).[19] This includes consulting with Tribal Nations to identify potentially affected properties of traditional, religious, and cultural significance, assessing the adverse effects of the proposed hydropower project on those properties, and developing and evaluating alternatives that could “avoid, minimize, or mitigate” those effects.

The project proponent assists FERC in meeting its obligations under Section 106 by following the applicable procedures.[20] However, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation’s Handbook on Consultation with Indian Tribes in the Section 106 Review Process states that “[e]ven when an Indian tribe agrees to coordinate with an applicant, the federal agency remains responsible for ensuring that the Section process is carried out properly, meeting the letter and spirit of the law, as well as resolving any issues or disputes.”

Under Section 106, FERC recognizes that Tribal Nations possess “special expertise” regarding the evaluation of these properties and how to resolve adverse effects to them. Participating as a consulting party in the Section 106 process is one way that Tribal Nations can seek to insert conditions or requirements into a hydropower license or can pursue an alternative binding commitment, such as a memorandum of agreement. Investing in the Section 106 process may also provide a Tribal Nation with more leverage to bring into settlement discussions.

Developing Comprehensive Plans for Affected Watersheds

Under Section 10(a) of the FPA,[21] FERC is required to consider how a proposed project fits within a comprehensive plan for improving or developing a waterway based on equal consideration of both power and non-power values.[22] This includes the requirement to solicit and consider license conditions from Tribal Nations affected by the project.[23] Proposed licensing conditions submitted based on solicitation under Section 10(a) are not afforded any deference, but this clause provides a statutory mandate for Tribal involvement in FERC hydropower licensing processes. In addition, the project proponent’s application must include an explanation of whether the project would comply with any relevant comprehensive plan. If a Tribal Nation determines that the project would be inconsistent with such a plan, the project proponent must include that determination.[24]

Building on the statutory and regulatory language, FERC’s Tribal consultation policy explicitly requires the Commission to consider any comprehensive plans developed by Tribal Nations or inter-Tribal organizations for improving or conserving an affected waterway affected by the proposed project when evaluating a proposed hydroelectric project.[25] Thus, Tribal development of comprehensive plans for a waterway can help shape FERC’s analysis of a proposed project.

This section is far from exhaustive, and there are other ways for Tribal Nations to protect their resources during FERC proceedings that are not explored in depth below, including seeking protection through a “rights of nature” framework.

Section 4: Opportunities to Leverage Other Agencies

While FERC has the final say on whether to issue a license, other agencies have significant authority over the license conditions that FERC must include in a license. Tribal Nations can engage and coordinate directly with those agencies to share knowledge, and advocate for license conditions that protect Tribal interests.

Section 18: Mandatory Conditions Applying to Projects That May Affect Fish Passage

National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) have the authority to issue mandatory license conditions that ensure “fishways” to ensure fish can safely travel up and downstream through the project.[26] These conditions are often called “fishway prescriptions” or “section 18 prescriptions,” in reference to a section of the Federal Power Act. [27] FERC does not have the discretion to change or reject these. [28]

Section 10(j): Requirement to Solicit Condition Recommendations from Other Agencies

Under Section 10(j) of the FPA,[29] FERC is required to include in any hydropower license conditions that “adequately and equitably protect, mitigate damages to, and enhance, fish and wildlife” affected by the project. FERC is required to give deference to recommendations for these conditions from NMFS, USFWS, and State fish and wildlife agencies. The Commission is only allowed to reject these recommendations if it thinks they are inconsistent with the Federal Power Act or another law. [30] FERC is also required to work with agencies to resolve disagreements about their 10(j) recommendations, which may include convening a meeting or technical conference. If an agreement cannot be reached, FERC will publish its final decision rejecting the recommendations.

Dive Brief:

State utility regulators are urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to direct the Midcontinent Independent System Operator to hold a stakeholder process to determine how to allocate costs from power plants the U.S. Department of Energy orders to run past their planned retirements.

At the same time, the Sierra Club and five other groups asked DOE to reconsider its “emergency” orders directing Northern Indiana Public Service Co., a division of NiSource, and CenterPoint Energy to continue running three coal-fired units in Indiana totaling more than 950 MW. In the rehearing request — a possible precursor to a lawsuit — the groups contend MISO doesn’t face a resource adequacy emergency as DOE claims.

Operating NIPSCO’s Schahfer units 17 and 18 and CenterPoint’s Culley unit 2 for 90 days under the DOE orders will cost at least $20.6 million, according to a report Synapse Energy Economics prepared for the Sierra Club, the Environmental Law and Policy Center and Earthjustice. If DOE extends its 90-day orders, the units will require about $34 million in maintenance and environmental upgrade costs, the consulting firm said.

Dive Insight:

The filings at FERC from at least 10 states and at DOE are the latest steps related to the department’s efforts to use its emergency authority under the Federal Power Act’s section 202(c) to keep power plants from retiring.

DOE last year prevented six power plants totaling about 4,300 MW from retiring. Five of the power plants burn coal. They are in Colorado, Indiana, Michigan and Washington. DOE also ordered Constellation Energy to continue running two oil- and gas-fired units totaling 760 MW at its Eddystone plant in Pennsylvania. So far, DOE hasn’t let any of its 90-day orders for those power plants lapse.

The orders claim the regions where the plants are located face a severe power shortage that constitutes an emergency, necessitating the need to keep the plants online.

Lawsuits are pending in federal court to overturn some of those orders. In part, the suits say DOE failed to show there are emergencies affecting the power systems in the Upper Midwest or the Mid-Atlantic region.

Besides legal questions around DOE’s use of its emergency authority, one of the key questions is: who will pay to keep the power plants online?

Consumers Energy — the majority owner and operator of the 1,560-MW, coal-fired J.H. Campbell plant in West Olive, Michigan — spent $164 million running the plant through its first 90-day order and part of the second one while incurring an $80 million loss, Synapse said, citing U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

The Illinois Commerce Commission on Friday asked FERC to put a pause on CenterPoint’s request to recover its costs from ratepayers for keeping its Culley unit online to give MISO stakeholders time to vet a cost recovery mechanism.

FERC in mid-August rejected similar requests for a MISO stakeholder process to determine a cost allocation plan for the Campbell power plant. As a result, costs are set to be shared across MISO’s central and northern regions.

Since then, however, the circumstances have changed, according to the ICC.

“DOE’s emergency orders are becoming routine,” the utility regulators said. “It seems likely that current 202(c) orders will be extended and that more orders are likely to be issued, potentially for years. The likely frequency and length of these orders … is crucial in considering how to handle cost allocation for generating units that are unexpectedly and unnecessarily being retained on the system.”

The Organization of MISO States and the ICC made similar arguments at FERC in response to NIPSCO’s earlier request for cost recovery related to the DOE order on its Schahfer units.

“States must have a meaningful opportunity to evaluate impacts to their ratepayers and to represent those interests before the Commission reaches any final determination,” OMS said in a Jan. 20 filing at FERC.

If FERC routinely approves broad regional cost allocation for DOE’s emergency orders without showing the benefits from keeping the power plants online, utilities may be incentivized to speed up power plant retirements and “cash in” on shifting costs away from local customers and onto an 11-state region, OMS said.

“Under NIPSCO’s proposal, costs would be broadly allocated across MISO’s North and Central Subregions, including to customers and states for which no reliability benefit has been identified, including Indiana,” OMS said, noting that the PJM Interconnection had a stakeholder process to determine how to allocate costs from Constellation’s Eddystone units.

“That stakeholder-driven approach underscores a fundamental principle: meaningful engagement and transparent deliberation are essential before costs are imposed on customers, particularly where benefits are unclear or have not been demonstrated,” OMS said.

FERC should only approve a cost allocation plan that is based on “clear need and demonstrable benefits,” according to OMS. “Any such recovery must also include a detailed explanation of why existing MISO planning and cost allocation frameworks — designed precisely for evaluating regional needs and benefits — were inadequate or not followed.”

“OMS recognizes that the lack of a clear demonstration of need in DOE’s 202(c) orders has put the Commission in a position of having to approve cost allocation mechanisms where benefits may not exist or at best, are unclear,” the organization said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/IyJhC9VkQ_83WIXj9pkLEqlQ7YjN-h2nA8BDpV1nStU/g:nowe:0:245/c:1280:723/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9TY2hhZmZlcl8yMTA1LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2026-01-26 12:01:17.552642

Under the previous tax regime, businesses were forced to amortize their Research and Development (R&D) expenses over five years rather than deducting them immediately.
This new provision allows companies to fully and immediately deduct 100% of their domestic R&D costs—including software development—in the year they are incurred.
Not only did it restore R&D expensing, but it also reinstated 100% bonus depreciation for new manufacturing facilities and equipment.
The market’s reaction was swift; the industrial sector posted a 16% gain in 2025, marking its best year in a generation.","As of late January 2026, the United States is witnessing its most significant industrial transformation since the post-war era. What started as a policy debate over technical tax accounting has ballooned into a full-scale ""Manufacturing Renaissance,"" fueled by the landmark One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) signed into law in mid-2025. By reinstating immediate R&D expensing and introducing unprecedented incentives for domestic production, the federal government has effectively supercharged the balance sheets of American industrial giants.

The immediate implications are visible in both the skylines of the Rust Belt and the ticker tapes of Wall Street. For the first time in decades, the industrial sector has become a primary driver of stock market growth, outperforming even the technology sector in several months of late 2025. With an estimated $3.5 trillion in new manufacturing investments announced since the bill’s passage, the shift from a service-led economy back toward a high-tech industrial powerhouse appears not just possible, but inevitable.

The Legislative Spark: From Amortization to Acceleration

The catalyst for this surge was the resolution of a long-standing ""innovation tax"" that had plagued U.S. companies since 2022. Under the previous tax regime, businesses were forced to amortize their Research and Development (R&D) expenses over five years rather than deducting them immediately. This changed on July 4, 2025, when the OBBBA was signed, introducing Section 174A. This new provision allows companies to fully and immediately deduct 100% of their domestic R&D costs—including software development—in the year they are incurred.

The timeline leading to this moment was fraught with political gridlock. Following the failure of the Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act in 2024, the manufacturing sector faced a ""capital crunch"" that threatened to derail the reshoring movement. However, the OBBBA went much further than its predecessors. Not only did it restore R&D expensing, but it also reinstated 100% bonus depreciation for new manufacturing facilities and equipment. This means a company building a $2 billion semiconductor plant or an automated assembly line can now write off the entire investment in year one, drastically increasing the net present value of domestic projects.

Key stakeholders, including the National Association of Manufacturers and major labor unions, have hailed the move as a ""Buy American"" masterstroke. By maintaining a 15-year amortization penalty for R&D conducted outside the U.S., the law has created a powerful financial gravity that is pulling technical teams and high-value laboratory work back to American soil. The market’s reaction was swift; the industrial sector posted a 16% gain in 2025, marking its best year in a generation.

The Winners' Circle: Industrial Titans Unleashed

The most profound impact of the tax changes is seen in the financial performance of R&D-heavy industrial leaders. GE Aerospace (NYSE: GE) has emerged as a poster child for the renaissance, with its stock price surging over 60% in the last year. The company’s ability to immediately expense development costs for its next-generation engine programs has freed up billions in cash flow, allowing for record-breaking capital expenditures and share buybacks.

In the semiconductor space, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) has utilized the expanded Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit—which the OBBBA increased from 25% to 35%—to offset the massive costs of its new domestic ""mega-fabs."" Analysts estimate that for a facility like Intel’s $40 billion site in New Mexico, these tax provisions could reduce the net cost by as much as $12 billion. Meanwhile, Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) is seeing a significant EPS boost, as its customers in the construction and mining sectors take advantage of bonus depreciation to modernize their fleets with new, high-margin machinery.

Other major beneficiaries include:

Eaton Corporation (NYSE: ETN): Benefiting from the ""AI buildout,"" Eaton is seeing a flood of orders for electrical infrastructure, supported by OBBBA incentives for domestic transformer production.

Rockwell Automation (NYSE: ROK): As manufacturers rush to automate their new U.S.-based factories to offset labor costs, Rockwell’s digital manufacturing solutions have seen a double-digit spike in demand.

Emerson Electric Co. (NYSE: EMR): Despite global trade headwinds, Emerson has maintained strong margins by leveraging tax credits to optimize its own domestic footprint and cater to the booming energy-tech sector.

A Structural Shift in Global Competition

The significance of these tax changes extends far beyond corporate balance sheets; it marks a fundamental pivot in U.S. economic policy. By shifting the interest deductibility limits (Section 163(j)) back to an EBITDA-based calculation in 2025, the OBBBA has allowed capital-intensive manufacturers to take on more debt for expansion at a lower net cost. This moves the U.S. closer to the ""industrial policy"" models seen in East Asia, though with a distinctly American focus on private-sector incentives rather than direct state ownership.

This event fits into a broader trend of ""de-globalization"" and national security-focused economics. The ""Foreign Penalty"" within Section 174 has created a ripple effect among competitors. European and Asian manufacturers are now facing a choice: keep their R&D hubs at home and lose the American tax advantage, or relocate their most innovative divisions to the U.S. This ""brain drain"" toward the American industrial sector has already sparked trade tensions with the EU, which has characterized the OBBBA as a protectionist move similar to the early days of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Historically, this period is being compared to the industrial surge of the late 1940s. However, the 2026 version is uniquely digital. The integration of AI into manufacturing—which is expected to grow by 60% this year—is being directly subsidized by these R&D provisions, creating a ""smart manufacturing"" ecosystem that is increasingly difficult for overseas competitors to replicate.

The Road Ahead: Opportunities and Gridlocks

In the short term, the market expects the industrial sector to continue its upward trajectory as more companies ""catch up"" on their 2022–2024 tax filings and deploy the resulting cash into new projects. However, a major strategic pivot is already underway: companies are shifting their focus from pure capacity expansion to ""labor-saving innovation."" Because the U.S. is facing a severe shortage of skilled tradespeople—electricians, welders, and HVAC technicians—the next wave of CapEx will likely be dominated by robotics and autonomous logistics.

Market participants should be wary of potential ""pinch points."" The same tax breaks that are driving factory construction are also fueling the AI data center boom, leading to a fierce competition for energy grid access and electrical components. If the U.S. power grid cannot keep pace with the demand from these new industrial and tech hubs, the ""Renaissance"" could hit a physical ceiling.

Looking toward 2027 and 2028, the sustainability of this trend will depend on whether the federal government can address these infrastructure and labor bottlenecks. Investors should watch for strategic moves by companies like Eaton and GE Vernova as they attempt to modernize the grid.

Final Assessment: A New Era for Investors

The return to immediate R&D expensing has done more than just simplify the tax code; it has signaled to the world that the United States is serious about reclaiming its industrial crown. The OBBBA of 2025 has created a virtuous cycle where tax savings are reinvested into high-tech domestic facilities, which in turn drive demand for automation, power management, and advanced machinery.

For investors, the key takeaway is that the ""industrial"" label is no longer synonymous with ""slow growth."" In this new environment, companies like Intel, GE, and Rockwell Automation are behaving more like high-growth tech firms, with R&D-driven flywheels and significant government tailwinds. The sector is no longer just a defensive play; it is the engine of the current market cycle.

Moving forward, the market will be hyper-focused on quarterly CapEx announcements and the ""domestic content"" ratios in corporate earnings reports. As the tax benefits of the OBBBA fully bake into the numbers over the coming months, the gap between domestic-focused winners and globalized laggards will only continue to widen.

Commercial and industrial customers will see their monthly bills drop between 9.6% and 15.8% when compared to January.
Duke spokeswoman Aly Raschid said the company’s storm recovery plan helped them get the power back on as soon as possible following the 2024 hurricanes.
“Between our improvements to our plants in Bartow and St. Pete, we were able to shave off about $10 from all of our customers’ bills,” Raschid said.
“Duke has already fully recovered their storm costs, and that is why they need to stop collecting at the end of the month.","If you're a Duke Energy customer, your electricity bill could be cheaper starting next month.

But it's not because costs are coming down.

The reduction comes after the company received enough money from its customers to cover its $1.1 billion storm recovery effort.

According to the company, residential customers will receive about $33 off per 1,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) used.

Commercial and industrial customers will see their monthly bills drop between 9.6% and 15.8% when compared to January.

Moreover, residential electricity bills will be lower by an additional $11 per 1,000 kWh used starting in March, resulting in a total cutback of $44 compared to January.

Duke spokeswoman Aly Raschid said the company’s storm recovery plan helped them get the power back on as soon as possible following the 2024 hurricanes.

“We bring in a ton of resources to help us get the lights back on for our customers,” she said. “We’ve brought in crews from all over the country that we have to house and feed, and that’s where all of our costs came from. We were constantly monitoring to see where we were in the recovery process, and we found that we had enough funds to remove the cost, so we did that immediately.”

Last year, the company announced improvements to its infrastructure throughout the state.

“Between our improvements to our plants in Bartow and St. Pete, we were able to shave off about $10 from all of our customers’ bills,” Raschid said.

According to the company, those upgrades, along with $65 million in Inflation Reduction Act tax credits, will help lower customer bills even further in the future.

However, Food and Water Watch Florida State Director Brooke Ward said the decision to end the storm surcharge was not voluntary.

“Duke has already fully recovered their storm costs, and that is why they need to stop collecting at the end of the month. Otherwise, they would overcollect,” Ward said. “Duke bills are still up by over $25 per month from what they were five years ago, a 44% increase between December 2019 and June 2025, and they plan to increase rates again in the next year.”

Ward said she believes the decision followed a November hearing in which state regulators ordered Duke to end the charge early.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/850b98d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2009x1055+0+37/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6f%2F9c%2F10347443469cb8386ecc4a3212dc%2Fduke-energy.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 12:02:07.610999

From Native Americans to hunters of today, hunting has provided sustenance and connected people to the land. For nearly 100 years, hunters have played a vital role in funding the conservation of wildlife habitat through taxes on firearms, ammunition and archery equipment. Hunters brought in nearly $1 billion dollars in funding for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2025.

Despite this, many wildlife species are in decline. For example, in Idaho, you’ll find that even mule deer are experiencing a population decline in the state. There are similar stories of species, game and non-game, declining in states across the country.

It’s no surprise then that hunting business, clubs and more joined us in supporting a bill in Congress to conserve and enhance wildlife corridors.

Last fall, several of us at Environment America began reaching out to hunting related businesses and organizations to gauge their support for wildlife corridors. We found widespread support for a bipartisan wildlife corridors bill. In total, 82 outdoorsmen and women, outdoor recreation businesses and conservationists signed a letter to Congress urging passage of the Wildlife Movement Through Partnerships Act.

Sportsman’s clubs, rod and gun clubs, outfitters and guides, gun shops, and the like signed the letter to Congress asking it to ensure the survival of species and the heritage of the great outdoors for all Americans.

Wildlife populations declining

Wildlife populations have experienced a dramatic decline and continue to face significant threats throughout the U.S. In North America, monitored wildlife populations decreased 39 percent from 1970 to 2020. Habitat loss remains a huge challenge.

From elk to trout, panthers to mule deer, pronghorn to black bears, and more, animals need room to roam so they can migrate, hunt, graze and mate. They need habitat to support their movement and fewer barriers along migration routes.

To help support the conservation needs of wildlife, including connecting and protecting habitats, bi-partisan legislation called the Wildlife Movement Through Partnerships Act was introduced in 2025. The legislation introduced by Republican Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana and Democratic Representative Don Beyer of Virginia would conserve, restore and enhance habitat, migration routes and connectivity for wildlife all across this country.

In addition to habitat conservation along migration routes, the bill would fund mapping of wildlife movements and increased coordination and technical assistance between state, federal and tribal wildlife management agencies for the benefit of wildlife.

Investor attention has turned to regulatory shifts as China steers toward a more liberalised commodity futures market. In this context, china to open nickel and lithium futures to foreign investors is emerging as a crucial development. Furthermore, evolving market dynamics and global integration are making it imperative to understand how reform impacts pricing and risk management.

Investor sentiment is also influenced by emerging trends such as china demand trends and shifting market fundamentals. Additionally, policy changes have led to recalibrated investment flows globally.

Why Are Nickel and Lithium Strategic to China and the World?

Nickel and lithium are the backbone of the energy transition. They are vital for powering electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy storage, and next-generation battery chemistries. Their importance is amplified by China’s leading position in these value chains.

• China’s share of global battery manufacturing is projected at roughly 60-70% in 2025.

• Nickel’s role is growing, with global demand expected to reach 3.5 million tonnes by 2030.

• Lithium demand is outpacing supply forecasts with 1.5 million tonnes of LCE required annually by 2030.

• China’s consumption footprint accounts for 50-60% of global nickel production and 60% of lithium output each year.

These commodities remain tethered to international pricing benchmarks such as London and index-referenced contracts. Consequently, policymakers and industry players are reassessing strategies to mitigate price shocks.

How Have China’s Previous Commodity Futures Reforms Fared?

China’s commodity market opening is not new. However, previous attempts encountered structural headwinds. For instance, despite incremental progress, legacy pricing norms remain resilient.

Timeline of Key Reforms:

• Dalian Iron Ore Futures (2018) – modest foreign participation.

• SHFE Int’l Crude Oil Futures (2018) – moderate foreign share.

• SHFE Int’l Copper Futures (2020) – foreign volume below 30%.

Underlying issues have included capital controls, operational mismatches, and currency risks. Moreover, investors often cite US-China trade impacts when discussing market constraints.

While progress is evident, legacy benchmarks such as LME Nickel or ICE Brent Crude continue to dominate global pricing.

How Does Expanding Futures Market Access Impact Price Discovery and Global Trade?

Recent regulatory changes promise to reshape participation models and the mechanics of price discovery considerably. For instance, on 26 January 2026, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) designated 14 contracts—including nickel and lithium carbonate— for foreign participation.

What Are the Regulatory Changes Underway?

Both the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) and Guangzhou Futures Exchange (GFEX) are making operational upgrades. These include:

• Allowing foreign currency-posted collateral for yuan trades.

• Introduction of a global-style margin requirement.

• Streamlined onboarding processes and enhanced audit mechanisms.

Although neither the precise start date nor the complete contract list has been disclosed, market participants eagerly await the reforms. In addition, innovative strategies such as China’s mining strategy hint at broader ambitions.

What Mechanisms Enable Foreign Participation?

Regulatory innovations underpinning market liberalisation include:

• Collateral flexibility: Using major currencies as collateral.

• Risk management alignment: Harmonised margin calls and cross-border reporting.

• Evolving capital controls: Gradual relaxation without full convertibility.

These measures are expected to bolster trust among international participants. Notably, foreign nickel and lithium futures provide useful context regarding newly available hedging options.

What Are the Potential Effects on Commodity Pricing Power and Market Liquidity?

The impact of opening China’s futures markets depends on the pace at which these platforms match Western exchanges across several dimensions. China’s domestic exchanges must now contend with established players renowned for their liquidity and robust risk management frameworks.

How Do Domestic and International Exchanges Compete?

Foreign institutional investors tend to gravitate towards venues with:

• Ample liquidity and tight bid-ask spreads.

• Transparent and predictable regulations.

• Robust clearinghouse protections.

Meanwhile, markets such as SHFE and GFEX are rapidly adapting with new technical reforms. This is highlighted by their increasing influence in price discovery and risk management practices. As market evolution continues, additional insights such as lithium industry innovations further enhance strategic understanding.

What Could Dampen China’s Efforts to Dislodge Existing Benchmarks?

Factors that may dilute China’s ambitions include:

• Capital convertibility challenges: Investors may face delays in repatriating capital.

• Concerns about transparency: Building trust in new governance structures takes time.

• Operational interoperability issues: Discrepancies with Western exchange systems can reduce arbitrage efficiency.

These challenges underscore why, despite the momentum, reforms must address entrenched market practices.

How Might These Reforms Change Risk Management for Miners and Manufacturers?

Global participants will soon gain new hedging tools through enhanced market access. For instance, offshore miners and OEMs can directly engage with SHFE and GFEX contracts. China to open nickel and lithium futures to foreign investors is set to widen their risk management options, effectively linking physical operations with financial hedging strategies.

Proposed innovations include:

• Direct participation in newly updated futures contracts.

• Flexibility to post collateral in widely traded currencies such as USD, EUR, and HKD.

• New supply contract structures referencing domestic price benchmarks.

These measures are designed to lower hedging costs and improve operational synchronisation. Notably, nickel’s strategic role is fundamental to these changes, as it reinforces the importance of aligning operational cash flows with market expectations.

Step-by-Step: Foreign Access & Hedging

Account opening: Register with SHFE or GFEX following KYC/AML protocols.

Fund transfer: Remit acceptable foreign currency to a designated clearing bank.

Collateral posting: Margin is calculated using daily FX rates and published haircut percentages.

Execution: Engage in futures positions electronically.

Monitoring: Track positions and margin calls in real time.

Repatriation: Withdraw capital, subject to compliance reviews.

What Does This Mean for Global Supply Chains and Investment Flows?

Enhanced market access may redefine raw material sourcing by reducing pricing disparities between domestic and international markets. Improved transparency drives more unified pricing in long-term agreements and spot contracts. For instance, greater integration on SHFE and GFEX will likely encourage structured hedging for battery-grade nickel and lithium.

How Could Enhanced Market Access Redefine Raw Material Sourcing?

Future-based pricing models might replace conventional spot models. Benefits include:

• Reduction in pricing disparities.

• Increased transparency for exporters and importers alike.

• New commercial templates tailored for hedging critical inputs.

This evolution is expected to streamline negotiations and reduce supply chain volatility, ultimately benefitting both mining and manufacturing sectors.

What Role Do Policy Shifts Play in Attracting Global Institutional Capital?

Policy liberalisation has historically attracted significant capital inflows. For example, emerging markets like Brazil and India witnessed surges in foreign direct investments following deregulation. Similarly, China is opening its futures markets to unlock secondary market depth and primary investment in upstream production.

Investors must monitor regulatory developments closely. Moreover, overseas lithium market conditions also provide insight into how these policies might evolve.

Frequently Asked Questions about China’s Nickel and Lithium Futures Market Liberalisation

How will foreign investors physically access and settle trades on Chinese exchanges?

Foreign investors can register directly or via global affiliates. They need to fulfil KYC/AML requirements and post approved currency collateral. Settlement occurs in CNY, with repatriation options determined by regulatory guidelines.

What protections exist for overseas capital in China’s futures markets?

Capital is segregated within advanced clearing systems, and margin protocols align with global best practices. However, regulatory risks still exist, especially in times of rapid policy change.

Could this shift affect global electric vehicle and battery supply chain costs?

Yes, over time, as Chinese benchmarks gain traction, price negotiations may increasingly reference yuan-denominated contracts. This shift could impact procurement strategies and contract stability for manufacturers worldwide.

Conclusion: Will China Set the Future Agenda for Critical Minerals Trading?

China’s strategy is not merely about pricing influence. It represents a broader integration plan wherein china to open nickel and lithium futures to foreign investors serves as a cornerstone of this ambition. In addition, sustained regulatory reform and deepening market liquidity are pivotal to realising these goals.

Practical challenges remain, including capital controls and exchange-rate volatility. Nonetheless, if robust international standards are maintained, China’s exchanges could soon serve as credible alternatives for risk management and pricing discovery. Ultimately, stakeholders must adapt to a dual-benchmark environment that blends legacy platforms with innovative Chinese mechanisms.

China to open nickel and lithium futures to foreign investors marks a strategic milestone in global commodity trading. With consistent implementation, market participants may benefit from enhanced risk management, improved pricing transparency, and dynamic investment flows.

Installations passed 100 GW for the first time – a milestone achieved even as some of the largest energy markets grappled with significant policy shifts.

China, for instance, removed the mandate to install storage with new renewables. Instead, they will be relying on market mechanisms, introducing uncertainty into future revenue streams. Meanwhile in the US, storage kept its tax incentive, but this came with significant supply chain constraints that rule out Chinese modules.

What will the year ahead bring for energy storage in the US and China? Will growth continue to accelerate in the Middle East and Europe, where government-led tenders support new additions? Drawing on unique insight from Wood Mackenzie Lens Energy Storage, our new report sets out Five trends to look for in global energy storage in 2026. Fill in the form for your complimentary copy, and read on for a short introduction to some of the themes explored.

Restructuring in the global energy storage supply chain

China maintains its dominant position in energy storage supply chains across raw-material processing, component manufacturing, battery manufacturing and system integration. However, domestic overcapacity and escalating local content requirements are driving manufacturers to diversify investments beyond China's borders to circumvent tariffs.

Chinese suppliers are strategically positioning themselves to serve global demand, with expansion efforts focused on South and Southeast Asia, MENA and Europe.

Significant supply chain challenges loom in the near term, particularly in the US market. Chinese manufacturers are expected to announce new ownership structures in 2026 to regain US market access, reducing ownership below 25% to meet FEoC requirements. How will this impact the market? Will supply shortages persist – and how will prices be affected? Find out more in the full report.

Non-lithium technologies – including sodium-ion – emerging at scale

Clean energy is entering a critical decade. 2026 will be a turning point as evolving market forces and policy direction significantly accelerate momentum. Alternative storage technologies – including sodium-ion, flow batteries and iron-air systems – are gaining traction as supply chains for lithium grow more complicated, especially for the US market.

Increased investment and technology-specific RFP activity, particularly for non-lithium storage, is emerging across major markets such as China, Australia, Ireland, Spain, Germany, Italy and California.

The truth is that Chinese automakers are developing, producing, and selling some of the world's most advanced and most affordable EVs on the planet, and not only are the brands making inroads overseas in Europe, they have eyes on the U.S. market. It's likely not a matter of if, but when, Chinese brands enter the U.S. market, and Detroit automakers don't have long to prepare, adjust, and innovate to compete at the necessary price points and quality levels.

Years ago, analysts had scattered warnings about foreign automakers needing to pull back in China, but now the warnings are that the Chinese are heading to America, and long-term investors should keep an eye on these developments because Chinese vehicles in the U.S. will dramatically alter business, market share, and profitability and make returns much more uncertain.

The federal government’s interventions in climate policy have been erratic, driven by political polarization and alternating control of the White House. In contrast, state governments have engaged in steady campaigns to reduce carbon emissions. Some people seem to think this has been a recent innovation, but it has now been ongoing for a generation. Here are some the key milestone along the way.

1983. Iowa establishes the first Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), which requires utilities to obtain a certain percentage of electricity from renewable sources. Similar requirements were then adopted by many other states.

2006. California passes Pavley Act, authorizing the Air Resources Board to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles.

2006. California passes AB 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act, resulting in the creation of an ambitious carbon trading system.

2007.Supreme Court rules in Massachusetts v. EPA that states have standing to litigate climate change issues.

2009. RGGI – the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative — is launched by Northeastern states, establishing a multi-state carbon trading system covering power plants.

2011. Supreme Court rejects Connecticut effort to seek remedies under federal law against utilities for their carbon emissions. The decisions leaves open the possibility of bringing similar claims under state law. The same year, the Bush EPA approves the California’s first zero-emission vehicle standard.

2013. Ninth Circuit rejects a claim that California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard is an unconstitutional barrier to interstate commerce, setting a broad precedent for upholding state climate policies.

2017. The United States Climate Alliance is formed by ten states in response to Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. Twenty-two states, with over half of the U.S. population and GDP, are currently members.

2023. Hawaii Supreme Court rejects effort to dismiss Honolulu lawsuit in state court against oil companies for damages relating to climate change. U.S. Supreme Court ultimately denies review.

2024. Vermont passes first Climate Superfund Law, requiring fossil fuel producers to compensate the state for climate-related damages caused by their carbon emissions. The same year, Vermont becomes the 13th state to set a deadline for using 100% renewable power.

2025. President Trump issues an executive order entitled “Protecting American Energy from State Overreach.” The order describes state clean energy policies as “burdensome and ideologically motivated ‘climate change’ or energy policies that threaten American energy dominance and our economic and national security.”

The order calls on the Attorney General to take action against these state laws, and she began to file lawsuits almost immediately.

The agency kept in place the existing 24-hour PM 2.5 standard of 35 micrograms per cubic meter of air.
Last November, EPA attorneys filed a motion asking the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to vacate the standard.
Twenty-four states — including Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, West Virginia and Wyoming — joined industry groups in challenging the rule in March 2024.
They warned that tailpipe emissions remain “a significant source” of nitrogen oxides, non-methane organic gas, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter.","The Trump administration is moving closer to reworking a Biden-era standard for fine particulate matter that manufacturers have criticized as unachievable.

The U.S. EPA rule, which was finalized in March of 2024 and went into effect May 6 of that year, lowered the annual limit for PM 2.5 from 12 micrograms per cubic meter of air to nine.

The new standard was intended to “protect public health with an adequate margin of safety” in accordance with the Clean Air Act, based on mounting scientific evidence showing that long-term exposure to PM 2.5 causes premature death and increases the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and respiratory problems, the new rule noted. The EPA estimated at the time that the change could prevent 4,500 premature deaths and 290,000 lost workdays and yield $22 billion to $46 billion in benefits, while incurring an estimated $590 million in costs by 2032.

The agency kept in place the existing 24-hour PM 2.5 standard of 35 micrograms per cubic meter of air. That limit measures levels over a shorter time frame than the annual standard.

Industry groups warned that the stricter annual limit would force a wide range of key manufacturing industries — including cement makers, chemical manufacturers, steel mills, coal-fired power plants and battery manufacturers — to pull back on construction of new factories in many areas and would hurt the economy.

Last March, just after President Donald Trump began his second term, the EPA announced it would revisit the PM 2.5 rule, along with 30 other environmental regulations. In an agency video, Administrator Lee Zeldin said the rules need to be reworked to ease costs for businesses and “give power back to the states.” Several industry groups also challenged the Biden rule in court.

Last November, EPA attorneys filed a motion asking the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to vacate the standard. The Biden administration, they said, had taken a “regulatory shortcut” in adopting the tighter limit and did not conduct a thorough enough review. Biden’s EPA also failed to adequately consider the cost of complying with the new limit, the motion said.

Environmental groups, including the Clean Air Task Force, disputed those claims, noting that the Supreme Court has found that the Clean Air Act prohibits EPA from considering implementation costs when setting or revising National Ambient Air Quality Standards.

“An abundance of scientific evidence shows going back to the previous standard would fail to provide the level of protection for public health required under the Clean Air Act, and, regardless of what EPA does, CATF will continue to defend this important rule in court,” Hayden Hashimoto, an attorney with the group, said in a statement issued after the EPA filed the motion to vacate.

California and several other states intervened to challenge the EPA’s motion, suggesting in a Dec. 16 filing that the agency had delayed revising the limit in hopes that the courts would strike down the rule.

States across the country have joined the legal fight over the new limit.

Twenty-four states — including Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, West Virginia and Wyoming — joined industry groups in challenging the rule in March 2024. Weeks later, 16 states — including Arizona, California, Maryland, Oregon and Wisconsin, as well as the District of Columbia and New York City — filed a motion to intervene to uphold the tighter limit, along with environmental groups.

In a legal filing in November, EPA urged the court to vacate the rule before the initial determination of which areas do not meet the new standard is due on Feb. 7. EPA Press Secretary Carolyn Holran declined to comment on the status of the effort to retool the rule. In an emailed statement, she said the Biden-era PM 2.5 standard “has raised serious concerns from states across the country and served as a major obstacle to permitting.”

Implementation plans from the states, which are charged with enacting and enforcing air quality standards, are due in April. Asked if the agency will uphold the Biden rule while retooling it, Holran said in an email that “EPA will always follow the law as we Power the Great American Comeback while carrying out our core mission of protecting human health and the environment.”

Manufacturers push for reverting to previous standard

The EPA’s move to revisit the rule has received praise from the National Association of Manufacturers and other industry groups, which have projected that the stricter standard would throw counties into non-attainment status that are home to 40% of the U.S. population, making it difficult to secure permits for new factories and other projects.

That would curtail manufacturing of a wide range of products, including the cement and steel needed for new US infrastructure, the groups said. The EPA had estimated in 2024 that most counties already meet the nine micrograms per cubic meter standard and that 99% of U.S. counties would do so by 2032.

The updated PM 2.5 standard was “one of the things we were most concerned about” during the Biden administration, said Brandon Farris, executive vice president of the Steel Manufacturers Association and former vice president of energy and resources policy at NAM.

“If you’re putting a shovel in the dirt anywhere, or you’re building a new manufacturing facility or operating your current ones or trying to do any upgrades, then the particulate matter is going to be one of the most burdensome rules,” he said.

Most companies could meet the previous standard of 12 micrograms per cubic meter or find a way to offset those emissions, but nine micrograms doesn’t allow for much headroom given existing background levels, Farris said.

“It’s pretty darn close to nine, just without manufacturing, in a lot of areas of the country,” he said. “I truly don’t know of many areas in the country that would be able to meet a standard of nine and allow for any growth.”

The tighter standard also places an unfair burden on manufacturing, which only accounts for 12% of PM 2.5 pollution, he added. “It’s wildfires, it’s dust storms, it’s unpaved roads,” Farris said. “This new standard essentially punishes manufacturing, [even though] manufacturing isn’t the largest source of this.”

SMA was one of 15 industry groups, including the Aluminum Association, the American Forest & Paper Association, and the American Fuel & Petrochemicals Manufacturers that signed a Jan. 6 letter urging the Trump administration to take “prompt action to correct an unlawful rule.” Members of the groups are already considering scaling back or relocating projects due to the revised standard, according to the letter.

Sean O’Neill, the American Cement Association’s senior vice president for government affairs, said he wasn’t aware of any specific projects in his industry that have been affected by the new standard yet. But he said the uncertainty around the future of the rule has made it difficult to plan future investments.

“We’re hopeful that this will be overturned,” he said. “If the standard was put back to where it was, I think you could see more capital investment occurring ... but it’s just a challenging time right now.”

AMA projects the lower standard could reduce domestic cement production, leading to layoffs and greater dependence on foreign imports. “We continue to be efficient at the plants, we continue to be innovative, but you can only do so much,” said O’Neill.

A 2025 report by the American Cement Association, one of the industry groups that initially filed suit against the lower limit, estimated that the U.S. will need 1 million metric tons of cement just to build the data centers needed to run artificial intelligence. By 2027, the number of data centers in the U.S. is expected to increase from 5,426 to 6,000, according to the report.

Vehicle rules revisited

Other air quality rules are getting a second look as well.

Aaron Szabo, EPA’s assistant administrator for the office of air and radiation, said in a Dec. 19 op-ed that the agency will move forward in early 2026 with plans to revisit two regulations aimed at cutting nitrogen oxide emissions from vehicles. Auto manufacturers opposed both rules, including a 2024 rule for light and medium-duty vehicles of model years 2027 and later, and a 2022 rule targeting heavy-duty vehicles.

Health advocacy groups warn that rolling back the new, stricter NAAQS for PM 2.5 and vehicle emissions favors industry at the expense of public health.

On Jan. 14, 75 groups and municipalities, including the Environmental Defense Fund, Clean Air Task Force, the City of Portland, Ore., and the Respiratory Health Association, sent a letter to the EPA opposing the overhaul of the vehicle standards.

They warned that tailpipe emissions remain “a significant source” of nitrogen oxides, non-methane organic gas, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter. The group’s letter said “any rollback would lead directly to increased hospitalization rates, lost work and school days, and thousands of preventable deaths.” Weakening the rules would also make it more difficult for states to achieve the NAAQS for PM 2.5 and ozone, they added.

Volkswagen AG's plans for a possible Audi factory in the US aren't progressing as President Donald Trump's tariffs weigh and talks for local incentives haven't yielded results, Chief Executive Officer Oliver Blume told Handelsblatt.

Europe's biggest carmaker has considered adding a second American manufacturing site on and off for some time, including dating back to 2018 during Trump's first presidency. Talks for an Audi plant have been ongoing, initially encouraged by subsidies making an investment economically viable.

That calculus has shifted as the Trump administration placed tariffs on European carmakers, Blume said in an interview with the German newspaper, citing duty costs of VW €2.1 billion ($2.5 billion) in the first nine months of 2025.

India plans to slash tariffs on cars imported from the European Union to 40% from as high as 110%, sources said, in the biggest opening yet of the country's vast market as the two sides close in on a free trade pact that could come as early as Tuesday.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has agreed to immediately reduce the tax on a limited number of cars from the 27-nation bloc with an import price of more than 15,000 euros ($17,739), two sources briefed on the talks told Reuters.

This will be further lowered to 10% over time, they added, easing access to the Indian market for European automakers such as Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and BMW.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/trump-defied-the-will-of-congress-in-cutting-ev-charger-funding-judge/l-intro-1769441430.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 12:01:46.255833

Two myths tend to shape how people talk about Kentucky and climate change. One is that the state is a “climate haven,” insulated from the worst effects of global warming. The other is that Kentuckians are hostile to climate action.

Officials pushing for change – researchers, environmental directors and more – say their conversations around climate are more nuanced than a red or blue ticket makes it look.

Kentucky is the sixth-most climate-vulnerable state, according to a report by Texas A&M University and the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund. From 2020 to 2024, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration documented 27 “billion-dollar” climate disasters in the state, including tornadoes that killed more than 50 people in western Kentucky and flash floods that killed 39 in the east.

From the outside, the Commonwealth’s politicians and residents – largely rural, with a reputation for voting conservative – may appear indifferent. Last year, state leaders passed S.B. 89, removing groundwater and wetland protections, and stood by President Donald Trump as he signed executive orders to boost the coal industry.

“I am delighted to share that that is a false assumption. And absolutely, it is an assumption that people make,” says Lauren Cagle, a professor at the University of Kentucky specializing in climate rhetoric.

Locally, municipalities varying in population density, income levels, and industry are teaming up to strengthen their own communities’ climate resilience through a six-county regional climate action plan. The draft Central Kentucky Climate Action Plan, published last fall through an Environmental Protection Agency grant, targets an area of more than half a million people. Their leaders say neither politics nor an urban-rural divide can predict the popularity and effectiveness of climate action.

“There are three parts to this, and it includes the environment, the people, and the economy. We believe if we focus on those three areas, then we can make our community stronger,” Jada Walker Griggs, the senior program manager in sustainability for Lexington-Fayette Urban City Government (LFUCG), explains.

Under the plan, the six counties – Bourbon, Clark, Fayette, Jessamine, Scott and Woodford — as well as municipal governments within will collaborate to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 23% by 2035 and 40% by 2050, as compared to 2021 levels.

“Since the early ’90s, we have seen this attempt to pit local and global versus each other. We’ve seen this attempt to pit individual choice versus systemic change against each other. And we’ve seen this attempt to pit urban versus rural. And these are all false choices,” says Cagle, who has closely followed the climate action plan’s development.

Inside the climate action plan

Regardless of federal and state action, the region is prioritizing initiatives that push actions countering and mitigating climate change. After all, Lexington aims to be carbon neutral by 2050.

Since 2004, the Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government has implemented an energy management plan to reduce consumption of fuel, and leaders commissioned a greenhouse gas inventory in 2021. They had already published a sustainability plan as far back as 2012 under Empower Lexington.

But in 2023, when officials searched for implementation grants, they realized more funding would be accessible if they included the entire Lexington Metropolitan Statistical Area.

“That’s not only Fayette County,” Griggs said. “That’s Clark County, and Scott and Bourbon and Jessamine and Woodford Counties, and then their municipal governments.”

Fayette County fared better than most of the Commonwealth in Texas A&M’s report, scoring in the 58th percentile for climate vulnerability: While it doesn’t experience many extreme weather events, the area’s environmental factors like land use and pollution dragged down its score. Nearby Clark County ranked in the 91st percentile nationwide, and Bourbon County ranked 96th. The contrast between those counties, according to the report, is largely due to infrastructure differences and residents’ physical health.

Jada Walker Griggs is the senior program manager in sustainability for Lexington-Fayette Urban City Government .

The Central Kentucky Climate Action Plan, which shows how these governments can work in tandem to reduce harmful emissions, is funded by a $1 million EPA grant. It’s a collection of two documents.

The Priority Climate Action Plan provides quick, high-impact changes for central Kentucky communities to adopt, including plans for:

Studying the need for electric vehicle charging stations across the region

Planting a stronger urban tree canopy in Lexington to help mitigate rising temperatures

Building upon the work of the local program Solarize Lexington, which provides residential solar to homeowners and other property owners at discounted rates

The Comprehensive Climate Action Plan offers a more thorough analysis for long-term growth, based on detailed data about each county’s vulnerabilities, economics and how their emissions and goals vary by region and demographic. Its recommendations include:

Scaling up the work of Solarize Lexington to include the entire 6-county MSA

Considering a ‘Smart Agriculture’ coalition – which would lead outreach on fertilizer use, plant breeding, and other environmental factors for farmers in the MSA.

Implementing electric bus fleets for public transportation for Fayette County (Lextran) and beyond.

Long-term development of education materials and campaigns showing the benefits of these initiatives

Griggs explains it’s vital that people across the region understand the very basics of climate change and pollution, as well as why these actions help. That’s part of why the Climate Action Plan has gone through multiple rounds of community input, from public focus group gatherings to community ambassadors.

The spectrum of climate concern

When Cagle attended one of these focus groups in Lexington, she was amazed at how many passionate people showed up.

“It was [so] packed, we had to bring chairs in. People were showing up to participate. In that room of however many people, everybody was excited about this vision,” Cagle says. “There was one person there who [voiced skepticism] about the reality of anthropogenic climate change, but was also willing to have a conversation about the vision for the future.”

About 58% of the Lexington-Fayette Metropolitan Statistical Area is worried about climate change, according to a YALE Climate Communications report monitoring adults’ beliefs, risk perceptions and policy support around climate change. Likewise, 63% of Kentuckians surveyed expressed their belief that global warming exists.

“Kentucky tends to sit right about 10% below the national average, but it’s not this dramatic swing. The national average is 72, so [people assume] Kentucky must be way down in the 30s.”

Lauren Cagle is a professor at the University of Kentucky.

And the state’s urban centers, Lexington and Louisville, don’t dramatically drive up that number, she notes. The majority of people in every Kentucky county surveyed believe global warming is happening.

The YALE report doesn’t limit itself to the binary of people either believing or not believing in climate change itself, Cagle adds: Many people don’t center climate action in their lifestyles, but they’re still cautious or concerned.

“In our mental models of discourse around climate, we tend to sort people into the extremes– you’re either alarmed, or you’re dismissive … the folks who are like, ‘climate change is a hoax, I don’t think it’s happening at all,’” Cagle explains. It’s rarely so black and white.

“The reality is that people sit all along that spectrum. So just because someone is not a climate activist doesn’t mean that they don’t think climate change is real.”

The Central Kentucky Climate Action Plans challenge the idea that climate change is a rural and urban divide problem, Cagle says. These areas may have different needs, but most rural towns are not moving backwards compared to cities.

“As public opinion shifts further and further in favor of taking action on climate change across all spaces, urban and rural … there’s increased public support for making systemic changes that will make it easier for individuals to make choices that reduce their own emissions,” Cagle argues.

Individual action

Shanda Cecil wears many hats for the small city of Winchester, one county east of Lexington: She is its stormwater and floodplain coordinator, its code enforcement officer, and a correspondent for the Central Kentucky Climate Action Plan.

Cecil has been pushing for climate-forward initiatives in her community for years, from environmentally friendly practices in the local school system to Clark County’s farmland preservation and protection plan. These scopes differ from the rooftop solar and electric bus capabilities Lexington is shooting for.

In Clark County, Shanda Cecil is a correspondent for the Central Kentucky Climate Action Plan.

“Every county seems to have similar goals, but the way we go about it does seem to be different,” Cecil explains. “Our viewpoints around things are slightly different. I am usually very practical about approaches, so I always try to grab the low hanging fruit first.”

Her current focus is on the school system, which she has gotten to know well since becoming an environmental educator. Cecil says she is meeting with other local leaders to implement composting for wasted school lunches and work toward eliminating non-recyclable styrofoam lunch trays.

“I’ve tried in the past to get that changed, and with not a lot of success, but maybe the composting aspect might actually happen if we can get a grant [to] create a facility on site to help compost,” Cecil says. “Food waste is 30% of the waste stream.”

In the draft Comprehensive Climate Action Plan, composting measures are projected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 300,000 metric tons regionally by 2050.

Many parts of the plan are oriented for the regional governments themselves to take on, but others – like recycling, reducing food waste and vehicle use – are based on individual habits changing. It also includes putting together public resources like the simple explanations of greenhouse gasses and climate change on the Climate Action Plan’s website.

“We’re putting together educational materials about recycling … in a way that I can forward it to the other communities so that they can put it on their website, and they can get it out to their residents,” Griggs says.

“This is not a perfect plan, but it is a plan that [means] anyone should be able to pick up and do something, regardless of what type of home you’re in, what size your business is – you can do something.”

Cecil, meanwhile, has grown more pessimistic about how much education can help drive change.

“I have been doing environmental education for about 23 years and I can tell you that it’s not that people don’t know,” Cecil says. The most difficult part of her work is getting people to act.

“It does not matter what political side you’re on. I don’t know why people don’t make these changes. I am starting to believe they just don’t care,” Cecil says. “I see people that will vote one way and, in their own personal life, do nothing to make a change.”

But she says this resistance has little to do with living in a more rural area.

“We’re all getting our kids ready in the mornings. We’re all going to work. We’re all mowing our yards. We’re all buying from Amazon.”

Williamson pointed to concerns such as equipment shortages, tariff-related cost increases, the elimination of federal tax incentives for renewable energy and tighter state rules around the use of renewable energy credits.
Katie Duckworth, a senior associate attorney at the Chicago-based Environmental Law & Policy Center, said the explosion of data centers impacts the energy law.
It has said it is in final stages for up to 1 gigawatt combined from two other data centers, too.
DTE and Consumers executives declined to comment in detail on the interplay between the clean energy law and huge data centers until unveiling their IRPs.","The utilities' leaders have said multiple potential gigawatts of additional capacity from data centers are in the pipeline in their territories. The only facility to date with signed power contracts, Oracle's 1.4-gigawatt OpenAI project near Ann Arbor, would be the largest user in the state by far, consuming enough electricity for 1 million homes and accounting for a staggering 25% increase in DTE's regular load by the end of 2027.

Under the 2023 law, utilities will have to reach a 50% renewable energy credit portfolio four years from now, up from 15% today. That covers the Stargate facility in Washtenaw County's Saline Township and any other new data centers, too.

The threshold for wind, solar and other renewable sources rises to 60% in 2035. Also, there is an 80% clean energy standard in 2035 and 100% in 2040 — renewables plus nuclear and, if nascent carbon-capture technology is used, natural gas that has become more important as dirtier coal-fired plants are closed.

There are ""off-ramps,"" or delays, for utilities that show the Michigan Public Service Commission they cannot meet the deadlines. But the advent of ""hyperscale"" data centers means the renewable- and clean-energy standards should be reevaluated, said Rod Williamson, executive director of the Association of Businesses Advocating Tariff Equity, which represents companies using large amounts of energy.

""A lot of the requirements that were put in place did not contemplate the amount and the speed of new load additions like these AI data centers,"" he said. ""Having some more robust off-ramps that do not cause a significant, fast escalation in electricity rates for customers or extending out these requirements to a longer timeframe, we think all of these things need to be considered along with just looking at things from a reliability standpoint and making sure that the blend of generation that we have is going to be able to meet the requirements of this new 24-hour, seven-day-a-week load addition.""

Williamson pointed to concerns such as equipment shortages, tariff-related cost increases, the elimination of federal tax incentives for renewable energy and tighter state rules around the use of renewable energy credits.

""We're looking at not just adding incremental growth to the utilities' electricity sales but step changes — significant step changes — to the utilities' electrical usage in a very fast timeframe,"" he said, noting that AI data centers use way more power than industrial manufacturers do.

Revisiting the 2023 law is very unlikely this year, as Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer — who has championed it as being necessary to fight climate change and lower power costs — prepares to leave office and the Legislature is split politically. But energy and data centers are issues in the 2026 election and not going away in the future.

Case in point: Republican House Speaker Matt Hall said last week that ""there's no way to do the wind and solar"" standards and ""you need to build natural gas plants"" to power huge data centers — a position disputed by environmental organizations.

The buildout of utility-scale solar and wind, which is crucial for the requirements to be reached, is seen as cheaper and quicker than adding other types of new generation like gas plants and emerging, albeit unproven, small nuclear reactors. But wind and the sun are intermittent. While battery storage is on the rise and able to help with short-term peak needs, it is not a replacement for continuous power from nuclear or gas plants.

Katie Duckworth, a senior associate attorney at the Chicago-based Environmental Law & Policy Center, said the explosion of data centers impacts the energy law.

""As load grows, they will have to procure or build more renewable energy. On their face, you can make that math work out. It involves more renewables,"" she said.

In seeking approval of the special contracts for Stargate, DTE said the new load would increase the utility's renewable portfolio standard target by around 30%. The company estimated needing an additional 443 megawatts of renewables by 2032 if it maximizes use of ""banked"" renewable energy credits.

It said it is actively developing new wind and solar facilities, pursuing power purchase agreements with third-party developers and, where feasible, will evaluate buying operational or near-operational renewable assets.

Environmental groups, Duckworth said, are advocating that there be a ""proactive"" approach to ensuring that as data centers come online there is not a ""mismatch"" between load growth and utilities' renewable and clean energy obligations.

""The risks are both the potential for jeopardizing the clean energy goals in a way that the utilities can't meet them at some point down the line or just making the compliance with those laws more expensive in a way that could impact other ratepayers,"" she said.

The groups, for instance, were disappointed that regulators deferred broader questions about how the Stargate data center will affect DTE's electricity mix until the Detroit-based company submits its integrated resource plan between July and September.

DTE has said it is in late-stage negotiations for an additional 3 gigawatts of data center load, which, if it materializes, would boost its typical load by over 50%. Jackson-based Consumers, which plans to unveil its IRP in June, may finalize a deal with an unspecified ""hyperscale"" data center that is expected to use up to 1 gigawatt starting in 2030. It has said it is in final stages for up to 1 gigawatt combined from two other data centers, too.

The utilities and Public Service Commission members have said new data centers will not raise rates on other customers. DTE and Consumers executives declined to comment in detail on the interplay between the clean energy law and huge data centers until unveiling their IRPs.

""As large customers come online in the future, our blueprint will transparently demonstrate how we will reliably and affordably meet the demand of all customers, including proposed economic development projects in Michigan's pipeline, while hitting targets set in the 2023 energy law,"" Consumers spoksperson Katie Carey said.

Laura Sherman, president of the Michigan Energy Innovation Business Council, an advanced-energy group that supports the mandates, said she still believes the targets can be hit, even amid the Trump administration's emphasis on fossil fuels following the Biden administration's push for green energy.

""I always viewed the RPS as a really important backstop to what's happening anyway in the market. And I still view it that way,"" she said, calling renewables the most cost-effective options and questioning the value of new gas plants both from a cost and timeline perspective.

""I think the utilities will continue carrying (renewables) and will continue moving in that direction. But I do think these upcoming IRPs are going to be really important from many perspectives — from a job-creation perspective, an environmental perspective, an advancement of clean energy perspective. ... I don't think the utilities have expressed an interest in using those off-ramps, that I have heard yet. But it's definitely something we will be keeping a close eye on.""",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/0z1a2881_original%20%281%29.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 11:02:37.388426

USA Rare Earth said Monday that the U.S. Commerce Department is investing $1.6 billion in the company to advance work on a mine in Texas and to build a magnet manufacturing facility in Oklahoma.

Shares of USA Rare Earth jumped more than 13% before U.S. markets opened.

The agreement with the Commerce Department’s CHIPS program includes $277 million in proposed federal funding and a $1.3 billion senior secured loan. The Commerce Department will get 16.1 million shares of common stock in return, as well as rights to buy 17.6 million more.

“USA Rare Earth’s heavy critical minerals project is essential to restoring U.S. critical mineral independence,” Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said in a statement. “This investment ensures our supply chains are resilient and no longer reliant on foreign nations.”

The Trump administration is intensifying efforts to build up the critical mineral industry in the United States to work to break the chokehold that China has on the global supply chain.

Industry insiders, analysts and lawmakers have warned for years that America’s dependence on China for critical minerals — a list of 50 minerals that includes 17 sought-after rare-earth elements — is a national security vulnerability.

Attempts by President Donald Trump to acquire Greenland is part of that push.

USA Rare Earth, based in Stillwater, Oklahoma, is the third U.S. operator in which the Trump administration has invested in recent months.

The Pentagon invested $400 million in rare-earth producer MP Materials. It gave the U.S. company a $150 million loan in August.

The Trump administration and private investors in November announced a partnership with rare earth startups Vulcan Elements and ReElement Technologies. The $1.4 billion deal is intended to scale up U.S. access to materials and technology that are crucial for producing an array of high-tech goods and military equipment.

The Trump administration’s tax and spending cut bill includes $2 billion for the Pentagon to boost the U.S. stockpile of critical minerals and $5 billion more through 2029 to invest in those supply chains.

Between 2020 and 2024, the Pentagon said it had awarded more than $439 million to establish supply chains for domestic rare earths.

(Nasdaq: USAR). Once a speculative venture aiming to revive the American ""mine-to-magnet"" supply chain, USAR has evolved into a strategic national asset. Today's landmark announcement of a $1.6 billion U.S. government investment package—comprised of direct grants and senior secured loans—marks the largest federal intervention in the critical minerals sector since the Second World War.

This capital infusion is not merely a corporate milestone; it is a decisive move by the U.S. Department of Commerce to break a decades-long Chinese monopoly on the rare earth elements (REEs) essential for electric vehicles (EVs), wind turbines, and advanced defense systems. With its flagship Round Top project in Texas and a newly commissioned magnet facility in Oklahoma, USA Rare Earth is attempting a feat of vertical integration that has eluded Western companies for thirty years. This feature explores the company's trajectory, its financial standing, and whether it can truly become the ""Exxon of the Green Revolution.""

Historical Background

The story of USA Rare Earth began with a recognition of the strategic vulnerability inherent in the global supply chain. Founded as a private entity, the company’s foundational move was the acquisition of an 80% interest in the Round Top Heavy Rare Earth and Critical Minerals Project in Sierra Blanca, Texas, in partnership with Texas Mineral Resources Corp (OTCQB: TMRC).

Throughout the early 2020s, USAR focused on a ""mine-to-magnet"" philosophy, realizing that simply mining ore was insufficient if the processing and manufacturing capabilities remained in China. In 2020, the company purchased the equipment from the only neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnet plant in the U.S., which had been shuttered years prior, and began planning its revival.

The company’s transformation accelerated in March 2025, when it successfully went public on the Nasdaq through a merger with Inflection Point Acquisition Corp. This IPO provided the necessary ""dry powder"" to scale its processing technologies and finalize the acquisition of Less Common Metals (LCM) in the UK and France, cementing USAR’s presence on both sides of the Atlantic.

Business Model

USA Rare Earth operates a uniquely vertically integrated business model designed to capture value at every stage of the REE lifecycle. Unlike traditional miners that sell raw concentrate to third-party refiners (often in China), USAR’s model is built on four pillars:

Extraction: The Round Top deposit in Texas provides a massive, 130-year resource of heavy rare earths (Dysprosium, Terbium) and lithium.

Processing & Separation: Utilizing proprietary Continuous Ion Exchange (CIX) technology, the company separates mixed rare earth oxides into high-purity individual elements at its Colorado facility.

Metal & Alloy Production: Through its subsidiary LCM, the company converts these oxides into specialized metals and alloys.

Magnet Manufacturing: The final and most lucrative stage occurs at its Stillwater, Oklahoma plant, where metals are transformed into sintered NdFeB magnets for industrial and automotive customers.

By controlling the entire chain, USAR aims to eliminate ""midstream leak"" where domestic ore is shipped abroad for processing, thereby securing higher margins and ensuring supply chain transparency for Tier 1 OEMs.

Stock Performance Overview

Since its public debut in March 2025 at an initial price of $10.00 per share, USAR has experienced significant volatility, typical of the ""Critical Mineral 2.0"" era.

1-Year Performance: In the past 12 months, the stock has risen 85%, buoyed by the completion of its Stillwater facility and today’s $1.6 billion government announcement.

Post-IPO Trajectory: After hitting a low of $7.50 in mid-2025 amid concerns over permitting delays, the stock staged a massive rally in late 2025 as the U.S. government intensified its ""De-risking"" policy toward China.

Current Valuation: As of January 26, 2026, USAR trades at approximately $18.40 per share, with a market capitalization of $3.3 billion. While the company is still pre-revenue from its mining operations, the market is pricing in the strategic ""floor"" provided by the U.S. government’s 16% potential equity stake.

Financial Performance

USAR’s balance sheet underwent a radical transformation today. Prior to the government deal, the company was burning approximately $45 million per quarter on capital expenditures and R&D.

Key Financial Metrics (Estimated Jan 2026):

Cash Position: Post-investment, the company sits on roughly $1.9 billion in liquidity (including the $1.3 billion loan facility).

Government Stake: The U.S. government has secured warrants for up to 17.6 million shares, effectively making the taxpayer a major partner in the enterprise.

Projected Revenue: Analysts expect the first significant revenue from magnet sales to commence in H2 2026, with a massive ramp-up in 2028 when the Round Top mine comes online.

Debt-to-Equity: The $1.3 billion senior secured loan increases the company's leverage significantly, but the 15-year term and subsidized interest rates provide a manageable runway.

Leadership and Management

The leadership of USA Rare Earth was ""industrialized"" in late 2025 to prepare for the massive scale-up.

Barbara Humpton (CEO): The former CEO of Siemens USA (OTC: SIEGY) took the helm in October 2025. Her deep ties to the Department of Defense and Department of Energy were instrumental in securing the $1.6 billion federal package.

Thayer Smith (President): A veteran of the company’s early years, Smith remains the architect of the operational strategy. His focus is on the ""technical de-risking"" of the CIX separation technology and the mine build-out.

Board of Directors: The board includes former high-ranking officials from the U.S. Geological Survey and veterans from the automotive and defense sectors, reflecting the company’s dual role as a commercial entity and a national security asset.

Products, Services, and Innovations

The crown jewel of USAR’s innovation is its Continuous Ion Exchange (CIX) processing. Traditional solvent extraction is chemically intensive and environmentally taxing. CIX allows for the separation of rare earths with a much smaller footprint and lower water consumption, a critical factor for the arid West Texas climate.

In Stillwater, Oklahoma, the company’s magnet facility utilizes advanced sintering techniques to produce magnets with high coercivity—meaning they can operate at the high temperatures required for EV motors without losing their magnetic properties. Furthermore, USAR is developing a ""circular"" magnet recycling program, allowing it to recover REEs from end-of-life electronics and reintroduce them into the manufacturing stream.

Competitive Landscape

USAR operates in a landscape dominated by three major forces:

China (State-Owned Enterprises): China still controls over 85% of global rare earth processing. Their ability to flood the market and crash prices remains the primary external threat to USAR.

MP Materials (NYSE: MP): The current domestic leader. While MP Materials has a head start in mining at Mountain Pass, USAR’s focus on heavy rare earths (Dysprosium/Terbium) differentiates it, as MP primarily produces light rare earths (Neodymium/Praseodymium).

Lynas Rare Earths (ASX: LYC): The largest producer outside of China. USAR competes with Lynas for non-Chinese off-take agreements with European and American automakers.

Industry and Market Trends

The ""Great Re-Shoring"" is the dominant trend of 2026. As Western governments realize that the energy transition is impossible without REEs, industrial policy has replaced pure free-market dynamics.

EV Proliferation: Despite a plateau in some regions, the transition to permanent magnet motors in EVs continues to drive a 12% CAGR in NdFeB demand.

Geopolitical Bifurcation: The world is splitting into two mineral blocs. USAR is the flagship of the ""Mineral Security Partnership"" (MSP), an alliance of 14 countries aiming to build supply chains independent of Beijing.

Risks and Challenges

Investing in USAR is not without significant peril:

Execution Risk: Building a multi-billion-dollar mine and processing plant simultaneously is a Herculean task. Any delays at Round Top could starve the Oklahoma magnet plant of domestic feedstock.

Price Volatility: Rare earth prices are notoriously opaque and volatile. A sudden drop in prices orchestrated by Chinese state-owned firms could hurt USAR’s margins.

Regulatory Hurdles: Despite federal support, the Round Top project must navigate a complex web of environmental assessments and local permitting in Texas.

Opportunities and Catalysts

The primary catalyst is the Accelerated Mine Plan, which aims to bring Round Top into commercial production by 2028.

Defense Contracts: With the U.S. military moving toward a ""China-free"" supply chain for its F-35 fighter jets and Virginia-class submarines, USAR is perfectly positioned to secure high-margin defense off-take agreements.

Strategic Stockpiling: The U.S. government’s move to create a National Defense Stockpile of permanent magnets provides a guaranteed ""buyer of last resort"" for USAR’s production.

Investor Sentiment and Analyst Coverage

Wall Street sentiment has shifted from ""skeptical"" to ""strategic."" Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have recently initiated coverage on USAR, with ""Buy"" ratings predicated on the company’s unique position as a government-backed monopoly-challenger.

Institutional ownership has surged to 45%, with major positions held by BlackRock and the Vanguard Group. On retail forums, USAR is often discussed as a ""generational hold,"" with investors betting on the long-term inevitability of mineral de-coupling from China.

Regulatory, Policy, and Geopolitical Factors

The $1.6 billion investment is part of a broader suite of policies including the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the CHIPS and Science Act. These laws provide production tax credits (Section 45X) that essentially subsidize the manufacturing of magnets on U.S. soil.

Geopolitically, the U.S. has signaled that it will use the ""Defense Production Act Title III"" to ensure that companies like USAR remain solvent even during periods of market manipulation. This ""sovereign backstop"" is perhaps the company’s greatest competitive advantage.

Conclusion

As of January 26, 2026, USA Rare Earth (Nasdaq: USAR) stands as a bold experiment in industrial policy. The $1.6 billion U.S. government investment has effectively ""de-risked"" the company’s capital structure, providing a bridge to 2028 when its domestic mining operations are slated to begin.

For investors, USAR represents a high-stakes bet on the future of the American energy transition. While operational and geopolitical risks remain substantial, the company’s ""mine-to-magnet"" vertical integration and unprecedented federal backing make it the most significant player in the Western quest for mineral independence. Investors should closely watch the commissioning of the Stillwater plant in Q1 2026 and the progress of environmental permitting at Round Top as the next major indicators of success.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel is suing some of the world’s largest oil companies, accusing them of colluding for decades to keep renewable energy and electric vehicles on the margins.

The landmark lawsuit, filed Friday morning in the US District Court for the Western District of Michigan, seeks unspecified financial compensation and forfeiture of profits from oil giants BP, Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Shell and their subsidiaries, as well as the industry lobbying group American Petroleum Institute.

Rather than a suit about environmental harm, “at the heart, this is an energy affordability case,” Nessel said in an interview with Bridge Michigan.

Michiganders pay among the nation’s highest residential energy rates — costs Nessel said “could have been prevented had the fossil fuel cartel not worked together to postpone innovation and to eliminate cost-effective alternatives.”

Ryan Meyers, senior vice president and general counsel for the American Petroleum Institute, criticized Nessel’s new suit. In a statement provided to Bridge, he called it part of “a coordinated campaign against an industry that powers everyday life, drives America’s economy, and is actively reducing emissions.”

With the suit, Michigan joins dozens of cities and states that have sued oil corporations, alleging they used illegal tactics to maintain market dominance and conceal the risks of their products.

Petroleum industry representatives have begun lobbying Congress for legal immunity, calling such lawsuits a waste of taxpayer resources.

Today’s suit comes more than a year-and-a-half after Nessel first announced plans to sue the fossil fuel industry over climate change.

While many other state and local lawsuits have accused oil companies of violating environmental and public trust laws, Michigan’s case hinges on antitrust laws designed to protect consumers from monopolies.

In the 126-page complaint, state lawyers argue the fossil fuel companies acted like a cartel, conspiring to thwart competition from EVs and renewable energy. That includes using “capture-and-kill tactics” such as buying renewable energy patents and then restricting their use, suing rival companies to keep them from deploying EVs and renewables, misleading the public about the risks of fossil fuels and hiring hackers to “surveil, intimidate and disrupt” investigations by journalists and activists.

Taken together, the lawsuit alleges, those actions amount to “an illicit conspiracy” to restrain free trade. In a world without such collusion, the lawsuit states, Michiganders would have more and cheaper transportation and energy options while avoiding the “staggering external costs” of climate change.

Oil company executives knew as far back as the 1960s that fossil fuels cause climate change, but spent decades publicly denying the science.

Greenhouse gas emissions caused by burning fossil fuels have destabilized Earth’s climate, prompting a global panel of experts to warn that humanity must stop emitting by 2050 or face dangerous “tipping points” such as mass extinction and runaway sea level rise, heatwaves, droughts and fires.

Last year was the third-hottest year on record, just barely cooler than 2023 and 2024.

While the lawsuit sparked effusive praise from environment advocates, it was harshly criticized by business groups.

Mike Alaimo of the Michigan Chamber of Commerce said Nessel’s lawsuit “weaponizes the Attorney General’s office against broad segments of Michigan’s economy,” arguing such moves inject “uncertainty into our business climate and jeopardizes our competitiveness.”

But the Michigan chapter of the Sierra Club, an environmental advocacy organization, hailed the suit as a way to push back against longstanding industry influence.

“These companies have used their outsized political influence to preserve the status quo and pave the way for a wave of energy-intensive data center projects across the state, even as renewable energy remains the cheapest source of new power and what Michiganders deserve,” Sierra Club lobbyist Tim Minota said in a statement.

Michigan Climate Action Network Executive Director Denise Keele called lawsuits like Nessel’s “exactly the kinds of things that we need to be doing.” She argued fossil fuel companies “should be chipping in to pay for all these catastrophic (climate) impacts.”

Even before it was filed, Nessel’s lawsuit drew a rebuke from President Donald Trump’s administration. Michigan’s top Democratic prosecutor has filed or joined dozens of lawsuits against the administration, and has claimed they have resulted in more than $2 billion in funds returned to the state.

Trump, who campaigned on a promise to “unleash” American oil and gas, has spent the first year of his second term bolstering fossil fuels.

In May, his Department of Justice preemptively sued Michigan, with US Attorney General Pam Bondi arguing that state climate lawsuits “threaten American energy independence and our country’s economic and national security.”

That case is pending in US District Court.

In addition to rolling back regulations on greenhouse gases and toxic coal plant pollution, Trump has canceled tens of billions of dollars’ worth of federal climate grants and clean energy subsidies while pushing instead to expand subsidies for fossil fuels.

Some $540 million in climate-related grants to Michigan have been canceled or held up since Inauguration Day. Nessel has sued the administration in hopes of reversing some of those cuts.

Investment grew even in the U.S., despite a sweeping rollback of government support for clean energy.

Last year, investors poured $893 billion into electric vehicles, $690 billion into renewable power, and $483 billion into power grids, with additional funding going to heat pumps, battery storage, nuclear power, and other technologies that promise to curb demand for fossil fuels, according to a new report from BloombergNEF.

China remains the global leader in clean energy investment, though it saw a drop in funding for renewable power last year as new regulations came into force that slowed the buildout of wind and solar. Investment in India grew by 15 percent, and in Europe by 18 percent. In the U.S., investment climbed by just 3.5 percent amid a gutting of federal support for clean energy under President Trump.

While the shift to clean energy may be unstoppable, the analysis showed that it can be slowed. Before Trump returned to office, EVs were projected to reach nearly half of U.S. car sales by the end of this decade. Now, they are on course for roughly a third, according to BNEF.

Analysts warn of another trend that threatens to slow the shift to clean energy. While China currently dominates the manufacturing of solar, batteries, and EVs, manufacturing investment is growing in the U.S. and the E.U., where governments are looking to protect fledgling industries by imposing tariffs on Chinese imports.

Albert Cheung, a lead analyst at BNEF, warned that, with tariffs, Western leaders are driving up the cost of the shift to clean energy. Rather than blocking affordable imports from China, he said, governments should be “looking for other investment opportunities where their countries may possess competitive advantage.”

These will include new offshore wind “hybrid assets” – wind farms at sea that are directly connected to more than one country through multi-purpose interconnectors (MPIs).","Almost a dozen countries have rallied together to get off the “fossil fuel rollercoaster” and transform the wind energy sector.

Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and the UK will today (26 January) sign the Hamburg Declaration – a landmark commitment to deliver 100GW of joint offshore wind projects across shared North Sea waters by 2050. This is enough electricity to power around 143 million homes.

The €9.5 billion pact aims to turn the North Sea into the world’s “largest clean energy reservoir” and mobilise €1 trillion of capital in Europe. It is also expected to create more than 90,000 jobs and reduce power production costs by 30 per cent in the next 15 years.

The Hamburg Declaration comes just days after Donald Trump dubbed countries investing in wind power as “losers”.

How the North Sea will become a haven for wind power

Three years ago, North Sea nations pledged to build 300GW of offshore wind in the North Sea by 2050 in response to Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine and “weaponisation” of Europe’s energy supplies.

A third of that is now slated to come from joint clean-energy projects. These will include new offshore wind “hybrid assets” – wind farms at sea that are directly connected to more than one country through multi-purpose interconnectors (MPIs).

There is already a network of undersea cables that connect the electricity grids of European countries, but the Hamburg Declaration marks the first time that wind farms will be directly linked to multiple nations.

In a joint statement, industry body RenewableUK and National Grid Ventures – the commercial development arm of the UK’s National Grid – say using MPIs would reduce the amount of infrastructure needed to transport electricity, slashing the impact on coastal communities and the environment.

However, interconnectors have proved controversial in Norway following concerns that power generated from MPIs could be sold to foreign countries. This stops energy bills from going down for residents and reduces their energy supplies.

To prevent this from happening, governments have started to bring in strict new rules banning electricity exports when domestic supply could be at risk.

Getting off the ‘fossil fuel rollercoaster’

“We’re standing up for our national interest by driving for clean energy, which can get the UK off the fossil fuel rollercoaster and give us energy sovereignty and abundance,” says UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband.

“After our record renewables auction, we today went further by signing a clean energy security pact with European allies to ensure we maximise the clean energy potential for the North Sea.”

Germany’s economy minister Katherina Reiche says the pact provides “reliable perspectives” for the offshore sector, helping to future-proof jobs and secure “creation of value in Europe”.

Last year, solar and wind generated more EU electricity than fossil fuels for the first time. While the milestone has been praised by energy experts, many still believe the EU’s “outdated” grid is holding back progress.",https://images.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/62/63/68/1200x675_cmsv2_908d2f1a-4ab2-5e71-9099-c750aab33a5b-9626368.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 13:00:35.968538

Data centers needed to power AI, electrification and industrial reshoring are expected to double electricity demand in some regions over the next five years.

Meeting this demand rapidly and affordably will require deployment of all available energy resources, from new hydrocarbon projects to boost U.S. production to nuclear, solar and wind, to form an abundant and resilient energy ecosystem.

As the Climate Intuition: Power Rewired: A New Map of Energy and Geopolitics report recently noted, governments not treating power as a strategic asset risk missing out on economic growth as AI transforms societies.

Strategic energy resources: A broader definition

For decades, reliable access to oil and gas defined energy security. Today, the definition is expanding as technologies and markets evolve. Energy security is increasingly a question of who controls minerals, grids, financing and technologies – prompting countries to look across a broad range of sources as they prioritize energy supply growth. Countries are also recognizing that a diversified energy mix can strengthen reliability, help to stabilize costs and enhance competitiveness.

JPMorganChase is working with clients to help expand reliable energy generation capacity and secure an affordable, diversified energy mix. It advised Constellation on its $16.4B acquisition of Calpine, merging Constellation's vast nuclear fleet with Calpine's extensive natural gas and geothermal assets and enabling them to diversify their power portfolio to meet growing customer demand.

Financing across this full range of energy solutions is not about promoting one technology over another. It’s about meeting client demand and enabling an energy supply that supports U.S. competitiveness and keeps prices affordable.

Building grid resilience

Modernizing the grid—physically, technologically, and in market design— while slowing rising costs is essential to grow the economy. A resilient grid is also an important part of U.S. national and economic security. Modernizing America’s transmission and distribution systems helps to prevent disruptions from storms, demand spikes and cyber threats. Distributed generation— from renewables, natural gas, or advanced nuclear—paired with advanced grid technology, strengthens the grid by decentralizing power and reducing the risk that any one failure can take down the system.

As outlined in Climate Intuition: Resilience: Where Climate Change and National Security Meet, Ukraine’s experience shows the value of decentralized and diversified infrastructure. Distributed renewable microgrids have been harder to target and faster to deploy during rebuilding than single-site large-scale energy plants.

JPMorganChase has supported clients working to build out grid modernization and storage capacity. It served as a joint bookrunner for VoltaGrid’s $5 billion comprehensive financing package, supporting their investment in behind-the-meter natural gas power solutions for data centers. This solution provides power for data centers without impacting the surrounding grid, thus enhancing grid resiliency.

Financing grid resilience goes beyond energy – it helps safeguard the U.S. economy.

Navigating uncertain supply chains

Supply chain resilience is increasingly important to bolstering America’s competitiveness in the global energy landscape. Also, by securing access to critical minerals, such as lithium, cobalt, and rare earth elements, and investing in domestic mining, processing, and manufacturing, the U.S. can reduce its dependence on geopolitically sensitive regions and insulate itself from export restrictions or supply disruptions.

As part of the Security and Resiliency Initiative – a $1.5 trillion, 10-year plan to facilitate, finance and invest in industries critical to national economic security and resiliency – It made a strategic equity investment in Perpetua Resources, helping to strengthen the domestic supply of critical minerals. Additionally, J.P. Morgan advised Korea Zinc and provided critical financing for its landmark transaction to build a large-scale metals smelter in the U.S., onshoring processing of 11 critical materials such as germanium and gallium.

Energy abundance as strategic advantage

By approaching diversified energy sources as strategic resources and safeguarding the supply chains behind them, the U.S. can strengthen its economy, manage energy costs, reduce vulnerabilities, and lead the industries of the future.

JPMorganChase is proud to support clients driving this transformation by helping finance the secure, abundant, affordable energy system that will power America’s next era of growth and competitiveness.",https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmorganchase/images/newsroom/stories/header-americas-strategic-edge-in-an-evolving-energy-landscape.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 11:03:10.128684

DHPL is a special purpose vehicle entity owned by Bhutan’s Druk Green Power Corporation (60%) and Tata Power (40%), India’s largest private integrated power company.","The 1125 MW Dorjilung hydroelectric power project, located on the Kurichhu River in eastern Bhutan, will generate more than 4500 GWh of clean electricity annually, increasing the country’s energy production by 40% and energy exports by 42%.

The project will help close Bhutan’s seasonal energy gap, eliminating the need for costly energy imports in winter, and generating surplus energy during the summer and monsoons to export to India when domestic energy demands in Bhutan are low. The savings and revenues from the project will create fiscal space for social spending and other investments to benefit the people of Bhutan.

Lyonpo Lekey Dorji, Finance Minister, Royal Government of Bhutan, commented: “The Dorjilung hydroelectric power project is a national priority and will be transformational for Bhutan – delivering clean electricity, spurring economic growth, and advancing our carbon-negative commitment. Its innovative financing structure ensures that this project does not unduly burden public finances, allowing us to continue investing in our people.”

Dorjilung will be Bhutan’s largest hydropower project developed under a public-private partnership, marking a shift to a more sustainable financing model for hydropower development and paving the way for greater private sector investment in the hydropower sector. The World Bank Group financing of US$815 million will mobilise about US$900 million from private investors.

Xavier Furtado, the World Bank Group’s Country Manager for Bhutan, added: “The World Bank Group is bringing the full strength of its institutions – International Development Association (IDA), International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), and International Finance Corporation (IFC) – to support the Dorjilung hydroelectric power project in Bhutan. We’ve worked with the Royal Government of Bhutan to put together a financing package designed to keep sovereign borrowing to a minimum, catalyse private sector engagement, and carefully balance risks among public and private stakeholders. This approach can serve as a model for future sustainable hydro development in Bhutan and other countries.”

The project will create thousands of jobs during the dam construction and operation; catalyse local enterprises; and support livelihoods in Mongar and Lhuentse Districts, which face higher poverty, unemployment and out-migration than the national average. The project will also upgrade roads and enhance access to markets and essential services for local communities.

The World Bank Group financing package includes a US$150 million grant and a US$150 million credit from the IDA and a US$15 million enclave loan from the IBRD to the Government of Bhutan, as well as a US$200 million IBRD enclave loan and a US$300 million ‘A loan’ from the IFC to Dorjilung Hydro Power Ltd (DHPL). DHPL is a special purpose vehicle entity owned by Bhutan’s Druk Green Power Corporation (60%) and Tata Power (40%), India’s largest private integrated power company.

UNDP experts analyzed the impact of climate change on energy infrastructure, especially power transmission lines, and concluded that adaptation can make a real difference.","International Clean Energy Day is another reminder to reflect on the connection between climate and energy. We often assume that energy systems affect the climate but increasingly, it’s the other way around.

We're used to thinking of energy as a powerful, resilient sector, insulated from the forces of nature. But in reality, it is becoming increasingly vulnerable. Strong winds, hurricanes, freezing temperatures, heatwaves, heavy rain, and droughts can damage power plants, down transmission lines, disable substations and hydropower plants.

Imagine your home losing heating in the middle of winter. Or summer heatwaves overloading the grid, cutting off electricity to homes, hospitals, and schools. These scenarios are no longer hypothetical; they're becoming a reality, causing outages and billions in economic losses around the world.

Let’s look at examples from other countries:

In Texas, USA, extreme cold in 2021 paralyzed the power system. The equipment froze, leaving four million households without electricity.

In France and Germany, rivers overheated during summer heatwaves, disrupting cooling systems for nuclear and thermal power plants. Energy output dropped by 30 percent, driving up production costs.

In China's Hainan province, intense rainfall flooded substations, halting metro services and factory operations.

In the Alps and Himalayas, glacial melt is already affecting hydropower operations. Initially, excess water can threaten infrastructure, but later, declining water levels cause energy shortages.

This is a serious challenge for the future, and losses are expected to grow without adaptation. The good news? By preparing through adaptation, we can limit outages, reduce economic losses, and safeguard our communities and infrastructure against climate impacts.

According to the OECD report Infrastructure for a Climate-Resilient Future(link is external), well-targeted and timely investments can help protect lives and livelihoods, improve service reliability, reduce maintenance costs, extend asset lifespans, and generate co-benefits. Every dollar invested in climate-resilient infrastructure yields about four dollars of benefits.

In Kazakhstan, hundreds of thousands of kilometers of power lines stretch across steppes, mountains, and flood-prone areas. According to UNDP assessments, the country is already experiencing more frequent heatwaves and deep freezes, heavier rainfall, more floods, higher winds, altered river flows, and glacial melt.

Economic modeling conducted by UNDP in Kazakhstan as part of the National Adaptation Plan process shows that climate-related losses could reach nearly 400 billion tenge by 2050, and up to 66.9 trillion tenge by 2100. These figures leave no doubt: energy is a critical pillar of climate adaptation.

UNDP experts analyzed the impact of climate change on energy infrastructure, especially power transmission lines, and concluded that adaptation can make a real difference. Measures such as upgrading power lines with weather-resistant materials, laying underground or insulated cables in vulnerable areas, developing smart grids and weather monitoring systems, and protecting substations from floods and overheating all bring measurable economic benefits. With investments of 2.9 trillion tenge by 2100, Kazakhstan could avoid 2.1 trillion tenge in losses from outages and disruptions.

Even if the savings don’t fully cover the costs, the strategic value of these investments is enormous: they increase energy reliability, reduce the frequency of breakdowns, and prevent cascading losses across industry, transport, and public services.

Adapting transmission lines is not just an expense, it’s a long-term investment in the country’s energy and economic security. And it requires action across the entire sector.

Priority adaptation measures for Kazakhstan include:

Upgrading transmission lines using climate-resilient materials;

Laying underground or insulated cables in high-risk zones;

Expanding smart grids and early warning systems for extreme weather;

Protecting substations from flooding and overheating;

Diversifying energy sources and scaling up renewable generation.

Clean energy is not only about reducing emissions it’s also about withstanding climate risks. On International Clean Energy Day, it’s worth remembering: resilience means protecting people, ensuring their safety and comfort, and securing the future of our country.",https://www.undp.org/sites/g/files/zskgke326/files/styles/scaled_image_large/public/2026-01/ai_image_for_energy_blog.png?itok=jeeSq3xC,N,,2026-01-26 12:01:32.109373

Hitachi Energy supports these hubs with its broader offering, which includes mobile BESS, charging infrastructure, and advanced energy management systems.
HyFlex, an award-winning solution, plays a key role in making hybrid energy hubs practical and scalable for zero-emission construction sites.
During these initiatives, Hitachi Energy’s HyFlex®-powered construction sites, including electric construction machinery, operated in areas without access to the power grid.","Hitachi Energy has completed the deployment of a zero-emission construction site in the United Kingdom. For four weeks, the company powered its own construction site as part of a National Grid 400 kilovolt (kV) grid connection project in Rugeley, Staffordshire, mitigating emissions from conventional diesel generators. The self-funded initiative reflects the company’s commitment to sustainability and the targets of achieving net-zero by 2050¹.

During this time, the site relied on Hitachi Energy’s HyFlex® hydrogen-powered generator supplied with clean green hydrogen from Air Products, together with a battery energy storage system (BESS). Based on an estimated electricity consumption of up to 5.2 megawatt-hour (MWh), the project avoided around five tonnes of CO₂ emissions compared to conventional diesel generators during the four-week period—roughly equivalent to two round-trip economy-class flights between London and New York. This achievement demonstrates the technology readiness for real-world application and marks a significant step toward fossil-free construction.

Green hydrogen is becoming increasingly central to the energy transition. Its versatility as a clean energy carrier offers strong potential to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors and indirectly electrify industrial processes. The construction sector alone accounts for over a third of global energy-related CO₂ emissions3, and the footprint of building operations continues to rise.

Policy momentum is accelerating this shift. In the UK, the Construction Leadership Council’s Zero Diesel Sites Route Map sets a target to cut diesel use on construction sites by 78 percent by 20354, highlighting the urgency to replace conventional generators with cleaner alternatives. As emission-free construction requirements expand across Europe, flexible energy hubs are a key enabler for sites that need affordable, reliable, and clean power. Hitachi Energy supports these hubs with its broader offering, which includes mobile BESS, charging infrastructure, and advanced energy management systems. HyFlex, an award-winning solution, plays a key role in making hybrid energy hubs practical and scalable for zero-emission construction sites.

The Rugeley case builds on the success of earlier pioneering HyFlex® deployments across Europe in collaborations involving leading companies such as Kanonaden, Volvo, the Port of Gothenburg, and Dura Vermeer. During these initiatives, Hitachi Energy’s HyFlex®-powered construction sites, including electric construction machinery, operated in areas without access to the power grid. It also enables zero emission of pollutants such as NOx and SOx, delivering very low noise and vibrations, which contributes to the wellbeing of site workers.",https://dynamicassets.hitachienergy.com/adobe/assets/urn:aaid:aem:edc28f52-658d-4997-bd57-677298415d54/as/hyflex.jpg?width=1440&height=810&smartcrop=16-9,N,,2026-01-26 08:58:53.476910

To reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote energy-efficient transportation, the United States (U.S.) government introduced a tax credit policy to incentivize income-eligible individuals to purchase electric vehicles (EVs). While the use of EVs reduces carbon emissions, they are expensive, and households that earn at least $200,000 are the primary consumers of EVs. In this study, we propose reallocating tax credit funds to encourage the purchase of hybrid vehicles, which are cheaper than EVs and thus more accessible to lower-income families. Lower-income households often own older, inefficient vehicles, and replacing these with hybrids could significantly reduce emissions. We hypothesized that this new policy would achieve higher fuel economy and reduce carbon emissions more effectively than the current policy. To test our hypothesis, we collected vehicle data from 2022 in the U.S. and analyzed the potential outcomes of fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions of both the current policy and proposed policy changes under different assumptions. Our analysis supported this hypothesis, showing that the proposed policy could yield better outcomes in terms of fuel efficiency, measured in miles per gallon and carbon dioxide emissions. We also suggested that the U.S. government develop a list of eligible vehicles for tax credits, contingent on the trade-in of older, high-emission cars, to maximize environmental benefits.

All that snow will intensify the cold for days ahead. It will never feel above zero today, according to 9 First Warning Weather. A cold weather advisory is in effect Monday because of the cold. That continues until 6 p.m. Then, starting at 6 p.m., an extreme cold warning begins for the Tri-State and will continue through 12 p.m. Tuesday.

This warning means that dangerously cold wind chills are expected.

Snow-covered Roads

Roads will remain in bad condition, though no new snow is in expected.

Road crews have been going non-stop since before the snow started Saturday. The Ohio Department of Transportation is responsible for the state highway system — that is state, federal and interstate routes outside of municipalities.

Public Information Officer Kathleen Fuller spoke with WVXU early Monday morning.

""Right now, we still have a lot of snow covered roads but we are making progress, particularly on the interstates in Hamilton County. We are getting some things, not fully cleared by any means, but we are seeing some pavement. There has been progress made,"" she said.

Fuller notes the extreme cold isn't going to help things any.

""There will be a tremendous impact. Because of the cold temperatures, materials are going to be somewhat ineffective. So it's really just a lot of having the plows down on the pavement and trying to push it off. We really just hope that ... the snow hasn't turned into some sort of ice and compacted to the pavement, and that is a real threat,"" she says.

The best way to help is to stay off the roads. If you do have to drive, give plows plenty of space to work.

As plow crews in your community get to clearing secondary streets and neighborhoods, officials have a big recommendation to save yourself a lot of headache: You should shovel snow to the right side of your driveway — that's to your right as you're facing the street. Doing this helps prevent snow from being pushed back into your driveway when the plow comes through.

There's good news from an energy standpoint. As of 7:30 a.m. Monday, Duke Energy was reporting only a handful of customers in the area without power.

We've, so far, dodged a potential catastrophe that could have been caused with ice build-up on power lines. Duke says half an inch of ice can down power lines. That's usually caused by freezing rain; sleet poses less of a risk because it doesn't accumulate on lines.

Photovoltaic solar energy conversion is of high importance in Europe’s transition toward a clean, resilient, and climate-neutral energy system. While silicon solar modules dominate today’s PV market, their rigidity, weight, and limited design flexibility constrain their use in many emerging applications. In contrast, next-generation thin-film photovoltaic technologies, particularly perovskite solar cells, enable solar energy generation in areas where conventional photovoltaics are less suitable.

Among these emerging technologies, perovskite solar cells have attracted great attention over the past decade. Their rapid rise in power conversion efficiency, now exceeding 27%, combined with low-temperature processing and compatibility with flexible substrates, positions them as a disruptive alternative to conventional photovoltaics. However, these high-performance perovskite solar cells contain lead, which raises environmental and societal concerns and could challenge large-scale deployment.

The EU-funded Horizon Europe project SMARTLINE-PV addresses this challenge by developing scalable, tin halide perovskite solar cells with the focus on innovative crystallisation technologies. By combining material innovation, plasma-assisted processing, ecodesign, and application-driven demonstrators, SMARTLINE-PV aims to unlock new areas of applications, in particular, in the rapidly growing fields of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV).

A strong European consortium driving innovation

SMARTLINE-PV brings together a multidisciplinary consortium of 13 partners from across Europe, combining academic and applied research expertise, and industrial know-how. The universities and research organisations (Graz University of Technology, HZB, Joanneum Research, CNR, Fraunhofer ISE, CEA, and bifa Umweltinstitut) lead the development of advanced tin perovskite materials, crystallisation chemistry, device architectures, module integration, sustainability assessment, and circularity, while the industrial partners (INO GmbH, temicon, Homerun Energy, COMTES FHT, Terran and FILBAU) focus on scalable processing, roll-to-roll compatibility, and market-oriented design. This tightly integrated collaboration enables SMARTLINE-PV to bridge the gap between fundamental materials research and industrially relevant photovoltaic solutions, enabling a transition from laboratory innovation to deployable clean-energy technologies.

From lead to tin: A sustainable materials shift

Replacing lead with tin in perovskite solar cells is a promising route towards environmentally friendly photovoltaics. Tin halide perovskites share many of the favourable optoelectronic properties of their lead-based counterparts, including strong light absorption and excellent charge transport. Encouragingly, tin-based perovskite solar cells have already demonstrated efficiencies exceeding 17%.

Despite this progress, several critical challenges remain. Tin perovskites are prone to fast crystallisation, high defect densities, and chemical instability, in particular, due to the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+. These factors negatively impact device efficiency, reproducibility, long-term stability, and large-area fabrication.

SMARTLINE-PV tackles these issues through novel precursor chemistry and crystallisation control strategies. Innovative crystallisation mediators are designed to slow down the crystal formation process, allowing tin perovskite films to grow with fewer defects and improved structural uniformity. In parallel, the project explores non-oxidising solvents, hydrogen-bond interactions, and halide-halide interactions to stabilise the tin oxidation state and further improve film quality. These material innovations lay the foundation for high-performance, stable tin halide perovskite solar cells that are suitable not only for laboratory demonstrations, but also for industrially relevant manufacturing.

Plasma-assisted crystallisation for scalable manufacturing

Conventional perovskite fabrication often relies on anti-solvent dripping, a process that is difficult to control, solvent-intensive, and not well suited for large-area or roll-to-roll production. In contrast, the plasma-assisted approach, investigated in SMARTLINE-PV, enables fast, solvent-free crystallisation at low temperatures, offering good control over nucleation and crystal growth. By combining optimised precursor formulations with carefully tuned plasma conditions, uniform and high-quality perovskite films can be produced without anti-solvents. This process is also well compatible with roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing, enabling continuous deposition on large-area flexible substrates. This compatibility represents an important step toward industrial scalability, reduced energy consumption, and lower production costs.

Device engineering for efficiency and stability

In addition to the optimisation of the perovskite absorber, SMARTLINE-PV focuses on customising the device architecture specifically for tin perovskites. Tailored interlayers are developed to enhance charge extraction, suppress recombination losses, and protect sensitive interfaces within the solar cell stack. Novel device architectures are explored to improve mechanical flexibility and long-term operational stability under real-world conditions.

Through this integrated approach, SMARTLINE-PV aims to achieve efficiencies above 20% for tin-based perovskite solar cells, an ambitious but realistic target that would highlight the potential of this solar cell technology as a viable alternative to established thin-film technologies.

Coloured modules through the MorphoColor concept and building integration

In the built environment, solar energy systems are expected to combine performance with design and functionality. SMARTLINE-PV addresses this by enabling colour variation in tin perovskite solar cell modules through the MorphoColor concept, which is inspired by the structural colouration found in butterfly wings. The MorphoColor concept relies on photonic structures that combine geometrically patterned substrates with interference layers to create bright, customisable colours without relying on pigments. This approach enables perovskite solar modules with selectable colour, which are ideally suited for architectural integration.

For BIPV applications, this design freedom is transformative. Facades, sunshades, and roof elements can simultaneously generate electricity and contribute to the visual identity of buildings, an essential factor for deployment in urban and historic environments.

Ecodesign, circularity and low carbon footprint

Sustainability is a guiding principle throughout SMARTLINE-PV. The project integrates eco-design and circularity concepts across the entire lifecycle of the solar cells, from raw materials and manufacturing to use, recycling, and end-of-life considerations. Low-temperature, fast processing reduces energy demand during fabrication, contributing to a low carbon footprint compared to conventional photovoltaic technologies. The elimination of lead and solvent-intensive processing further enhances environmental compatibility and social acceptance.

Demonstrators supporting technology transfer

To bridge the gap between laboratory research and practical deployment, SMARTLINE-PV places strong emphasis on application-oriented demonstrators. Flexible tin perovskite solar modules are integrated into IoT devices, enabling autonomous, maintenance-free power supplies for sensors and smart systems.

In parallel, BIPV demonstrators showcase the integration of flexible, colour-selectable modules into building elements such as roof tiles and sunshades. These demonstrators are tested under real-world conditions, providing valuable data on performance, durability, and user acceptance.

Shaping the future of thin-film photovoltaics

By addressing efficiency, scalability, sustainability, and aesthetics through a holistic approach, SMARTLINE-PV represents a significant step toward a new generation of thin-film photovoltaics. The project demonstrates that tin-based perovskite solar cells can move beyond niche research topics and become viable candidates for real-world applications.

SMARTLINE-PV demonstrates how advanced materials research, innovative processing, and thoughtful design can be combined to develop practical and impactful photovoltaic solutions. By addressing both technical performance and integration aspects, the project supports the broader adoption of photovoltaics in everyday applications and contributes to a more sustainable built environment.

Many of the core skills required for battery manufacturing already exist in adjacent industries.
Its training portfolio ranges from introductory courses explaining battery manufacturing fundamentals to deep-dive, hands-on experience on a live production line.
“We’re currently the only place in the world where you can get line-side experience in a real battery manufacturing environment,” Deeley-Williamson said.","By any measure, the UK’s transition to electrified transport is accelerating. Gigafactory announcements, electric vehicle (EV) targets and investment in battery research dominate headlines. Yet, as Jonty Deeley-Williamson, head of learning and development at the UK Battery Industrialisation Centre (UKBIC), argues, there is a critical enabler that remains consistently underplayed: skills

Speaking to an audience of engineers and industry leaders at Advanced Engineering, Deeley-Williamson was direct about the challenge. “People keep telling me how great their technology is, or how electrification will magically solve everything,” he said. “But when I ask about skills, I get blank looks. These factories don’t run themselves.”

UKBIC’S ROLE IN THE BATTERY ECOSYSTEM

UKBIC occupies a unique position in the UK and global battery landscape. Based in Coventry, it is the world’s only open-access battery manufacturing facility covering the full process chain from electrode manufacture through to module and pack assembly. Crucially, it does not retain intellectual property. Instead, it exists to de-risk manufacturing scale-up and develop capability. “We’re not here to own IP,” Deeley-Williamson explained. “What we care about is making sure people can actually run these processes at scale.”

That focus is timely. Around 65,000 new jobs are expected to be required across the UK battery supply chain as electrification accelerates. Without a coordinated approach to skills development, there is a real risk that capital investment in factories and R&D will outpace the availability of a trained workforce.

A WIDENING SKILLS GAP

The UK currently has only two confirmed large-scale battery manufacturing projects under construction: AESC in the North East and Agratas in the Midlands. To meet projected automotive demand alone, the UK would need to roughly double its planned gigafactory capacity. That figure excludes additional demand from heavy goods vehicles, off-highway machinery, rail, marine and stationary energy storage.

“These numbers are still educated guesses,” Deeley-Williamson noted. “But even the conservative estimates show we are several gigafactories short – and every one of those needs hundreds, if not thousands, of skilled operators and technicians.”

Compounding the issue is the reality that electrification is not a simple workforce transition from internal combustion engines (ICEs) to batteries. For the foreseeable future, both technologies will coexist. That limits the pool of experienced workers who can be directly redeployed.

“We’re not just flipping a switch,” he said. “You can’t assume the existing ICE workforce will simply move across. Many of the roles are different, and we need new entrants as well as reskilled staff.”

MANUFACTURING AT ALL LEVELS

According to Deely-Williamon, persistent misconception is that battery manufacturing is dominated by PhD-level scientists. In reality, around 80–90% of roles in a gigafactory are Level 2 or Level 3 technical and vocational positions. “This is normal manufacturing, just cleaner,” he said. “Production operators, maintenance technicians, quality technicians - these are the backbone of the industry.”

Each gigawatt-hour of battery manufacturing capacity typically supports around 180 direct manufacturing jobs, with at least 120 linked to automotive supply. As capacity scales, job creation is broadly linear. This has significant implications for education policy. While the UK has strong university-based battery research through organisations such as the Faraday Institution, vocational education and further education colleges have historically been under-supported. “We’ve invested heavily in universities, but we’ve left vocational education behind,” Deeley-Williamson said. “If we lose people at Level 2 and Level 3, the whole system falls over.”

TRANSFERABLE SKILLS: A HIDDEN ADVANTAGE

Despite the scale of the challenge, Deeley-Williamson is optimistic. Many of the core skills required for battery manufacturing already exist in adjacent industries. “If you walk through a battery plant, you’ll be surprised how much of the equipment comes from elsewhere,” he said. “Mixers came from concrete and food processing. Cell assembly looks a lot like electronics manufacturing. Maintenance and machine minding are universal skills.”

This creates an opportunity to reskill workers from industries in decline, rather than starting from scratch. Process control, statistical analysis, equipment maintenance and quality assurance are all transferable competencies.

UKBIC has built a structured skills ecosystem spanning Levels 2 to 5, complementing higher-level academic provision. Its training portfolio ranges from introductory courses explaining battery manufacturing fundamentals to deep-dive, hands-on experience on a live production line.

“We’re currently the only place in the world where you can get line-side experience in a real battery manufacturing environment,” Deeley-Williamson said. “Most commercial plants won’t let you anywhere near their lines.”

UKBIC has also led the development of the UK’s first Battery Manufacturing Technician apprenticeship standard, now adopted internationally in countries including Germany, France and Singapore. Additional short courses are being developed to support automotive workers, service leavers and those transitioning from ICE manufacturing.

Batteries account for around 62% of the value and weight of an electric vehicle. If the UK fails to build them domestically, it risks higher import costs, exposure to trade barriers and the loss of a strategically important manufacturing sector.

“We’re already seeing what happens when we don’t act,” Deeley-Williamson warned, pointing to the dominance of Asian manufacturers, who currently account for around 94% of global battery production. “This isn’t about losing a niche industry – it’s about losing the heart of future vehicle manufacturing.”",,N,,2026-01-26 08:58:40.609785

Cheap prices, government subsidies and a growing charging network all point to continued sales growth for China’s automakers in the country.

Mexico City is abuzz with cheap, battery-powered compacts made by the likes of China's BYD Co. The world’s largest EV maker nearly doubled its Mexican sales volume last year and now accounts for about 7 of every 10 electric and plugin hybrid vehicles sold there, according to estimates from BloombergNEF.

EVs or plugins account for 9% of new-car sales, making it a growing segment in Mexico that many other global brands have bypassed. It's a sign of how Chinese automakers see opportunity in developing economies with infrastructure challenges, fragmented distribution and lower income levels.

Middle-class city dwellers are lured by these EVs’ affordability. Mexico City resident Monica Reyes Rosas, a 49-year-old voice-over agent, is one of them. She drove a gas-powered Ford Ranger each day for the better part of six years until she made the switch last month to a BYD King plugin hybrid sedan that cost her $26,307. “You save a lot on gasoline and the price is extremely competitive,” Reyes said.

BYD’s Dolphin Mini EV, its most popular model, sells for about $2,000 less than its nearest competitor, the battery-powered Chevrolet Spark EUV, which was introduced to the market just over six months ago.

The swift incursion of Chinese cars has taken Mexico by surprise, leading to concerns by legacy carmakers with manufacturing operations in Mexico and pressure from the U.S. government. As part of a wider effort to address growing dependence on China, in September President Claudia Sheinbaum proposed tariffs as high as 50% on some products from countries that don’t have free trade deals with Mexico, which included Chinese auto imports.",https://cdn.magzter.com/images/refer/referandearn/MagzterGoldShare.png,N,,2026-01-26 12:02:58.807947

When the Senate passes the last of the appropriations bills — which is supposed to happen this week — Republicans and Democrats will have secured more than 8,400 earmarks collectively worth more than $15.7 billion for projects in their home states and districts.

The approval of those earmarks will be a welcome development for lawmakers who have waited nearly two years to secure funding for local initiatives such as road and transit improvements, dam and lock maintenance, wildfire mitigation, and wastewater and sewer projects.

That’s because the earmarks in the fiscal 2026 bills are the first since fiscal 2024. Congress passed a continuing resolution for fiscal 2025 that deprived members of their allocations.

In some cases, the lack of statutory direction in the funding patch allowed the Trump administration to more easily freeze or cancel funds, including for water infrastructure projects led by the Army Corps of Engineers.

Now, lawmakers are making up for lost time and celebrating the massive hauls many of them are about to get.

“My message to [President] Donald Trump: Don’t mess with our water. Don’t mess with our fish,” said Senate Appropriations ranking member Patty Murray (D-Wash.) in a speech last week, touting a $190 million earmark she secured for a dam project along with Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.).

“Just like salmon, I’m never giving up,” Murray said. “We’re going to muscle upstream and get this project and win this fight.”

Lawmakers are set to win many of the earmarks they requested last year, and in some cases two years ago. Republicans — especially senior appropriators — are poised to reap the largest windfalls.

Still, hurdles remain. Some fiscal conservatives have been speaking out about the earmarks. And Democrats want to renegotiate the Homeland Security spending bill after federal agents killed a second person in Minnesota amid protests against the administration’s immigration enforcement actions.

Six fiscal 2026 bills already cleared Congress — including Energy-Water and Interior-Environment — but the Homeland Security measure is packaged with five others that remain pending.

But even if Democrats succeed in isolating the Homeland Security bill, that would only jeopardize a fraction of planned earmarks. There is little appetite for a partial government shutdown.

Army Corps projects win big

Rep. Chuck Fleischmann (R-Tenn.), chair of the House Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee, will have his name on the largest earmark across all spending bills: a $213 million designation for a long-running Army Corps project at the Chickamauga Lock in Tennessee.

The blockbuster earmark is Fleischmann’s latest major contribution to the lock project. In fiscal 2024, he led all House members in earmarked dollars, including a $236.8 million request for the Chickamauga Lock.

Fleischmann has called it “a critically important project for Tennessee,” and he noted in his fiscal 2026 request that delays have necessitated more funding. The upgrades, he said, will help make cargo transport more efficient — including for the movement of equipment needed to produce nuclear power.

Cantwell and Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy-Water Appropriations Subcommittee, are set to come away with the $190 million earmark for the Hanson Dam, which would go toward a water storage and fish passage project.

At a press conference just downstream of the dam, Murray said the project is intended to reduce flood risk and support long-term water availability for more than 1 million residents.

The next-largest earmark, also in the compromise Energy-Water bill, would provide $183.8 million for construction at Montgomery Locks and Dam on the Ohio River.

It was requested by Sens. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) and Dave McCormick (R-Pa.), as well as Reps. Chris Deluzio (D-Pa.) and Guy Reschenthaler (R-Pa.).

Deluzio and Reschenthaler said in their joint request that the locks modernization effort would help boost the region’s economy, support shipping and supply chains, and result in “significant environmental advantages.”

A major hurricane damage mitigation system in coastal Louisiana will benefit from the fourth-largest earmark across all spending bills: $131.5 million.

The earmark for the Morganza to the Gulf project likely benefited from the backing of powerful lawmakers, including House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) and Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), chair of the Senate’s Energy-Water Appropriations Subcommittee.

“My approach on the Senate Appropriations Committee is simple,” Kennedy said in a statement. “I won’t ask for a penny more than Louisiana needs, and I won’t take a penny less than Louisiana deserves.”

Money for climate corps, pipelines

The fiscal 2026 funding bills are loaded with thousands of smaller earmarks for a variety of projects.

The vast majority of earmarks in the Interior-Environment bill draw from EPA’s Clean and Drinking Water state revolving funds. Most of them will fund local wastewater, sewage and irrigation projects.

The Labor-HHS-Education bill contains a $1.03 million request from Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) that would go toward a “Climate Corps Fellowship.”

Conservative Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) called out the earmark earlier this month as one that he wanted congressional leaders to consider scrapping.

Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) was granted a vote on an amendment to remove earmarks from the Labor-HHS-Education bill; it failed easily.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), chair of the Interior-Environment Appropriations Subcommittee, secured a $730,000 earmark to fund job training for renewable energy development in her home state.

The senior appropriator is also getting a $2.5 million request to fund training and equipment for constructing and maintaining pipelines.

Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) has secured $11 million for a well-field pipeline project.

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) is set to bring home $10 million for a Forest Service ranger station in the White Mountain National Forest.

Even Republicans who consider themselves fiscally conservative and have openly criticized earmarks are set to come away with funding for their districts.

House Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris (R-Md.) previously blasted a large earmark secured by former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). Two years ago, he fought to eliminate an earmark for a nonprofit that provided services to LGBTQ+ individuals.

For fiscal 2026, Harris, who chairs the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, has secured tens of millions of dollars for projects in his home district, including Army Corps maintenance projects, a wastewater treatment plant and a youth crisis center.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/bf/5c/73e960dd4aeba0bb620eb41e3421/u-s-congress-30745.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 07:59:11.300772

Spot wholesale electricity prices across the U.S. have been elevated throughout the weekend as regional grids strain to meet surging demand. When demand is higher than the forecasts for utility companies, they can be forced to pay elevated spot prices for electricity to meet the demands of their residential and business customers.

Regional grids feed their power into the local distribution lines that bring electricity to homes and businesses. Those local power lines are showing disruptions, with nearly 900,000 customers without power on Sunday, according to PowerOutage.us, with more than 300,000 in Tennessee and more than 100,000 each in Mississippi, Texas and Louisiana.

Changing Course: Tesla’s Position in the EV Market

Despite Musk’s active presence on X, electric vehicles remain the core of Tesla’s business. However, Tesla has lost its top spot as the world’s leading EV manufacturer. The company recently reported delivering approximately 1.6 million vehicles last year—a 9% decline from 2024—while China’s BYD sold 2.3 million units, overtaking Tesla.

The company faces both industry-wide and unique challenges. The end of certain U.S. tax credits and competitive pricing for used EVs have impacted sales, while Tesla-specific issues include some owners expressing dissatisfaction by purchasing “Elon Sucks” bumper stickers.

Both Tesla and its investors are shifting their attention to new priorities:

Next-Gen Roadster and Shareholder Focus: Tesla engineer Lars Marovy described the upcoming Roadster, which could enter production as early as next year, as “the last best driver’s car.” Meanwhile, four of the top five questions shareholders want addressed at the earnings call relate to full self-driving and the Optimus robot, with another question about whether Tesla shareholders will get priority if SpaceX goes public (source, source).

Mixed Progress on Innovation: Last week, Tesla introduced a small fleet of driverless robotaxis in Austin, relying solely on cameras rather than additional sensors—a move that has sparked concern among critics about the technology’s readiness for broader deployment (source). Production of Cybercabs is slated to begin this year, with Optimus robots potentially following next year.

The promise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in residential energy is consumer empowerment, yet without appropriate governance the emerging reality may be its opposite. As households become data producers, behavioural subjects, and operational assets within intelligent electricity networks, a troubling asymmetry is taking shape: while consumers gain new modes of participation and value creation, they simultaneously face deepening opacity, dependency, and systemic exposure.

This asymmetry stems from a quiet migration of control. As optimisation and coordination become automated, decision-making shifts from individual households to platform operators, aggregators, and technology providers. A new layer of intermediation emerges-one where consumers engage markets not directly, but through algorithmic interfaces whose logic, data practices, and profit distribution remain largely invisible to them.

More subtly, AI is beginning to govern household behaviour itself. Nudges and adaptive controls embedded in everyday devices steer users toward predefined goals-efficiency, load shifting-often without explicit awareness. These systems learn habits, anticipate preferences, and adjust operations accordingly, gradually transforming voluntary decisions into algorithmically mediated routines. The shift is foundational: from enabling informed choice to shaping choice itself.

Yet this trajectory is not inevitable. The central argument of this paper is that AI’s impact on the consumer-energy relationship depends less on technology than on the institutions governing it. Without proactive oversight, digitalisation risks entrenching inequality and eroding agency; with adaptive, transparent regulation, it can democratise participation and accelerate clean energy transitions. To navigate this, the paper proposes a framework linking consumer, system, and institutional governance to eight guiding principles: privacy, autonomy, fairness, coordination, stability, resilience, transparency, and accountability.

This is discussed in the Using Municipal Bond Climate Risk Disclosures to Identify Gaps in Water Utility Climate Risk Preparedness section.
Evaluated drinking water utility systems We evaluate 1455 of the more than 50,000 community drinking water utilities in the contiguous US.
Combined climate risk index development Composite indices for drinking water climate exposure and climate vulnerability were combined with the previously developed drinking water climate hazard index database1.
Using municipal bond climate risk disclosures to identify gaps in water utility climate risk preparedness The developed water utility climate risk index captures the determinants of risk (hazard, exposure, and vulnerability) but does not include any utility actions aimed at addressing climate change.","Drinking water climate exposure and vulnerability indexes

It is challenging to compare climate vulnerabilities among utilities and validate comparisons as there are few databases with publicly accessible information25. Existing drinking water vulnerability and performance indices, which do not address climate risks, have been developed using regional datasets or case study approaches25,26,27. Our goal was to develop open access drinking water utility vulnerability and exposure indexes for as many systems as possible in the United States, given data availability limitations.

Nine indicators were drawn from three different public databases (Table 1 and SI Fig. S1) to capture dimensions of climate vulnerability and exposure of drinking water utilities. These include five utility system characteristics chosen to capture dimensions of vulnerability and four chosen to capture dimensions of exposure. The choices of indicators and utility system characteristics were informed by data availability, and data limitations restrict the number of utilities assessed in the analysis. To enable comparison of the climate risk index with information from municipal bonds, the analysis was further limited to municipal water utilities that have issued a municipal bond in the past 10 years. See Methods for additional details about the data sources.

Distributions of the vulnerability indicators (Fig. 1, left) reveal the relative numbers of utilities experiencing each aspect of vulnerability. The wide distribution for infrastructure age indicates that some utilities are older and others are younger, while the heavily right skewed distribution for water quality health indicates most utilities are currently in compliance with regulations. There is a minimal correlation between physical system health and financial health (R2 = 0.25), indicating that, for this subset of utilities, a utility’s finances do not guarantee a reliable physical infrastructure system. The five indicators were combined into an overall vulnerability index (see “Methods” section for more details). The map in Fig. 1 identifies the utilities with combined vulnerability indexes at the 90th percentile or higher. Around 70% of the most vulnerable utilities are located in the Upper Midwest, Ohio Valley, and Northeast. This is due to older infrastructure, slightly lower operating ratios, and in the Upper Midwest and Northeast, higher drinking water non-compliance scores. For these most vulnerable utilities, vulnerability is mainly concentrated in one dimension (i.e., poor physical system health or poor financial health), with around half of the utilities (48.5%) showing high physical vulnerability, 28.3% showing high financial vulnerability, and 26.1% high in both dimensions of vulnerability. Many of these utilities, including Toledo, OH; Troy, NY; and Saginaw, MI, have been identified previously as vulnerable utilities by other composite indices using different indicators25,27.

Most utilities have overall lower exposure to climate change compared to a few highly exposed systems and the distributions of the four exposure indicators (Fig. 2, left) are all very narrow, indicating limited variations between utilities. The four exposure indicators were combined into an overall exposure index (see “Methods” section for more details). The map in Fig. 2 shows that the utilities with relatively higher exposure (90th percentile exposure index) are distributed across the country; every region has some exposed utilities. Many of the most exposed utilities have high per capita employment rates. Texas has a large portion of the most exposed utilities with high per capita service connections or service areas. Some cities, including Hillsborough, CA and Ferndale, MI, have high annual costs of service and thus larger exposure of their finances if disruptions to the system were to occur.

Combined climate risk scores

Drinking water utility climate risk is calculated from the product of the individual exposure and vulnerability indices, as well as mid-century climate change projection hazard index values (see Methods section)1. The distribution of the combined risk index (Fig. S8) is right skewed; a few utilities have comparatively higher climate risk. The hazard index values are larger on average than the other indices, meaning this component has a greater influence on the combined risk index. This is an accurate representation of how climate risk will manifest in drinking water utilities; most will experience changes in climate hazards, while few have notably higher exposure or vulnerability. This is an important property of this risk model because the changes in climate hazards are external stressors that might be unknown to the system, compared to other system financial or infrastructure characteristics that the utility has more ability to affect.

Drinking water utility climate risk is geographically distributed across the US (Fig. 3). The regions with the highest average risk are the Northeast and West (Fig. S9) but the South, Upper Midwest, and Ohio Valley also have large numbers of utilities classified as higher risk (Fig. S10). While Western US regions are likely to see comparatively larger changes in climate hazards, smaller magnitude changes in hazards in the Northeast, South, Upper Midwest, and Ohio Valley coupled with existing vulnerabilities and exposure, means these utilities are also at risk. These utilities could experience more difficulty recovering from climate change hazards, given the lack of current adaptive capacity. Surface water systems have a higher average climate risk score than groundwater systems (Fig. S14) and a slightly larger portion of utilities that use surface water (27%, 264 out of 991 systems) are classified as having high climate risk, compared to those that use groundwater (21%, 93 out of 442 systems), see SI Fig. S15. Utilities serving more than 1 million customers have the highest average climate risk scores, likely due to their proximity to the coasts, though overall there are minimal differences in average climate risk score by population size served (Fig. S16). The utilities with high or moderate climate risk scores serve ~67 million customers.

One indicator from each of the vulnerability, exposure, and hazard indices was omitted (infrastructure age, service costs, and sea level rise projections) to assess how sensitive the climate risk index is to the included indicators. Infrastructure age (represented through a proxy of median housing age) was included in the index to capture the health of infrastructure assets. There is regional variation in housing age across the country so removing this indicator from the index had an effect on regional averages (Fig. S11). The Northeast, Upper Midwest, and Ohio Valley had comparatively lower risk values when infrastructure age was not considered, though the modified index was strongly correlated with the original index (R2 = 0.80). The service cost of delivering a set amount of water per household was included in the index to capture utility financial exposure. Service costs also vary widely across the country, and there were numerous utilities included in the sample with missing cost data (regional medians were used instead). Omitting service costs had a minimal overall effect on the risk index (correlation between modified index values and original was significant, R2 = 0.88). Higher service costs in California meant the West region had a lower average risk index value when this indicator was omitted (Fig. S12). Sea level rise was included in the original hazard index because it can affect groundwater systems and buried infrastructure. Omitting sea level rise had a minimal effect on regional averages of the risk index, as so many utilities are unaffected (R2 = 0.96), see Fig. S13.

Gaps in water utility climate risk understanding

The developed index identifies which utilities face the highest risks from climate hazards but does not account for any actions the utility might have taken to address climate change and reduce their risk. Twenty-three percent (378 out of 1611 utilities) of all the analyzed municipal bond official statements mentioned climate change, though a higher portion of revenue bonds (33.0%) compared to general obligation bonds (19.7%) mentioned climate change. A similar fraction (30%) of all municipal offering statements mention climate change42. This could indicate a recognition by municipalities that repayment based on income from service rates is more susceptible to climate hazards than repayment based on taxes, or there could be a confounding size effect as larger utilities might be more likely to issue revenue bonds than general obligation bonds. Prior work also found that many drinking water utility managers do not consider their systems to be at risk20. Looking at trends in population served and geographical region (Figs. S17 and S18), utilities serving larger population sizes and located in the West or Northwest disclosed climate risk more often than other utilities. Climate change mentions are becoming more common, with 30% of the utilities discussing climate change within their bond statements in 2023 and 2024 (Fig. S19), compared with only 9.1% of utilities in statements from before 2020.

Utilities that mention climate change in their municipal bond official statements have similar distributions of bond ratings (Fig. S20) and climate risk (Fig. S21) when compared with those that do not disclose such climate risk (i.e., there are no discernible effects of mentioning climate risk within an official statement on having a better bond rating). Similarly, there is no observed relationship between the drinking water bond ratings and climate risk disclosures (R2 = 0.12) and a slightly negative relationship between bond ratings and climate risk index values (R2 = −0.39). This aligns with other research findings that physical climate risks are largely not yet factored into municipal bond markets or ratings43,44.

A comparison of calculated climate risk index values and climate change awareness identified high risk utilities that might not be aware of their risks. This category of utilities are good candidates for policy interventions that educate systems about all potential links between climate hazards and utility functions20. A larger proportion of utilities classified as having high climate risk mentioned climate change in bond statements, compared to those with lower overall climate risk (Fig. S22). This could indicate current guidance and recommendations are successfully being communicated to the highest risk utilities. Similarly, a slightly higher percentage of utilities exposed to multiple types of climate hazards (27.3%) mentioned climate change in their bond statements, compared to only 22.9% of utilities that are not projected to exceed multiple climate thresholds (Fig. S23).

Of the 146 drinking water utilities within the 90th percentile of climate risk scores, a majority (65%, 95 utilities) did not mention climate change in their official bond statements. Most of these utilities are located in the South (the majority of which are located in Texas), Ohio Valley, or Midwest. Of the high-risk utilities that did mention climate change, most are located in the West (mainly California). About half of the most at-risk utilities in the Northeast mentioned climate change in their bond statements and half didn’t; there is no discernable difference in the characteristics of either group of utilities.

Along with overall mentions of climate change, the frequency with which the drinking water utilities mentioned specific hazards (drought, flooding, wildfires, extreme heat, and sea level rise) within their bond statements was considered. Of the identified climate hazards, flooding risk was mentioned most frequently, followed by drought (Table S8). Some of the hazards were mentioned more frequently alongside mentions of climate change; most of the bonds that mentioned extreme heat and sea level rise also mentioned climate change (94.9% and 88.6%, respectfully) while only around half of the bonds that mentioned drought or flooding also mentioned climate change (Table S9). This could indicate that utilities perceive extreme heat and sea level risk as climate-related while drought and flooding are less climate-related. The utilities that mentioned drought and wildfires are projected to see larger changes in these hazards, indicating an alignment of risk perceptions and actual risk (Fig. S24). The opposite was observed for flooding and extreme heat (i.e., the systems that mentioned these hazards have lower projected changes in these hazards), indicating drinking water utilities might need more targeted guidance about whether and how extreme precipitation and extreme heat can affect their system’s reliability. There might be institutional understanding gaps about which hazards climate change will exacerbate and which of these pose the greatest risks to system reliability. Historical flood and drought may bring these more to mind than slower changes associated with increasing extreme heat.

The overall climate risk index captures the system’s risk while their bond official statement captures their risk awareness; combining both reveals which utilities are potential candidates for climate adaptation or resiliency planning assistance (Fig. 4). Utilities classified as Low Priority are those that have lower climate risk index values and mentioned climate change within their bond statements, indicating that they might be taking proactive actions. Those classified as High Priority have higher climate risk index values and did not mention climate change in their bond statements. The portion of analyzed utilities classified as High Priority systems (36%) reflects an important misalignment between risk awareness and risk disclosure. Many of the Low Priority utilities are suburban and in close proximity to others with the same classification (for instance, the suburbs around Nashville, TN and Chicago, IL), compared to the higher priority utilities. Many of the High Priority utilities serve smaller population sizes; the average population size served by a High Priority system is around 52,000, compared to 137,000 people served by a Low Priority system. A larger fraction of smaller systems is classified as High Priority systems (Fig. S25). This is notable, as smaller utilities have lower adaptive capacity21,22 and the analysis does not include even smaller utilities (those serving fewer than 10,000 customers). The utilities omitted from this analysis likely experience similar climate hazards to those included in the analysis that are geographically close to them, but more information is needed about their exposure and vulnerability. Omitting these utilities biases our findings toward larger systems, which may have more resources and are more often in urban areas. This bias may mask additional risk associated with small systems, which may have fewer resources and be found disproportionately in rural areas.

Validating the results of this work is challenging, as utilities will likely not experience the full effects of climate change hazards for multiple decades. However, recent extreme weather events that have disrupted drinking water utility operations and caused financial losses can provide context to the identified classifications. For instance, in 2022, a flooding event coupled with existing system vulnerabilities left 180,000 residents in Jackson, MI without drinking water45. This work classifies Jackson, MI as a High Priority system.

US drinking water utilities are at risk from climate change, regardless of location, size, and source water, and utilities with higher climate risk scores serve around 67 million customers. While the climate risk index was developed using a sample of only 1455 municipal drinking water utilities, the simplicity of the model and accessibility of input data allows any US drinking water utility to calculate its own climate risk and compare it to other utilities. Drinking water utility managers should gather their own system’s data for the indicators from Table 1, assess climate projections for their system1, calculate their system’s climate risk index using Eqs. 1 and 2, and produce these assessments for the public. The developed index is intended to be useful in comparing climate risks facing utilities across the country, but the most accurate picture of actual risk requires in-depth climate impact assessments by individual systems.

A primary limitation of this work is that, due to data availability, it was developed for municipally-owned drinking water utilities serving more than 10,000 customers that had issued bonds recently. Many smaller systems likely have high climate risks and limited resources to access hazard projections necessary to plan for those risks. Future work should expand the climate risk index to include all drinking water utilities to enable prioritization of planning and financial assistance decisions. This would require public reporting of infrastructure health and financial data for all utilities. Additional studies could also further explore how to overcome institutional knowledge gaps about which climate hazards pose risks to system reliability and how these risks should be disclosed to the public. Although all contiguous US drinking water utilities are projected to experience changes in climate hazards by mid-century1, this work identifies a subset of High Priority utilities that are potentially misaligned in their technical risk and risk disclosure. These utilities, with high physical risk but no mention of this risk in their municipal bonds, should be prioritized for assistance in climate resilience and adaptation planning. For instance, this prioritization could be directly tied to funding instruments such as Drinking Water State Revolving Funds, which allow states to determine whether and how funding assistance is awarded. While many utilities in the Western US are seemingly aware of their climate risk, utilities in the South, Ohio Valley, Midwest, and to a lesser extent, Northeast, may not be as aware, based on information disclosed in their bond official statements.

While there are limitations to using municipal bond statements to assess climate risk disclosures (see “Limitations” section), the low fraction of utilities mentioning climate issues in bond disclosures (23%) suggests that there is likely a considerable amount of undisclosed financial liability associated with at-risk utilities. The municipal bonds analyzed in this study represent a total of $39.3 billion dollars of debt, most of which will mature within the next 20 years (Fig. S26). Of that total amount, $9.2 billion (23%) has been issued by utilities that we project to have high climate risk and potentially limited risk awareness. This large amount of capital is a financial liability for the issuers and owners of the municipal debt, as well as the community members dependent on the long-term reliability of these drinking water systems. This section offers practical suggestions for how drinking water utility managers, bond purchasers, and governmental agencies can utilize the climate risk index and the findings in this work to increase their climate preparedness.

Ensuring High Priority utilities get the assistance they need in preparing for climate change requires governmental support. Federal and state regulatory bodies should use these results to target climate adaptation planning resources and available funding. The 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law46 recommends states incorporate climate resilience criteria into Drinking Water State Revolving Fund programs47; the climate risk index could serve as one metric included in that prioritization. Government agencies must play a role in requiring climate adaptation and providing publicly-accessible, high-quality climate risk information. Utilities vary in awareness of how climate change might pose risks to the reliability of their systems20 and in their access to private-sector climate information services4, leading to information asymmetry. Dependence on the federal government as a backstop may lead to less local investment in resiliency measures, creating a moral hazard. Thus, it is critical that public sector agencies work to improve risk awareness of drinking water utilities and require adaptation planning.

At the state-level, the presented drinking water utility prioritization classifications reveal which states have the most at-risk utilities (Fig. 5). Texas, the state with the largest number of High Priority drinking water utilities (74) does not have a state-led climate adaptation plan48 and has a very low rate of climate change mentions within bond statements (5%). Requiring climate assessments for drinking water utilities at the state-level in Texas could improve climate risk awareness for those utilities. This finding highlights the importance of state-level policies to target gaps in climate planning and adaptation. The prioritization is also useful in assessing which utilities might require less attention. For instance, many utilities in Colorado have high climate hazard index values, but their low exposure and vulnerability index values combined with an awareness of and investment in climate resilience has resulted in extensive climate adaptation planning49,50.

Bond purchasers and ratings agencies are interested in the financial liability of the debt issued by the most at-risk utilities. While physical climate risks do not yet appear to be factored into bond ratings, the Low Priority utilities have a higher average bond value ($57.6 million) and longer time to maturity (16.4 years) compared to the High Priority utilities ($17.5 million value, 11.7 years). Municipal issuers with relatively lower-value and shorter time-to-maturity bonds could have limited access to credit, which further diminishes their ability to invest in resilience and adaptation measures. Utilities omitted from this analysis because they have not issued a bond in the past 10 years also have a limited ability to invest in large capital projects, highlighting another layer of financial inequalities. Climate risk is more relevant to longer-term municipal bonds, as these bonds will mature closer to when the climate hazards are projected to be experienced. This complements other research findings that long-term municipal bonds are more affected by climate risk compared to short-term bonds38,44,51.

The total amount of bonds held by High Priority drinking water utilities (Table S10) can offer insights into the total value of risk, though the amounts presented in this work only reflect the most recent bond issuances, not the total amount of issued debt. Six states (Michigan, Illinois, California, Massachusetts, Virginia, and Texas) have High Priority municipal drinking water utilities with total recent bond debt around or above $500 million dollars and an average bond maturity of over 10 years (Fig. 6); the purchasers of these municipal bonds might not be aware of the risks facing these drinking water utilities. Ratings agencies should consider adjusting ratings to reflect climate risk, even for short-term issuances. To more accurately quantify the value of risk facing utilities, the Environmental Protection Agency could require utility managers to estimate capital improvements needed to address future climate hazards within the next Drinking Water Infrastructure Needs Survey and Assessment52.

The developed drinking water utility climate risk index is useful for multiple stakeholders, including utility customers, bond purchasers, and regulatory agencies. It provides drinking water utilities with a better understanding of the projected future risk they face and allows them to compare their risk with other utilities serving different population sizes, using different source waters, and located in different regions. Utilities can use this information for planning and decision-making. This climate risk index also allows for more accurate climate risk disclosures, especially in the municipal bond market. Further, the proposed classifications identify which utilities should be prioritized when government agencies provide climate resilience planning and assistance; these utilities are candidates for immediate federal or state support for climate adaptation.

A dataset of mid-century climate change projections and hazard index values for 42,786 drinking water utilities across the contiguous US was used as the core dataset for this analysis1. This dataset was created using a multi-hazard approach, accounting for changes in extreme heat, extreme precipitation, freeze-thaw cycles, sea level rise, wildfires, and water supply stress, as well as gradual changes in average temperature and precipitation (captured through the proxy of utility energy demand), and drew on climate projections from the U.S. Government’s Climate Mapping for Resilience and Adaptation tool53 and the Climate Risk and Resilience Portal (ClimRR) dataset54. The mid-century, Relative Concentration Pathway 4.5 climate emission scenario was used and both sets of projections were derived from Localized Constructed Analogs (LOCA) downscaled climate model ensembles55. Existing research analyzing multi-hazard climate risks to drinking water systems outside the US combines hazards with information about utility system infrastructure56. In this work, we link service area boundaries for all US community water systems57 and system information from the Safe Drinking Water Information System database (SDWIS) for all utilities using Public Water System Identification Numbers. Public water systems are required to annually report water quality violation and enforcement information, as well as facility and infrastructure information to SDWIS58. The SDWIS database was further used to compile information about populations served, the number of service connections, and the length and duration of water quality violations (captured through the Drinking Water Non-Compliance Score). Added context about the utility’s financial, environmental, and demographic conditions were acquired from the Municipal Drinking Water Database (MDWD)59. This dataset contains demographic information, details about the municipal government structure, and financial measures as reported in the Government Finance Database60. The MDWD was used for data about municipal employees, the age of infrastructure, and the prevalence of poverty rates within the utility’s customer base.

While the MDWD includes financial metrics about the overall municipality linked to the drinking water utility, it does not include direct measures of a utility’s financial health or service rates. The Electronic Municipal Market Access (EMMA) database was used to extract water utility financial information from municipal bond official statements for each municipal drinking water system. Many municipal drinking water utilities use municipal bonds to finance capital improvement projects35,36, and bond statements can offer information about current utility financial and operational weaknesses. Official bond statements are disclosure documents published by municipal issuers that list information about the bond offering, including operating expenses and revenue (including service rates), other financial information, and bond ratings61. Issued municipal bonds are given ratings by external ratings agencies using holistic and case-based analysis, including information from official statements, that reflects a rating agency’s opinions on the bond’s default risk62. Municipal bond official statements have previously been used to collect information about drinking water utility customers and water rates63. We conducted searches for each municipal drinking water system within EMMA and extracted the most recent bond official statement issued by that utility or its associated municipality over the past 10 years. In addition to providing information about utility operating ratios, bond rating, and service costs, the bonds were also used to provide insights into climate risk awareness. This is discussed in the Using Municipal Bond Climate Risk Disclosures to Identify Gaps in Water Utility Climate Risk Preparedness section.

Evaluated drinking water utility systems

We evaluate 1455 of the more than 50,000 community drinking water utilities in the contiguous US. The main data limitation was the use of data from the MDWD, which includes only drinking water utilities serving more than 10,000 people (2219 utilities). Of those utilities, only 1609 were linked to municipalities that issued bonds in the last 10 years. Of the analyzed 1609 utilities, some were missing data (reported as NA) for one or more of the nine exposure and vulnerability indicators needed to create the indices. Some of these NA values were able to be replaced with data from the MDWD or median values, so the final dataset contains 1455 utilities. The indicator with the largest portion of missing data was utility service costs; these were extracted from bond statements and not every utility included service rates. These missing values were replaced with median regional service costs. Omitting this indicator was assessed in the sensitivity analysis. See SI Fig. S1 for details of the dataset restrictions and Table S1 for more details about how the treatment of missing values. Drinking water utilities specifically mentioned in this article were contacted and none provided comments.

The analyzed sample of utilities serves a combined 113.7 million people, or 33% of the total US population. See SI Figs. S2–S4 for details about population served, source water supply, location, and projected climate hazard index values for the utilities included in the sample. In addition to omitting smaller drinking water utilities in the US, this sample has a smaller proportion of utilities served by groundwater and a much larger proportion served by surface water. In terms of regional representation, the sample overrepresents utilities located in the Ohio Valley and Upper Midwest and underrepresents utilities in the Northern Rockies and Plains, Southeast, and Southwest; regions were designated using the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Regions (Fig. S5)64. The states with the largest number of utilities included in the sample are Texas, Illinois, Massachusetts, and California (Fig. S6). See SI Table S3 for more details comparing the sample with all drinking water utilities. Despite the limitations imposed by the availability of data in national datasets, the underlying model structure was designed so that individual utilities can use their own system’s data to determine a climate risk score for comparison.

Looking at the municipal bond data, this sample of 1455 utilities has bonds with an average maturity date of 2037, an average issuance of $25.9 million dollars, and an average rating of Aa2/AA/AA (Table S4). Thirty-six percent of the bonds were issued directly by a drinking water utility, while the rest were issued by a municipality that oversees the water utility as a business-type activity. Most of the analyzed bonds were issued in the past 5 years and are general obligation bonds (Fig. S7), in which the issuer guarantees repayment using government taxation power. Bonds issued directly by the water utility are more likely to be revenue bonds that guarantee repayment based on income from service rates.

Climate vulnerability index development

Indicators included in the vulnerability index (Fig. 7) were chosen to capture financial and physical utility system characteristics that affect its propensity to be adversely affected by climate change. Financial dimensions of vulnerability capture the ability of a utility to pay for treatment and delivery of clean water and maintain its fiscal health into the future26, as well as the socioeconomics of the utility customer base, which may affect its ability to fund and maintain system improvements through rate increases. Physical utility system characteristics, or the utility’s infrastructure health, are those that make it potentially vulnerable to the climate hazards identified in the combined hazard index2,3,25 and those that affect the reliability of the utility’s infrastructure assets. The intersection of physical and financial aspects affects the ability of the utility to invest in repairs or prevent infrastructure failure.

Three factors are included as indicators of utility system financial health: utility operating ratio, municipal bond rating, and percentage of served population below the poverty line. A utility operating ratio, or the ratio of operating revenues to operating expenses, is used in assessments of drinking water financial capability and capacity because they capture a utility’s cost recovery. Ratios greater than or equal to one indicate the utility can cover expenses through revenue sources26,65.

Bond ratings are also included as an indicator as they measure perceived risks of a utility’s creditworthiness, or the reliability a system can repay debt. Most utility infrastructure financing relies on the bond market and a change in rating can signal management or financial issues facing a utility35,63,65. The nomenclature of ratings and results vary slightly across rating agencies but take the form of very highly rated bonds with the lowest risk (e.g., AAA) to bonds with the highest risk of default (e.g., C), see Table S2. Lower municipal bond ratings can affect borrowing costs, limiting capital investment programs63. While bond ratings are not commonly included in drinking water vulnerability assessment due to data limitations, they have been used in other analyses of utility financial health63.

Poverty rates are an important inclusion in social vulnerability indices66 and previous assessments of drinking water-specific vulnerability identified the influence of a utility’s social vulnerability, captured through poverty prevalence, on the utility’s financial vulnerability25,26. Utilities with high populations served below the poverty line have challenges raising rates to increase revenue without causing affordability issues or increasing numbers of delinquent accounts67.

Physical dimensions of water utility vulnerability capture the ability of a utility’s infrastructure system to maintain service given changes in severity, frequency, or duration of climate hazards. The health of a utility’s physical system depends on asset conditions; infrastructure in poorer conditions is more likely to be damaged when exposed to hazards. Age of the infrastructure system is used to capture infrastructure condition, as older infrastructure is closer to its end-of-life and is more likely to be compromised by climate hazards68. Exact ages for different infrastructure components are not commonly accessible, so median housing age in the utility service area is used as a proxy for infrastructure health. Comparing median housing age data to pipe age data69 for a subset of the data shows a correlation (R2 = 0.63), with the housing age about 4 years older than the pipe age, on average. A similar validation was used and found by Hughes25.

Another aspect of a utility’s physical system health is how well it meets drinking water quality standards. Complying with water quality regulation violations is an important performance outcome for utilities26, and violations can reveal underlying limitations in a system’s ability to properly treat drinking water. From a utility management perspective, violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act reflect existing operational vulnerabilities. Violations can be health-based, revealing exceedances of maximum contaminant levels for contaminants or failure to meet treatment technique requirements, or non-health-based, revealing failures in reporting or public notification). While the health-based violations reveal the largest vulnerabilities in a system’s ability to produce safe water, non-health-violations are also important inclusions in drinking water vulnerability assessments26 because they may indicate administrative capacity limitations. The Drinking Water Non-Compliance Score is included as an indicator because it accounts for the severity and duration of both health and non-health water quality violations70. This indicator is used to capture the challenges a system has complying with water quality regulations; higher scores indicate more challenges faced by the utility71. The two physical system health indicators, Drinking Water Non-Compliance Score and infrastructure age, were averaged to create one physical system indicator, that was then combined with equal weighting with the financial health indicator for the vulnerability index.

Climate exposure index development

Climate exposure is defined from the perspective of the water utility; it is the people and assets of the water utility that could be negatively affected by climate hazards2,3. A utility is considered more exposed to climate change if it has more assets on a per capita basis (i.e., a utility has more exposed assets when delivering water to the same number of people). The indicators included in the exposure index (Fig. 8) capture the different facets of a utility’s assets: infrastructure, workforce, and finances.

The infrastructure assets the utility owns include the distribution system, pump stations, treatment plants, and any storage facilities. While utilities have extensive information on their facilities, this information is not gathered in any public centralized database for all US utilities. Limited information, including the number of treatment plants and the number of service connections are available from SDWIS. The number of service connections per capita and the service area per capita, considered together, are used as a proxy for total exposed assets (i.e., how much more infrastructure the system maintains on a per capita basis). As the size of the distribution system affects economies of scale for the utility72,73, the service area per capita is used to capture the relative length and complexity of the utility’s infrastructure. The service connections per capita captures the relative exposure of the utility’s service lines27. The Climate Vulnerability Index, a measure that characterizes vulnerability and exposure generally, uses a similar per capita for lane miles to capture transportation infrastructure exposure74. There are limitations to using this proxy measure for total exposed assets, namely that the exact location and size of utility infrastructure assets affect exposure as well (i.e., a large treatment plant in a flood zone is more exposed than a smaller treatment plant outside a flood zone). This index is intended to provide insights for the entire country, but individual utilities should use more detailed information about their facilities to properly assess their individual exposure. Furthermore, while source water supplies can affect a utility’s exposure to different climate hazards75,76, this index does not distinguish between surface water and groundwater systems. Differences in source water were considered in analyzing the trends in climate risk index values.

Also included in this exposure index are utility personnel; these personnel are susceptible to negative consequences of extreme climate hazards like heat waves and flooding events. Drinking water utilities have identified their employees as exposed to these climate hazards18. The number of employees per capita was used because a utility has increased workforce exposure if it has more employees per capita. As each utility’s total personnel is not publicly available, the number of municipal employees per capita was used as a proxy. Comparing the number of municipal full-time employees to drinking water utility full time employees for a subset of Wisconsin utilities69, there was a strong correlation (R2 = 0.85) between the values, with the overall municipality having about 20 times as many employees as the utility, on average.

Finally, the utility’s financial exposure can be captured in the cost of delivering a set amount of water per household. Utilities generate revenue through service rate charges and the affordability of these rates has consequences for how much revenue the utility earns65. Comparing household service charges reveals how financially exposed a utility is, were a climate hazard to interrupt service or reduce a customer’s ability to pay their water bills. The household annual cost of service was calculated using water rates reported in utility bond official statements, assuming 2.65 people per household each consuming 50 gallons per day77.

Not included in this combined exposure index is the exposure of the customers the system serves. These customers are exposed to the effects of climate hazards on their drinking water utility, and they may experience negative effects of those climate hazards, depending upon the actions the utility takes to mitigate those effects. However, the scope of this work focuses on exposure of the water utility itself.

Combined climate risk index development

Composite indices for drinking water climate exposure and climate vulnerability were combined with the previously developed drinking water climate hazard index database1. The composite index approach captures multidimensional facets and assumes each indicator component has a distinct influence on the combined index78. The different indicators \(({X}_{i})\) were normalized (scale 0 to 1) using a min-max normalization79,80. This approach is minimizes the effects of extreme values32,79, and has been used in other drinking water and climate indices81,82, see Eq. 1.

$${X}_{(V,E),\,i}=\frac{x-\min \left(x\right)}{\max \left(x\right)-{\mathrm{min}}\left(x\right)}$$

(1)

The combined exposure and vulnerability indexes were then aggregated and divided by their number of components30, see Eq. 2. The indicators were all weighted equally31,83, which is the best choice when there is a lack of theoretical justification for a different weighting scheme31,83. Other drinking water and climate risk indices also used this weighting scheme25,32. The final combined climate risk index was calculated using the product of the exposure and vulnerability indices, along with the hazard index1, see Eq. 2. This formulation follows IPCC frameworks for modeling climate risk2,3 and has been used in other approaches that developed separate hazard, exposure, and vulnerability indices, assigned equal weights, and then multiplied them together for a composite index of climate risk32.

$${Risk}=\sum \frac{{X}_{H,\,i}\left(0,1\right)}{k}* \sum \frac{{X}_{E,\,i}\left(0,1\right)}{k}* \sum \frac{{X}_{V,\,i}\left(0,1\right)}{k}$$

Sensitivity analysis

Composite indices are useful for modeling multidimensional system properties that are not directly measurable, but decisions about their construction, including which indicators to include and how they are combined, affect whether the results are meaningful83,84,85.

The min-max method used to normalize the indictors reduces the effects of outliers because all indicators have identical ranges32,79. The linear aggregation method used to combine the indicators assumes compensation, or that one indicator’s lower can be compensated by another’s higher value31,86. An important consideration when constructing composite indices is whether the individual indicators are related, as the assumption is each indicator has a distinct effect. Different aspects of utility vulnerability are expected to be related26, and socially vulnerable communities experience increased risks of drinking water quality violations87. Indicators were chosen to capture different facets of vulnerability and exposure, and indicator collinearity was tested to assess whether the individual indicators are independent of one another78. Low collinearity was observed between the indicators (SI Tables S5 and S6), suggesting the selected indicators represent different aspects of exposure and vulnerability, and that they can be used together.

The climate risk index was developed from the hazard, exposure, and vulnerability indices, including a total of 16 indicators. Correlation analyses were performed to examine the relationships between each indicator component and the composite index (SI Table S7). The overall vulnerability index and exposure index are moderately correlated with the risk index (R2 = 0.75 and R2 = 0.62, respectively) while the hazard index is not correlated (R2 = 0.20). Infrastructure age (captured by the proxy of median housing age) is the individual indicator with the strongest correlation with the risk index (R2 = 0.66). The exposure, vulnerability, and hazard indices have low multicollinearity between themselves, indicating each is contributing a unique aspect to the overall climate risk index.

The sensitivity of the climate risk index to the included indicators can be analyzed by assessing how results change when certain indicators are omitted. Indicators from each of the vulnerability, exposure, and hazard indices were omitted (Infrastructure Age, Service Costs, and Sea Level Rise) to analyze how the climate risk index changed. Infrastructure age was chosen because while median housing age has been used as a proxy for infrastructure age in other work25, a utility’s pipes might be considerably older or younger than the housing stock and age itself is only an indirect measure of asset health. Service costs were chosen because this indicator had the most missing data (median service costs within a NOAA Region were used instead). Sea level rise was chosen for the hazard index because of its difficulty to predict88 and because it only affects coastal utilities (an uneven regional distribution).

Using municipal bond climate risk disclosures to identify gaps in water utility climate risk preparedness

The developed water utility climate risk index captures the determinants of risk (hazard, exposure, and vulnerability) but does not include any utility actions aimed at addressing climate change. The actions a system takes in response to climate change are also important drivers of overall risk89. While research has found a lack of climate adaptation planning occurring at drinking water utilities20, climate risk disclosures from bond official statements offer important insights about which utilities have acknowledged potential risks of climate change. Issued municipal bonds are given ratings by external ratings agencies using holistic and case-based analysis, including information from official statements, that reflects a rating agency’s opinions on the bond’s default risk62. Rating agencies have begun to consider physical climate risks to municipal debt issuers when assigning bond ratings90,91, making bond official statements an important source of information for climate risk disclosures. S&P Global rates water and sewer utilities as having strong identification of operation risks if “climate risk assessment is incorporated into planning and operations as a potential risk to the system.”90 Utilities may score as vulnerable if they have not explicitly addressed climate risk either in plans or operations. There are mixed conclusions about whether physical climate risk is actually linked to lower bond ratings. Some research has found links between increased exposure to certain climate hazards (like sea level rise) and lower municipal bond ratings and higher borrowing costs38,44,51. Research focused on municipal water bonds found that specific hazards like droughts and floods were factored into bond markets37. Other work has found that the full scope of physical climate hazard risk has not yet been priced into the municipal market43. Regardless, professional organizations recommend that water utilities provide information to bond rating agencies about climate risk and adaptation planning92, making bond official statements a useful source of information about their perceptions of climate risk.

In addition to using municipal bond official statements to extract drinking water utility financial information (described previously), these statements were also searched for mentions of climate change and resilience, as well as mentions of specific climate hazards, including drought, flood, wildfire, heat, and sea level rise. Given that rating agencies explicitly consider physical climate risks when assessing their ratings90,91, these mentions were assumed to capture utility awareness of and possible responses to climate change. While the lack of mentions was assumed to indicate less awareness or concern from the utility about climate risk, utilities might have other reasons for not explicitly using the term climate change, which are discussed further in the Limitations section. The climate risk awareness identified in the bond official statements was also compared to and combined with the calculated climate risk index scores for each utility to reveal which utilities might be uninformed about their future climate risk and which might need targeted climate adaptation assistance.

Limitations

A primary limitation is the drinking water utility sample analyzed in this work; focusing on municipal utilities that serve more than 10,000 customers and have issued a municipal bond in the past 10 years limits the applicability of the complete model to utilities serving smaller population sizes. The larger the system, the greater its adaptive capacity, or ability to respond to changes21,22. While utilities serving fewer than 10,000 customers might have lower exposure (i.e., fewer assets and smaller systems), these systems likely have much higher existing vulnerabilities (i.e., more susceptible to disruptions) because of lower adaptive capacity. Smaller utilities have more drinking water quality violations and less capacity to comply with regulations93. Omitting smaller systems from this analysis likely underestimates the number of systems nationwide that have higher climate risks and that should be prioritized for adaptation assistance. Additional analyses will be needed to prioritize assistance among these smaller systems.

Many smaller systems are groundwater systems, and an additional limitation of this work is that the index does not distinguish between surface water and groundwater systems. Source water supply type can affect exposure to different climate hazards, but there is limited work quantifying how climate hazards affect the operations and infrastructure of groundwater systems differently from surface water systems. Future work could model how certain climate hazards damage infrastructure and disrupt operations differently. Segmenting the sample to drinking water utilities that have recently issued bonds also introduces biases, as these omitted utilities might have decided against bond issuance because of an underlying financial or operational vulnerability. A larger portion of the utilities that have not issued bonds (1.5%) are in the 98th percentile for WQ non-compliance scores than the utilities that have issued bonds (0.5%).

There are also limitations associated with using mentions of climate change within municipal bonds to identify risk awareness and preparedness. “Climate change” as a term has a range of associated political framings and misunderstandings94, which influence use of the term. Political affiliations and personal experiences of extreme weather affect perceptions of climate risk95,96,97 and there are regional differences in public understanding of whether global climate change is happening and whether it could harm people in the US98,99. Given these differences, some municipalities and utilities might be hesitant to explicitly use the term in their bond official statements even while rating agencies are requiring a consideration of these physical climate risks when assigning ratings90,91. Lastly, many ratings agencies are focused on short-term creditworthiness and utilities might have disclosed longer-term climate risks or concerns directly to ratings agencies and not explicitly mentioned them in official statements. Searching the bond statements for explicit mentions of certain climate-related hazards (drought, flooding, heat, sea level rise) alongside explicit mentions of climate change revealed only a small fraction of the bonds that mentioned climate change didn’t mention one of the hazards (3.2%) and around a third (27.3%) of those that mentioned a hazard didn’t mention of climate change.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43247-025-03044-z/MediaObjects/43247_2025_3044_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2026-01-26 05:59:21.359257

Freetown, 26 January 2026: The Salone Off-Grid Renewable Energy Acceleration (SOGREA) Initiative today launched its first Call for Pre-Qualification Applications, inviting private sector companies to develop and upgrade green mini-grids in rural communities across Sierra Leone. The call marks a major step forward in accelerating universal energy access while unlocking new opportunities for renewable energy investors and developers.

Delivered in partnership with the Government of Sierra Leone, SOGREA aims to crowd in private capital to expand clean, reliable electricity to underserved communities, strengthening local economies and supporting climate-resilient development. The announcement was made during a live-streamed event hosted by Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL) marking the International Day of Clean Energy.

The SOGREA is funded by the European Union and the Government of Denmark and totals EUR 24 million in catalytic funding. The three-year programme is designed to reduce investment risk and boost the commercial viability of rural electrification in Sierra Leone. The initiative provides performance-based capital support to cover a portion of upfront development costs for green mini-grids, with payments released against independently verified milestones.

By bridging the gap between the true cost of electricity supply and what rural households and businesses can afford, SOGREA helps lower tariffs while expanding connections. The approach builds on Sierra Leone’s recent mini-grid sector reforms, including progressive regulation and transparent tariff-setting mechanisms that provide long-term certainty for investors.

The Call for Pre-Qualification Applications is open to eligible applicants, who are licensed, for-profit mini-grid developers registered to operate in Sierra Leone, with proven experience operating green mini-grids in Sub-Saharan Africa, the capacity to deliver new projects within 12 months, smart-meter integration capability, compliance with UEF requirements and at least 30% female representation across administrative and operational roles. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis, with Pre-Qualification submissions closing on 9 March 2026. Successfully pre-qualified companies will be invited to submit site-specific proposals for development of new or upgrade of already existing green mini-grid projects. Funding decisions will be made on a first-come, first-served basis until available resources are fully allocated.

This performance-based capital support reflects the EU and Denmark’s commitment to advancing clean energy access, sustainable investment and climate action in Africa. The initiative is implemented by UNOPS, with its host entity Sustainable Energy for All, in close partnership with the Government of Sierra Leone.

Washington’s Department of Commerce, which works on state energy policy, has offered up state employees to help the federal Bonneville Power Administration process its backlog of renewable energy projects — though it remains uncertain whether the agency will accept the offer. Bonneville, which owns 75% of the Northwest’s power grid, must sign off before wind and solar developers who wish to connect to its grid can break ground.

Meanwhile, four state agencies have recommended that Washington’s Legislature provide incentives for utilities to upgrade transmission lines, plan out “microgrid” energy projects that don’t need to connect to Bonneville’s power lines and create a new state agency that would plan and potentially pay for major new transmission corridors. A bill to create such an authority had a hearing on Jan 21.

The Commerce Department, Department of Ecology, Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council and Utilities and Transportation Commission are also meeting regularly to diagnose what’s holding up more than a dozen high-priority wind, solar and energy storage projects that could make an outsize difference.

Joe Nguyễn, who recently stepped down as the state’s commerce director, said there’s added urgency to get the work done since OPB and ProPublica last year showed that other states like Iowa and Texas have made far more progress than Washington.

“We’re forcing these tough conversations that have never been done before,” Nguyễn, a former state senator who helped pass Washington’s law setting a deadline to go carbon-free, said during a recent public forum. He spoke at the panel just before leaving the state Commerce Department in January to take a job as head of the Seattle Chamber of Commerce.

“We probably have to modify some policies, we’re going to amend some things, we have to make strategic investments, but I think that’s a good thing,” Nguyễn said at the forum. “I’m not daunted by the task.”

Under Bonneville, projects face longer odds of successfully connecting to the electrical grid than anywhere else in the country, OPB and ProPublica found.

The federal agency weighs how many new transmission lines and substations will be needed to carry the added load, and it has historically been slow to pay for such upgrades, renewable energy advocates have said. Often the burden falls on the builders of the wind and solar projects.

Washington and Oregon lawmakers failed to account for this obstacle when they required electric utilities to phase out fossil fuels. Combined with rapid growth in electricity demand from new data centers powering artificial intelligence, studies now predict rolling blackouts in the Pacific Northwest within the next five years.

Inspired by OPB and ProPublica’s reporting, the Seattle nonprofit Clean & Prosperous published a report this month identifying energy high-potential projects that could generate enough power for 7 million homes and contribute $195 billion to the state’s economy if built by 2030. Kevin Tempest, research director for Clean & Prosperous, said the fact that Washington ranked 50th nationally for green power growth was poorly understood until the recent news coverage.

“I don’t think that we were aware of just how stark it was,” said Tempest, whose group advocates for “entrepreneurial approaches” to eliminating fossil fuels and promoting economic growth. “So that really opened our eyes and, I think, accelerated a lot of conversations.”

Separately, in Oregon, Gov. Tina Kotek recently signed two executive orders intended to speed up the construction of energy projects. Kotek, too, said the news reports helped galvanize policymakers.

Nguyễn told OPB and ProPublica their reporting made him realize “the people who talk about clean energy are not actually doing it.” But now, he said, “Washington state’s desperately trying.”

“Things That We Can Control”

Most of the high-priority projects identified by the state and by Clean & Prosperous are waiting for approval to connect to Bonneville’s substations and transmission lines so that developers move toward construction.

The federal agency’s review process historically has been sluggish and often puts the onus on a single energy developer to invest tens of millions of dollars in upgrades or else wait until another developer comes along to shoulder some of the cost. In addition, state officials in Oregon and Washington must also sign off on the location planned for new power lines and wind or solar farms — a process with its own bottlenecks.

“There are a myriad of reasons why projects are not happening,” Tempest said. “It’s different for each case.”

But he said across all projects, Bonneville is “a common feature for some of the new facilities not breaking ground.”

Bonneville spokesperson Kevin Wingert said in an email that the agency has implemented several reforms over the past year to enable faster connections to its grid. For example, the agency began studying clusters of projects collectively, based on their readiness, and expects its first study to be done at the end of the month.

Wingert said the agency has identified 7 gigawatts worth of projects — roughly the capacity of Grand Coulee hydroelectric dam, Washington’s largest power plant — that it says it’s on pace to have online within five years. It expects to have more than double that amount connected and energized by 2035.

In the near term, the state is focusing on grid improvements to the transmission system it can make without Bonneville, according to Casey Sixkiller, director of the Washington Department of Ecology.

He said Washington will work to help projects connect to some part of the roughly 25% of the region’s grid that is operated by investor-owned and public utilities.

“I think the point is for us in Washington trying to find, as we wait for BPA, who’s years behind, what are the other things that we can control that we should be prioritizing and trying to move forward?” Sixkiller said.

Kurt Beckett, chair of Washington’s Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council, which issues site permits for energy projects, said localized improvements that can be made outside of Bonneville’s grid are cheaper and will have tangible, immediate results. They also have the benefit of “buying time for the bigger, harder upgrades that Bonneville’s in charge of.”

Bonneville says it plans to spend $5 billion on nearly two dozen transmission line and substation improvements, but many of those projects are years away with no firm deadline.

What’s within Washington’s control in the near term is to streamline state permitting of projects that have received or don’t need Bonneville’s approval.

The need was highlighted by the passage last year of President Donald Trump’s so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which will phase out key federal energy tax credits and sets a July 4 deadline for projects to break ground. The credits cover as much as 50% of construction costs for most solar and wind farms.

More than 200 wind, solar and battery storage projects theoretically could meet the deadline “should development processes improve,” Clean & Prosperous concluded in its report. The group said it was a reference to both Bonneville’s role and the state’s.

Sixkiller said Washington leaders are prioritizing a smaller list of 19 proposed projects they think have the best chance of beating the July deadline. In some cases, the developers already have a connection agreement with Bonneville in place. In two, the projects will connect to power lines run by a utility.

An Offer of Help

In addition to actions taken by state agencies, Washington lawmakers are considering a bill that would ease the state’s reliance on Bonneville to build new power lines. That would come in the form of a state transmission authority — a new state agency in charge of planning transmission routes, acquiring land and working with developers to build new lines. It could also eventually pay for projects. Washington lawmakers are calling for a report on what financing tools, such as the ability to issue bonds, the new transmission authority will need.

The bill has support from environmental groups, labor unions and energy developers. However, lobbyists for large industrial energy consumers and for Bonneville’s public utility customers opposed the bill, saying they supported the intention to build more transmission but wanted the state to focus on relaxing its permitting requirements to let utilities solve the problem.

For the time being, state officials told OPB and ProPublica they are working to shore up Bonneville’s ability to do the work that the region’s grid needs.

Beckett said he hopes the state can help Bonneville with the agency’s self-imposed goal of cutting the average time a project spends in the queue from 15 years down to five or six.

Agencies have offered Bonneville some of their staff to help its analysts complete grid connection studies, which Washington officials said makes sense because the state in many cases is already reviewing the same projects that are awaiting the federal agency’s permission to connect.

Bonneville hasn’t said yes yet. Wingert said Bonneville’s interconnection studies have “numerous technical and regulatory requirements” that make them “inappropriate or infeasible” for the state to conduct on BPA’s behalf.

But, he said, the agency was open to working with the state to speed projects up at some point.

“There may be opportunities to coordinate efficiencies between state policies and BPA’s interconnection processes in the future,” Wingert said.

Nguyễn said that technical requirements shouldn’t keep Bonneville from accepting the state’s help in vetting projects or analyzing their impact on the grid, and that state employees could help with the less technical aspects of the report if needed.

“If you want us to bring you lunch so your analysts can go faster, we will do it,” he said. “That’s the level of seriousness I have about getting transmission built.”","https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/groundbreaking1-8-11-25-social_preview_maxWidth_3000_maxHeight_3000_ppi_72_embedColorProfile_true_quality_95.jpg?resize=2000,1050",N,,2026-01-26 05:59:15.961676

According to Data Center Watch, a project run by AI security company 10a labs, nearly 200 community groups are currently active and have blocked or delayed 20 data center projects representing $98 billion of potential investment between April and June 2025 alone.
The changes, which will take effect in 2027, are designed to protect household customers from costs associated with data center expansion.","With community opposition growing, data center backers are going on a full-scale public relations blitz. Around Christmas in Virginia, which boasts the highest concentration of data centers in the country, one advertisement seemed to air nonstop. “Virginia’s data centers are … investing billions in clean energy,” a voiceover intoned over sweeping shots of shiny solar panels. “Creating good-paying jobs” — cue men in yellow safety vests and hard hats — “and building a better energy future.”

The ad was sponsored by Virginia Connects, an industry-affiliated group that spent at least $700,000 on digital marketing in the state in fiscal year 2024. The spot emphasized that data centers are paying their own energy costs, framing this as a buffer that might help lower residential bills, and portrayed the facilities as engines of local job creation.

The reality is murkier. Although industry groups claim that each new data center creates “dozens to hundreds” of “high-wage, high-skill jobs,” some researchers say data centers generate far fewer jobs than other industries, such as manufacturing and warehousing. Greg LeRoy, the founder of the research and advocacy group Good Jobs First, said that in his first major study of data center jobs nine years ago, he found that developers pocketed well over a million dollars in state subsidies for every permanent job they created. With the rise of hyperscalers, LeRoy said, that number is “still very much in the ballpark.”

Other experts reflect that finding. A 2025 brief from University of Michigan researchers put it bluntly: “Data centers do not bring high-paying tech jobs to local communities.” A recent analysis from Food & Water Watch, a nonprofit tracking corporate overreach, found that in Virginia, the investment required to create a permanent data center job was nearly 100 times higher than what was required to create comparable jobs in other industries.

“Data centers are the extreme of hyper-capital intensity in manufacturing,” LeRoy said. “Once they’re built, the number of people monitoring them is really small.” Contractors may be called in if something breaks, and equipment is replaced every few years. “But that’s not permanent labor,” he said.

Jon Hukill, a spokesperson for the Data Center Coalition, the industry lobbying group that established Virginia Connects in 2024, said that the industry “is committed to paying its full cost of service for the energy it uses” and is trying to“meet this moment in a way that supports both data center development and an affordable, reliable electricity grid for all customers.” Nationally, Hukill said, the industry “supported 4.7 million jobs and contributed $162 billion in federal, state, and local taxes in 2023.”

Dozens of community groups across the country have mobilized against data center buildout, citing fears that the facilities will drain water supplies, overwhelm electric grids, and pollute the air around them. According to Data Center Watch, a project run by AI security company 10a labs, nearly 200 community groups are currently active and have blocked or delayed 20 data center projects representing $98 billion of potential investment between April and June 2025 alone.

The backlash has exposed a growing image problem for the AI industry. “Too often, we’re portrayed as energy-hungry, water-intensive, and environmentally damaging,” data center marketer Steve Lim recently wrote. That narrative, he argued, “misrepresents our role in society and potentially hinders our ability to grow.” In response, the industry is stepping up its messaging.

Some developers, like Starwood Digital Ventures in Delaware, are turning to Facebook ads to make their case to residents. Its ads make the case that data center development might help keep property taxes low, bring jobs to Delaware, and protect the integrity of nearby wetlands. According to reporting from Spotlight Delaware, the company has also boasted that it will create three times as many jobs as it initially told local officials.

Nationally, Meta has spent months running TV spots showcasing data center work as a viable replacement for lost industrial and farming jobs. One advertisement spotlights the small city of Altoona, Iowa. “I grew up in Altoona, and I wanted my kids to be able to do the same,” a voice narrates over softly-lit scenes of small-town Americana: a Route 66 diner, a farm, and a water tower. “So, when work started to slow down, we looked for new opportunities … and we welcomed Meta, which opened a data center in our town. Now, we’re bringing jobs here — for us, and for our next generation.” The advertisement ends with a promise superimposed over images of a football game: “Meta is investing $600 billion in American infrastructure and jobs.”

In reality, Altoona’s data center is a hulking, windowless, warehouse complex that broke ground in 2013, long before the current data center boom. Altoona is not quite the beleaguered farm town Meta’s advertisements portray but a suburb of 19,000, roughly 16 minutes from downtown Des Moines, the most populous city in Iowa. Meta says it has supported “400+ operational jobs” in Altoona. In comparison, the local casino employs nearly 1,000 residents, according to the local economic development agency.

Ultimately, those details may not matter much to the ad’s intended audience. As Politico reported, the advertisement may have been targeted at policymakers on the coasts more than the residents of towns like Altoona. Meta has spent at least $5 million airing the spot in places like Sacramento and Washington, D.C.

The community backlash has also made data centers a political flashpoint. In Virginia, Abigail Spanberger won November’s gubernatorial election in part on promises to regulate the industry and make developers pay their “fair share” of the electricity they use. State lawmakers also considered 30 bills attempting to regulate data centers. In response to concerns about rising electricity prices, Virginia regulators approved a new rate structure for AI data centers and other large electricity users. The changes, which will take effect in 2027, are designed to protect household customers from costs associated with data center expansion.

These developments may only encourage companies to spend more on image-building. In Virginia’s Data Center Alley, the ads show no sign of stopping. Elena Schlossberg, an anti-data-center activist based in Prince William County, says her mailbox has been flooded with fliers from Virginia Connects for the past eight months.

The promises of lower electric bills, good jobs, and climate responsibility, she said, remind her of cigarette ads she saw decades ago touting the health benefits of smoking. But Schlossberg isn’t sure the marketing’s going to work. One recent poll showed that 73 percent of Virginians blame data centers for their rising electricity costs.

“There’s no putting the toothpaste back in the tube,” she said. “People already know we’re still covering their costs. People know that.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/data-center-jobs-pr.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2026-01-26 08:59:35.288285

If a future administration wants to restore expansive tax credits for wind and solar energy, that president will have to push Congress to pass new climate legislation.

Trump’s climate blitzkrieg may be the starkest example yet of the benefits and drawbacks of that model.","This story was first published by Grist.

One year ago, with one of the first strokes of his presidential Sharpie, President Donald Trump signed an executive order declaring a ​“national energy emergency,” making good on a campaign promise to ​“drill, baby, drill.” It was the first of many such orders, signaling that the championing of fossil fuels would be a cornerstone of the new administration: A subsequent order pledged to revitalize America’s waning coal industry, eliminate subsidies for electric vehicles approved by Congress under former President Joe Biden, and loosen regulations for domestic producers of fossil fuels. Yet another executive order withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, the nearly unanimously adopted international treaty that coordinates the global fight against climate change. He resumed liquefied natural gas permitting paused by his predecessor and reopened United States coastlines to drilling.

In the days following his inauguration, Trump killed a climate jobs training program, closed off millions of acres of federal water designated for offshore wind development, and scrubbed mentions of climate change from some federal agency websites. To many observers, it looked like the most comprehensive reorientation of the executive branch’s environmental and climate priorities in American history.

On paper, it certainly appears as though Trump has continued to make good on these early promises. He pushed Congress to pass the so-called Big Beautiful Bill, which phases out an extensive set of tax credits — for wind and solar energy, electric vehicles, and other decarbonization tools — that were responsible for much of the progress the U.S. was expected to make toward its Paris Agreement commitments. (That move has already led some companies to abandon new clean energy projects.) Trump’s attacks on the nation’s offshore wind industry, which he recently called ​“so pathetic and so bad,” have been unrelenting, culminating in a blanket ban on offshore leases last month. A few weeks ago, he upped the ante on his earlier withdrawal from the Paris Agreement by severing ties with the United Nations framework that facilitates international cooperation on matters of climate change, environmental health, and resilience — a treaty that was ratified unanimously by the U.S. Senate in 1992.

“It has been an extraordinarily destructive year,” said Rachel Cleetus, climate and energy policy director at the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists. It’s not hard to find specific moves that have already done tangible harm to the climate: The EPA, for instance, delayed a requirement that oil and gas operators reduce emissions of methane, an ultra-potent and fast-acting greenhouse gas, for a full year. The Interior Department announced a $625 million investment to ​“reinvigorate and expand America’s coal industry” and directed a costly Michigan coal plant on the verge of closure to stay open.

However, while these moves have been effective in sowing panic and uncertainty, their long-term effects on the country’s climate policy framework are far from certain. Indeed, only a small fraction of the climate damage threatened by Trump is truly permanent, experts told Grist. That’s not only because many of Trump’s moves may ultimately be ruled illegal — federal judges in Rhode Island, New York, and Virginia, for instance, allowed offshore wind farms in those states to resume construction just last week — but also because executive actions can be reversed by a future president. And the president has not shown much interest in passing energy- or climate-related legislation, a far more durable form of policymaking than executive decree. Despite claims to the contrary, Trump has signed fewer bills than any president since Dwight D. Eisenhower.

“He is not changing law,” said Elaine Kamarck, who worked in the Clinton administration and is the founding director of the Brookings Institution’s Center for Effective Public Management. ​“He is changing practice.”

Even something as unprecedented as the EPA’s moves to relinquish its own authority to regulate the emissions that affect human health — a responsibility that is a core tenet part of the agency’s mission and is therefore widely regarded as unlikely to hold up in court — could be unraveled by a future administration even if it’s ruled to be legal, though that process would take years.

“You can’t make up for the lost time, the increased emissions, and the extent that new areas are opened up for [fossil fuel] exploration,” said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. ​“But from a regulatory perspective, what this administration is doing to EPA and the other agencies are all executive actions that can be undone in the same way they were done.”

The major exception is the GOP’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA. If a future administration wants to restore expansive tax credits for wind and solar energy, that president will have to push Congress to pass new climate legislation. But the climate-relevant portions of OBBBA are noteworthy for being subtractive rather than additive — and are perhaps more accurately viewed as a representation of Trump’s quest to refute Biden’s legacy than as a desire to radically alter U.S. energy law. Indeed, the new law left in place the tax credits for other sources of carbon-free energy, including nuclear and geothermal — something that more moderate Republicans who do not share the president’s dismissal of climate science have been quick to note.

“We like to point out that the baseload clean energy credits were maintained,” said Luke Bolar, head of external affairs and communications at ClearPath, a think tank that develops conservative climate policies. Sean Casten, a Democratic U.S. representative from Illinois, said that the goal of the Biden-era climate legislation — ensuring that U.S. clean energy can be built in a cost-competitive way — has largely been achieved even if specific parts of the law have been repealed.

“Every single zero-carbon power source … is still cheaper on the margin than a fuel energy source,” he said.

The relative fragility of Trump’s assault on bedrock environmental and climate laws could be a product of the president’s prioritization of political dominance over lasting change, said Josh Freed, senior vice president for climate and energy at the think tank Third Way.

For example, the administration has taken steps to shield the American coal industry from the punishing blows of competition, environmental regulation, and the rising costs of mining. Trump has signed an executive order aimed at ​“reinvigorating America’s beautiful clean coal industry,” granted coal-fired power plants temporary exemptions from emissions limits, and ended a federal moratorium on coal leasing. But those interventions will do little in the long run to reverse a decline driven mainly by economics: The nation’s aging coal plants are becoming increasingly expensive to run while natural gas and solar energy have only gotten cheaper. And they certainly don’t help the president’s stated goal of reducing household energy costs.

To attempt to make sense of the president’s crusade to save coal is to assume there is a larger political strategy at play — which may not be the case, Freed said.

“There’s no reason to bring back coal other than to show that the administration can bring back coal,” he said. ​“It’s not like there’s this huge lobbying effort or donor base that will be of significant benefit to MAGA or Republicans if they do it.”

A style of governance motivated by political dominance is a good way to make headlines, but it’s not a particularly effective way to build a lasting legacy. Trump’s efforts to buoy coal may help the industry in the short term, but experts are broadly in agreement that coal can’t be ​“saved” without sustained support from the federal government. And an industry that can survive only with a coal-friendly Republican in the Oval Office isn’t exactly thriving.

“When you have to get the government to step in to put its thumb on the scale in order to help your industry,” Sean Feaster, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, told my colleagues earlier this week, ​“it’s a sign that you’re not particularly competitive, right?”

For decades now, the pendulum of U.S. climate policy has swung left and right, reflecting the priorities of the sitting president. Trump’s climate blitzkrieg may be the starkest example yet of the benefits and drawbacks of that model. But despite his best efforts to stand out from the pack, the president’s first year back in office fits a well-worn pattern. As a result, his victories may not last much longer than his presidency.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Trump-hand-with-Sharpie_Getty-Images.webp?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=80&w=1200&s=953dd3c9c80b54f8f6487f70729bfc17,N,,2026-01-26 04:58:44.052988

Fifteen years gets you to 2041, and who is footing the bill?” Bensusan noted that the technology risk seems significant, particularly for the AI-driven component of the rise in energy demand.
I have a 15-year PPA that’s $300 per MWh,’” Bensusan said, noting that technology risks apply also to energy generation, and that solar could become significantly cheaper and more reliable, particularly with battery storage over that time period.
“One thing that jumped out to me was the 15-year price certainty term that was mentioned in the statement of principles.
“This prescription for a 15-year term of price certainty could be attractive to developers and investors if the price is right.","The US Department of Energy and PJM’s own board put forward plans on the same day in mid-January to address the needs of the mid-Atlantic states where demand for power continues to rise along with rates and frustration.

The Department of Energy’s announcement, part of the administration’s plan to “Build Big Power Plants Again,” came with the announcement that an agreement between the region’s governors and the National Energy Dominance Council to bring $15 billion of baseload generation online while urging PJM, the largest US regional grid interconnection, to focus on “reliable” generation.

Natural gas accounts for about 45 percent of the PJM electricity mix, spanning across 13 states, followed by nuclear, although about 2.8GW of the new 3GW generation added in 2025 came from solar.

The agreement itself does not provide details about how the goals will be pursued, but a number of announcements asserted that it will serve to “accelerate development of reliable power generation by providing 15-year revenue certainty for new power plants”.

PJM, for its part, published a letter highlighting efforts to improve load forecasting, create an interconnection fast-track for industrial customers and announced plans to hold a future “emergency backstop capacity auction” without becoming the long-term procurement authority.

‘At what point will people revolt?’

Izzet Bensusan, CEO and founder of Captona, a New York-based energy transition investment firm with $3 billion in AUM, told Infrastructure Investor the announcements called to mind previous efforts to protect pricing guarantees, such as the Mobile Sierra Doctrine that raises the bar for FERC intervention into projects.

“It has pros and cons. As somebody who invests in plants, and in this case, we are looking to buy into three nuclear projects that are in development,” Bensusan said, “at the end of the day for an investor it could be good because I know I can finance against it.

“For me as an investor it’s a good incentive to start buying these assets and either retrofitting or repowering them. On the other hand, I have the following concerns: Most of our plants we’ve bought and owned now for 11, 12 years and things change over time. Fifteen years gets you to 2041, and who is footing the bill?”

Bensusan noted that the technology risk seems significant, particularly for the AI-driven component of the rise in energy demand. The facilities for training AI currently being built for hyperscalers may not serve much purpose once the shift to inferencing happens. “If we are going to invest and borrow money, the prudent thing to do is to get your equity back, if not with some return within seven, eight years,” he said.

”We’re signing up to power prices that [are] going to be much higher than the market, and then if the market goes down, at what point will people revolt and say, ‘Hey, you know what? I have a 15-year PPA that’s $300 per MWh,’” Bensusan said, noting that technology risks apply also to energy generation, and that solar could become significantly cheaper and more reliable, particularly with battery storage over that time period.

“So, we can invest more, but we would like to get the return on the capital sooner. On the con side, I think the long term of this is very unknown and somewhat the risk of who foots the bill at the end of the day.”

A big splash

Diana Jeschke, a senior energy regulatory attorney at law firm Linklaters, said those concerns are common among investors.

“Both items made a big splash, but from my perspective there is still a lot that needs to be worked out,” Jeschke said. “At a high level both actions seem to highlight the need for changes. There’s clearly a need to do something about all the new large loads that are coming on and make sure there will be reliable generation on the other end to serve them.”

Jeschke said there was significant overlap in the actions called for by both from the PJM board of directors and the Department of Energy.

“Even on the face of the documents there’s going to be uncertainty about where it’s going to land,” she said.

Jeschke added that there will likely be jurisdictional issues, particularly as pertains to efforts to tie the costs of data centres directly to the centres, which could require action by individual states as well as PJM.

“One thing that jumped out to me was the 15-year price certainty term that was mentioned in the statement of principles. There’s been an ongoing question about whether the capacity market framework as it currently exists is still sufficient to incentivise new generation,” Jeschke said, noting that currently PJM exists as a three-year forward market with price commitments coming in annual increments.

“This prescription for a 15-year term of price certainty could be attractive to developers and investors if the price is right. But I’m wondering how that’s going to work. Would there literally be an agreement or more of a price lock worked out to the PJM tariff?

“The auctions as they stand right now are designed for the loads or entities, mostly utilities, to be the buyers. It would be a change to have data centres participating directly in these auctions and I’m not sure that all of them would be willing to do that.”

‘Classical economics’

Dennis Wamsted, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, which has previously highlighted concerns about generation issues in PJM, said the moves by both organisations are unlikely to accomplish their stated goals of developing new baseload power, keeping prices down, and doing so fast.

“In a nutshell: I’m not sure how effective it’s going to be,” Wamsted said, adding that the release from the Department of Energy in particular “mis-categorised the PJM market completely”.

“PJM is a market right now. It may not work the way you or I want it to, and it may have its up and downs, but it’s designed to be a market. In the late 2010s and early 2020s that market was paying a very low price for capacity,” said Wamsted. “Part of the reason they were really low is because there was a big build out of gas earlier in the decade and there was very low demand growth.”

According to Wamsted, while problems with the PJM interconnect queue worsened matters, “classical economics” was in fact working to balance the supply and demand for capacity. Political pressure to keep prices for consumers low also made new installation a more difficult prospect, and many developers at the time were unmoved by PJM’s prices.

“You combine that with power that retired because most of it was old and most of it was economically inefficient, that has led to this shortage coming forward.”

PJM said last August that it studied nearly 140GW of generation interconnection projects since July 2023. The interconnection queue had been reduced to about 63GW of projects as of June 2025, all of which it said will be processed in 2025 and 2026.

“Turbines are hard to come by, and even if you could get one it would take you a minimum of three years to build and bring the operation online, and that assumes you already have permitting,” Wamsted said.",https://media.infrastructureinvestor.com/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1303511343.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 04:58:48.636044

Germany's minister of economics and energy Katherina Reiche said: ""The North Sea is a strategic key area for Europe's energy and supply security.","(Alliance News) - The UK and its European allies will sign a new clean energy pact to bring an ""unprecedented fleet"" of offshore wind projects to the North Sea that will supply multiple nations, the Department for Energy Security has said.

The Hamburg declaration includes Germany, Norway, France and Denmark and aims to ""escape the fossil fuel rollercoaster"" and power homes and businesses across the continent, it added.

It will be signed at a summit in the German port city on Monday – three years after North Sea countries pledged to build 300GW of offshore wind in that sea by 2050, in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the ""weaponisation"" of European energy supplies.

North Sea countries will agree to deliver 100GW of that offshore wind power through joint clean energy projects, including wind farms at sea that are linked between multiple countries.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said in a statement: ""We are standing up for our national interest by driving for clean energy, which can get the UK off the fossil fuel rollercoaster and give us energy sovereignty and abundance.

""After our record renewables auction, we today go further by signing a clean energy security pact with European allies to ensure we maximise the clean energy potential for the North Sea.""

The government expects industry will respond by unveiling new projects to end Europe's ""reliance on volatile fossil fuel markets controlled by petrostates and dictators"".

An agreement on connecting the offshore grid between Britain, Germany, Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands is also expected to be signed at the Future of the North Seas Summit.

The statement of intent is to focus on speeding up delivery by joint planning, cost sharing and market arrangements.

A framework to deepen German and UK collaboration on subsea energy infrastructure is also to be agreed.

The partnership would ""put UK firms at the forefront of grid technology"", the government said.

Agreements will also be made between Nato and Europe, particularly on cyber security co-operation in the North Sea.

Germany's minister of economics and energy Katherina Reiche said: ""The North Sea is a strategic key area for Europe's energy and supply security.

""By planning expansion, grids and industry together and implementing them across borders, we are creating clean and affordable energy, strengthening our industrial base and increasing Europe's strategic sovereignty.

""Today's investment pact provides reliable perspectives for the offshore sector, secures creation of value in Europe and brings future-proof jobs.""

The head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, which represents thousands of UK firms, welcomed the co-operation with European allies.

William Bain added in the statement: ""The commitments set out in the Hamburg Declaration will deliver on that, allowing our businesses to work on joint projects on renewables, interconnectors and other vital energy infrastructure.

""But we must not stop there. Action is also needed to ensure the competitiveness of oil and gas extraction and refining in the UK.

""This is a vital part of our energy mix in an uncertain world where we face multiple geopolitical and security threats.""

He said the current tax regime remains unsustainable and that the energy profits levy – the windfall tax on oil and gas companies – will have a negative impact on jobs and investment if it is not changed.

Bain added: ""The government must move to the recently announced oil and gas price mechanism as soon as possible, 2030 will be too late.""

Offshore hydrogen exports from the UK, and carbon capture and storage need to be explored too, he said, adding that European partners have focused on those aspects for energy security.

The spike has reverberated across overseas markets, underlining the growing globalization of the U.S.-dominated liquefied natural gas trade.

U.S. natural gas futures have surged by almost 70% over the last week to $5.35 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), their highest since December 2022. The cold spell is set to lift domestic gas demand this week to 156 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd), compared with a five-year January average of 137 bcfd, according to LSEG forecasts.

The Week in Breakingviews newsletter offers insights and ideas from Reuters' global financial commentary team. Sign up here.

At the same time, icy conditions are forcing drillers in regions such as the Permian shale basin in Texas and New Mexico to curb output due to “freeze‑offs,” when water and other liquids in the gas stream freeze. The trend will likely intensify as temperatures drop further.

Average gas output in the U.S. has already slipped to 108.4 bcfd so far in January, down from a record 109.7 bcfd in December, LSEG data showed, partly due to the cold weather. Tighter U.S. supply could reduce LNG exports, as liquefaction plants receive less feedgas.

Severe cold has curtailed oil and gas production several times in recent years. A 10-day cold spell in January 2024 led to a 3% drop in average monthly dry gas output, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data.

And three years earlier in February 2021, Winter Storm Uri led to a drop of over 20% in gas output at the lowest point compared with pre-storm levels. LNG feedgas fell by as much as 75% during the storm, leading to a 30% drop in February LNG exports that year, according to Kpler.

In each of these past Arctic blasts, output generally rebounded within a month or two. But since Uri, the U.S. has nearly doubled its liquefaction capacity, becoming the world's top LNG exporter, meaning a disruption today could create a much larger shortfall.

GLOBAL KNOCK-ON EFFECT

What has changed in recent years is that cold weather conditions in the U.S. can now lead to higher gas prices in Asia and especially Europe, which is heavily dependent on U.S. LNG after Russia slashed pipeline flows following its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

The U.S. has since 2023 dominated the LNG market, becoming the first country to export over 100 million metric tons per year in 2025. Around two-thirds of that was delivered to Europe, according to data analytics firm Kpler.

Benchmark European TTF gas prices gained over 6% last week to almost 40 euros per megawatt hour, or $13.75 per mmBtu, the highest since June 2025. Prices have risen by 38% so far this month, driven by a rapid depletion of regional gas stocks, which are currently 48% of capacity, far below last year's level of roughly 58%.

Europe is expected to import a record amount of LNG this year, the International Energy Agency said on Friday, with the bulk of the increase expected to come from the U.S.

To be sure, the current rally pales in comparison to the post-invasion spike in 2022, when TTF prices quadrupled to more than 300 euros per MWh.

Global LNG prices eventually returned to near pre‑invasion levels, helped by surging new supply that is expected to keep prices relatively low in coming years.

Between 2025 and 2030, new LNG export capacity is expected to grow some 50%, or by 300 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year globally, driven mainly by the U.S. and Qatar, according to the IEA.

INTERCONNECTED MARKET

Yet, the increasingly interconnected LNG market means that when sudden shifts in supply or demand do occur in major producing areas, whether due to outages or extreme weather, the global impact will be more pronounced than in the past.

And, importantly, climate change is likely to make such extreme weather events more frequent.

""The global gas market has become far more interconnected,"" said Mashal Jaffery, partner at gas and LNG commercial advisory Baringa. ""Regardless of their absolute price levels, markets such as TTF and (U.S.) Henry Hub are now structurally more volatile and increasingly exposed to supply, demand, and geopolitical dynamics originating outside their own regions.""

Of course, the global gas market has adapted. A larger number of LNG cargoes are now held at sea, enabling traders to respond more quickly to regional price swings. This can help the market respond to short‑term demand spikes and ultimately smooth volatility.

In other words, the gas market – which has long been highly regional in nature – is now starting to look like the modern, highly liquid oil market.

As the world’s fastest-growing major economy, its energy demand is rising at nearly three times the global average, and India is expected to account for around 25% of global energy demand growth over the next two decades.

To manage this responsibly, under the leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, India has built its strategy on four strong pillars. The first is diversification of supplies. The country has expanded its crude oil import basket from 27 countries in 2014 to over 40 countries today, insulating the economy from global volatility. The second pillar is affordability for the common citizen. Despite significant global price shocks, India is among the few countries where fuel prices have declined over the last three years. This has been achieved through calibrated tax interventions and proactive management by public sector oil marketing companies.

Third, India is steadily transitioning towards a gas-based economy. Natural gas is viewed as a critical bridge fuel, and efforts are underway to raise its share in the energy mix from about 6% today to 15% by 2030 through rapid expansion of pipelines, LNG terminals, and city gas distribution networks.

The fourth pillar is the biofuel revolution, which has emerged as a clear success story. India achieved 10% ethanol blending ahead of schedule and is firmly on track to reach 20% by 2025, five years ahead of the original target. Together, these measures enable rapid economic growth while keeping energy secure, affordable, and progressively cleaner.

India is no longer a passive participant in the global energy system. Today, it is a structural growth engine and an increasingly important stabilising force. India sees its role as that of a global bridge, connecting producers and consumers, the developed world and the Global South, and traditional energy systems with emerging clean technologies.

Initiatives such as the Global Biofuels Alliance, which now brings together over 29 countries and 14 international organisations, demonstrate how India is helping to create sustainable and circular energy economies at scale.

Similarly, the India–Middle East– Europe Economic Corridor reflects India’s vision of integrated energy, trade, and digital infrastructure, with clean fuels such as green hydrogen at its core.

Most importantly, India brings a balanced and realistic voice to global energy conversations. For 1.4 billion Indians, and for billions across the developing world, energy security is not solely about decarbonisation. It is about development with dignity. India’s leadership seeks to ensure that the global energy transition remains just, inclusive, and equitable.

Green hydrogen represents one of the most significant opportunities for India. Under the National Green Hydrogen Mission, the country is targeting annual production of 5 million metric tonnes by 2030, with the potential to scale further as export markets develop. Capacities for electrolyser manufacturing and hydrogen production are already being awarded, positioning India as a competitive global hub for green molecules.

Beyond hydrogen, India is making strong progress across several other key areas. Compressed bio-gas is one example, with more than 130 plants already operational and many more under development, converting agricultural waste into clean energy while generating additional income for farmers.

India is also accelerating work on sustainable aviation fuel to decarbonise one of the hardest-to-abate sectors, as well as on second-generation ethanol and waste-to-energy projects that combine technological innovation with social and environmental benefits.

Digitalisation is another important enabler. The use of AI, data analytics, and advanced monitoring systems is improving efficiency across exploration and production, refining, and the rapidly expanding city gas distribution networks. When aligned with policy and scale, technology becomes a powerful driver of transition.

India Energy Week has quickly established itself as one of the world’s most consequential energy platforms, and the 2026 edition will reflect India’s “energy abundance” mindset.

The event will move beyond a simplistic division between traditional and renewable energy. Instead, it will showcase how India is greening its conventional energy sectors through efficiency improvements and emerging solutions, while simultaneously scaling up the fuels and technologies of the future.

India Energy Week provides a space where policy, industry, technology, and investment converge. It reflects the complexity of India’s energy transition and the confidence with which it is being managed, pragmatically, inclusively, and at scale.","https://www.energyconnects.com/media/30lfauj2/170a4236-2.jpg?rxy=0.45709959623149393,0.12179717602203607&width=1200&height=628&v=1dc8c5883201200",N,,2026-01-26 04:01:02.692405

“West Virginia is on the rise, and gas is playing a major role in that,” Morrisey told the crowd.
Morrisey’s 50 by 50 plan was first announced last summer.
During the 2025 Governor’s Energy Summit last November, Morrisey announced several economic development projects related to energy that could add 1.9 gigawatts of energy towards his 50 by 50 plan.
Those projects included a $2.5 billion FirstEnergy natural gas power plant with additional 70 megawatts of utility-scale solar power generation, and the $1.2 billion Wolf Summit Energy 625-megawatt natural gas power plant in Harrison County.","CHARLESTON — Gov. Patrick Morrisey told attendees of one of the largest natural gas events in West Virginia that the latest announcement about Houston-based Calpine LLC building a natural gas power plant in Marshall County is another example of his 50 by 50 plan gaining support.

Morrisey spoke Thursday morning at the Gas and Oil Association of West Virginia’s 2026 winter meeting at the Marriott Town Center Hotel in downtown Charleston.

“West Virginia is on the rise, and gas is playing a major role in that,” Morrisey told the crowd. “I’ve always thought that West Virginia is America’s energy state and just keeps needing a little bit more kick to get it to the next level.

“There is room for you to be strong, there is room for you to be dominant, and there’s room for other forms of energy to be strong and dominant as well,” Morrisey continued. “Because for West Virginia to truly change and transform to the kind of state we want it to be, it’s going to rely heavily on all the people in this room.”

Morrisey announced that Calpine, a subsidiary of Baltimore-based energy management services company Constellation Energy, has finalized its project to build a 500-megawatt natural gas power plant in Moundsville. The proposed $1 billion investment would involve 400 construction jobs and 25 permanent jobs when complete.

“That’s great. That’s good stuff,” Morrisey said. “This is a major vote of confidence for our state.”

Morrisey said the potential of another 500 megawatts of electric power was proof that companies were heeding his call to increase the number of megawatts produced by West Virginia from 16 gigawatts to 50 gigawatts by 2050. Morrisey’s 50 by 50 plan was first announced last summer.

The plan focuses on easing regulatory hurdles for power producers in order to increase the state’s base load electric generating capacity from 16 gigawatts to 50 gigawatts in the next 25 years to meet the growing demand for electricity by AI programs and data centers in the PJM Interconnection grid, and to remain competitive with other nations, such as China.

During the 2025 Governor’s Energy Summit last November, Morrisey announced several economic development projects related to energy that could add 1.9 gigawatts of energy towards his 50 by 50 plan. Those projects included a $2.5 billion FirstEnergy natural gas power plant with additional 70 megawatts of utility-scale solar power generation, and the $1.2 billion Wolf Summit Energy 625-megawatt natural gas power plant in Harrison County.

With the Calpine announcement, Morrisey said that brings the state to 2.35 gigawatts in proposed new natural gas power generation, with the potential for future announcements that could result in between seven to 10 gigawatts of new electric generation.

“I know a lot of people thought that we were on the sauce a little bit when we went from 16 gigawatts in our plan to 50 by 2050,” Morrisey said. “The demand is certainly there. And now the key is we’re really taking advantage of our energy resources in a way we haven’t seen before … That is the plan, and it’s a good plan. And I’m not going to let any media or anyone come in our way.”

Morrisey told attendees that a key driver of anticipated future energy demand is the technology sector, particularly the development of data centers. West Virginia has taken legislative action to position itself as a prime location for this industry through the passage last year of House Bill 2014, the bill creating data center and microgrid districts.

“I went out to California. I spent a lot of time with data center companies and a lot of the tech companies. And West Virginia wasn’t on the map in terms of the data center front,” Morrisey said. “I said, ‘you know what? We need to change that.’ And there are a lot of opportunities in advanced manufacturing, in artificial intelligence and technology. And we spent a lot of time working on it.

“The reason I’ve been so bullish on what’s going on from a technology perspective is because that’s fueling all the demand for your products,” Morrisey continued. “We’re really taking advantage of our energy resources in a way we haven’t seen before … to marry that up with all the companies, the customers that want to come into our state.”",https://ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.theintermountain.com/images/2026/01/23224726/Morrisey-689x500.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 04:01:38.543415

Canada Systematically Destroying Itself, Says Trump

In a post on the social media platform X on Sunday, Transport Secretary Sean Duffy shared a clip posted by Trump on Truth Social, which criticized Canada's EV trade agreement with China.

""Canada is systematically destroying itself,"" Trump said in the post. He added that the agreement with China was ""a disaster"" deal and would go down as ""one of the worst deals, of any kind, in history.""

Trump also said that Canada's businesses were moving to the U.S., though he did not provide any additional information or elaborate on that claim. ""I want to see Canada SURVIVE AND THRIVE!"" he said.

Canada's trade deal with China outlines lower tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles coming into the country. As part of the agreement, Ottawa will initially permit up to 49,000 EVs from China at a 6.1% tariff.

Trump Threatens 100% Tariffs

The news comes as Trump threatened to levy 100% tariffs on Canada. ""If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A,"" Trump said.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, however, shared during a press briefing on Sunday that Canada's deal with China was consistent with the conditions outlined in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

The agreement has been criticized by Duffy, who shared that the country would ""live to regret"" the decision of letting Chinese-made EVs into the country. Chinese-made EVs have also raised concerns in Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F) CEO Jim Farley.

Regulators must adopt policies that reward clean power and streamline permitting while protecting people and nature.
Industry must diversify supply chains so more countries can manufacture, install, and maintain clean energy systems.
A clean energy future is within reach.","On this International Day of Clean Energy, we can feel the world shifting – but we must pick up the pace.

The science tells us we are heading for a temporary overshoot above 1.5 degrees Celsius. Our responsibility is to make that breach as small, as short, and as safe as possible – through a just, orderly and equitable transition away from fossil fuels.

Renewables are the engine that can drive this transition. They are the cheapest source of new power in most places. And last year, for the first time, wind, solar, and other renewables generated more electricity worldwide than coal.

Renewable energy connects communities still left in the dark, provides clean cooking, and opens the door to better health, education, and opportunities. Renewables anchor new industries, create decent jobs and lower energy costs, while shielding countries from geopolitical shocks and market volatility.

Even so, the renewables revolution is not moving fast enough or far enough. Grid infrastructure is lagging well behind the expansion of clean energy capacity, and high costs continue to shut many countries out of the transition entirely.

The roadmap is clear: we must triple global renewable capacity by 2030, by lifting barriers, cutting costs, and connecting clean power to people and industry – with scale, speed, and solidarity.

Regulators must adopt policies that reward clean power and streamline permitting while protecting people and nature. Utilities must upgrade, expand, and digitize grids and interconnections, to carry clean power where it is needed, and scale storage so power systems stay steady as renewables grow. Industry must diversify supply chains so more countries can manufacture, install, and maintain clean energy systems. This includes the critical minerals essential to the transition, which must benefit producing countries and communities – not just global markets.

Finance must bring down the cost of capital, especially for developing countries with vast renewable potential. And multilateral development banks must reduce risk and unlock far greater private investment.

Most importantly, we must ensure this transition is just – protecting workers and communities, supporting education, industrial development, and opportunity for all as energy systems evolve.

A clean energy future is within reach. Let us seize the moment – and bring the renewables revolution to every corner of the world.",https://www.un.org/sg/sites/default/files/image/2026-01/1200x628tw.png,N,,2026-01-26 04:01:31.852885

Hong Kong IPO candidate Wuxi Lead Intelligent commands 15.5% of the global market for lithium battery manufacturing equipment, benefiting from China’s EV dominance

Solid-state battery equipment offers major growth potential for the company, but the industry’s highly cyclical nature requires careful capital management

By Hugh Chen

Everyone knows that China dominates battery manufacturing, home to global leader CATL as well as smaller players like CALB and Gotion High Tech (002074.SZ). But far less visible is China’s equally commanding position in the upstream manufacturing equipment segment behind the finished product.

The leader in that space is Wuxi Lead Intelligent Equipement Co. Ltd. (300450.SZ), whose plan for a second listing in Hong Kong, complementing its current listing in Shenzhen, made a key advance last week after receiving approval from China’s securities regulator.

As the leader in its class, the company is hoping to follow in the footsteps of CATL, one of its top customers, whose shares have nearly doubled since its own second listing last May that was Hong Kong’s largest for the year, raising more than $4.6 billion.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission’s (CSRC) approval is the latest advance in a rocky overseas listing journey for Wuxi Lead Equipment, which terminated plans for a Switzerland listing in early 2025. It then pivoted to Hong Kong with its submission of an IPO prospectus, but that filing lapsed, and the company had to submit an updated version in August last year.

Wuxi Lead Equipment filed an updated prospectus on Sunday after the CSRC approval, suggesting the listing is likely to move forward quickly after clearing the key regulator advance.

The company, which has been listed in Shenzhen since 2015, didn’t announce how much it would raise. But its selection of A-listed underwriters JPMorgan and Citic Securities suggests the offering size should be substantial, attracting both Asian and global investors.

Those investors are likely eying the company’s leading position in battery equipment, similar to CATL’s position for finished batteries. Its investments in emerging solid-state battery equipment technology and diversification into photovoltaic manufacturing equipment could serve as additional attractions. However, investors also need to consider certain risks, including the cyclical nature of both the battery and photovoltaic industries.

We’ll examine these risks in greater detail shortly, but first we’ll begin with a review of the company’s core business and development story.

Wuxi Lead Intelligent was founded in 2002 by Wang Yanqing, 58, who got his start as an engineer making radio components. The company began by manufacturing equipment to make the capacitors that are energy storage components used in various electronic devices, including mobile phones and home appliances. It became a major player in this space and secured contracts to supply machinery to electronics giants including Japan’s Panasonic.

Over that time, Wang observed that lithium battery manufacturing shared fundamental processes with capacitor production, leading him to establish a lithium battery equipment division in 2008. The timing proved fortuitous, coinciding with the lithium battery industry’s rise driven by surging smartphone demand.

Riding EV growth

The company’s big break came after it identified opportunities in electric vehicle (EV) batteries, which the Chinese government designated as a strategic industry around 2010. Wuxi Lead Intelligent was among the earliest to capitalize on the resulting boom in battery equipment demand. It secured key backing from CATL, with the battery giant naming Wuxi Lead Intelligent as a core supplier in 2014.

CATL’s orders helped the company record more than 70% revenue growth the following year. As EV sales in China took off, battery companies like CATL expanded rapidly, lifting battery equipment providers as well. Wuxi Lead Intelligent emerged as a major beneficiary thanks to its strong technical expertise, and quickly expanded its customer base beyond CATL to major domestic and international players including Sony, Panasonic, LG, Tesla and BYD.

According to third-party research cited in its prospectus, the company was the world’s largest lithium-ion battery intelligent equipment provider in 2024, commanding 15.5% of the global market. Its dominance is even more pronounced in China, where it holds a 19% market share.

The company’s growth momentum has slowed considerably in recent years due to oversupply in the battery market after a massive buildup. Its revenue rose just 19% in 2023 before contracting 29% in 2024. Profitability trended similarly, with net profit plunging from 1.8 billion yuan ($258 million) in 2023 to just 268 million yuan in 2024.

This underscores the cyclical nature of the battery industry. Since the second half of 2023, the lithium battery supply chain has entered an adjustment period, with downstream players slowing capacity expansion amid a brutal price war in the EV sector.

Things began to pick up last year. Revenue resumed growth in the first three quarters of 2025, rising 15% year-on-year to 10.4 billion yuan, while the company’s net profit nearly doubled to 1.2 billion yuan.

Wuxi Lead Intelligent is now emphasizing the opportunity presented by solid-state battery equipment. Compared to traditional liquid-based lithium-ion batteries, solid-state batteries offer advantages in safety and energy density, and carmakers are increasingly shifting toward them. Solid-state batteries have already begun contributing to revenue, though they are still at an early stage. Solid-state battery equipment generated between 400 million yuan and 500 million yuan in the first half of 2025, according to an October research note from Citi.

Nomura said in a November report that it expects Wuxi Lead Intelligent’s order book momentum to continue into 2026, driven largely by demand from solid-state battery commercialization as well as capacity expansion for energy storage systems associated with solar and wind power plants — another area the company has identified for growth.

Wuxi Lead Intelligent has also recently ramped up efforts to expand into other equipment types, most notably photovoltaic equipment, an area it first entered in 2009. However, despite years of development, photovoltaic equipment revenue remains modest, contributing just 9% of the company’s total in the first three quarters of 2025, while battery intelligent equipment accounted for the majority at 67%.

Its difficulty breaking into the photovoltaic equipment market partly reflects the challenges of adapting battery manufacturing technology to a different sector, and also underscores the intensely competitive nature of the photovoltaic industry.

In the battery equipment space, Wuxi Lead Intelligent faces competition from the three largest players: Shenzhen Yinghe Technology (300457.SZ), Zhejiang Hangke Technology (688006.SS) and Guangdong Lyric Robot Automation (688499.SS). In the photovoltaic equipment space, it faces much larger rivals such as Naura (002371.SZ) and Shenzhen S.C New Energy Technology (300724.SZ). Wuxi Lead Intelligent acknowledges in its prospectus that its position in the photovoltaic equipment market is negligible.

At the end of the day, solid-state batteries offer the biggest growth opportunity for the company right now, and its secondary IPO comes at an opportune time to raise additional capital for continued technology investment. Given the cyclical nature of both the battery and photovoltaic industries, the company will need to carefully manage its capital allocation and maintain financial flexibility to weather industry downturns while positioning itself to capture growth when demand recovers.",https://thebambooworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Wuxi-Lead-0126.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 01:58:18.351442

Ten years ago, switching from burning coal to gas was a key element of China’s policy to reduce severe air pollution.

However, while gas is seen in some countries as a “bridging” fuel to move away from coal use, rapid electrification, uncompetitiveness and supply concerns have suppressed its share in China’s energy mix.

As such, while China’s gas demand has more than doubled over the past decade, the fuel is not currently playing a decisive role in the country’s strategy to tackle climate change.

Instead, renewables are now the leading replacement for coal demand in China, with growth in solar and wind generation largely keeping emissions growth from China’s power sector flat.

While gas could play a role in decarbonising some aspects of China’s energy demand – particularly in terms of meeting power demand peaks and fuelling heavy industry – multiple factors would need to change to make it a more attractive alternative.

Small, but impactful

The share of gas in China’s primary energy demand is small and has remained relatively unchanged at around 8-9% over the past five years.

It also comprises 7% of China’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fuel combustion, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Gas combustion in China added 755m tonnes of CO2 (MtCO2) into the atmosphere in 2023 – double the total amount of CO2 emitted by the UK.

However, its emissions profile in China lags well behind that of coal, which represented 79% of China’s fuel-linked CO2 emissions and was responsible for almost 9bn tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2023, according to the same IEA data.

Gas consumption continues to grow in line with an overall uptick in total energy demand. Chinese gas demand, driven by industry use, grew by around 7-8% year-on-year in 2024, according to different estimates.

This rapid growth is, nevertheless, slightly below the 9% average annual rise in China’s gas demand over the past decade, during which consumption has more than doubled overall, as shown in the figure below.

The state-run oil and gas company China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) forecast in 2025 that demand growth for the year may slow further to just over 6%.

The majority of China’s gas demand in 2023 was met by domestic gas supply, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).

Most of this supply comes from conventional gas sources. But incremental Chinese domestic gas supply in recent years has come from harder-to-extract unconventional sources, including shale gas, which accounted for as much as 45% of gas production in 2024.

Despite China’s large recoverable shale-gas resources and subsidies to encourage production, geographical and technical limitations have capped production levels relative to the US, which is the world’s largest gas producer by far.

CNPC estimates Chinese gas output will grow by just 4% in 2025, compared with 6% growth in 2024. Nevertheless, output is still expected to exceed the 230bn cubic metre national target for 2025.

Liquified natural gas (LNG) is China’s second most-common source of gas, imported via giant super-cooled tankers from countries including Australia, Qatar, Malaysia and Russia.

This is followed by pipeline imports – which are seen as cheaper, but less reliable – from Russia and central Asia.

One particularly high-profile pipeline project is the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline project. However, Beijing has yet to explicitly agree to investing in or purchasing the gas delivered by the project. Disagreements around pricing and logistics have hindered progress.

Evolving role

Beijing initially aimed for gas to displace coal as part of a broader policy to tackle air pollution.

A three-year action plan from 2018-2020, dubbed the “blue-sky campaign”, helped to accelerate gas use in the industrial and residential sectors, as gas displaced consumption of “dispersed coal” (散煤)”– referring to improperly processed coal that emits more pollutants.

Meanwhile, several cities across northern and central China were also mandated to curtail coal usage and switch to gas instead. Many of these cities were based in provinces with a strong coal mining economy or higher winter heating demand.

China’s pollution levels saw “drastic improvement” as a result, according to a report by research institute the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).

(In January 2026, there were widespread media reports of households choosing not to use gas heating despite freezing temperatures, as a result of high prices following the expiry of subsidies for gas use.)

Industry remains the largest gas user in China, with “city gas” – gas delivered by pipeline to urban areas – trailing in second, as shown in the figure below. Power generation is a distant third.

Gas has never gained momentum in China’s power sector, with its share of power generation remaining at 4% while wind and solar power’s share has soared from 4% to 22% over the past decade, Yu Aiqun, a research analyst at the US-based thinktank Global Energy Monitor, tells Carbon Brief.

Yu adds that this stagnation is largely due to insufficient and unreliable gas supply, which drives up prices and makes gas less competitive compared to coal and renewables. She says:

“With the rapid expansion of renewables and ongoing geopolitical uncertainties, I don’t foresee a bright future for gas power.”

Average on-grid gas-fired power prices of 0.56-0.58 yuan per kilowatt hour (yuan/kWh) in China are far higher than that of around 0.3-0.4 yuan/kWh for coal power, according to some industry estimates. Recent auction prices for renewables are even cheaper than this.

Meanwhile, the share of renewables in China’s power capacity stood at 55% in 2024, compared with gas at around 4%.

Generation from wind and solar in particular has increased by more than 1,250 terawatt-hours (TWh) in China since 2015, while gas-fired generation has increased by just 140TWh, according to IEEFA.

As the share of coal has shrunk from 70% to 61% during this period, IEEFA suggests that renewables – rather than gas – are displacing coal’s share in the generation mix.

However, China’s gas capacity may still rise from approximately 150 gigawatts (GW) in 2025 to 200GW by 2030, Bloomberg reports.

A report by the National Energy Administration (NEA) on development of the sector notes that gas will continue to play a “critical role” in “peak shaving”, where gas turbines can be used for short periods to meet daily spikes in demand. As such, the NEA says gas will be an “important pillar” in China’s energy transition.

In 2024, a new policy on gas utilisation also “explicitly promoted” the use of gas peak-shaving power plants, according to industry outlet MySteel.

China’s current gas storage capacity is “insufficient”, according to CNPC, reducing its ability to meet peak-shaving demand. The country built 38 underground gas storage sites with peak-shaving capacity of 26.7bn cubic metres in 2024, but this accounts for just 6% of its annual gas demand.

Transport use

Gas is instead playing a bigger part in the displacement of diesel in the transport sector, due to the higher cost competitiveness of LNG as a fuel – particularly in the trucking sector.

CNPC expects that LNG displaced around 28-30m tonnes of diesel in the trucking sector in 2025, accounting for 15% of total diesel demand in China.

This is further aided by policy support from Beijing’s equipment trade-in programme, part of efforts to stimulate the economy.

However, gas is not necessarily a better option for heavy-duty, long-haul transportation, due to poorer fuel efficiency compared with electric vehicles (EVs).

In fact, “new-energy vehicles” (NEVs) – including hydrogen fuel-cell, pure-electric and hybrid-electric trucks – are displacing both LNG-fueled trucks and diesel heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs).

In the first half of 2025, battery-electric models accounted for 22% of all HDV sales, a year-on-year increase of 9%, while market share for LNG-fueled trucks fell from 30% in 2024 to 26%.

Gas can be cheaper than oil but is not competitive with EVs and – with the emergence of zero-emission fuels such as hydrogen and ammonia – gas may eventually lose even this niche market, says Yu.

Supply security

Chinese government officials frequently note that China is “rich in coal, poor in oil and short of gas” (“富煤贫油少气”). Concerns around import dependence have underpinned China’s focus on coal as a source of energy security.

However, Beijing increasingly sees electrification as a more strategic way to decarbonise its transport sector, according to some analysts.

“Overall, electrification is a clear energy security strategy to reduce exposure to global fossil fuel markets,” says Michal Meidan, head of the China energy research programme at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.

Chinese oil and gas production grew dramatically in the last few years under a seven-year action plan from 2019-25, as Beijing ordered its state oil firms to ramp up output to ensure energy security.

Despite this, gas import dependency still hovers at around 40% of demand. This, according to assessments in government documents, exposes the country to price shocks and geopolitical risks.

The graph below shows the share of domestically produced gas (dark blue), LNG imports (mid-blue) and pipeline imports (light blue), in China’s overall gas supply between 2017 and 2024.

“Gas use is unlikely to play a significant role in decarbonising the power system, but could be more significant in industrial decarbonisation,” Meidan tells Carbon Brief.

She estimates that if LNG prices fall to $6 per million British thermal units (btu), compared to an average of $11 in 2024-25, this could encourage fuel switching in the steel, chemical manufacturing, textiles, ceramics and food processing industries.

The chart below shows the year-on-year change in gas demand between 2001-2022.

Year-on-year changes in Chinese industry’s gas demand by sector, 2001-2023, bcm. Source: National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), OIES.

Growth in gas demand has been decelerating in some industries in recent years, such as refining. But it also remains unclear if Beijing will adopt more aggressive policies favouring gas, Meidan adds.

A roadmap developed by the Energy Research Institute (ERI), a thinktank under the National Development and Reform Commission’s Academy of Macroeconomic Research, finds that gas only begins to play an equivalent or greater role in China’s energy mix than coal by 2050 at the earliest – 10 years ahead of China’s target for achieving carbon neutrality.

Both fossil fuels play a significantly smaller role than clean-energy sources at this point.

Wang Zhongying and Kaare Sandholt, both experts at the ERI, write in Carbon Brief:

“Gas does not play a significant role in the power sector in our scenarios, as solar and wind can provide cheaper electricity while existing coal power plants – together with scaled-up expansion of energy storage and demand-side response facilities – can provide sufficient flexibility and peak-load capacity.”

Ultimately, China’s push for gas will be contingent on its own development goals. Its next five-year plan, from 2026-2030, will build a framework for China’s shift to controlling absolute carbon emissions, rather than carbon intensity.

Recent recommendations by top Chinese policymakers on priorities for the next five-year plan did not explicitly mention gas. Instead, the government endorses “raising the level of electrification in end-use energy consumption” while also “promoting peaking of coal and oil consumption”.

The Chinese government feels that gas is “nice to have…if available and cost-competitive but is not the only avenue for China’s energy transition,” says Meidan.

While improvements in vehicle battery technology have led to increased battery range, consumers are still left wondering how long they can expect their vehicle battery to last. After all, the battery pack is the most expensive part of an electric car, with a new battery costing upwards of $20,000.

So what can you expect for an electric vehicle’s battery lifespan? We have the important answers.

What are EV Batteries?

Internal combustion engined cars are powered by gasoline, while EVs are powered by a battery pack driving one or more electric motors. The batteries that power electric cars are rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which is the same type of battery found in cell phones and other consumer electronics. Lithium-ion batteries have a higher energy density than lead-acid or nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries, which means they don’t take up as much space while providing an equivalent level of power. A vehicle’s battery capacity is measured in kilowatt hours (kWh), so a vehicle with a higher kWh rating means it has more range.

How Long Do EV Batteries Last?

The lifespan of an EV battery depends on a number of factors. While battery life can vary, EV manufacturers are generally required to issue a warranty for at least 8 years or 100,000 miles. However, some manufacturers offer longer warranties. Kia offers a battery pack warranty for 10 years or 100,000 miles, and Hyundai provides warranty coverage on EV batteries for the vehicle’s entire lifetime. Battery warranties vary not only by time but also by the nature of the coverage. Some automakers will only replace the battery if it completely fails, while others, like BMW, Tesla, and Volkswagen, will cover a battery if its capacity falls below a certain percentage.

Recent studies show that EV batteries may retain around 90% capacity after 100,000 kilometers and about 87% after 300,000 kilometers, with an annual degradation rate of approximately 1.8%. For example, a Tesla Model S only loses an estimated five percent of battery capacity over its first 50,000 miles. As battery technology continues to evolve, companies are creating larger batteries with increased range and reduced degradation. The first-generation Nissan LEAF had a maximum range of 84 miles, while the newest LEAF has a maximum range of 212 miles.

Modern electric car batteries are increasingly designed to last the entire life of the vehicle, reducing the likelihood of needing a battery replacement. With advancements in battery management systems and engineering, an EV battery is expected to last 10-20 years, depending on maintenance and care.

How to Prolong the Life of Your Electric Vehicle Battery

Just like there are preventative maintenance measures to extend the life of your gasoline vehicle, there are EV charging measures you can take to prolong your EV’s battery life. Here are the top tips to protect your EV battery’s health:

1. Avoid parking in extreme temperatures

Lithium batteries have thermal management systems that will heat or cool themselves, which in turn uses energy and drains EV battery packs. Try to park in the shade if possible on hot days and inside in extreme cold temperatures to assist battery longevity.

2. Don’t Charge Your Car Too Much or Too Little

Modern electric cars are equipped with management systems that avoid charging and discharging at the maximum and minimum charging levels. You should avoid charging your vehicle above 80 percent or below 20 percent to extend EV battery life.

3. Minimize Use of Fast Charging Stations

DC fast charging stations can bring your battery level up to 80 percent in as little as 30 minutes. With this convenience comes a strain on your EV battery. For optimal battery life, you should limit how often you plug in to these fast charging stations for occasional scenarios, like road trips.

4. Maintain Optimal State of Charge While Vehicle is Stored

If you are planning on storing your vehicle for a long time, make sure that your battery does not have an empty or full charge. With a timed charger, you can set it to maintain the charging level between 25 and 75 percent.

Second Life of EV Batteries

When an automotive EV battery’s performance dips below 70 percent, it can have a second life when it is no longer useful to power a vehicle. There are many applications to repurpose EV batteries for renewable energy sources including home battery storage systems and powering manufacturing plants. In Japan, Toyota has installed EV batteries to store power generated from solar panels.

Bottom Line

While an electric car’s battery life can vary, advancements in technology have helped ensure that it typically lasts for the lifespan of a vehicle. The main factor for prolonging a battery’s life expectancy is to limit the number of charging cycles each battery cell goes through. Battery cells die when a battery reaches its empty or full state of charge for too long, so make sure you charge your vehicle according to the manufacturer’s instructions to minimize battery degradation.

Estimated restoration times will be available on Monday, January 26.

Ice storms cause delays because the damage doesn’t happen all at once. Unlike wind events or hurricanes, ice storms often unfold over many hours or even days, leading to outages that occur in waves.

As freezing rain falls, ice steadily accumulates on power lines, trees and poles, adding layer upon layer of weight. Equipment may hold initially, then fail hours or days later as stress increases. Even small amounts of ice can add hundreds of pounds, causing lines to sag, tree limbs to snap, or poles to be pulled down well after precipitation ends. Trees often fail gradually, with ice-laden branches cracking or falling later as temperatures fluctuate, sometimes bringing down lines after crews have already restored nearby power. Repeated freezing, slight melting and refreezing further strain equipment, weakening components and triggering new outages over time.

Restoring power during winter storms is different from other weather events and requires a careful, step-by-step approach to protect both customers, workers and the electric grid.

Before power can be restored, damage to infrastructure must be assessed. Damage assessment and restoration work has been slowed by downed vegetation blocking roadways and icy road conditions. Once it is safe to do so, crews begin evaluating damage to power plants, transmission lines, substations and local distribution equipment.

Cold load pickup is the phenomenon that takes place when a distribution circuit is re-energized following an extended outage of that circuit.

It is referred to as cold load pickup because the power supply has been unavailable for a period of time, so the load has reached a “cold” state before being re-energized.

In an article written on this occasion, the Party chief recalled President Ho Chi Minh’s call to action, “Forward! Total victory will be ours!” and emphasized that today the late President’s appeal still surges with momentum, “spurring us to strengthen our resolve, overcome poverty and backwardness, and build a prosperous and happy country.”

The Investor introduces a translation of the article by Vietnam News Agency as follows.

FORWARD! TOTAL VICTORY WILL SURELY BE OURS!

The 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam has just concluded with great success, marking a particularly momentous political event that opens a new era of development for the country. The Congress represented a powerful convergence of the will, aspirations, and determination of the entire Party, the entire people, and the entire army, crystallizing the nation’s intellect and desire to rise.

The Congress’s guiding principle - “Solidarity-Democracy-Discipline-Breakthrough-Development” - is not merely a slogan, it is truly a call to action and a mandate of responsibility before history, affirming an unshakable belief in the path chosen by the Party, President Ho Chi Minh, and our People.

With thorough, rigorous, and scientific preparation and broad-based input from across the Party and the people, the documents adopted at the 14th Congress reflect strategic vision and the highest level of political resolve. Notably, for the first time in the history of Party congresses, the 14th Congress issued an Action Program accompanying the Resolution - a breakthrough aimed at ensuring that the Resolution is put into practice immediately.

From guidelines to planning and implementation, responsibilities are clearly defined: who does what, when it is done, what resources are required, and what the ultimate objectives are. As a result, the Resolution of the 14th Congress has truly become an action handbook for the Party and the entire political system, a “guiding torch” lighting the way forward on the country’s new development path.

The Resolution of the 14th Congress sets out exceptionally clear, bold yet feasible overarching goals for the 2026-2030 period, with a vision through 2045: maintaining a peaceful and stable environment; advancing rapid and sustainable national development; comprehensively improving the People’s living standards; and strengthening self-reliance and resilience to move confidently into the nation’s new era.

More importantly, the 14th Congress’s documents translate this spirit of decisive action into concrete terms. The Action Program accompanying the Resolution places particular emphasis on the requirement to “make the right choices - implement quickly - follow through to the end - measure performance by results” across all tasks.

Every major policy decision of the Congress has been developed into a practical implementation plan, with clearly defined objectives, solutions, and evaluation criteria. The principle of “the People as the roots” runs throughout: the People are placed at the center and as the subject of development, with all policies aimed at improving their material and spiritual well-being; while upholding respect for, listening to, and fully harnessing the People’s role as masters of the nation.

As a result, the Resolution of the 14th Congress goes beyond vision and orientation, carrying the pulse of real life, inspiring a renewed aspiration for development and a powerful momentum for action, ready to be translated into practice immediately after the Congress.

From resolution to action

With the Resolution in place and the Program clearly defined, what remains is action. The Congress requires Party Committees at all levels to swiftly disseminate, study, and translate the Resolution into programs and plans tailored to their respective localities and units, promptly putting both the Resolution and the Action Program into practice.

The overarching imperative is a decisive shift from “talk” to “action,” from awareness to implementation. The Congress documents make clear the need to resolutely and thoroughly address the problems of “talking much but doing little,” “saying well but doing poorly,” and “saying one thing and doing another,” and to put an end to bureaucratic, formalistic working styles. Every Party Committee, every Party Organisation, and every cadre and Party member, especially those in leadership positions, must heighten their sense of responsibility and lead by example in turning decisions into reality.

From now on, “words must be matched by deeds” must become a guiding principle of action; every policy and task must clearly define objectives and solutions, link responsibility to results, align breakthroughs with sustainability, and ensure that discipline in implementation is measured by the People’s satisfaction.

Entering a new phase, every sound guideline, once adopted, must be carried out with 10-fold determination and a hundredfold effort in practice; political resolve must be at its highest, effort at its strongest, and action at its most decisive - an imperative arising from the nation’s will and aspiration for development. From the central to grassroots levels, from Party and State agencies to the Vietnam Fatherland Front and socio-political organisations, all must move forward in unison with a renewed sense of momentum; in this process, every cadre and Party member - above all, each member of the Party Central Committee - must lead by example, daring to think, to speak, to act, to take responsibility, and to innovate for the common good, with service to the People as the highest measure of work effectiveness

The next 5-10 years

The coming 5-10 years will be a pivotal period of decisive significance for the country’s two centenary strategic goals. Within this relatively short timeframe, we must both complete the objectives of the 2026-2030 period and lay a solid foundation for reaching higher development milestones by 2045. The goal for 2030 is to transform Vietnam into a country with modern industry and upper-middle income status.

This requires the economy to sustain average annual growth of 10% or higher over many consecutive years - an unprecedented breakthrough pace, yet an entirely feasible target if all resources are fully mobilized and effectively utilized. By 2045, we must resolutely achieve the goal of building a developed, high-income Vietnam on par with leading countries worldwide.

With limited time and heavy, decisive tasks, the 14th Congress set out revolutionary and breakthrough orientations and solutions to seize every opportunity and overcome all challenges. Over the next five years, we must accelerate comprehensively across all key areas: the economy must make strong breakthroughs to achieve sustained high growth; science, technology and innovation must be vigorously promoted as a driving force for development; and institutional reform, together with improvements to the investment and business environment, must be pursued resolutely and transparently to unleash all social resources.

At the same time, social sectors such as education, health care and culture must receive attention and investment commensurate with economic growth, ensuring harmonious and sustainable development. The building and rectification of the Party and the political system continues to face very high requirements, particularly in the building of a contingent of officials equal to their tasks - those who are “truly exemplary in moral qualities, intellect and mettle, and fully capable of leading the successful fulfillment of the major missions entrusted by the Party, the State and the People.”

The 14th National Party Congress term is an exceptionally important period for the entire Party and the entire people to achieve the highest accomplishments in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Party’s founding (2030). From now on, the mindset of “five-year action with a 20-year vision” must be thoroughly embedded in leadership and governance. This means that successfully fulfilling the immediate five-year objectives will at the same time lay a solid foundation for goals in the years ahead. The sound and breakthrough decisions taken today will not only deliver immediate results for the 2026-2030 period, but will also generate momentum for a leap in development in the decades to come.

If we seize opportunities and overcome the challenges of this pivotal 5-10-year period, the country will undoubtedly take off strongly, turning into reality the aspiration of building a powerful Vietnam by the mid-21st century. Conversely, if opportunities are missed or delays and mistakes occur during this critical juncture, the cost will be extremely high - potentially squandering the opportunity of an entire nation and causing the country to fall further behind in a rapidly changing world. Fully aware of this, the entire Party and people are determined to act with speed and resolve from the very start of the term, allowing “not a single day to be wasted, not a single week to be delayed.”

Rising above challenges

Looking ahead, we have no option other than success. The 14th Congress has ignited the flame of invincible confidence, placing upon the entire Party and the entire people a historic responsibility that is extraordinarily heavy yet profoundly honorable. Ahead lie many difficulties and challenges, but the Party allows no room for hesitation or failure on the chosen path. Standing alongside the Party are the trust, affection and expectations of more than 100 million compatriots, and before us lies the fate of the entire nation in the 21st century.

The goal of “a prosperous people, a strong country, democracy, equity and civilisation” set by the Party is not merely an aspiration, but a solemn pledge of honor to the People. Therefore, every official and Party member, especially those who “bear the main responsibilities” must constantly remind themselves to rise higher and overcome their own limitations.

We cannot afford to delay reform, we cannot afford to hesitate in action, and we certainly cannot allow complacency or rest on past laurels. Lessons from previous terms show that wherever there is strong political resolve and focused, unified and hands-on leadership, work progresses positively; conversely, where there is laxity, complacency or a lack of determination, even the soundest policies are difficult to translate into success.

History has proven this: our Vietnamese nation has never bowed to any enemy or hardship. From the earliest days of nation-building and nation-defence, our forebears forged a tradition of resilience and indomitability: the greater the hardship and trial, the greater the unity and shared resolve to achieve victory. In the 20th century, under the Party's leadership flag, our nation achieved victories that were “resounding across the five continents and shaking the globe”. In the new era, on the front of socio-economic development, we must all the more bring into full play the spirit of “never retreating, never faltering, only moving forward, advancing ceaselessly”.

Our Party and our People are determined to secure victory in the cause of building and defending the socialist Fatherland, for every delayed step and every unfulfilled objective affect the future of the entire nation. “Success, certain success!” – that is the mindset, the political resolve that we engrave deeply in our hearts as we embark upon the implementation of the Resolution of the 14th Congress.

In a world context marked by constant turbulence, never before have opportunities and challenges been so intricately intertwined as they are today. The destiny of the country depends on our ability to seize opportunities and overcome challenges. Intensive and extensive international integration means that Vietnam faces mounting competitive pressures, yet it also opens doors to the acquisition of knowledge, advanced technology, and development resources from abroad. Economic globalization provides large markets for Vietnamese goods and services, but it also requires us to continuously enhance our endogenous capacities in order to ascend to higher rungs of the global value chain.

Geopolitical fluctuations worldwide may affect the environment of peace and stability – the prerequisite for development – and therefore the task of firmly safeguarding independence, sovereignty, and a peaceful environment becomes ever more vital. The new context demands new thinking and new vision: we must be strategically proactive, constantly vigilant and perceptive in analysing developments, flexible and creative in our responses, steadfast in principles yet not dogmatic or rigid.

With the mettle and intellect of the Vietnamese nation, and with the trust, unity, and consensus of the People, we can affirm that favorable conditions will outweigh challenges. The position and strength of the country, after more than half a century of reunification, have grown stronger than ever before, creating the foundation for us to rise with confidence. The steadily increasing reputation and standing of Vietnam on the international stage constitute favourable conditions for mobilizing the support and cooperation of international friends. What is essential is that we maximize internal strength while harnessing external resources, transforming this combined power into a driving force for national development. Proactive adaptation and vigorous promotion of innovation are precisely the keys that will enable Vietnam to weather storms and advance steadily in an era full of volatility.

Certain victory

At this special moment, more than ever, the words of beloved President Ho Chi Minh continue to resound: “Forward! Total victory will surely be ours!” That call to action from Uncle Ho in those earlier days became an invincible belief, inspiring our entire nation to rise up and win independence and freedom. Today, in the cause of building and defending the Fatherland, that call still surges with momentum, spurring us to strengthen our resolve, overcome poverty and backwardness, and build a prosperous and happy country, standing shoulder to shoulder with friends across the five continents.

Nearly six million Party members and more than 100 million compatriots carry within their hearts a flame of aspiration for a strong and powerful Vietnam. The 14th Congress has entrusted us with the banner of decisive victory. Now is the time for the entire Party, the entire people, and the entire army to tighten ranks, unite in common purpose, and vigorously emulate one another in labor, study, work, and combat, in order to successfully implement the Resolution of the Congress.

Now is the time to turn every guideline and resolution into action and concrete results. The future and destiny of the country urge us to act – to act with even greater determination. The entire Party, the entire people, and the entire army act together in the spirit of “each person working twice as hard”, armed with new knowledge, supported by science and technology, under the guiding light of the Party; we act with indomitable will, advancing on all economic, cultural, and social fronts like “soldiers in peacetime”, and as a result, the effectiveness generated will be tenfold, a hundredfold. From our unwavering faith in the leadership of the Party and in the strength of the People, we together proclaim in unison: “Under the glorious flag of the Party, for the bright future of the nation, advance forward, victory is certain”.",https://t.ex-cdn.com/theinvestor.vn/560w/files/honghanh.nguyen/2026/01/25/1930-party-general-secretary-to-lam-2-191919.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 22:58:42.079092

A harrowing number of people have already been affected by climate change.
You don’t have to look hard to see the effects of global warming.
Our very own state has felt the harsh assault of a storm worsened by climate change.
Global warming is a humanitarian crisis as much as it is a scientific one, and far more than it is an economic one.","When Donald Trump entered the Oval Office in January 2025, he signed an executive order called “Unleashing American Energy. ” This order labeled environmental rules and regulations as “burdensome” to the American people and aimed to reverse them in order to restore cheaper transportation, utilities and manufacturing.

Trump's signature on the bottom of this document was a major stepping stone on his path toward turning climate change into an economic argument, one that fails to account for the endangerment of human health and life.

A harrowing number of people have already been affected by climate change. Thousands more will be harmed in the future. You don’t have to look hard to see the effects of global warming. We’ve seen clips of ravenous fires and cataclysmic hurricanes barrage social media. Other, less public moments, include people with lung cancer due to exposure to harmful air pollutants, heatstroke due to increased temperatures or even mental health problems due to traumatic experiences with a natural disaster.

Climate change is deeply and inherently intertwined with health and human life. To attempt to forget and ignore the past, as well as current and future victims of climate change in the name of money, is a disconcerting decision. However, it is a step that Trump and the Environmental Protection Agency are not only willing — but excited — to take.

In June, the EPA proposed the repeal of rules that limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, aiming to trim billions of dollars in costs for the industry.

Greenhouse gas emissions are the main driver of global warming. And with global warming comes countless attacks on human well-being. Higher global surface temperatures expand the possibility of droughts and increasingly intense storms.

Our very own state has felt the harsh assault of a storm worsened by climate change. When Hurricane Helene hit western North Carolina, rainfall was 10 percent heavier, and the total rainfall was made 70 percent more likely because of climate change. If the world continues to burn fossil fuels at similar rates, reaching two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, catastrophic rainfall events like Helene would become 15 to 25 percent more likely.

For decades, the EPA has assigned monetary value to human well-being, calculating the money saved in health care costs because of the air pollution limits it sets. Recently, the EPA announced that they would no longer be computing this figure, focusing only on the cost for industry and not the worth of human life. This is yet another ruling that values money and efficiency over people like the 91,000 in the U.S. who die each year due to air pollution.

In line with the movement to excavate human life from climate change action, the EPA also proposed to rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding, which declared that greenhouse gases “threaten the public health and welfare. ” Overturning this finding would repeal emission regulations for motor vehicles and engines for the sake of cheaper cars and deliveries.

The proposal alone, of withdrawing the assertion that human beings are endangered by climate change, is a direct attack on human existence.

Climate change isn’t just a rising bar on a graph. Parents have lost children. Houses have been washed away. Global warming is a humanitarian crisis as much as it is a scientific one, and far more than it is an economic one.

One day, climate change will reach your doorstep. You will be the one uploading a video of disastrous flooding in your neighborhood or undergoing chemotherapy in a hospital bed. In the America that Trump is actively working to build, these experiences — your fatigue, dwindling health and crumbling home — will be brushed aside in favor of a cheap, gas-guzzling car and highly-efficient factories unleashing American energy.",https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dth/9071e360-52fd-40b2-ba7e-cb5b13db32ad.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Cedges&ar=16%3A9,N,,2026-01-26 04:01:43.769364

Three years ago these countries set the 300GW target in response to geopolitical shocks, and the Hamburg Declaration will now outline how 100GW will be built through “offshore wind hybrid assets”, which are wind farms directly connected to more than one country using interconnectors.

The Energy Secretary will meet leaders from Germany, France, Belgium, Iceland, Ireland, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark and Norway as they pursue plans to transform the North Sea into a major clean energy reservoir.

“We are standing up for our national interest by driving for clean energy, which can get the UK off the fossil fuel rollercoaster and give us energy sovereignty and abundance,” said Miliband.

“After our record renewables auction, we today go further by signing a clean energy security pact with European allies to ensure we maximise the clean energy potential for the North Sea.”

Industry is expected to unveil plans for new projects in response to the pledge, with interconnectors highlighted as crucial to sending clean power where it is needed and ending reliance on volatile fossil fuel markets controlled by petrostates and dictators.

The UK earlier this month secured 8.4GW of offshore wind in its latest auction, which the government described as the biggest in European history.

Further summit outcomes include a statement of intent between the UK and Germany, Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands to unlock cross-border offshore electricity projects through joint planning, cost-sharing and market arrangements.

The UK will also agree a framework to deepen collaboration with Germany on offshore hybrid assets, which combine offshore wind connections with interconnectors and could open export opportunities for UK firms.

Talks are beginning between the EU and UK on the UK's participation in the EU internal electricity market to drive investment in North Sea clean energy projects and reduce exposure to fossil fuel price volatility.

The summit will additionally feature agreements between NATO and European countries on cyber security cooperation focused on North Sea infrastructure, with leaders warning of increasing threats.

""Today is a step towards a more integrated energy system in the North Seas,” said Ben Wilson, president of National Grid Ventures.

""LionLink and projects like those being announced today are important for maximising the efficient use of resources, reducing costs, and minimising the impact on coastal communities.”

Dhara Vyas, chief executive of Energy UK, added that the sector is “fully behind the landmark efforts” to build a regional clean power hub and deliver 100GW of offshore cooperation projects by 2050.

“This deeper cooperation on supply chains, standardisation, and shared infrastructure is not just a strategic necessity, it is the most effective way to bring down energy costs for households and businesses while fuelling sustainable economic growth and high-value jobs for years to come,” stated Vyas.

Jane Cooper, deputy chief executive of RenewableUK, said the announcement will “increase the energy security of the UK and the whole of the North Sea region significantly”.

“We are strengthening our security collaboration to ensure the North Sea’s critical energy infrastructure is protected from harm, so that we can continue to generate the huge quantities of clean power needed by the UK and our neighbours reliably at all times,” added Cooper.

Gus Jaspert, managing director, marine at The Crown Estate, said the UK offshore wind sector “is a national success story” that attracts investment, supports jobs and boosts energy security.",https://renews.biz/media/35295/miliband-credit-zara-farrar-and-desnz.jpg?width=640,N,,2026-01-25 19:57:59.176931

Hawaii families spend thousands of dollars each year on imported fossil fuels for electricity and transportation.","Hawaii’s high cost of living isn’t driven only by housing and groceries. Energy costs — especially gasoline and electricity — play a major but often overlooked role. Our dependence on imported fossil fuels keeps prices far above the national average, placing a heavy burden on families across the state.

Hawaii has more than 1 million registered gas-powered passenger vehicles, or about 4 for every 5 residents. Gasoline prices here are typically 40% to 50% higher than the U.S. average and frequently the highest in the nation. With more than 400 million gallons of gasoline consumed each year, the costs add up quickly.

At today’s average retail price of about $4.40 per gallon, residents spend roughly $1.75 billion annually on gasoline alone. That is more than $1,700 per gas-powered vehicle every year, much of which is money that leaves Hawaii to pay for imported fuel rather than circulating within the local economy.

Electricity costs are just as punishing. Hawaii has the highest electricity rates in the country, averaging more than 40 cents per kilowatt-hour. The reason is straightforward. More than 60% of our electricity is generated from oil. The average household pays about $212 per month for electricity, or over $2,500 per year.

Rates vary by island, but the underlying problem is the same statewide — heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels. Kauai Island Utility Cooperative shows what’s possible. By moving aggressively toward renewable energy, KIUC transformed its rates from the highest in the state to the lowest.

Renewable energy, particularly solar, is a cost-effective, local alternative to fossil fuel. The AES Maui solar farm, which includes battery storage, generates electricity at roughly 8 cents per kilowatt-hour, far less than oil-fired generation.

Hawaiian Electric reports that about half of a typical electricity bill comes from fuel costs. Based on the utility’s own filings, generating electricity from oil costs roughly 21 cents per kilowatt-hour. If electricity were obtained at 8 cents per kilowatt-hour, estimated retail rates would drop to about 30 cents per kilowatt-hour, which would be a meaningful savings for families.

Lower electricity prices could also reduce transportation costs. An electric vehicle traveling three miles per kilowatt-hour, powered by electricity at 30 cents per kilowatt-hour, costs about 10 cents per mile to drive. A gasoline vehicle getting 30 miles per gallon costs roughly 15 cents per mile at today’s fuel prices. Over time, that difference would translate into real savings.

Hawaii already gets about a quarter of its electricity from the sun, and the potential for growth is enormous. The State Climate Commission’s Hawaii Climate Action Pathways 2025 envisions nearly quadrupling solar generation by 2045 through rooftop systems and utility-scale projects.

However, the transition to clean energy has been slowed by decades of fossil fuel subsidies that built an entrenched and increasingly expensive system. The costs of extraction, shipping, processing and storage make imported fuels less competitive than locally produced renewable energy.

Programs like carbon cashback offer a practical and equitable way forward. By placing a fee on fossil fuel pollution and distributing the revenue directly to residents in equal shares, the program discourages fossil fuel use while helping households pay for essentials.

Proposals to use liquefied natural gas as a “bridge fuel” miss the point. LNG is another polluting fossil fuel and remains, in the long run, more expensive and less sustainable than renewables.

The math is clear. Hawaii families spend thousands of dollars each year on imported fossil fuels for electricity and transportation. Faster adoption of renewable energy and electric vehicles would lower those costs, reduce pollution, and strengthen local energy independence. Carbon cashback would do exactly that.

When former president Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) first took office in 2016, she set ambitious goals for remaking the energy mix in Taiwan. At the core of this effort was a significant expansion of the percentage of renewable energy generated to keep pace with growing domestic and global demands to reduce emissions. This effort met with broad bipartisan support as all three major parties placed expanding renewable energy at the center of their energy platforms. However, over the past several years partisanship has become a major headwind in realizing a set of energy goals that all three parties profess to want.

Tsai made good on a key campaign promise to phase out nuclear energy by 2025 through pushing for an energy transition that featured a rapid expansion of Taiwan’s renewable energy capacity. Power generation targets for 2025, set by the Executive Yuan in December 2017, were to increase renewable energy’s share of gross power generation from 5 percent to 20 percent; drop nuclear power to zero from 12 percent; reduce the share of coal-generated power to 30 percent from 45 percent; and increase LNG’s share to 50 percent from 32 percent.

The nuclear strategy conforms to the Democratic Progressive Party’s (DPP) long-held position against nuclear power, originating in the efforts of the anti-nuclear movement of the 1970s and its role in the formation of the DPP, over safety and environmental concerns while seeking to reduce reliance on imported energy sources and shift to cleaner ones. Her successor, President William Lai Ching-te (賴清德), vowed to continue the same energy policy direction with a “second energy transition” seeking to catalyze what was achieved from 2016 to 2024.

Nearly nine years after the energy transition policy shift began, the structural change to Taiwan’s power generation is clear. Based on the latest data from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, power generation shares by energy sources toward the end of 2025 are remarkably close to the policy targets set in 2017, with one glaring exception — renewable energy.

Renewable energy, including hydro, solar, wind, waste-to-energy, and biomass, produced just over 12 percent of Taiwan’s electricity through November 2025, well off the 20 percent mark. Upon closer examination, one can see that solar installed capacity growth has slowed significantly in 2025, while installed capacity of waste-to-energy, which contributes about 1.2 percent of power generation, has been stagnant since 2023. In 2025 this prompted the Ministry of Economic Affairs to quietly reset the timeline for the 20 percent target to November 2026, a date which may see further outward revisions.

The Executive Yuan’s own Annual Report on National Sustainable Development pointed out some of the reasons for the slower-than-expected adoption of renewable energy: solar power was affected by local governments’ interpretation of regulations and residents’ concerns about the environmental impact on solar farm sites. And biomass and waste-to-energy facilities are stalled by stock feeds collection issues and system operation.

What’s more worrisome is that renewable energy companies appear to have become prime targets for partisan rancor, creating significant uncertainties and unforeseen risks for investors in this sector. That is going to have a negative longer-term impact on public-private efforts to expand and modernize Taiwan’s power generation and grid.

Taiwan’s economy is partly driven by the partnership between domestic manufacturers and global technology giants such as AWS, Microsoft and Google. These global companies place significant demands on their Taiwanese suppliers to produce their sourced products with renewable energy. There are hard deadlines in future years where suppliers must reach 100 percent of production utilizing renewable, zero-emission sources. There is a finite amount of this energy in Taiwan and an absence of supply will inhibit growth in these partnerships while adding costs as supply tightens and demand expands. The only viable solution is to speed up the supply of renewables to reduce the cost and ensure supply meets the demands of global partners.

There are several examples illustrating the growing headwinds to expanding renewable energy.

Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) lawmakers last year alleged Kaohsiung’s lack of supervision resulted in solar vendors causing damage to hillside areas. The reaction to this situation and other solar-related ecosystem impact complaints caused a recent, November 2025, set of amendments to the Environmental Impact Assessment Act (環境影響評估法), the Act for the Development of Tourism (發展觀光條例) and the Geology Act (地質法), jointly supported by both the opposition KMT and the Taiwan People’s Party (TPP). They passed the Legislative Yuan resulting in significant increases in the environmental impact review burden for companies installing solar panels. These actions expanded the bureaucracy, adding time and cost.

Three previously approved waste-to-energy, or solid recovered fuel (SRF), companies in Taoyuan, including US-invested Taiwan Cube, were forced to cease construction or simply withdraw in 2024, after local lawmakers and residents made pollution claims into an election issue. Such a flipflop of a major multi-governmental administrative decision (local and national) affecting large, long-term investments removed renewable energy capacity that could help to not only reduce burgeoning waste, but also produce much-needed renewable electricity. The case also sets a negative precedent for Taiwan as an attractive location for foreign investment.

This latter point is important. The just completed tariff negotiations with the United States seek to place Taiwan as the strategic partner for the US in the development of artificial intelligence technologies, a huge opportunity that could continue to turbo-charge Taiwan’s economy in the coming years; however, it will require power and an investment environment that is transparent and reliable. The situation in Taoyuan undermines future renewable energy production, the removal of waste, and the attractiveness of Taiwan as a market for global capital.

The closing of Taiwan’s nuclear power stations too is a lamentable development. Nuclear power produces zero emissions, is clean and reliable, and should be playing an important role in Taiwan’s ongoing energy transition. The recent loss of three plants has hurt both efforts to reduce emissions as well as Taiwan’s national security, given the absence of energy supply chains in comparison to those needed to power coal, oil and LNG plants. Nuclear power is a plus when we consider Chinese blockade and quarantine scenarios that disrupt incoming energy supplies. It is a modest but welcome development that one of the power plants may yet be restored through efforts by the KMT and that Lai continues to leave open the possibility of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) to power the island in the future. SMRs are attractive but some years away from a mature technology ready for island-wide utility. Politics has undermined an important power source that produces zero emissions.

Environmental protection is fundamentally important to the health and welfare of all countries and should be taken into consideration when assessing renewable energy projects. But the stark reality is that Taiwan is falling behind in its renewable energy goals. While the excesses of more radical environmental demands in Europe have dissipated due to concerns over high prices and the reliability of grids that are overly reliant on renewables, the need for a healthy mix of power sources, including renewables, remains a must.

Pursuing an ambitious renewable energy goal will require bipartisan vision, political will and reliability, and a set of policies that can attract global capital. That was a goal all three parties agreed was important for national advancement as recently as 2016.

It’s time for all parties to stop using renewable energy projects for short-term political gain, otherwise the 20 percent renewable energy target could well remain elusive, endangering important national commitments to the Taiwanese and to the global community.",https://img.taipeitimes.com/images/2026/01/26/p08-260126_RupertHammond-Chambers.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 21:58:44.709422

The order can also be invoked if the Texas power grid falls to emergency level three.

What we don't know: It is unclear if the use of backup generators will be needed during the current arctic blast.","The U.S. Department of Energy on Sunday issued an emergency order for the deployment of backup energy resources to mitigate blackouts in Texas.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright called on the Energy Reliability Council of Texas to require major facilities like data centers to operate their backup generators to help reduce the risk of blackouts amid increased energy demands during the winter storm.

What they're saying:

""The Trump administration is committed to unleashing all available power generation needed to keep Americans safe during Winter Storm Fern,"" Wright said. ""The Trump administration will continue taking action to ensure that the 35 GW of untapped backup generation that exists across the country can be deployed as needed during Winter Storm Fern and in the future.""

What does the emergency order do?

What we know:

The order directs ERCOT to require large energy consumers to use backup generators after using all of ERCOT's resources. The order can also be invoked if the Texas power grid falls to emergency level three.

Under section 202c of the Federal Power Act, the Department of Energy has the authority to make temporary changes to the U.S. electric system and ""require by order such temporary connections of facilities and such generation, delivery, interchange, or transmission of electric energy as in its judgment will best meet the emergency and serve the public interest.""

While the Federal Power Act allows for a waiver of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, an emergency order must ""'to the maximum extent practicable' ensure the order is consistent with environmental laws or regulations and ‘minimizes any adverse environmental impacts.’""

The order would not require defense, homeland security, first responder, air traffic control, hospital facilities, 911 call centers, water treatment or wastewater facilities, natural gas pipeline facilities, natural gas gathering facilities, or other similar facilities to use their backup generators.

ERCOT is required to tell the Department of Energy within one day of directing facilities to use backup generation.

What we don't know:

It is unclear if the use of backup generators will be needed during the current arctic blast.

According to the agency's dashboard, ERCOT's grid is operating under normal conditions with sufficient operating reserves for its current demand.

Power outages in Texas

As of Sunday afternoon, findenergy.com is showing more than 83,000 Texans are without power. A majority of those impacted are in east Texas.

According to ERCOT, current power outages are likely local outages and not an issue with the grid.

One analysis found that bills from Indiana’s five investor-owned electric utilities shows went up 17.5% in one year, or $28 a month on average statewide.

Indeed, my husband is a hawk at turning off lights, watching the thermostat and making energy-efficient decisions.

But our bill has still ballooned — with the cooling and heating seasons delivering truly astounding bills.

One analysis found that bills from Indiana’s five investor-owned electric utilities shows went up 17.5% in one year, or $28 a month on average statewide.

So, I was excited to hear that House Republicans would be tackling utility affordability.

But the bill won’t help all Hoosiers.

The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission oversees eight electric utilities and 17 natural gas utilities in the state, according to the commission. However, more than 100 municipal and Rural Electric Membership Cooperatives have withdrawn from the commission’s rate jurisdiction. That includes my provider.

Kerwin Olson, executive director of the consumer-focused Citizens Action Coalition, estimates up to 20% of Hoosiers aren’t protected by regulators — about one in five Hoosiers.

“The rationale is largely that those customers are taxpayers and constituents or voting members and can take complaints directly to the utility. Their only recourse really is common courts if they are not satisfied,” he said.

Olson thinks it’s fair in the context of investor-owned utilities needing more oversight. He does wish some of the state rules on deposits, late fees, reconnect charges and efficiency programs applied to all utilities.

But that’s a fight for another day.

Legislative efforts

The rest of you should be watching House Bill 1002.

Most of the bill doesn’t do anything to reduce or control your gas and electric bills. It instead provides ways to cope with them. But that doesn’t mean those provisions aren’t important.

The bill would do the following:

Require an electricity supplier that is under the jurisdiction of the IURC to offer a low-income customer assistance program that provides financial assistance to low-income residential customers for the payment of monthly bills for utility service.

Block service shut-offs to those customers during dangerously hot months. This protection already exists for cold-weather months — another time when bills jump but disconnection could harm Hoosiers.

Put all ratepayers on predictable billing plans. These plans level out your monthly bills so that your costs are more consistent. But they don’t control or lower them. And ratepayers could opt out of the program if they want.

The one section that could have a positive future impact is performance-based ratemaking.

It’s a newer concept, under consideration in other states, that would tie future rate increase requests to specific metrics. The Indiana bill would pair the new multi-year rate plans with performance metrics and incentives tied to customer affordability and service restoration.

Lawmakers may also look at peak load demand or environmental sustainability.

It’s unclear if the incentives would be enough to truly impact future rate increases, and customers wouldn’t see change for several years. But it’s a worthy discussion to have as Hoosiers struggle with higher costs.

Gov. Mike Braun is hoping to move the needle by revamping IURC’s membership and targeting rate hikes that pad company profits at the expense of ratepayers.

“Affordability is why I support Rep. Alaina Shonkwiler’s bill to hold investor-owned utility companies accountable to provide affordable energy before they can increase their profit margin,” he said during his State of the State speech.

“And it’s why I appointed three ratepayer-conscious members, now constituting a majority, to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission — to make decisions in the public interest to ensure utilities provide service at just and reasonable rates.”

Between the executive and legislative efforts, it’s my hope that Hoosiers will start to see the cost curve bend to a more reasonable level after years of increases.",,N,,2026-01-25 16:59:08.968658

With new innovation and technologies things are possible and we must shift to clean energy for the benefit of each and every living being on the planet.","26th January is the International day of Clean Energy

We should know that over 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from burning fossil fuels for energy and every $1 invested in renewable energy creates 3 times more jobs than in the fossil fuel industry. Polluting fuels for cooking causes 3.2 million premature deaths annually while clean cooking can prevent many of these.

Globally the energy sector, dominated by fossil fuels, accounts for 34 percent of human-caused greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with a total of 20 Gigatons (Gt) of GHG globally (IPCC, 2023). Global CO2 emissions should be halved by 2030 to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement.

We need energy and more importantly clean energy. Energy lies at the core of a double challenge: leaving no one behind and protecting the Planet. Our challenge is to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels to source our electricity, supply our heating and cooling needs, and power our industry and transportation, by accelerating the transition to sustainable and affordable energy for all.

At a time when we are all getting more questions than answers due to climate change, clean energy plays a vital role in reducing emissions, and can also benefit communities lacking access to reliable power sources. But the global data says that 666 million people live in the dark – more than 85 percent of them in Sub-Saharan Africa.

We are aware that a large chunk of the greenhouse gases that blanket the Earth and trap the Sun’s heat are generated through energy production, by burning fossil fuels (oil, coal, and gas) to generate electricity and heat.

Our agenda must be clear and it must focus on limiting climate change. To do this , we need to end our reliance on fossil fuels and invest in alternative sources of energy that are clean, accessible, affordable, sustainable, and reliable. Renewable energy sources – which are available in abundance all around us, provided by the sun, wind, water, waste, and heat from the Earth – are replenished by nature and emit little to no greenhouse gases or pollutants into the air.

The International Day of Clean Energy on 26 January was declared by the United Nations General Assembly (resolution A/77/327) as a call to raise awareness and mobilize action for a just and inclusive transition to clean energy for the benefit of people and the planet. 26th January is also the founding date of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), a global intergovernmental agency established in 2009 to support countries in their energy transitions, serve as a platform for international cooperation, and provide data and analyses on clean energy technology, innovation, policy, finance and investment. In 2023, the power sector was the largest source of global greenhouse gas emissions. We have to take more and more action to reach net-zero by 2050. It’s time to move to alternate and the positive side is that renewable energy sources — such as sunlight, wind, water, organic waste, and heat from the Earth — are abundant, replenished by nature, and emit little to no greenhouse gases or air pollutants. About 80 per cent of the global population lives in countries that are net-importers of fossil fuels – that’s about 6 billion people who are dependent on fossil fuels from other countries, which makes them vulnerable to geopolitical shocks and crises. In contrast, renewable energy sources are available in all countries, and their potential is yet to be fully harnessed.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 99 percent of people in the world breathe air that exceeds air quality limits and threatens their health. Air pollution is associated with 7 million premature deaths every year. The unhealthy levels of fine particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide originate mainly from the burning of fossil fuels.

Prices for renewable energy technologies are dropping rapidly. Over 90 per cent of new renewable projects are now cheaper than fossil fuels alternatives. On the positive note, clean energy sector jobs already outnumber fossil fuel jobs – employing almost 35 million people worldwide. In 2023, 16.2 million people were employed in the renewable energy sector, up from 13.7 million in 2022. The transition towards net-zero emissions will lead to an overall increase in energy sector jobs, while about 5 million jobs in fossil fuel production could be lost by 2030, an estimated 14 million new jobs would be created in clean energy, resulting in a net gain of 9 million jobs.

Our energy consumption must be sustainable and to ensure a sustainable future, we need to end our reliance on fossil fuels and invest in alternative sources of energy that are clean, accessible, affordable, sustainable, and reliable. With new innovation and technologies things are possible and we must shift to clean energy for the benefit of each and every living being on the planet. We must not forget that we do not have any other planet to live.

A clean energy future is within reach.","On this International Day of Clean Energy, we can feel the world shifting – but we must pick up the pace.

The science tells us we are heading for a temporary overshoot above 1.5 degrees Celsius. Our responsibility is to make that breach as small, as short, and as safe as possible – through a just, orderly and equitable transition away from fossil fuels.

Renewables are the engine that can drive this transition. They are the cheapest source of new power in most places. And last year, for the first time, wind, solar, and other renewables generated more electricity worldwide than coal.

Renewable energy connects communities still left in the dark, provides clean cooking, and opens the door to better health, education, and opportunities. Renewables anchor new industries, create decent jobs and lower energy costs, while shielding countries from geopolitical shocks and market volatility.

Even so, the renewables revolution is not moving fast enough or far enough. Grid infrastructure is lagging well behind the expansion of clean energy capacity, and high costs continue to shut many countries out of the transition entirely.

The roadmap is clear: we must triple global renewable capacity by 2030, by lifting barriers, cutting costs, and connecting clean power to people and industry – with scale, speed, and solidarity.

Regulators must adopt policies that reward clean power and streamline permitting while protecting people and nature. Utilities must upgrade, expand, and digitize grids and interconnections, to carry clean power where it is needed, and scale storage so power systems stay steady as renewables grow. Industry must diversify supply chains so more countries can manufacture, install, and maintain clean energy systems. This includes the critical minerals essential to the transition, which must benefit producing countries and communities – not just global markets.

Finance must bring down the cost of capital, especially for developing countries with vast renewable potential. And multilateral development banks must reduce risk and unlock far greater private investment.

Most importantly, we must ensure this transition is just – protecting workers and communities, supporting education, industrial development, and opportunity for all as energy systems evolve.

A clean energy future is within reach. Let us seize the moment – and bring the renewables revolution to every corner of the world.",https://bangladesh.un.org/profiles/undg_country/themes/custom/undg/images/un-flag.png,N,,2026-01-25 20:58:01.792312

While improvements in vehicle battery technology have led to increased battery range, consumers are still left wondering how long they can expect their vehicle battery to last. After all, the battery pack is the most expensive part of an electric car, with a new battery costing upwards of $20,000.

So what can you expect for an electric vehicle’s battery lifespan? We have the important answers.

What are EV Batteries?

Internal combustion engined cars are powered by gasoline, while EVs are powered by a battery pack driving one or more electric motors. The batteries that power electric cars are rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which is the same type of battery found in cell phones and other consumer electronics. Lithium-ion batteries have a higher energy density than lead-acid or nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries, which means they don’t take up as much space while providing an equivalent level of power. A vehicle’s battery capacity is measured in kilowatt hours (kWh), so a vehicle with a higher kWh rating means it has more range.

How Long Do EV Batteries Last?

The lifespan of an EV battery depends on a number of factors. While battery life can vary, EV manufacturers are generally required to issue a warranty for at least 8 years or 100,000 miles. However, some manufacturers offer longer warranties. Kia offers a battery pack warranty for 10 years or 100,000 miles, and Hyundai provides warranty coverage on EV batteries for the vehicle’s entire lifetime. Battery warranties vary not only by time but also by the nature of the coverage. Some automakers will only replace the battery if it completely fails, while others, like BMW, Tesla, and Volkswagen, will cover a battery if its capacity falls below a certain percentage.

Recent studies show that EV batteries may retain around 90% capacity after 100,000 kilometers and about 87% after 300,000 kilometers, with an annual degradation rate of approximately 1.8%. For example, a Tesla Model S only loses an estimated five percent of battery capacity over its first 50,000 miles. As battery technology continues to evolve, companies are creating larger batteries with increased range and reduced degradation. The first-generation Nissan LEAF had a maximum range of 84 miles, while the newest LEAF has a maximum range of 212 miles.

Modern electric car batteries are increasingly designed to last the entire life of the vehicle, reducing the likelihood of needing a battery replacement. With advancements in battery management systems and engineering, an EV battery is expected to last 10-20 years, depending on maintenance and care.

How to Prolong the Life of Your Electric Vehicle Battery

Just like there are preventative maintenance measures to extend the life of your gasoline vehicle, there are EV charging measures you can take to prolong your EV’s battery life. Here are the top tips to protect your EV battery’s health:

1. Avoid parking in extreme temperatures

Lithium batteries have thermal management systems that will heat or cool themselves, which in turn uses energy and drains EV battery packs. Try to park in the shade if possible on hot days and inside in extreme cold temperatures to assist battery longevity.

2. Don’t Charge Your Car Too Much or Too Little

Modern electric cars are equipped with management systems that avoid charging and discharging at the maximum and minimum charging levels. You should avoid charging your vehicle above 80 percent or below 20 percent to extend EV battery life.

3. Minimize Use of Fast Charging Stations

DC fast charging stations can bring your battery level up to 80 percent in as little as 30 minutes. With this convenience comes a strain on your EV battery. For optimal battery life, you should limit how often you plug in to these fast charging stations for occasional scenarios, like road trips.

4. Maintain Optimal State of Charge While Vehicle is Stored

If you are planning on storing your vehicle for a long time, make sure that your battery does not have an empty or full charge. With a timed charger, you can set it to maintain the charging level between 25 and 75 percent.

Second Life of EV Batteries

When an automotive EV battery’s performance dips below 70 percent, it can have a second life when it is no longer useful to power a vehicle. There are many applications to repurpose EV batteries for renewable energy sources including home battery storage systems and powering manufacturing plants. In Japan, Toyota has installed EV batteries to store power generated from solar panels.

1. Avoid parking in extreme temperatures

Lithium batteries have thermal management systems that will heat or cool themselves, which in turn uses energy and drains EV battery packs. Try to park in the shade if possible on hot days and inside in extreme cold temperatures to assist battery longevity.

2. Don’t Charge Your Car Too Much or Too Little

Modern electric cars are equipped with management systems that avoid charging and discharging at the maximum and minimum charging levels. You should avoid charging your vehicle above 80 percent or below 20 percent to extend EV battery life.

3. Minimize Use of Fast Charging Stations

DC fast charging stations can bring your battery level up to 80 percent in as little as 30 minutes. With this convenience comes a strain on your EV battery. For optimal battery life, you should limit how often you plug in to these fast charging stations for occasional scenarios, like road trips.

4. Maintain Optimal State of Charge While Vehicle is Stored

If you are planning on storing your vehicle for a long time, make sure that your battery does not have an empty or full charge. With a timed charger, you can set it to maintain the charging level between 25 and 75 percent.

Second Life of EV Batteries

When an automotive EV battery’s performance dips below 70 percent, it can have a second life when it is no longer useful to power a vehicle. There are many applications to repurpose EV batteries for renewable energy sources including home battery storage systems and powering manufacturing plants. In Japan, Toyota has installed EV batteries to store power generated from solar panels.

Bottom Line

While an electric car’s battery life can vary, advancements in technology have helped ensure that it typically lasts for the lifespan of a vehicle. The main factor for prolonging a battery’s life expectancy is to limit the number of charging cycles each battery cell goes through. Battery cells die when a battery reaches its empty or full state of charge for too long, so make sure you charge your vehicle according to the manufacturer’s instructions to minimize battery degradation.

EV and plug-in hybrid market share dropped below 8% in January 2026—down nearly four percentage points from last year—after the $7,500 federal tax credit disappeared on October 1, 2025. Pure EVs now grab just 6.6% of new retail sales, down 2.9 percentage points year-over-year, while plug-in hybrids sank to 0.9%. Average EV transaction prices jumped 18.1% to $51,981, while gas vehicles crept up just 0.9% to $45,510. Your monthly payment? Now $760 on average—up $24 from last year.

Manufacturers are hemorrhaging cash trying to stop the bleeding. Automakers are dumping $5,700 per EV in incentive spending—more than $2,000 higher than last year—trying to replace the lost federal credit. That's nearly double what they spend on hybrids and $2,500 more than gas cars get. Buyers are walking away. EV sales plummeted once the tax credit math flipped, and only 44% of EV transactions are structured as leases now—down 30 percentage points from January 2025.

Gas Cars Win the Discount War

The money automakers saved by selling fewer EVs went straight into gas and hybrid discounts. Non-EV incentives hit $3,004 per vehicle—up $403 from last year—while traditional hybrids are eating up 14.7% of sales, a 1.4-percentage-point gain. Internal combustion engines claimed 77.7% of sales, up 2.7 percentage points from last year. Total new-vehicle sales for January are projected at 1.12 million units, down 2.7% year-over-year. Consumers will spend $39.7 billion on new vehicles this month, but 27.3% of trade-ins now carry negative equity—up 2.4 percentage points—and 11.7% of buyers are stretching into 84-month loans just to make the math work.

My Verdict

If you're shopping for an EV right now, wait until March or April. Dealers are sitting on inventory they need to clear, and manufacturers are still figuring out how to price these things without federal help. Gas cars and hybrids are getting the best deals in years—if you don't need electric range, buy there instead and pocket the savings. If you're committed to electric, charging infrastructure is finally improving, but the price premium without tax credits is real. Run the total cost of ownership over five years—including insurance, maintenance, and electricity costs—before you sign. Don't let dealer incentives distract you from what you'll actually pay.",https://s.yimg.com/os/en/men_s_journal_718/6157c47e9ada3c5a2790798deefa5197,N,,2026-01-25 13:58:47.515634

The outages, which were concentrated in Tennessee, Mississippi and Louisiana, came after warnings from weather forecasters that Winter Storm Fern could threaten the power grid and test utilities’ ability to meet the surge in demand.

The Trump administration took swift action to shore up some power supplies, with the Energy Department granting PJM Interconnection, the country’s largest electric grid operator, blanket permission to run all its power sources at full tilt — regardless of pollution rules in its region that reaches from the Midwest to the Mid-Atlantic.

The concern about energy supplies will grow in the coming days as Fern plunges millions into a cold spell that will put a significant draw on heating and electricity resources. The polar vortex conditions that plunged Arctic air all the way to the Gulf Coast are expected to drive temperatures even lower through the end of the week, running the risk of exhausting power supplies or debilitating the electricity grid.

The chief threat to the electric grid comes from ice and freezing rain that can topple trees and strain power lines. Given the storm’s expansive geographic range, utilities may have fewer personnel to dispatch to help neighboring regions deal with outages as they face disruptions in their own territories.

“The ice is the big concern this week and that’s scary,” said Allison Clements, a former commissioner on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. “When these types of things happen, you can’t control the ice. You can’t control the tree branch break.”

As of 4:15 p.m. EST Sunday, Tennessee experienced the most outages in the country, at more than 308,000, according to PowerOutage.us. Mississippi had more than 149,000 customers without power, trailed by 138,000 in Louisiana, 103,000 in Georgia, 80,000 in Texas, 67,000 in Kentucky, 33,000 in West Virginia and 28,000 in South Carolina.

Georgia Power said it restored power to 70,000 customers as of 4 p.m. EST, though another 70,000 concentrated in north Georgia and Atlanta are still without electricity.

“The bulk of these outages are caused [by] trees laden with ice falling on power lines. We currently have more than 10,000 crews working diligently to repair these outages,” the utility said in a statement. “We are confident that we can meet demand [in] the next week.”

All told, 200 million people face some mix of sleet, snow, ice and frigid temperatures sweeping the nation which makes for a “deadly combination,” AccuWeather meteorologist Brandon Buckingham said in a Sunday note.

Power loss is the main threat to life over the coming days — and pressure on the power grid is mounting. The storm has added stress to the utilities and operators that were already struggling to meet rising demand fueled by the influx of data centers, artificial intelligence and other large customers. That all has shrunk the power generating slack in the system, bringing electric reliability concerns to the forefront.

PJM said Sunday that peak demand for its 13-state footprint is expected to surpass 130,000 megawatts for seven consecutive days for the first time ever, noting extreme cold conditions may persist through Feb. 1. It said the region could set an all-time winter peak load record on Tuesday and activated pre-emergency measures for utilities BGE, Pepco and Dominion to curtail electricity usage to preserve supplies.

“This is a formidable arctic cold front coming our way, and it will impact our neighboring systems as much as it affects PJM,” Mike Bryson Sr., vice president of operations at PJM, said in a statement. “We will be relying on our generation fleet to perform as well as they did during last year’s record winter peak.”

DOE also tapped data centers and other large customers within Texas’ grid to bring their backup onsite power onto the public grid, a move that allowed those generators to skirt pollution rules.

“As Winter Storm Fern brings extreme cold and dangerous conditions to the Mid-Atlantic, maintaining affordable, reliable, and secure power in the PJM region is non-negotiable,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.

Benchmark natural gas prices surged more than 80 percent in the three days before the storm, a jump that consulting firm Wood Mackenzie said was the largest increase in history. Supplies could get trapped if gas infrastructure in the Gulf Coast, which is unaccustomed to single-digit temperatures, succumbs to strain. Such a failure of natural gas infrastructure occurred during Winter Storm Uri in 2021 that killed 246 people in Texas.

Real-time electricity costs across the eastern half of the country soared on the storm demand, and operators overseeing New England and New York’s grid said consumption was outpacing forecasts by more than 3 percent as of 10:30 a.m. The Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which handles the grid from the Dakotas to Michigan south to Louisiana, said demand was below its forecasted peak, although it operated under alert for a few hours on Saturday due to “unplanned generator outages.”

Though the power disruptions so far appeared to be due to the storm, the frigid conditions to come this week could make the grid vulnerable to what the North American Electric Reliability Corp. warned in its latest winter reliability assessment: that several parts of the U.S. do not have sufficient energy supplies to meet demand during an extreme winter.

In its application to DOE requesting the emergency order, PJM said it has already experienced outages “trending up to 20,000 MW,” adding that “there are many other unknowns that could exacerbate already tightening system conditions.”

PJM has been the subject of scrutiny for rising prices as demand has squeezed power supply. The Trump administration has blamed the Biden administration and state policies that it contends incentivized solar and wind with artificially low prices that pushed gas, nuclear and coal power plants off the grid. Wright has said that has left customers in jeopardy of power outages during searing heatwaves or deep winter freezes.

On Sunday, those gas, coal and nuclear resources supplied an overwhelming majority of electricity to the nation’s largest customer base. Gas met more than 39 percent of PJM’s load, while nuclear supplied 26 percent and coal nearly 23 percent, while wind fed just shy of 5 percent.

“The claim that [Virginia] or any PJM state can run a modern grid without dispatchable gen is reckless. Facts are stubborn things,” former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chair Mark Christie posted on X.

Utilities spent the last week shoring up infrastructure by reinforcing wires and cutting tree branches to prevent major disruptions.

The Edison Electric Institute, a trade association representing investor-owned utilities, said companies marshaled 63,000 workers from 43 states and the District of Columbia to sites in the storm’s path. EEI spokesperson Brian Reil said that was comparable to the personnel deployed to the theater of Hurricane Helene, the 2024 storm that inflicted $78.7 billion worth of damage across North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and Virginia.

Ice is Fern’s key threat. Even a quarter-inch of ice layers tree branches with exponentially more weight, raising the chances of limbs breaking and damaging wires. Half an inch can snap electrical wires. Beyond that, treacherous ice can prevent or delay response teams from accessing compromised infrastructuring and prolong recovery time.

“We’re expecting a very serious situation if the worst comes with this storm,” Duke Energy spokesperson Riley Cook said, noting the utility had dispatched 18,000 employees to 22 critical sites. “We could be seeing power lines come down or tree limbs fall on our power lines, and we have to get those up.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/02/8a/18383c894775896d4c5519271e3a/winter-weather-chicago-33622.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 18:00:41.171399

Of course, we who follow electric vehicles know China is the world’s largest EV manufacturer. It’s also clear there are many affordable Chinese EVs — much more affordable than in some other countries. There might be less clarity about how much China is also leading in the number of EV chargers, which makes sense for a country that has the largest number of fully electric vehicles.

To get straight to it, here are some points recently published by China’s National Energy Administration: “By the end of December 2025, the number of electric vehicle charging facilities in my country reached 20.092 million, exceeding the 20 million mark. Among them, there were 4.717 million public charging facilities (guns) and 15.375 million private charging facilities (guns). Currently, my country has built the world’s largest electric vehicle charging network, supporting the charging needs of over 40 million new energy vehicles.”

Another claim in the article is that going from 10 million chargers to 20 million only took about 18 months. Many of China’s chargers are fast ones as well. Quite a few chargers have been installed in highway service areas, with almost full coverage of those areas now provided for long-distance driving.

For the sake of comparison, Europe has a little over one million public EV chargers. The US may have only about 237,000 non-home chargers.

China has great motivation for switching to full EVs, far too much toxic air pollution. Air pollution from fossil fuels harms many people in China every year and contributes to far too many premature deaths.

“Every year, more than four million people around the world die prematurely from breathing dirty air. In China alone, the number of deaths attributable to air pollution exceeds one million annually. That figure may not come as a surprise; after all, we are routinely treated to images in the media of thick, sooty smog enveloping Beijing, Shanghai, and other Chinese cities.”

There are some people who try to criticize electric vehicles by claiming they all run on electricity generated by coal, which is not true. Much electricity is now generated from clean, renewable sources: hydropower, solar power, wind power, etc. China is a world leader in solar power and in battery manufacturing, so it is poised to decrease its reliance on fossil fuels and become more energy independent while reducing toxic air pollution.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ChatGPT-Image-Jan-25-2026-10_36_46-AM-800x533.png,N,,2026-01-25 14:58:30.950944

In a press release, CATL stated that the whitepaper identifies five interdependent actions that are needed in order to strengthen system resilience:

Design batteries for circularity, not disposal

Rethink battery service within optimized energy–mobility systems

Scale circular business models that treat batteries as long-term assets

Build and co-invest in regional circular infrastructure

Enable a circular operating system through data, standards, and policy

Speaking at The Foundation’s Leadership Briefing, Jiang Li, Vice-Chairman and Board Secretary of CATL highlighted: “This report marks a major milestone in the global journey towards a circular battery economy. Circular battery systems must now be scaled across regions, industries, and applications — from EVs to energy storage — and adapted to diverse market contexts.”

“As EV adoption accelerates, a circular economy for batteries and critical minerals is no longer optional — it is essential to affordability, resilience, and long-term growth while reducing environmental and social impacts,” said Wen-Yu Weng, Executive Leader for Critical Minerals at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. “EV batteries are strategic assets, and circular approaches are key to retaining their value and ensuring critical minerals never become waste. We welcome CATL’s contribution and look forward to continued collaboration to help scale a truly circular battery system and support the wider energy transition.”",https://www.canadianmanufacturing.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GECC.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 12:59:04.942326

In the bustling showrooms of Chevrolet dealerships across the United States, models like the Bolt EV and Equinox EV have been turning heads with their surprisingly low price tags. Priced under $30,000 after incentives, these vehicles represent a beacon of hope for mass-market electrification, promising to democratize access to zero-emission driving. But beneath this veneer of affordability lies a brewing storm of economic pressures that could soon inflate costs, making these budget-friendly options a relic of the past. Industry analysts and automakers are sounding alarms about supply chain vulnerabilities, particularly those tied to international trade dynamics.

The core issue revolves around the batteries that power these electric vehicles (EVs). Chevrolet, a division of General Motors, has relied on cost-effective components sourced from global suppliers, including those in China, to keep prices competitive. However, recent policy shifts in Washington are poised to disrupt this delicate balance. Proposed tariffs on imported batteries and related materials could add thousands of dollars to the production costs of vehicles like the Bolt, potentially forcing GM to pass those expenses onto consumers.

This isn’t mere speculation; it’s grounded in the realities of global trade tensions. As the U.S. seeks to bolster domestic manufacturing, measures aimed at curbing reliance on foreign tech are gaining traction. For Chevrolet’s EV lineup, which has been praised for undercutting rivals like Tesla’s Model 3 in price, these changes could erode their market edge. Dealerships from California to Michigan are already whispering about inventory adjustments in anticipation of higher sticker prices.

Rising Tariffs and the Battery Supply Chain Squeeze

The Biden administration’s push for tariffs on Chinese goods, including EV batteries, stems from a broader strategy to protect American jobs and reduce dependence on overseas production. According to a report from Digital Trends, these tariffs could increase the cost of key components by up to 25%, directly impacting models like the Chevrolet Bolt. This isn’t isolated; similar concerns echo across the industry, with experts predicting a ripple effect on all affordable EVs.

Beyond tariffs, the supply chain for lithium-ion batteries is fraught with volatility. Raw materials such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel have seen price fluctuations driven by geopolitical events and mining constraints. For instance, disruptions in African cobalt mines and Australian lithium exports have already pushed costs upward. General Motors has invested heavily in North American battery plants, like the Ultium Cells facility in Ohio, but scaling these operations to meet demand remains a challenge, potentially leading to short-term reliance on pricier domestic alternatives.

Automotive insiders point out that Chevrolet’s strategy of offering sub-$30,000 EVs hinges on economies of scale from global sourcing. If tariffs force a pivot to U.S.-based suppliers, the transition could involve not just higher material costs but also investments in new infrastructure. A recent analysis from BloombergNEF highlights how such shifts might add $2,000 to $5,000 per vehicle, a burden that budget-conscious buyers may not absorb easily.

Geopolitical Tensions Fueling Price Volatility

Trade wars aren’t new, but their intensification under recent administrations has amplified risks for the EV sector. The U.S. Commerce Department’s investigations into Chinese subsidies for battery manufacturers have led to calls for steeper duties, as detailed in a Wall Street Journal piece exploring the broader implications for American consumers. This comes at a time when EV adoption is accelerating, with sales projected to reach 10 million units globally this year.

Chevrolet’s parent company, GM, has been vocal about these challenges. In earnings calls, executives have warned that without policy relief or accelerated domestic production, affordable models could see price hikes of 10% or more. This sentiment is echoed on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), where industry watchers such as @EVExpert and @AutoInsiderNews have shared threads on how tariffs might stifle competition, linking to real-time data from trade monitoring sites.

Moreover, the European Union’s parallel moves to impose tariffs on Chinese EVs add another layer of complexity. As reported by Reuters, this global clampdown could reroute supply chains, increasing costs for U.S. importers. For Chevrolet, which assembles many EVs in Mexico and Canada under NAFTA provisions, these international pressures might necessitate redesigns or sourcing overhauls, further inflating expenses.

Domestic Manufacturing Push: Opportunities and Hurdles

The silver lining in this scenario is the U.S. government’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which offers tax credits for domestically produced EVs and batteries. Chevrolet’s Bolt EV qualifies for up to $7,500 in federal incentives, helping offset potential price increases. However, as a New York Times investigation notes, the IRA’s strict domestic content requirements could exclude vehicles with foreign batteries, pressuring GM to accelerate localization efforts.

GM’s Ultium battery platform is central to this shift. Joint ventures with LG Energy Solution are ramping up production in states like Tennessee and Michigan, aiming to produce millions of cells annually. Yet, scaling these facilities involves billions in capital, and any delays—such as those caused by labor shortages or regulatory approvals—could prolong dependence on imported parts, exacerbating cost pressures.

Industry veterans argue that while domestic manufacturing builds resilience, it comes at a premium. A study from the International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that U.S. battery costs could remain 20% higher than Chinese counterparts until 2030, even with subsidies. This disparity underscores why Chevrolet’s affordable EVs might soon carry a heftier price tag, challenging the narrative of EVs as accessible to the average American.

Consumer Impacts and Market Shifts

For everyday buyers, the prospect of rising EV prices is daunting. Take Sarah Jenkins, a teacher from Denver who recently purchased a Chevrolet Equinox EV for its $27,000 post-incentive price. “It was the only way I could afford to go electric,” she told reporters. But if tariffs push that figure to $32,000 or more, as speculated in forums on X, it could deter similar purchases, slowing the green transition.

Dealers are preparing for this by diversifying inventories, stocking more hybrid options that aren’t as tariff-sensitive. A Automotive News article details how GM is lobbying for exemptions, arguing that abrupt changes could harm sales momentum. Indeed, Chevrolet’s EV sales surged 60% last quarter, but analysts from Cox Automotive warn that price sensitivity remains high among middle-income households.

Competitors aren’t immune. Ford and Hyundai, which also offer budget EVs, face similar headwinds. Yet, Chevrolet’s heavy bet on affordability makes it particularly vulnerable. Social media buzz on X, including posts from @GreenCarReports linking to tariff updates, suggests consumers might turn to used EVs or delay purchases, potentially creating a market glut of older models.

Innovation as a Counterbalance to Cost Pressures

Amid these challenges, technological advancements offer hope. Solid-state batteries, which promise higher energy density and lower costs, are on the horizon for GM’s lineup. Partnerships with startups like Solid Power aim to commercialize this tech by 2027, potentially reducing reliance on volatile lithium supplies.

Recycling initiatives are also gaining steam. Companies like Redwood Materials are building U.S.-based facilities to reclaim battery materials, as covered in a Bloomberg report on circular economies in EVs. For Chevrolet, integrating recycled components could shave costs, making affordable models viable even under tariff regimes.

Furthermore, software updates and over-the-air improvements are extending vehicle lifespans, adding value without hardware changes. GM’s Super Cruise system, now standard on many EVs, enhances appeal, helping justify modest price bumps.

Strategic Responses from Automakers

General Motors isn’t standing idle. CEO Mary Barra has outlined a $35 billion investment in EVs through 2025, focusing on vertical integration. This includes mining deals in the U.S. and Canada to secure raw materials, mitigating tariff impacts.

Collaborations with tech giants like Google for infotainment could differentiate Chevrolet’s offerings, attracting buyers willing to pay a premium for features. As per insights from Electrek, such strategies are crucial for maintaining market share in a tariff-heavy environment.

Rivals like Tesla are doubling down on U.S. production, but Chevrolet’s mass-market focus requires broader accessibility. Industry forums on X highlight how GM might bundle financing or leases to soften price shocks, preserving the allure of models like the Bolt.

Long-Term Implications for EV Adoption

The trajectory of affordable EVs like Chevrolet’s hinges on policy evolution. If tariffs are moderated or domestic incentives expanded, prices could stabilize. However, persistent trade frictions might accelerate a bifurcation, with premium EVs thriving while entry-level options languish.

Environmental advocates worry this could hinder emissions reductions. The Union of Concerned Scientists estimates that widespread EV adoption requires prices below $30,000, a threshold now at risk.

Ultimately, Chevrolet’s challenge reflects broader industry dynamics, where affordability battles against protectionism. As one executive quipped on X, “Cheap EVs were never truly cheap—they were subsidized by global trade.” Moving forward, innovation and policy alignment will determine if models like the Bolt remain gateways to electrification or become cautionary tales of economic turbulence.

Navigating Uncertainty in Electric Mobility

Stakeholders from suppliers to regulators are monitoring these developments closely. A recent webinar hosted by the Society of Automotive Engineers discussed hedging strategies against tariff volatility, emphasizing diversified sourcing.

For consumers, staying informed via sources like X’s real-time updates or publications such as Car and Driver is key. Chevrolet’s website now features tariff impact FAQs, signaling transparency amid uncertainty.

Just because the federal government has turned its back on climate action doesn’t mean the United States is out of the fight.
Based on polling and local action, it seems that the American people understand the importance of climate action, even if the American president does not.
In a poll last year, 65 percent of US registered voters recognized a link between climate change and their cost of living.
A 2024 poll found that in 47 of the 50 states, a majority of voters were worried about climate change.","On January 7, President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from 66 international organizations, conventions, and treaties, including 31 affiliated with the United Nations. Though many are environmentally focused, the list also includes groups with missions involving human rights, peace, trade, and women’s rights. One particularly striking item on that long list was the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the most important climate treaty in the world and the foundation for every global climate action of the last 30 years.

Former Environmental Protection Agency administrator Gina McCarthy called the departure announcement “short-sighted, embarrassing, and foolish.” Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland, called it “unbelievably stupid.” The Sierra Club’s executive director, Loren Blackford, said, “Donald Trump may talk tough, but time and again he proves incapable of leading.”

Where does that leave the future of climate policy and greenhouse gas reduction?

The Trump administration has made moves to distance the United States from international climate agreements before, pulling out of the Paris Agreement once in 2017 and again in 2025, after President Biden rejoined the agreement during his term. But the UNFCCC is more than an agreement—it’s a full treaty, ratified unanimously by the Senate and signed into law by Republican President George H.W. Bush. Even without the US, it has 197 member states, more than the UN itself. The United States would be the first country ever to leave the treaty.

Many question whether Trump even has the authority to make this change. Article 2 of the US Constitution grants the president the power to make treaties, with Senate approval. However, the framers did not include a similar process for how to leave them. That leaves constitutional scholars divided over the legality of Trump’s decision. Some say that if the Senate has to ratify a treaty, it should also have to ratify a departure. This is the view of several environmental organizations, which may sue the administration to block the departure.

""Because the US entered the UNFCCC with advice and consent of the Senate in 1992, it’s our legal view that it also must be exited using the same process in reciprocation,"" Jean Su, energy justice director at the Center for Biological Diversity, told Reuters.

But others claim the executive branch’s generally wide-ranging powers over foreign affairs give the president the ability to leave treaties unilaterally, or at least, that they are not explicitly barred from doing so by anything in the Constitution.

The Supreme Court had a chance to weigh in on the issue in 1979. Senator Barry Goldwater sued then-President Jimmy Carter over his decision to leave a treaty with Taiwan. The Court refused to decide one way or the other. Nearly 50 years later, it may come down to another Supreme Court, this one largely appointed by the same sitting president who will be the defendant in the case.

Some contend that if a US president can leave a treaty, another president may be able to simply rejoin it, since the Senate ratification would still apply. The head of the UNFCCC, Simon Steill, made it clear that the treaty organization itself would allow it. “The doors remain open for the US to reenter in the future, as it has in the past with the Paris Agreement,” he said in a statement. Executive authority, once granted by the Court or ceded by inaction, doesn’t go away when the office changes hands.

Each of the 66 organizations listed in the executive order have their own rules about how countries can leave them. The UNFCCC, for example, requires a year from formal declaration of departure, so it would not take effect until at least next January. Some of them require as much as three years, meaning that the US would remain for the rest of the second Trump term. A few have no rules at all for governing departures, which will leave even more unanswered legal questions.

The announcements came as a surprise to many at the UN, including top diplomats who told the Associated Press that they learned of the action through social media, with no notice or official communications.

Many experts and opponents of the departures say that there is one clear winner in all this chaos. If the United States makes its abdication of climate responsibility official, it hands the reins of climate policy, green energy, and all the economic and political power tied up in both to another global superpower: China.

“Withdrawing from the UNFCCC is an abandonment of America’s opportunity to drive the global economy into the future, ceding jobs and economic growth to China and other countries,” Blackford said in a press statement.

In another statement to CNN, former Secretary of State John Kerry called the departure “a gift to China and a get-out-of-jail-free card to countries and polluters who want to avoid responsibility.” World Resources Institute director David Widawsky said it was “a strategic blunder that gives away American advantage for nothing in return.”

The United States is already far behind China on production of new green energy. In the first half of 2025, China installed more new solar power than the rest of the world combined. This week, only a few days after a new high-seas treaty came into effect, the Chinese government proposed hosting the secretariat of the treaty in Xiamen. As the United States hands over the soft power of international climate and environmental leadership, China appears more than happy to pick it up.

Some question how much American membership matters. The Trump administration has already stopped participating in international climate action. The administration has stopped paying its dues, amounting to over 20 percent of the treaty’s total funding. The United States is also the world’s biggest oil and gas producer, and also the largest exporter of fracked gas. We produce more crude oil than any country, ever.

Consequently, some experts have wondered whether removing such a massive petrostate from a leadership position on climate could have a bright side. Cornell climate scientist Daniele Visoni told Inside Climate News, “the only thing that this government is doing is depriving themselves of the opportunity to influence these reports in any way,” and suggests that the pullout could keep the US from being a cheerleader for fossil fuel interests.

COP30, held last year in Brazil, provided a test case for this theory. The United States sent no official delegation to the conference, which some believed might produce a less compromised agenda. But that’s not how it turned out. COP30 was widely seen as ineffective, resulting in some voluntary pledges but little measurable progress.

Just because the federal government has turned its back on climate action doesn’t mean the United States is out of the fight. Over both Trump terms, the role of states, cities, and other jurisdictions has grown to fill the gap. When the administration chose not to send a delegation to COP30 last year, California did. While the Trump administration may deny the scientific truth of climate change, 33 states, including Republican-led coastal states like South Carolina and Mississippi, have some sort of climate resilience and adaptation plan in effect, according to a report from the Brookings Institution.

Based on polling and local action, it seems that the American people understand the importance of climate action, even if the American president does not. In a poll last year, 65 percent of US registered voters recognized a link between climate change and their cost of living. A 2024 poll found that in 47 of the 50 states, a majority of voters were worried about climate change. In the absence of federal leadership, people power can move smaller-scale local elections and issues forward.

The future of global climate policy is more uncertain now than it has ever been. What is known is this: The United States has stepped back from its responsibilities on climate and handed that leadership role to China. But no president, no matter how reckless, can undo these basic truths of physics and economics: Climate change is real, and green energy is cheaper than fossil fuels. President Trump may be giving up our place at the table, but the rest of the world, and American cities and states, can still take meaningful action.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootzine/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-25 12:59:21.650816

The mission: Have one 212 hp Leapmotor C10 range extender EV.
We also reference Audi's Dakar Rally-winning range extender EV, the RS Q e-tron.
This range, claims Leapmotor, is possible because of the unique range extender EV drivetrain.
And it did so using a range extender EV, the RS Q e-tron.","The theory seems absolutely brilliant. A practical SUV, propelled by an efficient, 212-hp electric motor. With a 1.5-liter, four-cylinder gas-powered engine under the hood, serving only as a generator, charging the SUV as you drive it. So, in theory, even though you can plug in your SUV and charge it like a Tesla or Ford Mustang Mach-E, you don't actually don't need to charge your EV with a range extender system in place.

To test this rather ambitious theory, we embarked on a 2,000-mile cross-country journey in a Leapmotor C10 range extender EV. Leapmotor, you ask? Stellantis owns a 20% equity stake in Chinese start-up Leapmotor, and the technology deployed in the C10 will soon find its way into Stellantis products, too. Here's how it all went down.

The mission: Have one 212 hp Leapmotor C10 range extender EV. Embark on a 2,000-mile cross-country trip, and see how far you get before you are left Volt-less next to the road. We also reference Audi's Dakar Rally-winning range extender EV, the RS Q e-tron.

How To Get Stranded Next To The Road... Or Not?

Auto companies have a habit of not calling a spade a spade, but rather calling a spade a Caterpillar front-end loader. In other words, marketing materials are known to embellish some details. Often, numbers that are claimed appear to be theoretical, achieved only in laboratory-perfect conditions. Numbers that the average driver will probably never achieve in the daily commute.

So, when Chinese start-up brand Leapmotor claims the C10's internal combustion engine, operating on the Atkinson cycle, can achieve 42.7 MPG, it seems rather... well... optimistic. It doesn't end there. You also get a 28.4 kWh battery pack in the game, which adds another 90 miles of pure EV range (when fully charged). Cue drum roll... with a 13.2-gallon fuel tank, the combined range of this contraption is claimed to be just over 603 miles. Optimistic, much?

This range, claims Leapmotor, is possible because of the unique range extender EV drivetrain. Instead of providing drive to any part of the car in any which way, the gasoline engine's sole purpose is to charge the battery. The C10 is driven only by Volts, with the internal combustion engine only generating Volts for the battery pack to power the 212-hp electric motor, driving the rear axle.

The theory is simple: a drivetrain that provides all the advantages of an EV-driven vehicle, including instant torque, smooth and efficient operation, and low maintenance. And with the gasoline generator in the game, range anxiety is no longer an issue at all. In fact, you don't have to charge the battery in the traditional EV way at all. Just add gas, and drive. Sounds too good to be true, right?

To test Leapmotor's claims, we embarked on an extensive 2,000-mile range, traveling to places where folks have never even heard of electric vehicle propulsion, Elon Musk or Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries.

What is it like to drive? Like a run-of-the-mill electric vehicle, that's what. So you have the instant torque, combined with 212 hp, providing more than adequate performance for a large SUV. The drivetrain is efficient and smooth, the progress seamless and refined. There is only the occasional, very faint drone from the gasoline engine, as it kicks in to charge the battery. It really is surprisingly quiet in its operation.

Is the C10 perfect? Nope. Driver assist systems like the lane-keep assist set-up are certainly not as polished as offerings from some other brands, and the system's interventions can be disruptive. But you can switch these systems off by using the massive 14.6-inch touchscreen. Wireless software updates should sort this out soon enough.

On that note. The Leapmotor's minimalist interior takes the button-free concept to the next level. The only buttons or actions available in the cabin are the basic buttons on the steering wheel, controlling functions like the sound system, side mirror adjustment, cruise control and the voice control (with a lady living in the dashboard that takes some convincing before performing the requested task). The gearlever is a stalk behind the steering wheel, and the left stalk operates the wiper and high beam function. Other than the buttons to roll the windows up and down, that's it. Everything else requires adjustment via that big central screen.

Meanwhile, cruising along at a merry 75 mph, we were waiting for the Leapmotor to grind to a halt next to the road, without a Volt in sight. After a stint of about 400 miles, and with the range indicator claiming we still had around 150 miles in the tank, with some Volts as change, we stopped for gas. Just in case. And then we worked out the numbers, using the actual fuel added. It had done 36.7 MPG, with plenty of lead-footed driving included, as we explored the C10's dynamic prowess.

With more finesse and care, we realized that more than 40 MPG may be possible... and that is without any additional Volts from a charging station. Say what? Is Leapmotor's ambitious range claim actually achievable? Well, apparently, it is!

Going The Whole Nine Yards

After we achieved 37.6 MPG on the first stint of our trip without really trying, we made a more concerted effort to extend the range, driving in a more economical fashion, sticking to 70 mph. It became a challenge. But unlike the challenge of a normal EV, where drivers have to keep an anxious eye on that range and continuously plan their journey around charging stations, we had no such qualms. Any filling station would do.

The high-end sound system, once you've figured out how to work it, is pretty fine. Climate control gets the job done in the most efficient manner. And the interior is a comfortable place in which to spend your hours. In no time, we had racked up another 500 miles, and topped up the fuel, and crunched some numbers... 42.9 MPG! That means, with a full charge of the battery (after you give it an AC or DC charge), the C10 can reach more than 600 miles without refueling or recharging!

The Leapmotor continued to impress on the rest of the 2,000-mile trip. Smooth. Efficient. Comfortable. Luxurious. Running on gas fumes. And, importantly, no range anxiety, whatsoever. Is this the way of the future? Combining all the advantages of an EV with an efficient, low-emission gasoline engine?

It certainly seems to tick a lot of ""Yes"" boxes.

For the record, Leapmotor is obviously a big deal in China, and is also sold in various European markets, as well as in Southern Africa. In theory, it will eventually be sold in every country with a Stellantis outlet. The trip recorded here was conducted in Southern Africa, driving from Johannesburg to the desert-like Karoo area, and the surrounding areas.

Range Extender EVs are heading to the US. As is the Leapmotor's distant cousin, the RAM 1500 REV, which is expected to go on sale soon. As you'd expect, the RAM is bigger and better in every department compared to the C10. A 3.6-liter V6 is deployed as the generator, it has a much larger 92.8 kWh battery pack, and two electric motors power the truck. The result is 647 hp of pure electric power, and a drivetrain that can blast the truck to 60 mph in just 4.5 seconds. Yet it can also reach a claimed 690 miles before requiring a recharge or refuel.

With fellow Stellantis brand Jeep also set to introduce the Grand Wagoneer REV soon, and Nissan adding its own range of REEVs too, the way of the car in the USA may be about to change, forever.

Audi's Cool Party Trick That Changed The EV Game

In 2024, Audi won the Dakar Rally, the most grueling motorsport event on Earth. And it did so using a range extender EV, the RS Q e-tron. The RS Q is propelled by two powerful electric motors, hailing from Audi's Formula E racing program. With one motor per axle, the all-wheel-drive Audi produces 384 hp, and around 600 lb-ft of torque.

The generator part is taken care of by a two-liter, turbocharged four-cylinder, DTM racing engine. In racing conditions, the engine runs constantly between 4,500 and 6,000 rpm, providing the relatively small 52 kWh battery pack with all the Volts it needs. Yes, it may have sounded weird, the gas engine running at constant revs with a high-pitched, ungainly wail. But it was effective. So effective that it managed to beat a horde of competitors, racing in purpose-built internal combustion racing vehicles.

In doing so, Audi's pioneering race winner steered EVs in a new direction. Welcome to the age of REEV.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/img_4174.JPG?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-25 12:59:17.423928

For three centuries, southern right whales were known as “the right whales” to hunt. Their docility, slow speed, and floating carcasses made them easy prey for whalers. By the 1920s, the species’ estimated global population of more than 70,000 had been all but eliminated, with around 300 remaining. The hunt was banned in 1935.

Since then, various initiatives have sought to reverse the trend, such as the International Whaling Commission. This intergovernmental organization is charged with regulating whaling and conserving all species of these animals. The commission celebrates its 80th anniversary this year. These days, southern right whale populations off the coast of Argentine Patagonia are showing signs of recovery. Here, the “Blue Gulf” of San Matías has emerged as a key site for their reproduction and breeding. But a new threat is looming.

The San Matías Gulf, alongside Argentina’s central Río Negro province, has become a key site in national plans to export liquefied natural gas (LNG). As extraction operations ramp up inland at the Vaca Muerta oil and gas field (one of the world’s biggest shale oil and gas deposits), exportation is being galvanized under the pro-extraction presidency of Javier Milei. He has described Argentine LNG as “the largest investment in the history of Argentina.”

Argentina is eyeing LNG markets, including Europe, India, China, South Korea, Japan, and Brazil. There are still no firm agreements with any of these countries, although there are signs of interest from some.

However, the San Matías Gulf is an area of enormous ecological value, home to five national and provincial marine reserves. It has been internationally recognized for around 20 years as one of the richest ecosystems in Argentina. The gulf concentrates phytoplankton and captures large amounts of CO₂. It is also one of the few places in the world where southern right whales can be observed from land.

Biologists and oceanographers have told Dialogue Earth that the installation of oil and gas projects in the area poses a critical risk to these whales, as well as the rest of the ecosystem.

Until a little over three years ago, such activity was prohibited by law. In 2022, the government of Alberto Fernández reformed Río Negro province’s law number 3308, which had prohibited hydrocarbon activities in the area. The reform has paved the way for a new port to enable LNG exports and other strategic projects.

The San Matías Gulf was chosen because it is one of the few points on Argentina’s Atlantic coast with sufficient depth and a direct connection to Vaca Muerta.

Four key projects — a pipeline, a port, and two floating LNG plants — are currently at different stages of development, with plans for four more. These are opposed by several environmentalists and scientists who are raising concerns about their cumulative impact.

Ship collisions and oil spills

Critics claim this development will heighten the risk of oil spills, and could change ocean dynamics. It will also lead to a wider increase in greenhouse gas emissions.

There are multiple risks for whales and other animals living in the San Matías Gulf, warns the ecologist Belén Braga, a member of the multinational, non-profit Whale Conservation Institute (ICB). One of the most significant is ship collisions, which Braga says will increase. This is in addition to the entanglement risks they face from the fishing industry. And greater numbers of gas liquefaction vessels could cause more seaweed to grow, bringing a heightened risk of disease, she adds.

“We are talking about collisions, noise pollution, spills, and chronic micro-spills. All these warnings are on the table,” says Braga. The impacts would not only compromise wildlife, she adds, but also the regional economy, which is based on fishing and tourism.

In its environmental impact assessment, the national energy company YPF acknowledges that the necessary pipeline and two huge, floating platforms used for loading tankers (known as “monobuoys”) all represent spill risks. The operators have designed a “safe operation management” plan in the event of a spill.

However, a 2025 study concluded that, in several scenarios, the oil could spread further across 30 hours than YPF has calculated for. The study was coordinated by the Forum for the Conservation of the Patagonian Sea (FMP), a network of civil society organizations that includes the ICB.

Several sources consulted by Dialogue Earth have pointed out that environmental assessments of fossil fuel projects in the San Matías Gulf are fragmented. As a result, they say, there has not yet been a comprehensive analysis of the cumulative impacts of these developments in this area.

Cristian Fernández, legal coordinator for the Environment and Natural Resources Foundation (Farn), an Argentine NGO, raises issues with the potential for increased emissions: “The environmental impact study omits a serious analysis of emissions, including carbon dioxide, methane, and volatile organic compounds such as benzene.”

Fernández claims the San Matías Gulf is being treated as a “sacrifice zone” in the name of economic development.

Argentina’s LNG vision

Four projects linked to the LNG export plan have been approved by the national government so far. The most significant is a nearly 500-kilometer-long oil pipeline called Vaca Muerta Oil Sur. YPF’s president and CEO, Horacio Marín, has described it as “the largest infrastructure project in the country.” The shareholder companies are YPF, Vista Energy, Pampa Energía, all Latin American, and Pan American Energy, headquartered in Canada.

The pipeline begins in Loma Campana, Neuquén, in the heart of Vaca Muerta. It runs to Punta Colorada, a town located between two protected areas in the San Matías Gulf. The pipeline will carry LNG to the port and its two monobuoys.

In addition, two floating vessels from the Norwegian company Golar LNG, named the Hilli Epiceyo and the MK II, are expected to be deployed off the coast of Argentina to liquefy the gas. An alternative to permanent, onshore facilities, the vessels are ship-based units, 300-400 meters long and 112 meters high. This project is being handled by the consortium Southern Energy, comprising Pan American Energy, YPF, Pampa Energía, Golar LNG, and Harbour Energy, headquartered in London.

According to Southern Energy, the first ship would begin operating in 2027, the second in 2028. They will eventually process around 17% of Argentina’s current gas production.

A separate gas pipeline is currently out for tender with the Italian-Argentine manufacturer Techint. The firm is facing competition from a number of unidentified Chinese companies.

The MK II is currently being repurposed by a Chinese company. Philip Andrews-Speed, a researcher at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies in the United Kingdom, explains that China’s status as one of the world’s largest shipbuilders gives it a key role in the LNG market.

Despite strong support from the government, however, Argentine LNG has yet to gain commercial traction. In April 2025, YPF signed a memorandum of understanding with Eni, an Italian oil major. The following November, YPF signed another similar agreement with Abu Dhabi’s state oil company, ADNOC.

But in early December, the London-based oil giant Shell withdrew from the project before it began; Shell itself had been a replacement for another company that also withdrew, Malaysia’s PETRONAS. Meanwhile, China — the country with the highest LNG import figures globally — has been reducing its purchases of foreign gas due to “excess demand” and higher than expected prices.

Despite these troubles, the government of Río Negro has continued to support the projects’ progress.

The reform that made it possible

Critics say the September 2022 reform of Río Negro’s law 3308 was hurried through and failed to fulfill consultation requirements.

Pablo Barreno, a regional legislator, tells Dialogue Earth the bill arrived without prior notice – and with strong support from the then-governor, Arabela Carreras. “We found out about it through a WhatsApp group.” Barreno adds that the meeting took place just one day later. He was the only legislator who voted against it, citing insufficient information.

The session was targeted by protestors, including Fabrizio di Giacomo, a member of Multisectoral Gulf of San Matías (MGSM). This collective brings together local residents, coastal communities, and other organizations. Di Giacomo claims the government sought to prevent any form of social participation by holding the session behind closed doors and reinforcing police control.

Several campaigners and scientific institutions argue the reform was unconstitutional and violates the Escazú Agreement. The treaty, which entered into force in 2021, guarantees civic participation in decision-making. An appeal against the reform was rejected by Río Negro’s superior court of justice in 2023. Another appeal has been lodged at the Supreme Court.

The meeting focused on partnership models and mechanisms for the localization of SANY’s advanced wind turbine technology, according to a statement by the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy.

The Ministry is implementing a clear plan for technology transfer and is open to diverse partnership models, particularly those prioritizing the use of locally manufactured components to build a robust domestic renewable energy market, said Esmat.

The drive for localization is supported by Egypt’s massive natural resource capacity. Hassan El-Khatib, Minister of Investment and Foreign Trade, noted during the World Economic Forum (WEF) that Egypt possesses the potential to generate 700 to 900 gigawatts (GW) from the Western Desert alone.

To unlock this potential, Egypt is expanding cooperation in power generation while simultaneously developing energy storage systems to ensure grid stability.

During a recent visit to China, Esmat oversaw the signing of several landmark agreements aimed at establishing a local industrial base. The first agreement is a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with TBEA to cooperate on renewable energy systems, localize the electrical power grid connection systems, and establish the first factory to produce inverters in Egypt.

Ice accumulation, freezing temperatures, impassable roads and hazardous road conditions make restoration efforts challenging by slowing access to damaged equipment and creating unsafe working conditions.

Our crews are working as quickly and safely as possible to restore service, and 2,750 restoration resources are staged and ready to respond as conditions allow, with additional resources in route.

Restoring power during winter storms is different from other weather events and requires a careful, step-by-step approach to protect both customers, workers and the electric grid.

Before power can be restored, damage to infrastructure must be assessed. Damage assessment and restoration work has been slowed by downed vegetation blocking roadways and icy road conditions. Once it is safe to do so, crews begin evaluating damage to power plants, transmission lines, substations and local distribution equipment. In some areas, icy roads and unsafe conditions may delay access.

During extreme cold, power cannot be restored all at once. Many customers leave heating systems and appliances running during an outage, which can create a sudden surge in electricity demand when power is restored. To prevent additional outages or equipment damage, crews restore service one section at a time using a controlled process known as cold load pickup.

We restore customers in a planned and deliberate order. We start with essential services, move on to large neighborhoods and then to individual homes.

Power is first restored to critical community infrastructure and essential services such as hospitals, water treatment plants, police and fire stations, and communication systems.

Next, we restore lines serving large areas of customers, and then we restore neighborhoods. This returns power to the largest number of customers in the shortest amount of time.

Some homes and businesses take longer, as individual customer homes or businesses with damage are often the most time-consuming repairs.

While many customers may be restored relatively quickly, some outages may last longer depending on damage severity, ice conditions and accessibility.

Customer safety and community resources

Customers should continue to prioritize safety while outages persist.

Warming centers: Customers in need of shelter and warmth should consider local warming centers or shelters if it is safe to travel. To find a listing of available warming centers, visit GOHSEP’s Louisiana Warming Centers: https://gohsep.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/9d47b24a528f43cf84633a2c04270706

Road conditions: Please be aware that roads may be hazardous or closed during restoration efforts. Road conditions and closure information can be found here from Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development: https://www.511la.org/

Generator safety: Never use generators indoors or in and never connect a generator directly to home wiring without proper transfer equipment.

Heating safety: Never use ovens, grills or outdoor heating devices to heat your home.

Downed power lines: Always assume downed lines are energized and dangerous — stay away and report them immediately by calling 1-800-9OUTAGE (1-800-968-8243) or your local police/fire department.

Ongoing monitoring and workforce readiness

Entergy Louisiana continues to closely monitor weather conditions, grid operations and energy demand. We are coordinating with the regional grid operator and have secured hundreds of additional restoration workers, though the widespread footprint of this storm may limit the availability of outside crews.

Our employees are prepared to work extended hours once conditions are safe, while following strict safety and fatigue-management protocols.

But at the other four border forts, troops and time marched on.","When Anthony Knopp first came to the campus of Texas Southmost College in 1976, his office was in an old barrack, and some faculty members lived in single-story, 100-year-old former military buildings, recalls the retired history professor.

While the old structures lacked modern amenities, Knopp made the most of teaching at a historic site. “When studying U.S. history, particularly relations with Mexico and 20th-century wars,” he says, “I was able to connect students to what was here at Fort Brown.”

Today, a former 48-bed hospital houses the college president’s offices on the campus in Brownsville, in the Rio Grande Valley. Fort Brown’s hospital annex (built in 1868), commissary (1904), guardhouse and morgue (1870) support various college departments.

Fort Brown and four other U.S. Army forts, established along the Rio Grande in the years after Texas became a state in 1845, endured for decades as military installations.

Unlike Texas frontier forts of the 1800s, such as Fort Concho in San Angelo and Fort McKavett in Menard County, which were rapidly abandoned as the frontier moved west, the border forts in Brownsville, Rio Grande City, Laredo and Eagle Pass remained defensive posts, off and on, for nearly 100 years. Fort Bliss in El Paso is still in use.

Today—178 years after the Mexican-American War—repurposed buildings from these border forts contribute to the vitality and identity of those Texas towns. Retaining their 1800s ambiance, the former Army headquarters, barracks and hospitals serve as schools, colleges, museums and parks.

The border forts had much in common, each named for veterans of the Mexican-American War, fought immediately following Texas statehood. At Rio Grande crossings, most about 100 miles apart, each fort shifted locations several times before being rebuilt as permanent posts after the Civil War.

Troops at the forts alternately dealt with Mexican bandits and rustlers and rowdy revolutionaries from both sides of the border, protected travelers and settlers from raids by Comanche and Lipan Apache tribes, and trained troops for both world wars. The garrisons shaped the cities that grew around them, as Army suppliers set up shops that also catered to local residents.

Fort Brown

Count riverboat pilot Mifflin Kenedy among the early merchants who cashed in on Army contracts. He ferried troops and equipment from Fort Brown, near the Gulf Coast, up the Rio Grande during the Mexican-American War.

He later started a steamboat company, married a wealthy widow and acquired hundreds of thousands of acres. He is the namesake of the Kenedy Ranch, the town of Kenedy and Kenedy County.

Fort Brown evolved from a star-shaped earthen fort to a commanding presence after the Civil War, when 70 buildings were erected of locally made border brick. With wide arches fronting shaded breezeways, Fort Brown’s 1869 hospital (said to be the most beautiful hospital in the Army) was of crucial importance during epidemics of yellow fever and cholera as the only hospital in Cameron County until 1909.

Quartermasters negotiated contracts with local businesses for goods and services such as beans, flour, coffee pots and hay for horses. Although a brick wall separated the town from Fort Brown and its palm-lined parade grounds, traffic flowed between them.

“Interactions resulted in marriages,” Knopp says. “Married soldiers either stayed in the area or returned.”

Fort Brown provided several forms of entertainment for the town: parades, concerts and sporting activities. Sunday afternoon polo matches, a cavalry favorite, drew locals as did concerts at the post bandstand, held twice a week.

A tree-shaded “lovers’ lane” curled between the fort and the river. Troops marched in local parades and Charro Days celebrations. Off-duty troops ate at local restaurants. The officers’ club hosted dances while enlisted men attended dances on the patio of El Jardin Hotel. Soldiers’ sisters and daughters met and married local men, too.

Deactivated in 1944 when the last U.S.-based mounted soldiers left, Fort Brown almost immediately started a new life as part of what is now Texas Southmost College. New campus construction echoes the border brick architecture of bygone days.

Fort Brown tours, arranged by the Brownsville Historical Association, link the past to its visible remnants.

Fort Ringgold

Upriver at Rio Grande City, Fort Ringgold followed Fort Brown’s trajectory. Veterans of the Mexican-American War went into business, not always successfully.

Capt. Forbes Britton and partners failed at making their Rio Grande City riverboat landing a major stop for Kenedy’s steamboats. But construction booms after the Civil War and continuing through World War I boosted the local economy.

At Fort Ringgold, barracks, a jail, an arched brick hospital and officers’ quarters surrounded a parade ground, which was larger than a football field.

“The parade ground gives a real picture of what Fort Ringgold looked like 150 years ago, about 1870,” says Aminta Reyna Alaniz, a Rio Grande City historian and tour guide. The post bugler played reveille and taps in front of a megaphone longer than 5 feet on the parade ground, signaling the troops as well as townsfolk.

Alaniz identifies 17 fort buildings—from the guardhouse and bakery to warehouses and six barracks—that are today used by the Rio Grande City Grulla Independent School District.

The school district purchased the fort’s 325 acres and buildings in 1947 with plans for an education complex and park. Along F Troop and 12th Cavalry streets, tan- and white-painted brick buildings house registration, curriculum and instruction units.

Near a two-story enlisted cavalry barracks that once housed about 100 soldiers (and later was used as an elementary school), girls played softball on a recent Sunday afternoon. The expansive parade ground hosts marching band practice and school Christmas displays.

Until recently, Alaniz says, an electronic sound system broadcast a digital bugle call morning and night. But even those echoes have ended.

Fort McIntosh

Fort McIntosh was built at a long-established Rio Grande crossing in 1849, opposite a former Spanish presidio. Laredo grew along with the fort, which held as many as 400 soldiers on over 400 acres with a requisite hospital, jail, barracks and cemetery.

In 1946, the International Boundary and Water Commission and the city of Laredo divided up the former fort. The city created what is now the Fort McIntosh campus of Laredo College in 1947.

Inside the Fort McIntosh Historic District, streets are named for post commanders and soldiers. The brick hospital has become Laredo College’s purchasing department. The former officers’ quarters houses the campus student ministry, and the old commandant’s house became a museum furnished with Victorian-era pieces.

The bakery is occupied by a customs brokers association. Other refurbished McIntosh campus buildings are used for classrooms. The cemetery is empty, the remains relocated.

Fort Bliss

In 1848, more than 400 miles up the Rio Grande, a fifth border fort was established at El Paso. It too moved locations multiple times as El Paso flourished around it.

Hoping to remain prosperous, the residents in 1890 purchased and donated land for a permanent Army post, which remains active today.

Unlike the other forts in this list, Fort Bliss grew after World War II. It now covers 1.1 million acres of Texas and New Mexico and is among America’s largest Army posts, home to about 20,000 troops.

Replicas of Fort Bliss’ early adobe buildings were constructed for the fort’s centennial in 1948 and house a museum, which is open to the public.

While companies have rushed to ramp up production of power transformers and distribution transformers, keeping up with skyrocketing demand is an impossibly tall order.
""This surging transformer demand has created a significant supply deficit, with domestic manufacturing capacity unable to keep pace,"" Wood Mackenzie Senior Analyst Ben Boucher.
In 2025, imports will account for an estimated 80% of US power transformer supply and 50% of the distribution transformer supply.
This market imbalance is escalating costs and lead times and is delaying our ability to bring generating plants online in pace with the surging energy demand.""","The global clean energy transition has passed a tipping point as renewable energies have simply become too cheap to fail. Worldwide, nations both rich and poor are rushing to install more and more wind and solar capacity to keep up with rising energy demand rates driven by global economic development and the age of AI. But while countries have been investing heavily into increased production capacity, investments in critical grid infrastructure have not kept pace, leading to a major energy transition bottleneck and a potential threat to energy security for an increasing number of countries.

The United States and Europe are both facing critical transformer shortages and aging and inadequate grid infrastructure, and the threat that this shortage poses to energy security is already being felt through historic blackouts such as last year's cascading grid failure in Spain and Portugal. While these setbacks have raised the profile of infrastructure investing in European policy spheres, ""ambition is not yet being matched by action from governments, policy-makers, investors and businesses,"" according to a recent report from the World Economic Forum.

In the United States, specialists foresee a yearslong transformer crunch, with little to no relief forthcoming. While companies have rushed to ramp up production of power transformers and distribution transformers, keeping up with skyrocketing demand is an impossibly tall order. Wood Mackenzie estimates that, since 2019, U.S. demand for power transformers has jumped by 116 percent, while demand for distribution transformers has shot up 41 percent.

""This surging transformer demand has created a significant supply deficit, with domestic manufacturing capacity unable to keep pace,"" Wood Mackenzie Senior Analyst Ben Boucher. ""Utilities are routinely turning to the import market to meet project timelines. In 2025, imports will account for an estimated 80% of US power transformer supply and 50% of the distribution transformer supply. This market imbalance is escalating costs and lead times and is delaying our ability to bring generating plants online in pace with the surging energy demand.""

However, some experts disagree with this takeaway, arguing that the transformer ""shortage"" is overblown if not fabricated, and the issue lies in self-inflicted procurement problems. There's room for debate because the issue is a complex one stretching over many different economic sectors and supply chains. Whether the problem is one of supply or one of procurement, however, the impact is the same - major bottlenecks for new electricity with potential pitfalls for national energy security.

""Over the past few years, what started as a squeeze has gradually morphed into a crisis,"" Power Magazine recently reported. The Power article contends that this growing crisis has been ""furnished by years of underinvestment in domestic manufacturing, a sudden surge in post-pandemic construction and electrification, and volatility in grain-oriented electrical steel (GOES) and copper markets, which steadily pushed lead times for large power and generator step-up (GSU) transformers beyond historical norms.""

And those driving factors are showing little signs of changing, indicating that delay times for transformer delivery are going to continue to stretch on. Even though demand for these products is now growing exponentially, this spike is coming in the wake of years of lackluster demand, and would-be investors are still warming up to the idea that they'll get a return on their investment in the sector.

Hitachi, one major producer of such transformers, for example, has strategically only invested in transformer development when the purchase of those components is already guaranteed and buyer-backed. ""Nobody wants to overinvest"" in new production facilities, according to Hitachi Energy CEO Andreas Schierenbeck.

Through these kinds of up-front deals, Hitachi has planned $1 billion in new manufacturing capacity across the United States. However, Schierenbeck told news outlet Semafor this week that these deals are ""probably not enough to close the gap between supply and demandâ€¦ There are still customers who are just in the old world with transactional behavior, and they'll have to be lucky to get a slot.""

If you’re a typical user, you don’t need to overthink this: if you owe federal income taxes and plan to keep the car long-term, aim for a model that qualifies for the full credit. How to choose an EV under these conditions? Focus on vehicles under $55,000 MSRP for sedans or $80,000 for SUVs/trucks, verify final eligibility with your dealer, and avoid overpaying for features you won’t use. The key is timing—over the past year, uncertainty around policy changes has made early action more valuable than waiting.

This piece isn’t for keyword collectors. It’s for people who will actually use the product.

About EV Tax Credits and Final Cost

The federal tax credit reduces the effective purchase price of eligible new electric vehicles by up to $7,500. This isn’t a rebate—it’s applied when you file taxes, though many dealers now offer point-of-sale transfers, effectively lowering your upfront cost 1. Used EVs qualify for up to $4,000 or 30% of the sale price, whichever is less, with a cap at $25,000.

If you’re a typical user, you don’t need to overthink this: the credit only matters if you have sufficient tax liability. No tax bill? No credit benefit. And eligibility depends on battery sourcing, final assembly location, and income caps for buyers—details that shift faster than automakers can update brochures.

Why This Matters Now

Over the past year, political and legislative shifts have put the future of the $7,500 credit in doubt. As of late 2025, multiple sources indicate the credit is set to expire or be modified as early as September 30, 2025 2. That creates a narrowing window for buyers to lock in savings.

The change signal is clear: automakers are adjusting pricing, leasing terms, and marketing focus. Some brands are pulling back on entry-level models, while others are emphasizing lease deals to absorb the tax complexity. If you’re a typical user, you don’t need to overthink this: if you were considering an EV within the next 12 months, now is the time to evaluate whether acting before policy shifts makes financial sense.

Types and Variants

Not all electric vehicles qualify for the same incentives. Here’s a breakdown:

New Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)

Pros: Full $7,500 credit possible, zero tailpipe emissions, simpler maintenance

Cons: Higher base prices, eligibility tied to strict supply chain rules, may require home charging setup

New Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)

Pros: Qualify for partial or full credit depending on battery size and electric range, flexibility with gas backup

Cons: Often priced near the $80,000 SUV cap, complex powertrain, lower electric-only utility than BEVs

Used EVs

Pros: Up to $4,000 credit available, lower upfront cost, avoids first-year depreciation

Cons: Limited selection of qualifying models, must be sold by certified dealer, price capped at $25,000

If you’re a typical user, you don’t need to overthink this: unless you drive less than 20 miles daily or lack charging access, a used EV rarely offers better value than a new one with the credit. The math usually favors new purchases when incentives apply.

Key Features and Specifications to Evaluate

When assessing which EV gives you the best post-credit value, focus on these factors:

Battery Sourcing: At least 50% of battery components must come from North America to qualify for full credit. This disqualifies many imported models.

Final Assembly Location: Must occur in North America. Vehicles built in Asia or Europe—even by American brands—may not qualify.

MSRP Caps: Sedans/liftbacks under $55,000; SUVs, trucks, vans under $80,000. Exceeding by $1? No credit.

Buyer Income Limits: Single filers above $150,000 AGI, heads of household above $225,000, joint filers above $300,000 are ineligible.

When it’s worth caring about: if you're comparing two similar EVs but one qualifies and the other doesn’t, the difference could be $7,500. When you don’t need to overthink it: if you're already over budget for your target vehicle, the credit won’t make it affordable—focus on cheaper models instead.

Pros and Cons

If you’re a typical user, you don’t need to overthink this: the pros outweigh the cons only if you meet all eligibility requirements and plan to keep the car for years. Otherwise, it’s just noise in the decision process.

How to Choose an EV with Tax Credits in Mind

This guide walks you through making a practical decision—not chasing incentives, but using them wisely.

Step-by-Step Checklist

Determine your tax liability: Do you expect to owe at least $7,500 in federal taxes? If not, the credit provides no benefit.

Set a realistic budget: Include insurance, charging equipment, and potential upgrades.

Narrow to qualifying models: Use the DOE or IRS lookup tools to filter by credit eligibility.

Verify MSRP: Ensure the trim you want stays under $55k (sedans) or $80k (larger vehicles).

Confirm battery origin: Ask the dealer for documentation on component sourcing.

Compare total cost of ownership: Factor in fuel, maintenance, and resale.

Lock in purchase before deadline: If policy changes loom, act early.

Decision Flow

You want an EV → Check if you owe federal taxes → Yes → Look only at eligible models → Stay under MSRP cap → Confirm assembly location → Buy before expiration

You want an EV → No tax liability → Ignore credit → Focus on lowest sticker price or lease deal

Recommendations by Scenario

First-time EV buyer: Choose a new compact BEV like a Chevrolet Bolt EUV or Nissan Leaf—if eligible. Avoid PHEVs unless you lack charging access.

Family needing space: Target eligible SUVs under $80,000 (e.g., Ford Mustang Mach-E, Hyundai Ioniq 5). Skip luxury trims that exceed the cap.

Low-income or used-car shopper: Consider certified pre-owned EVs under $25,000—some qualify for $4,000 credit.

Tax-exempt household: The credit is irrelevant. Prioritize lowest upfront cost and reliability.

Red Flags / What to Avoid

Dealers claiming ‘instant credit’ without verifying eligibility

Models just above MSRP cap—even $1 over voids the credit

Leasing deals that don’t pass the credit to lessee

Old inventory marketed as ‘last chance’ without price adjustment

Ignoring your actual driving needs to chase the credit

This piece isn’t for keyword collectors. It’s for people who will actually use the product.

Price & Market Insights

Over the past year, the average transaction price for a new EV was approximately $55,614 3. That’s higher than the average gas-powered car. But after the $7,500 credit, many mainstream models fall into the $40,000–$50,000 range—competitive with comparably equipped ICE vehicles.

Prices may vary by region/model/seller. Incentives differ at state and local levels. Always verify current dealer pricing and financing options. If you’re a typical user, you don’t need to overthink this: national averages are useful, but your local quote is what counts. Get written confirmation of eligibility from the dealership before signing.

Top-Seller & Competitive Analysis

The following models represent common choices among recent buyers who qualified for the full $7,500 credit. Availability and eligibility may change weekly.

If you’re a typical user, you don’t need to overthink this: stick to models clearly under the cap and confirmed as eligible. Don’t assume brand reputation guarantees credit access.

Customer Feedback Synthesis

Analysis of recent buyer reviews and forums shows recurring themes:

Positive: “Saved $7,500 instantly at purchase,” “Dealer handled paperwork seamlessly,” “Monthly payment dropped below my old car’s.”

Negative: “Salesperson misled me about eligibility,” “My tax preparer said I didn’t qualify due to income,” “Chose wrong trim—was $500 over cap.”

When it’s worth caring about: if multiple buyers report confusion at a specific dealership, seek a second opinion. When you don’t need to overthink it: isolated complaints about delivery delays or minor defects aren’t credit-related and shouldn’t sway your decision.

Maintenance, Safety & Legal Considerations

Evs generally require less maintenance than gasoline cars—no oil changes, fewer moving parts. However, tire wear and battery health monitoring remain important.

Safety ratings vary by model. Use IIHS or NHTSA data to compare crash test performance. Never assume electrification equals higher safety.

Legally, the tax credit is subject to verification during tax filing. Keep all purchase documents, including manufacturer certification of eligibility. If audited, you’ll need proof the vehicle met requirements at time of sale. Verify retailer return policy in case eligibility is later denied.

If you’re a typical user, you don’t need to overthink this: the legal burden is low if you buy from a reputable dealer and keep records. Just don’t discard paperwork.

Conclusion

If you need a new car, owe federal taxes, and drive enough to justify an EV, choose a model under the MSRP cap and confirmed eligible for the $7,500 credit. Timing matters—policy shifts mean waiting could cost you thousands. If you don’t owe taxes or are buying used primarily for low cost, the federal credit won’t move the needle. Focus instead on reliability, range, and total ownership cost.",https://s.alicdn.com/@sc02/kf/Hedb7b2f51b9b4b25aeaeafd8ba68fc45m.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 22:58:34.463484

""Defendants’ conspiracy [...] denied the State and Michigan consumers meaningful choices, raised switching costs, and eliminated competitive price pressure.""","Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed a federal antitrust lawsuit accusing major oil companies and an industry group of colluding to ""suppress"" renewable energy and electric vehicle competition.

The suit names BP, Chevron, Exxon, Shell, and the American Petroleum Institute, alleging they acted like a cartel to restrain trade and block clean energy alternatives.

Michigan claims this alleged conspiracy has kept energy prices high and limited affordable EV options for consumers.

The American auto industry is in the middle of a pivot back to gasoline-powered cars after more than a decade of chasing a mostly electric future. Some observers say it's short-lived, driven by new tariffs and shifting regulations under the Trump administration. Others blame market forces and the fact that many electric-vehicle choices haven't been on par with consumers' needs.

But the State of Michigan is attempting to hold another group responsible for the downturn of EVs and renewable power in general: the oil industry.

Michigan's attorney general Dana Nessel on Friday filed a federal antitrust lawsuit against BP, Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Shell Oil and the American Petroleum Institute, alleging that the petroleum giants and their trade association ""have unlawfully colluded to reduce innovation and output (and thereby increase prices) in the Michigan transportation energy market and the Michigan primary energy market.""

The 126-page lawsuit alleges that the oil companies committed a ""conspiracy"" that has kept energy prices artificially high in the state and dependent on fossil fuels, while also working to undermine the American EV market.

The state is seeking a jury trial and unspecified financial damages tied to what Michigan consumers and the state government have allegedly overpaid for energy. It's also seeking a repayment of fossil-fuel industry profits.

""For decades, defendants have conspired with each other to forestall meaningful competition from renewable energy and maintain their dominance in the energy market,"" the lawsuit said. ""They have done so as a cartel, agreeing to reduce the production and distribution of electricity from renewable sources and to restrain the emergence of EV and renewable primary energy technologies in the United States.""

""These baseless lawsuits are a coordinated campaign against an industry that powers everyday life, drives America’s economy, and is actively reducing emissions,"" an attorney for the American Petroleum Institute told the Detroit Free Press. ""We continue to believe that energy policy belongs in Congress, not a patchwork of courtrooms.”

While Michigan's lawsuit is wide-ranging in its claims around energy sources and prices, it specifically blames an oil industry ""conspiracy"" for decades of slower growth around EVs, charging infrastructure and cheaper electricity.

Alpitronic EV Chargers

Among other things, the state accuses the oil companies of slow-walking charger growth at their fueling stations; deliberately delaying their own hybrid and battery technology development that they once helped pioneer; driving ""misinformation"" campaigns with “thinktanks, blogs, and ideologically sympathetic media outlets” that have undermined EV adoption and spread false narratives about renewable technology.

""But for the conspiracy, EVs would have reached scale years earlier and Michigan and its consumers would have avoided billions of dollars in overcharges on transportation energy,"" the lawsuit alleged.

Michigan has some of the highest electricity costs in the U.S. It remains home to much of the American automotive industry, which is now delaying, repurposing or outright cancelling many of the EV investments that have been underway for years. Ford, General Motors and Stellantis have all announced a slower EV rollout than they projected at the outset of the decade, and have more recently touted ""consumer choice"" as the reason for renewed investments back to fossil-fuel powertrains.

That shift comes amid a second Trump administration that has been overtly friendly to oil and gas interests. On his first day in office, President Donald Trump vowed to ""unleash American energy"" and eliminate what's been called an ""EV mandate"" instituted by his predecessor, President Joe Biden.

Trump has since rolled back strict fuel economy rules, sought to cancel federal EV charger funding and eliminated EV tax credits. Trump's own cabinet is also extensively staffed with officials who have strong ties to the fossil-fuel industry.

But Michigan’s lawsuit goes further, including claims of technology and climate data suppression that stretch back decades—and have since left people in that state without viable energy alternatives.

""Drivers in Michigan continue to rely on gasoline not because it is superior or cheaper, but because cleaner alternatives have been restrained,"" the lawsuit said. ""Defendants’ conspiracy [...] denied the State and Michigan consumers meaningful choices, raised switching costs, and eliminated competitive price pressure.""

While Nessel has said that this lawsuit is the first of its kind to target oil companies with antitrust laws, other states have sued the industry on climate-related grounds in recent years as well. Maine, Connecticut, New Jersey and other states have all filed litigation in recent years against various oil companies, typically alleging that the energy giants have misled and deceived consumers about the climate damage caused by fossil-fuel power.

One of their own is fighting back.,"Amelia Davidson, Kelsey Brugger",,,,,https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/25/democrats-climate-affordability-trump-00745597,"Now Democrats are increasingly showing they have decided it’s a losing message to tout the ways in which they’d curb fossil fuel production to thwart the most dire effects of climate change.
His social media thread notes that people are feeling the economic burdens of climate change throughout the country, from home insurance hikes to drops in property values.
Some are talking nearly exclusively about competitive prices for clean energy — largely in hopes of beating Republicans at their own messaging game.
Talking about affordability need not negate the focus on the impact of climate change, she said.
“Democrats and environmental groups’ climate messaging for years has been crap, and so if you go back to that crap messaging, obviously it’s not going to succeed,” Whitehouse said.","In a later interview about his posts, Whitehouse warned these “climate hushers” have also made their way into strategy conversations on Capitol Hill. He noted he’s been present for some of them, which he described as “polling presentations made to the Senate Democratic Caucus in a so-called strategy retreat that didn’t ask about climate change … There’s this massive blind spot.”

In recent years, Democrats have been handwringing over the best messaging on environmental issues to reach an electorate that cares about “kitchen table” matters – and doesn’t uniformly consider the rapidly warming planet to be one of them. Environmentalists made a strong argument during the 2024 presidential campaign that the climate crisis should be a motivator in electing Kamala Harris — but the contest went to Donald Trump.

Now Democrats are increasingly showing they have decided it’s a losing message to tout the ways in which they’d curb fossil fuel production to thwart the most dire effects of climate change. Instead, they’re choosing to focus on policies that would lower energy costs and lean hard into affordability talking points embraced by Trump and congressional Republicans.

Whitehouse understands the importance of talking about affordability — for years he’s spoken about the climate crisis as a threat to the global economy.

His social media thread notes that people are feeling the economic burdens of climate change throughout the country, from home insurance hikes to drops in property values.

That’s the message Democrats should lean into, he said, rather than shy away from.

“When leaders don’t talk about something, enthusiasm falls among voters,” Whitehouse wrote in his post. “In politics, you can often make your own wind, or you can make your own doldrums.”

This is something Democrats are grappling with on Capitol Hill. Interviews with a half dozen House and Senate Democrats revealed how many are still struggling with how to discuss climate change, a problem they consider existential but that doesn’t register among voters’ top immediate concerns.

Some are talking nearly exclusively about competitive prices for clean energy — largely in hopes of beating Republicans at their own messaging game.

“My theory of the case is that the argument that I’ve been making for 30 years is finally breaking through,” said Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.), a former clean energy professional.

“The urgency of climate change means that we have to focus on it especially when it’s not as salient with the American people, if we are to be the leaders we claim to be,” he added. “But I think that’s largely a separable conversation from what is the best way to talk about it in any given moment, that has the most ability to move public opinion.”

Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, who is on track to be the next Senate Democratic whip, has a similar perspective.

Last year, he removed “climate hawk,” along with other self-descriptions, from his bio on X. And during an event this fall affiliated with New York Climate Week, he said that “those of us in the climate community who are used to making a more broad argument about where we are in the sweep of history have to get comfortable making a more immediate argument that says the reason prices are going up is a deliberate policy choice of the Republican Party.”

Schatz said in a statement last week that he and Whitehouse were united in their ideas around “climate action,” but he also doubled down on the importance of affordability messaging at this time.

“There are think tanks and advocacy organizations that are dedicated to the proposition that climate action is incompatible with affordable energy, but those factional rivalries have been overtaken by events,” Schatz said. “Cheap is clean, and clean is cheap.”

Recent actions from the Democrats’ Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, or SEEC — of which Casten is vice-chair — have also focused squarely on energy costs and the ability of clean energy to lower Americans’ bills.

At a SEEC press conference earlier this month meant to respond to the last year of energy and environment policy under President Donald Trump, a roster of climate-focused Democrats spoke nearly exclusively about energy prices. “Trump lied; Energy costs are up,” read the main sign at the presser.

Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.), a member of the House Natural Resources Committee, said in an interview that Democrats need to focus on energy prices because Trump has used that as a justification for executive actions that bolster oil and gas.

“People, when they see the ways in which the energy policies that are serving big oil are hurting their pocketbooks, it makes it more tangible for why folks should care, in addition to the welfare of the planet,” Stansbury said.

Meanwhile, Republicans have picked up on the Democrats’ shift in talking points and have used it to their advantage.

“You actually see on the left, this debate going on right now, where a lot of people within the Democratic Party, they are talking about how they’ve lost the narrative, or the culture war, on climate,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said on Fox Business this month.

Left-leaning thinkers and independent analysts have also argued that Democrats may have gone too far in following the lead of environmental groups they say were out of touch with most Americans.

Columnist Matt Yglesias argued in a New York Times op-ed that Democrats should not be hostile to oil and gas. Longtime energy expert Daniel Yergin wrote in Foreign Affairs about the “troubled energy transition” and the need for a “pragmatic path” forward. And Veteran Democratic operative Adam Jentleson started the think tank the Searchlight Institute to curb the influence of the “groups” on party positions, including climate.

Rep. Kathy Castor of Florida, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce’s Energy Subcommittee, downplayed the notion that congressional Democrats were at odds over how to message on climate change. Talking about affordability need not negate the focus on the impact of climate change, she said.

“I think they are one in the same,” Castor said. “Take my community in Florida. We’re still recovering from Hurricane Helen and Milton and people understand that those storms were supercharged because the Gulf was very, very hot, very warm. And the rain was unlike anything we’ve ever seen. So they are trying to afford rebuilding their homes and paying their property insurance and also suffering higher rate increases.”

Whitehouse in an interview acknowledged some shortcomings to Democrats’ past depictions of climate change “as sort of a moral imperative, as an intangible thing floating out there, something that will affect polar bears,” but said the solution wasn’t to be silent in calling out the harmful impacts of fossil fuel emissions and the influence of oil and gas companies on Trump administration policy.

Ultimately, there’s only so much he can do to press his case. In recent months he has organized forums on climate change as the senior Democrat on the Environment and Public Works panel, toured red states to talk about rising insurance rates related to natural disasters spurred by global warming and said he has commissioned his own polling on the issue.

Those activities, plus delivering speeches and crafting social media posts, are among the limits of what he can achieve with his party in the minority and his colleagues making their own messaging choices.

He isn’t giving up.

“Democrats and environmental groups’ climate messaging for years has been crap, and so if you go back to that crap messaging, obviously it’s not going to succeed,” Whitehouse said. “But that doesn’t mean that the alternative is to throw in the towel.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F23%2F8e%2F20cab1e04de9922f36d8f44fe764%2Fu-s-congress-10611.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 11:00:36.261017

A tax credit is different from a tax deduction, which lowers the amount of an individual’s taxable income. Tax credits are often more valuable compared to deductions because they directly reduce your tax bill, dollar-for-dollar.

Tax credits can be nonrefundable, refundable or partially refundable. Here’s what to know when filing your taxes this year:

What is a tax credit?

A tax credit is a dollar-for-dollar amount an individual can directly subtract from their tax return to reduce the tax they owe. This can lower the total tax payment or increase the refund amount.

Tax credits are more favorable than tax deductions because they reduce the tax due, not just the amount of taxable income, according to Investopedia.

Tax credits are available for a variety of expenses, including purchasing health insurance through the marketplace, paying for higher education and covering child care costs.

Federal tax credits for electric vehicle purchases and energy‑efficient home upgrades are no longer available for 2026, after their eligibility deadlines passed in late 2025, according to NerdWallet.

How do refundable tax credits work?

Refundable credits are paid out in full, and a taxpayer also gets a refund for any remaining credit that’s still available. Some taxpayers who aren’t required to file may still want to do so to claim refundable tax credits.

There are several types of refundable tax credits, such as the Premium Tax Credit, which helps individuals and families cover the cost of health insurance premiums purchased through the health insurance marketplace.

The Earned Income Tax Credit is for low‑ to moderate‑income workers who meet eligibility rules based on income and family size.

For 2026, the IRS increased maximum earned income tax credit amounts to:

Up to $664 for workers without children.

Up to $4,427 for those with one qualifying child.

Up to $7,316 for those with two qualifying children.

Up to $8,231 for those with three or more qualifying children.

How do nonrefundable tax credits work?

For nonrefundable tax credits, once a taxpayer’s amount owed reaches zero, they won’t see any leftover amount as a refund.

Some nonrefundable tax credits must be used in the year they are claimed and expire if unused, according to Investopedia. Others, such as the Adoption Credit, may be carried forward to future years.

Nonrefundable tax credits can negatively impact low-income taxpayers because they cannot use the entire amount of the credit.

How do partially refundable credits work?

Some types of credits are partially refundable. One example is the American Opportunity Tax Credit for postsecondary education students.

Under this credit, if a taxpayer reduces their tax liability to zero before using the entire $2,500 credit, the remaining portion may be taken as a refundable credit up to the lesser of 40% of the remaining credit or $1,000, according to Investopedia.

TL;DR EraNova Metals offers asymmetric risk-reward through its undervalued Ruby Creek molybdenum project in British Columbia, trading at $10 million market capitalisation against $30 million in existing infrastructure and a 433 million pound molybdenum resource.","EraNova Metals, a new name & new President & CEO Meredith Eades, has repositioned the company to pursue dual value creation paths through both development of its 433 million pound molybdenum deposit at Ruby Creek and exploration of high-grade copper-gold-silver targets across its 30,000-hectare British Columbia property.

The Ruby Creek molybdenum project, which reached full feasibility and environmental assessment certificate stage in 2008, represents significant embedded value with $30 million in existing infrastructure against a current market capitalisation of just $10 million.

The company completed a 1,585-pound bulk sample from the Silver Surprise zone that yielded a 14.3-ounce silver bar through simple crushing and gravity separation, with grades of 4,200 g/t silver and 95% recoveries, demonstrating potential for near-term direct shipping ore (DSO) revenue generation.

EraNova is working with Tetra Tech to advance the molybdenum project toward a preliminary economic assessment (PEA), updating previous economics to reflect current market conditions as molybdenum prices show steady improvement, with minimal additional drilling required due to comprehensive historical work.

Management is exploring various development options including strategic partnerships, joint ventures, and offtake agreements for the molybdenum asset, whilst maintaining capital discipline and minimising dilution, with a lean operational team heavily invested in the company working to advance both development and exploration objectives.

The global transition to clean energy and advanced manufacturing is creating unprecedented demand for critical minerals, with molybdenum emerging as an essential strategic metal for high-strength steel alloys, oil refining catalysts, and emerging green technologies. In this backdrop, EraNova Metals presents a compelling investment opportunity through its advanced-stage Ruby Creek molybdenum project in British Columbia, combined with emerging high-grade precious metals discovery potential that provides multiple pathways to value creation.

Under the leadership of newly appointed President and CEO Meredith Eades, EraNova has undergone a strategic repositioning that recognises both the embedded value in its molybdenum asset and the significant exploration upside across its expansive land package. This dual-path approach addresses a fundamental challenge facing many junior mining companies: balancing the capital-intensive requirements of resource development with the need to generate shareholder value through exploration success.

The Molybdenum Market Opportunity

Molybdenum, whilst less widely understood than precious metals or base metals like copper, serves critical functions across multiple industrial applications. The metal is essential for producing high-strength, corrosion-resistant steel alloys used in infrastructure, oil and gas pipelines, automotive manufacturing, and construction. As economies globally emphasise infrastructure renewal and industrial upgrading, molybdenum demand continues to grow steadily.

The current market environment appears increasingly favourable for molybdenum projects.

Eades noted, ""We've been seeing this slow steady uptick in the molybdenum price, and like any project, at one minute it's amazing and the economics make a lot of sense, and then the market completely changes.""

This acknowledgement of commodity price cyclicality is important—molybdenum projects that struggled economically during price troughs can rapidly become attractive as fundamentals improve.

EraNova's positioning within the molybdenum sector carries several distinct advantages. As Eades emphasised,

""We're a molybdenum-only project, which is quite rare in general. The metallurgy is quite simple. It's not complex.""

This simplicity translates directly into lower processing costs and reduced technical risk during development and operation. Unlike complex polymetallic deposits that require sophisticated metallurgical flowsheets and multiple product streams, Ruby Creek's straightforward molybdenum mineralisation offers a clearer path to production.

Ruby Creek: Embedded Value & Development Pathway

The Ruby Creek molybdenum deposit represents a substantially de-risked asset that has already undergone extensive technical work. The project reached full feasibility study and environmental assessment certificate approval in 2008, with previous owners positioning it for mine construction before commodity price weakness led to shelving the project. This historical work created significant embedded value that the current market capitalisation fails to recognise.

The project's infrastructure represents tangible value independent of the resource itself. With $30 million invested in roads, access, and site infrastructure against a current market capitalisation of approximately $10 million, investors are essentially acquiring proven infrastructure at a substantial discount. The 433 million pound molybdenum resource provides the foundation for economic assessment, with EraNova now working with engineering firm Tetra Tech to advance toward a preliminary economic assessment that will update previous economics to current market conditions.

Critically, the technical work required to reach PEA stage does not demand extensive additional drilling programmes. The deposit has been well-defined through historical exploration, allowing management to focus capital on economic studies and engineering work rather than costly drill campaigns. This capital efficiency aligns with management's stated focus on ""execution and being disciplined around dilution,"" addressing a key concern for investors in junior mining companies where shareholder value can be eroded through continuous equity raises.

Valuation Metrics

EraNova's current valuation metrics present a compelling opportunity for value-oriented investors. The company sits at a significant discount to comparable molybdenum developers trading at approximately 2.5 cents per pound of molybdenum in-ground,

As Eades noted, ""Compared to our peers, we trade at about 2.5 cents per pound of molybdenum in the ground, while some of our peers are five to 35 cents.""

This fourteen-fold differential in valuation multiples suggests substantial re-rating potential as the company advances its PEA and demonstrates the economic viability of Ruby Creek under current market conditions. This valuation gap can be attributed from the company's previous focus and market perception as primarily a molybdenum developer may not have resonated during periods of weak molybdenum prices. The recent management transition and strategic repositioning have not yet been fully recognised by the market. Additionally, the broader junior mining sector has experienced sustained undervaluation, with many quality assets trading below intrinsic value due to limited risk capital and investor attention.

The jurisdiction also provides meaningful value. British Columbia offers established mining regulations, reliable infrastructure, skilled labour availability, and political stability—factors that reduce development risk and support project financing. The Ruby Creek property's road accessibility further enhances its attractiveness, reducing both construction capital requirements and operating costs compared to remote projects requiring extensive infrastructure development.

Development Pathways

Management's approach to advancing Ruby Creek demonstrates pragmatic flexibility in considering multiple development pathways. Eades outlined several potential structures, the openness to various transaction structures positions EraNova to capitalise on market opportunities as they emerge, whether through traditional equity partnerships, production-linked financing, or strategic acquisitions by larger producers seeking to expand molybdenum exposure.

The preliminary economic assessment represents a critical de-risking milestone that will significantly enhance the company's ability to attract strategic partners or secure development capital. By updating the project economics to reflect current costs, commodity prices, and technical parameters, EraNova can present potential partners with a clear, credible basis for evaluation and negotiation. This positions the company to potentially secure development partnerships that provide funding whilst preserving shareholder value through carried interests or production royalties.

Interview with Meredith Eades, President & CEO of EraNova Metals

Capital Structure & Financing Strategy

EraNova completed a financing round in autumn that strengthened its treasury position to fund advancement of the PEA and initial exploration activities. The financing came together efficiently despite the loss of a significant intended investor, demonstrating market receptivity to the company's strategic vision. The participation of both existing long-term shareholders and new investors suggests confidence in management's ability to execute its dual-path strategy.

The company's capital structure benefits from insider alignment, with key team members holding significant equity positions. Looking forward, management's stated focus on capital discipline and anti-dilutive strategies addresses a critical concern for investors in junior mining companies. The exploration of alternative financing mechanisms, including the potential for direct shipping ore from high-grade silver zones to generate internal cash flow, demonstrates creative thinking about funding exploration and development activities without resorting to continuous equity dilution.

Eades confirmed active interest from potential partners, noting people that have been reaching out to get more involved. Whilst remaining appropriately circumspect about specific discussions, this acknowledgement signals that the investment community and potential strategic partners recognise Ruby Creek's value proposition. For investors, this suggests that value recognition may not require years of additional technical work, but rather the completion of the PEA and effective communication of the project's economics.

The Exploration Upside: Silver & Precious Metals Potential

Whilst molybdenum provides the foundation for EraNova's value proposition, the exploration potential across the 30,000-hectare Ruby Creek property offers significant additional upside that remains largely unrecognised by the market. This discovery potential effectively provides investors with a free option on exploration success, given that the current valuation appears entirely focused on the molybdenum asset.

The Silver Surprise zone represents the most advanced exploration target, with results from a bulk sampling programme demonstrating both high grades and simple metallurgy. The 1,585-pound sample yielded a 14.3-ounce silver bar through straightforward crushing and gravity concentration, with direct smelting achieving 95% recoveries. The grades of 4,200 grams per tonne silver, with even tailings material running 3,500 g/t, indicate robust mineralisation with potential for near-term economic extraction.

The three parallel veins identified at Silver Surprise extend up to 180 metres in length and occur at surface, enabling hand sampling of the bulk sample material. This surface expression and high-grade character raise the possibility of direct shipping ore scenarios, particularly as silver prices have strengthened substantially. Management is actively evaluating this potential, with Eades noting the changing economics:

""A month ago when the price of silver was $50, we discussed could we do that. Yhe conversation at $75 it makes way more sense, and now it's in the $90s. So it seems like something that would be a miss to not think about more seriously.""

Considerations

As with any junior mining investment, EraNova carries execution risks that investors must carefully consider. The company requires successful completion of the PEA to validate the economic viability of Ruby Creek under current market conditions. Whilst historical work de-risks the technical aspects, changing cost structures, environmental requirements, and permitting standards may impact project economics relative to the 2008 feasibility study.

Molybdenum prices, whilst showing recent improvement, remain cyclical and sensitive to global industrial activity and steel production trends. A sustained downturn in industrial demand could undermine project economics and limit financing options. Similarly, whilst silver price strength enhances the exploration upside, precious metals markets can be volatile.

The company's lean management structure, whilst capital-efficient, places significant execution burden on a small team. Successful advancement of both the molybdenum development pathway and the exploration programme will require effective capital allocation, technical execution, and strategic decision-making. Investors should monitor management's ability to attract additional experienced personnel as the company scales its activities.

Permitting and regulatory processes in British Columbia, whilst generally supportive of responsible mining development, can be lengthy and complex. Although Ruby Creek received an environmental assessment certificate in 2008, permitting requirements and community expectations have evolved, potentially requiring additional engagement and approvals before construction could commence.

The Investment Thesis for Era Nova Metals

‍Significant Valuation Discount to Asset Value: Current market capitalisation of $10 million represents 33% of the $30 million in existing infrastructure value at Ruby Creek, before accounting for the 433 million pound molybdenum resource. Trading at 2.5 cents per pound molybdenum in-ground versus peer range of 5-35 cents suggests 2-14x re-rating potential based on sector-standard valuation multiples.‍

De-Risked Development Asset: Ruby Creek's 433 million pound molybdenum resource benefits from historical feasibility study and environmental approval, with simple metallurgy requiring straightforward processing. Minimal additional drilling needed before PEA completion enables capital-efficient advancement, whilst road-accessible location in established British Columbia mining district reduces infrastructure capital and operating costs.‍

Multiple Near-Term Value Catalysts: Preliminary economic assessment with Tetra Tech expected to demonstrate improved project economics under current molybdenum pricing, whilst potential strategic partnership or joint venture discussions are actively underway. 2026 exploration programme targeting high-grade silver zones offers additional catalysts through bulk sampling or direct shipping ore scenarios.‍

Exploration Optionality: Silver Surprise zone bulk sample demonstrated 4,200 g/t silver grades with 95% recoveries through simple gravity concentration, with three parallel surface veins up to 180 metres strike length. Seven distinct mineralised zones across 30,000-hectare property with copper-gold-silver-tungsten potential remain largely unexplored, providing free exploration upside.‍

Strong Management Alignment: Key technical team members including operations manager and chief geologist work without cash compensation as significant shareholders, ensuring alignment with investor interests. Explicit focus on minimising dilution through exploration of alternative funding mechanisms including DSO revenue demonstrates commitment to shareholder value preservation.‍

Strategic Flexibility, Multiple Development Pathways: Management's openness to strategic partnerships, joint ventures, and offtake agreements for molybdenum development provides optionality to capitalise on market opportunities whilst preserving shareholder value. Active interest from potential partners signals market recognition of Ruby Creek's value proposition.‍

Favourable Macro Backdrop: Molybdenum demand supported by infrastructure spending, industrial upgrading, and high-strength steel requirements, whilst silver benefits from monetary uncertainty and supply constraints. Government focus on domestic critical minerals production enhances strategic value of Canadian molybdenum supply in stable jurisdiction.

TL;DR

EraNova Metals offers asymmetric risk-reward through its undervalued Ruby Creek molybdenum project in British Columbia, trading at $10 million market capitalisation against $30 million in existing infrastructure and a 433 million pound molybdenum resource. Under new CEO Meredith Eades, the company is advancing toward preliminary economic assessment with Tetra Tech whilst exploring high-grade silver targets that yielded 4,200 g/t from bulk sampling. Trading at 2.5 cents per pound molybdenum in-ground versus peers at 5-35 cents, EraNova presents 2-14x re-rating potential as it demonstrates project economics and explores strategic partnerships. The exploration upside across 30,000 hectares provides additional optionality, with potential direct shipping ore from surface silver mineralisation offering near-term revenue generation. Management's capital-disciplined approach and heavily invested technical team working without cash compensation ensures strong alignment with shareholders, whilst multiple development pathways including joint ventures and offtakes preserve strategic flexibility.

It’s important to understand that not all of the bad news for the coal industry is coming by way of the EPA. While the CO2 limits for new coal and gas plants complicates domestic power generation, the global market for U.S. coal is softening. Up until several months ago, many people (myself included) were expecting U.S. coal exports to increase based on strong international demand. I wrote last year that even though domestic coal production was declining, significant amounts of U.S. coal (and carbon) were being consumed by European and Asian markets.

However, instead of expecting a record year of coal exports, U.S. exports are expected to decline by 5 percent this year.

Perhaps the biggest indicator is China’s announcement that they will ban construction of coal-fired power plants in three key industrial regions around Beijing, Shanhai, and Guanghzou in an effort improve air quality. The action plan from the State Council, China's Cabinet, also aims to cut coal's share of the country's total primary energy use to below 65% in 2017 and increase the share of nuclear power, natural gas and renewable energy.

In the most recent news, the country took a major forward leap after a previously delayed state subsidy agreement has now officially been secured. Ultimately, this means that the UK has received the go ahead or approval to move forward into the construction phase of its hydrogen project and advance its portfolio of projects that are looking to achieve decarbonization.

Understanding the impacts of ownership shifting in the green hydrogen project

Tax paying residents are not usually concerned with the complex issues that arise during the execution of an energy project. Instead, their main concern is reaping the benefits of the electricity or power supply once a project has finally reached completion. In the UK, agreements under the government’s Hydrogen Allocation Round (HAR1) are expected to guarantee extensive revenue support that will permit the first phase of turning meticulous planning into a full reality. This is monumental for the European country considering that it is embracing something which it has not previously done in the past.

Much has been made about the UK receiving public support during its energy related aspirations, but what is an even bigger deal is how the agreement is set to initiate shifts in project ownership which investors are paying careful attention to. 2026 might be the year that the UK moves past the previous delays that have haunted its hydrogen production potential.

The United Kingdom’s green hydrogen project: Analyzing the role of the government

In most cases, the government is the only branch responsible for halting an energy project because private corporations require approval from it. Thus, when a government finally decides to play ball and take part in a project, countries along with their residents stand to gain massively. The UK government’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) created a lot of anticipation and excitement after breaking the news that an astounding 10 green hydrogen projects have officially signed Low Carbon Hydrogen Agreements with the state-owned entity Low Carbon Contracts allowing them to receive long term subsidies. The agreed contracts are expected to foster a compromise between green hydrogen and fossil fuels.

Now investors may fully commit to strategically planning for the construction phase with more confidence that it will come to fruition.

Assessing the ownership shift in the UK’s green hydrogen project

The agreed upon contract means that the UK state will be able to support hydrogen production in a timescale spanning over 15 years. According to reports, the UK is sure that the current structure will foster private capital and significantly assist the UK in becoming one of the leading countries in clean energy.

New investors’ involvement is imminent in the green hydrogen project

Following the renewed government backing, it is almost a certainty that many companies will be seeking to benefit from it by becoming investors just as is usually the case in energy projects. For instance, consumer goods manufacturer Kimberly-Clark is set to become one of the first industrial end users to utilize green energy hydrogen at a high scale. The company has reached collaborative deals with other corporations such as HYRO, Carlton Power, and Schroders Greencoat, with the intent of securing investment agreements that will amalgamate hydrogen production with its manufacturing resources in Barrow-in Furness and Northfleet.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/21-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 11:59:21.484527

WA lawmakers want them to pay - The Olympian,Simone Carter,,,,,https://www.theolympian.com/news/politics-government/article314431886.html,"Washington state has sought to grow as a hub for data centers, but now state lawmakers are considering setting new requirements for them.

There are more than 100 data centers in Washington state, which ranks among the top 10 nationally, according to the website Data Center Map.

Data centers are physical facilities that hold various IT infrastructure to process, store and deliver data for various purposes including artificial intelligence, streaming services and online banking.

Such centers can generate sizable revenue and job growth for the communities that call them home — but concerns have begun to bubble up about their implications for local electricity rates and the surrounding environment.

State Rep. Beth Doglio, an Olympia Democrat, is the primary sponsor of House Bill 2515. During a Jan. 22 hearing on the bill, she said that lawmakers are confronting the possibility of significant demands on the state’s water, communities and power grid.

”These policies seek to protect ratepayers by ensuring new data centers are picking up the whole tab for new growth, protect against stranded assets, ensure grid reliability,” Doglio told the House Environment & Energy Committee, which she chairs.

There are more than 100 data centers in Washington state, which ranks among the top 10 nationally, according to the website Data Center Map.

Washington has worked to attract more data centers to the state by providing tax incentives. Yet 2024 reporting by The Seattle Times and ProPublica showed that the state’s courting of data centers has conflicted with its ambitious clean-energy goals.

Gov. Bob Ferguson launched a workgroup last year examining how data centers affect the state’s economy and environment.

The group’s preliminary findings, released last month, suggest that the state has work to do when it comes to meeting burgeoning power demands. They also highlighted “potential impacts” regarding water resources, and recommended shielding ratepayers by ensuring that data centers foot the bill for full energy-system expenses.

Doglio’s proposal would, in part, set new requirements for data centers. They would need to report on their energy and water use, with new or expanded facilities meeting certain thresholds for using electricity from nonemitting electric generation or renewable resources. Data centers would also pay the Department of Revenue an annual fee to deposit into a new account, with proceeds split between energy- and higher education-related purposes.

A preliminary fiscal note projects that in the fiscal 2027-29 biennium, $46.4 million would be generated from the annual fee, legislative staff said at the hearing. That number is estimated to come in at $67.7 million in the following biennium.

Data centers in Eastern Washington communities in particular, including Quincy and East Wenatchee, have led to rising local property values, job creation, funding for public infrastructure and declining levy rates, the governor’s workgroup found.

The Tri-City Herald reported in November that the Tri-Cities has received three data center proposals in the past year, any of which would mark the first facility in or near that area.

Republican state Rep. Alex Ybarra said during the hearing that data center-related water issues aren’t a concern in Quincy, which he represents. Despite 85% of its residents living in poverty, the city is home to the third-cheapest electricity in the U.S., he added.

Logan Bahr with Tacoma Power/Tacoma Public Utilities testified in support of HB 2515, which he said would help protect consumers. He also said the bill would set clear guidelines for new large-energy users.

“These same principles guided Tacoma as we implemented our large-load rate in 2024 that ensures new high-demand customers are accountable for the impacts they have on the system,” Bahr said.

The measure also saw support from climate and environmental advocates who argued that the bill would help safeguard clean air, water and salmon. Others want to see data centers report on energy use to better understand the toll on the power grid.

By 2030, the Northwest’s power supply gap is forecasted to hit close to 9 gigawatts, sparking concern about potential energy shortfalls, McClatchy previously reported

Some in the business community voiced their opposition at Thursday’s hearing.

Peter Godlewski with the Association of Washington Business noted that Grant County saw a 131% spike in tax revenue between 2005 and 2024 thanks to the data-center sector.

Tom Pierson, interim president and CEO of the Tacoma-Pierce County Chamber, said past legislation authorizing data center tax preference for Pierce, King and Snohomish counties. Before then, a data center in Puyallup had sat vacant for 13 years, he said, but today it counts some $200 million in investments — with tax dollars returning to the local economy.

“Data centers are not theoretical investments,” Pierson said. “They’re proven infrastructure.”",https://www.theolympian.com/public/latest-news/t6dcx3/picture314433937/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Beth_Doglio.png,N,,2026-01-25 11:59:26.409035

It also supplies its own autonomous driving solutions for use in conjunction with its battery electric trucks.
In its 2024 Sustainability Report released in 2025, Zijin Mining stated that the Xinjiang Zijin Zinc mine had 250 all electric mining trucks undertaking 80% of the transportation tasks in the mining area.
In addition, the safety and operating efficiency of electric mining trucks have notable advantages over diesel trucks.
But ultimately, Zijin Mining is looking to have its own in-house captive electric mining trucks.","Zijin Mining has announced a major sustainability milestone – its total installed clean energy capacity has officially surpassed 1,000 MW. This achievement reflects successful grid connections across its global operations, including a 70 MW wind power project at Bayannur Zijin in China; a 23.87 MW solar project in the Democratic Republic of Congo; and a a 25 MW solar facility at Rosebel Gold Mine in Suriname. It states: “Together, these projects mark meaningful progress in our green and low-carbon development journey.”

Alongside expanding renewable energy generation, Zijin says it continues to implement comprehensive energy-saving initiatives, including waste heat recovery systems. As a result, by the end of 2024, carbon emissions per RMB10,000 of industrial added value decreased by 35% compared to 2020, while renewable energy now accounts for more than 50% of its total electricity consumption.

But the company’s net zero transition also extends to green fleets in mining. Since 2020, the Zijin electric vehicle fleet has grown from 13 to 1,183 vehicles, and Xinjiang Zijin Zinc in China it says has become the single mine with the world’s largest fleet of pure electric mining trucks. These trucks have included models supplied by Breton Technology, which is headquartered in Shanghai and listed on the HKSE in May 2025. Breton has introduced three main BEV mining truck models to the market. In August 2022, it launched a 105-t model, the BRT105E, which enabled heavy-load uphill operations. In the second half of 2024, it launched a 120 t model, the BRT120E, with a greater payload and the 135 t range-extended model BRT135E. It also supplies its own autonomous driving solutions for use in conjunction with its battery electric trucks.

In its 2024 Sustainability Report released in 2025, Zijin Mining stated that the Xinjiang Zijin Zinc mine had 250 all electric mining trucks undertaking 80% of the transportation tasks in the mining area. It added: “The energy cost per tonne kilometre for electric mining trucks is only about RMB0.177, compared to as high as RMB0.68 when using fossil energy. In addition, the safety and operating efficiency of electric mining trucks have notable advantages over diesel trucks. With fewer complex transmission components such as engines and transmissions, these trucks have a much lower failure rate than that of fossil fuel vehicles. Moreover, the simpler operation of electric vehicles reduces the risk of accidents due to operational errors.”

At this operation and at other mines, Zijin is also working with other major battery mining truck OEMs like Tonly, LGMG, SANY, XCMG and others. For example at the Zhibula copper mine, part of the Julong Copper Mine complex, Zijin is deploying 60 SANY battery mining trucks fitted with EACON’s autonomous driving system. On January 23, 2026, Phase 2 of the Zijin’s Julong Copper Mine project was officially completed and put into production. Based on the existing mining and processing scale of 150,000 t/d, an additional production scale of 200,000 t/d will be newly added to Julong Copper Mine, resulting in an overall production scale of 350,000 t/d.

At another major Zijin operation, its namesake Zijinshan gold mine in Shanghang County, Longyan, Fujian Province, the electric fleet has also been growing. By September 2024, electric vehicles accounted for 45% of Zijinshan’s fleet, all of which support both static charging and battery swapping. The battery swap station, built by Zijin Mining and State Grid Corporation of China and launched in September 2023, can service a truck in just 8 minutes and has an annual battery charging capacity of 12 million kWh. The fleet includes the new XCMG EX80 truck, on which EACON has also deployed its autonomous driving system.

But ultimately, Zijin Mining is looking to have its own in-house captive electric mining trucks. For the problem of slow recharging speed of electric vehicles, Fujian Longking, a company in which Zijin is the controlling shareholder (its stake recently increased from 25% to 33.76%) tailored a battery box and side battery swap system plan for the Xinjiang Zijin Zinc mine.

The capacity of each battery box is as high as 770 kWh, representing Zijin says the largest capacity of side swapping battery technology globally, with a swap time of only four minutes. Leveraging these advantages, Xinjiang Zijin Zinc restructured the roles of electric and diesel trucks to optimise their use within the remaining lifespan of diesel trucks, assigning the electric mining trucks to steeper sections at the bottom of the mine and diesel trucks to gentler slopes in the upper areas. “This adjustment gives full play to the best performance of different power vehicles, reducing diesel consumption at the mining site from 42,000 t in the previous reporting period to 34,000 t.”

This relationship with Fujian Longking has recently deepened, with Zijin working closely with the company for the development of next generation battery trucks for its own use, not just in China but globally. Xie Xionghui, a Vice President of Zijin Mining is also the Chairman of Longking.

In December 2025 the first all electric mining truck developed by Zijin and Longking rolled off the Longking production line in Longyan – the 140 t class LK220E. This was it says after only nine months of development.

Longking states: “The mines of Zijin Mining are mostly located in remote areas at high altitudes, and adverse conditions such as large day and night temperature difference, high cold temperature, and high temperature have brought severe tests to the stable operation of mine equipment. The pain points of difficult operation, large load demand, and high energy consumption have become key bottlenecks limiting the efficient and green development of the mining industry.”

It adds that its R&D team has gone through several rounds of research and technical arguments, with ‘stable power, improved energy efficiency, and strong safety’ as the main goals. “By customising a pure electric special drive bridge with high carrying capacity and large tonnage, it greatly improves energy recovery efficiency, achieves the precise adaptation of power output and high endurance capacity under large heavy duty work conditions, and improves the transportation efficiency of mines.” Longking has developed a two-bridge independent central distributed drive system, enabling flexible torque distribution and adaptation to mine conditions.

The core parts of the entire vehicle are made of cold, abrasion and vibration resistant high strength materials, which translate to good shock resistance in low temperature environments. The steering and braking system combine with dual safety redundancy to significantly reduce the risk of failure; The battery pack protection level reaches IP68, which can effectively guarantee the safe and stable operation of the vehicle through dozens of rigorous tests such as soaking in water, fire, simulated collision, extrusion, and thermal diffusion.

Its adds that the LK220E can achieve seamless docking with Zijin’s intelligent mine ecosystem, “marking a new stage in the R&D and industrialisation process of Longking in the field of new energy mining equipment.” At present, Longking on key technologies such as high-capacity power battery system integration, high-power drive control, and cloud platform computing power. “By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as big data analysis, AI-driven decision-making, and simulation design, we can optimise core strategies like vehicle scheduling, energy consumption management, and intelligent maintenance, accelerate the development and mass production of next-generation fully electric mining dump trucks, and build a differentiated, high-end, and intelligent product matrix.”

The statement pointed out that as a world-leading multinational mining giant, Zijin Mining has more than 30 large-scale mines at home and abroad and in order to accelerate the construction of green and smart mines, and at the same time solve the problem of the long-term monopoly of imported brands in the high-end mining truck market, Zijin Mining has clearly put forward the goal of building “a new energy independent equipment system.” This will see it use its more than 30 mining scenarios around the world as innovation test fields so that products can continue to be tempered and iteratively matured in real and complex working conditions.

Longking: “Relying on the rich scene support provided by Zijin and the equipment R&D and manufacturing experience accumulated by Longking for decades, the company’s R&D and industrialisation of pure electric mining trucks has obtained unique fertile ground and development advantages.”

Most significantly, Zijin’s Julong Copper Mine and Longking have recently signed a number of electric mining truck procurement contracts. Longking states: “The Julong mining area is located in a high-altitude and alpine area, with a working altitude of 5,300 metres, which will fully and comprehensively verify the product performance. With an average annual operation of 50,000 kilometres, compared with traditional fuel mining trucks, each model can reduce carbon emissions by more than 120 t per year, and the cost per tonne-kilometre can be reduced by more than 30%, bringing significant environmental benefits and economic returns to mines, and filling the gap in Julong large-tonnage pure electric mining dump truck products.”",https://im-mining.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_9982.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 11:59:29.447225

A tax credit is different from a tax deduction, which lowers the amount of an individual’s taxable income. Tax credits are often more valuable compared to deductions because they directly reduce your tax bill, dollar-for-dollar.

Tax credits can be nonrefundable, refundable or partially refundable. Here’s what to know when filing your taxes this year:

What is a tax credit?

A tax credit is a dollar-for-dollar amount an individual can directly subtract from their tax return to reduce the tax they owe. This can lower the total tax payment or increase the refund amount.

Tax credits are more favorable than tax deductions because they reduce the tax due, not just the amount of taxable income, according to Investopedia.

Tax credits are available for a variety of expenses, including purchasing health insurance through the marketplace, paying for higher education and covering child care costs.

Federal tax credits for electric vehicle purchases and energy‑efficient home upgrades are no longer available for 2026, after their eligibility deadlines passed in late 2025, according to NerdWallet.

How do refundable tax credits work?

Refundable credits are paid out in full, and a taxpayer also gets a refund for any remaining credit that’s still available. Some taxpayers who aren’t required to file may still want to do so to claim refundable tax credits.

There are several types of refundable tax credits, such as the Premium Tax Credit, which helps individuals and families cover the cost of health insurance premiums purchased through the health insurance marketplace.

The Earned Income Tax Credit is for low‑ to moderate‑income workers who meet eligibility rules based on income and family size.

For 2026, the IRS increased maximum earned income tax credit amounts to:

Up to $664 for workers without children.

Up to $4,427 for those with one qualifying child.

Up to $7,316 for those with two qualifying children.

Up to $8,231 for those with three or more qualifying children.

How do nonrefundable tax credits work?

For nonrefundable tax credits, once a taxpayer’s amount owed reaches zero, they won’t see any leftover amount as a refund.

Some nonrefundable tax credits must be used in the year they are claimed and expire if unused, according to Investopedia. Others, such as the Adoption Credit, may be carried forward to future years.

Nonrefundable tax credits can negatively impact low-income taxpayers because they cannot use the entire amount of the credit.

How do partially refundable credits work?

Some types of credits are partially refundable. One example is the American Opportunity Tax Credit for postsecondary education students.

Under this credit, if a taxpayer reduces their tax liability to zero before using the entire $2,500 credit, the remaining portion may be taken as a refundable credit up to the lesser of 40% of the remaining credit or $1,000, according to Investopedia.

Clean energy is reshaping countries, economies and lives faster than anyone expected.

Bangladesh has set a global record, electrifying millions of homes powered by off-grid solar, bringing electricity to rural families who waited generations for it. Denmark has shown how wind power can move from experiment to energy infrastructure backbone. The massive purchase by Pakistan of solar panels and batteries has helped the country walk away from natural gas as a strategic fuel. And the ban by Ethiopia on fossil-fuel car imports has sparked a rapid shift to electric vehicles.

These projects are proof that clean energy works at scale.

This is because clean energy now makes economic sense. Today, more than 90 per cent of new renewable power is cheaper than building new fossil fuel plants. Investors see it. Governments see it. Communities feel it. Clean energy is faster to deploy, cheaper to run and more resilient in an increasingly volatile world.

It is also creating millions of jobs. About 16.6 million people already work in clean energy worldwide, from manufacturing to installation to innovation. In 2025 alone, global investment in renewables, nuclear, grids, storage, low-emissions fuels, efficiency and electrification hit $2.2 trillion, twice the amount that flowed into oil, gas and coal. For developing economies, this shift offers a powerful opportunity to grow without locking into costly fuel imports or outdated systems.

Energy is the engine behind nearly every development goal we care about. Without reliable, affordable energy, progress on poverty, health, education, gender equality, clean water, industry and cities stalls. In fact, an analysis across the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) framework shows that energy underpins roughly two thirds of all SDG targets, with 125 of the 169 SDGs linked to energy, either directly or indirectly. This is why access to clean energy sits at the heart of the 2030 Agenda, and why getting it right accelerates progress across the board.

Nowhere is this clearer than with climate change. Energy use produces about three quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions. If we do not transform how we power our homes, factories, transport and cities, there is no credible path to a safe climate. Clean energy is quite simply the solution. Without a rapid and sustained transformation of energy systems, no credible pathway exists to achieve net-zero emissions by mid-century or to meet the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement.

There has been real progress. Nearly 92 per cent of people worldwide now have access to electricity. Clean cooking access has also grown, and currently stands at 74 per cent globally, improving health, saving lives and easing the burden on women and girls. These gains show what is possible when ambition meets action.

But the gaps remain stark and unacceptable. 666 million people still live without electricity and 2.1 billion rely on dirty fuels to cook, breathing smoke that harms their health every day. At the same time, clean energy investment remains slow and uneven. For example, Africa, which holds some of the world’s best solar resources, receives just 2 per cent of global clean energy finance. Many countries with the greatest need are still left waiting, perpetuating poverty, inequality and health risks while constraining climate action.

This carries significant economic risk. To meet global climate goals and deliver energy for all, clean energy investment must more than triple by 2030, and much of it must go to emerging and developing economies.

The good news is that momentum is building. Governments are renewing commitments. Global plans are being updated. Clean energy is firmly on the climate agenda. And 2026 will be a defining year, with a major global review of progress on energy access and sustainability.

Clean energy is one of the rare solutions that brings people together rather than pulling them apart. It cuts emissions while creating jobs. It strengthens economies while improving health and opportunity. It gives countries more control over their futures, and communities more power over their lives.

The International Day of Clean Energy, observed each year on 26 January, is a moment to recognize just how far we have come and how much further we can go. This day is our call to accelerate action, share solutions and build momentum behind a transition that is already underway.

The building blocks are in place. The technologies work. The costs are falling. And the evidence, from villages to entire nations, shows that clean energy delivers. What is needed now is the confidence to move faster and the commitment to ensure that no one is left behind.

The international community has a decisive role to play in accelerating the build-out of clean energy infrastructure, especially across the developing world, where energy demand is rising fastest and the stakes are highest.

By mobilizing concessional finance, de-risking private investment, and transferring technology and technical expertise, developing countries can undertake grid modernization, energy storage and robust renewable projects that will, in turn, expand clean energy access and strengthen economic resilience.

If we choose ambition over hesitation, partnership over fragmentation and action over delay, clean energy can become the defining success story of this decade. It can turn global promises into real progress, lighting homes, powering schools, fuelling businesses and protecting the planet we share.

A clean energy future is not only possible. It is within reach. The choices we make today, starting now, will determine whether it becomes a reality for everyone.",https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/field/image/2026/01/un71079981_dsc2395_.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 11:59:34.784157

QADIRABAD, Pakistan—Only a few weeks to wrap up a lifetime. The thought crossed Muhammad Imran’s mind and lingered as he prepared in November to depart the country with his family, perhaps for good.

Disheartened by Pakistan’s chronic political and economic troubles, Imran decided to look for a better future elsewhere. But the other, more immediate worry was less than a mile from his family’s neighborhood in the agricultural heartland of the nation’s largest province: a giant coal-fired power plant.

“We never felt comfortable here. This environment … it’s not just about us. Everyone here breathes the same air,” Imran, 33, said somberly as his wife, Asma Rafique, comforted the younger of their two children.

The couple stepped into the courtyard of their government housing colony, awash in afternoon light that glared against a wall of broken bricks and scattered weeds. The Sahiwal power plant towered over the neighborhood, a thick white plume rising from one of its massive smokestacks.

In 2015, as countries increasingly retired coal power plants because of their health- and climate-damaging pollution, Pakistan struck a deal with China for eight new ones—starting with Sahiwal. The logic was simple: Generate more electricity fast to end destabilizing blackouts in Pakistan, while producing a return for China as part of its massive infrastructure push across the Global South.

A decade later, seven of those power plants are running and Pakistan faces new problems. Ballooning debt from the energy complexes has jacked up electricity costs, fueling a surge in rooftop solar that in turn means less money to address the debt. Communities near the plants bear the brunt of the new pollution. And many regions still experience rolling blackouts, now triggered not by lack of electrical generation capacity but because the country doesn’t have the cash to fully run the plants.

China describes its Belt and Road investment campaign as a major win for lower-income countries long exploited by the West. But a number of the projects have harmed surrounding communities, an investigative series by Inside Climate News found. And in Pakistan’s case, the power-plant deal built on the playbook developed by Western companies operating in the country years earlier.

Imran and Rafique moved to Qadirabad several years after the power plant began operating in 2017. They and their children started experiencing lingering respiratory and skin symptoms and could get no explanation for the cause. For a while, before deciding they had to leave, they tried to spare their children’s health by spending weekends with relatives, some 50 miles away in a city called Chichawatni.

“We leave every Friday and come back on Monday. That way our kids get to breathe fresh air back in our family home,” Rafique said. The air in Qadirabad is so polluted, Imran said, that his mother, who has chronic asthma, cannot visit for even a few hours.

A pharmacist at the local clinic described similar experiences. “Half the patients who come now complain of cough or eye redness,” said the man, who asked not to be named because staff is not supposed to speak with the media. “It wasn’t like this before the plant.”

How a Coal Plant Landed in the Middle of Farmland

Pakistan’s electricity shortages have persisted for decades. But the hours-long rolling blackouts that started in 2011 and continued into 2015 were among the worst in recent memory, plunging communities into darkness, shuttering factories and stalling economic growth. Under pressure, the conservative Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party then in power scrambled for fixes to calm public anger and reboot the economy.

China offered one.

Its talks with the PML-N government for the multibillion-dollar Pakistan component of the Belt and Road, the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC, included the slate of coal-fired plants.

Built for $1.9 billion by a subsidiary of the state-owned China Huaneng Group, the plant was one of many Belt and Road projects constructed by Chinese firms across the Global South.

Afia Malik, an Islamabad-based energy economist with the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, a government research organization, said the decision to rely on imported coal that Chinese investors found more viable than Pakistan’s domestic resource locked it into foreign fuel dependence and price volatility.

The terms of the contracts have caused even more problems for Pakistan.

The government agreed to pay the plant operators for 85 percent of the electricity each facility is capable of generating, whether that amount was generated or not, she said.

Pakistan already had experience with that “take-or-pay” structure. Pushed by the World Bank and other multilateral lenders to address electricity shortages in the 1990s with privatization, the country agreed to contracts with Western independent power producers that also guaranteed minimum payment based on capacity. But that threshold was 65 percent, not 85, Malik said. And even so, Pakistan is paying billions each year for 1990s-era plants operating at low levels.​

Both the older and newer contracts require payments in dollars, a further problem for Pakistan as its currency value sinks. All of that adds to the country’s “circular” energy debt, which refers to overdue payments from electricity users including households and businesses as well as transmission and distribution-related losses piled across the power system, impacting the government’s ability to pay power producers on time. That cycle has metastasized overtime and cannot subside without systemwide upgrades and reforms, experts say.

The International Monetary Fund said in a January 2024 report that the country’s circular debt stood at 2.6 trillion Pakistani rupees, about $9 billion in U.S. dollars, equivalent to 2.5 percent of gross domestic product.

Pakistan’s planning failures are to blame for the financial impacts of the CPEC plants, in Malik’s view. “[The] Chinese government didn’t ask us to take it. We asked them to come and invest here.”

Ayesha Ali, an associate professor at the Lahore University of Management Sciences who studies electricity access and structural failures in low- and middle-income energy systems, said Pakistan missed a chance in the mid-2010s to build a more balanced energy mix.

“A slower path, but perhaps more sustainable … would have integrated more renewables,” she said from her Lahore office. She pointed to hydropower, utility-scale solar and distributed mini-grids as options overlooked in the rush to end blackouts.

In a written statement, officials at Pakistan’s power ministry said CPEC coal plants “largely resolved” the country’s blackouts related to insufficient capacity. But the government doesn’t have enough money to fully run those plants because the cost of fuel, its transport and related services are so high. That, along with problems such as climate-driven breakdowns, is driving current-day outages, the ministry said.

Pakistan’s rapid, citizen-led shift to rooftop solar—with inexpensive panels from China—is both a symptom and a catalyst of this dysfunction. As more households and businesses go solar, the country’s electric utilities have fewer paying customers, further worsening their financial troubles.

The Clinic in the Shadow of the Smokestacks

When the Sahiwal power plant project in Punjab province received approval, the region’s Environment Protection Department laid out compliance requirements, including routine monitoring to ensure air quality standards would not be exceeded. The operator was also instructed to promptly address complaints from neighboring residents.

But when some local community organizations raised concerns about the plant’s impact on public health and the environment, they said the operator didn’t respond directly but rather through Chinese media platforms, little-known forums and paid content, insisting that emissions remained well within limits and complied with local laws. The groups weren’t able to confirm that: Officials at the Punjab Environmental Protection Department in the provincial capital referred them to annual compliance reports that are not independently verified or even publicly available, the local advocates said.

The Punjab Environmental Protection Department and the office of the provincial minister, Marriyum Aurangzeb, did not respond when asked by Inside Climate News whether any emissions monitoring, groundwater sampling or similar periodic testing has been done as required. They also did not say whether they would make any results public or comment on whether the government has a plan to address public grievances and health concerns.

In the absence of public monitoring and compliance data, the best way to grasp the coal plant’s impacts is to visit the modest rural health center in village 55/5L, a short drive from the government colony where Imran and Rafique lived with their two young children.

Dr. Samir Baig, a young medical doctor posted here last February, said the facility has no reliable system for tracking illnesses over time, but patterns in the steady stream of cases jump out to him.

“I’ve seen a clear burden of skin issues, and a close second is flu and sore throat. I’m seeing this from the very beginning,” he said. Upper airway irritation is also common.

The clinic’s dispenser, who joined the staff several years before the plant began operating in 2017, offered a clearer sense of how illness patterns have evolved over the years, describing common ailments like skin irritation, congestion and asthma. “In my experience, the frequency of these burdens has increased, not lessened, since the power plant started working here,” he said, asking not to be named because he was not supposed to talk with the media.

The problems both men described, even susceptibility to influenza, are what decades of health research has shown a community can expect when exposed to the toxic particles and sulfur pollution from burning coal. Coughing, throat irritation, recurrent chest infections and asthma‑like episodes are noted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the World Health Organization and toxicological assessments of sulfur dioxide and particulate pollution.

At the village 55/5L clinic, handwritten pages in English and Urdu note the illnesses reported by patients and medicines they were sent home with.

In 2018 and 2019, the first full years after the plant began commercial operation, respiratory illness was the most common complaint noted in the daily outpatient registers, documents reviewed by Inside Climate News show. Many pages are densely filled with the names of villagers from the plant’s immediate vicinity.

Children under 5 came in frequently with acute respiratory infections and fever, while older adults showed up with wheezing, shortness of breath and other chronic chest complaints.

On several days in July and September 2018, more than half the entries involve breathing complaints. None of the handwritten entries discuss causes, pollution or otherwise.

Inside Climate News was also able to review the 2022 records. In July, August and September of that year, the forms record several hundred cases of “acute (upper) respiratory infections” each month, alongside smaller but persistent numbers of pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and suspected tuberculosis cases.

Only gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhea and peptic ulcer disease rivaled respiratory illness in scale, and skin conditions like scabies trail behind them. Taken together, these reflect the infectious‑disease burden typical of rural Punjab, said a local health department expert who asked not to be named. What stood out was that respiratory diagnoses remained near the top of the list.

These clinic numbers are one of the few datasets reflecting health conditions near the Sahiwal plant. In communities exposed to coal combustion, public‑health experts typically watch for three early markers: persistently high rates of acute respiratory infections, more frequent flare‑ups of asthma and obstructive pulmonary disease and a noticeable burden of eye and upper‑airway irritation. All appear in the clinic’s registers.

None of that information can establish causation. What it shows are troubling patterns.

And independent research suggests that residents are being exposed to pollution that can harm their health. Findings published in the PLOS One journal in 2024 showed elevated levels of coal-related heavy metals in soil and crops across villages closest to the plant.

Plant operator Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy and its parent company, China Huaneng Group, did not respond to repeated requests for comment by Inside Climate News. The Chinese embassies in Islamabad and Washington, D.C., also did not respond.

Asked about conditions near the Sahiwal plant, Shezra Mansab, Pakistan’s minister of state for climate change, said Pakistan is “committed to environmental justice.” Provincial environmental agencies are responsible for enforcement but concerns will “take some time” to address, she said.

Locked in a Vicious Circle

Weak oversight isn’t limited to the coal plants’ pollution. A 2020 government-commissioned inquiry found that numerous power producers under CPEC “were earning profits far in excess of what was allowed,” with inflated project costs and contracts that “transferred most of the risk to the Government of Pakistan” and worsened the circular debt. The report urged officials to renegotiate the deals in the public interest.

As policymakers in Islamabad weigh contract revisions and early coal retirements, public officials and experts are asking why Pakistan didn’t learn from its expensive 1990s private power deals before locking the country into another exorbitantly expensive 30-year fossil fuel generation cycle.

Pakistan’s former climate change minister, Malik Amin Aslam, who was not part of the administration that negotiated CPEC power deals, sees those coal plants as a “big liability” and called the Sahiwal coal power plant “a project … done with criminal neglect.”

In a phone interview with Inside Climate News, Aslam said the plant “was clearly sited in the wrong place” and is “having disastrous effects on the people who are living around it and the agriculturists.” He said underground water sources and crop yields have both declined since the plant opened.

“It is the heartland of Pakistan and it has had disastrous results,” he said bluntly. Now the country is trapped in what he called a “very bad situation,” paying for power it no longer needs from multiple new coal plants as consumers rapidly migrate to rooftop solar.

Pakistan is negotiating to repurpose or retire some of the coal plants early, particularly Sahiwal, Aslam said. Both Pakistani business interests and outside experts say a deal to fix the country’s coal-energy conundrum would accelerate the country’s shift to renewables. But Aslam warned the talks will be difficult, given the “very luxurious” 30-year contracts to Chinese investors. “Why would they walk away from future profits?” he said.

Mansab, the minister of state for climate change, defended the country’s heavy dependence on imported coal while acknowledging planning flipflops underpinning CPEC’s power projects.

“Pakistan was in dire need of stable energy,” she said in a phone interview. The coal plants, she maintained, were built at a time when “there wasn’t so much policy … for renewables” and therefore were necessary. She did not dispute that the same projects are now at the core of Pakistan’s fiscal troubles.

Mansab also conceded that the planning assumptions underpinning CPEC deals did not materialize. The expected industrial growth “did not happen,” she said, leaving the country with more power plant capacity than it needed.

Mansab resisted calling the episode a failure of governance, saying the contacts reflected “global financing norms at that time.” But she acknowledged that Pakistan is now “relooking” at these deals both domestically and in discussions with foreign partners, including China. Without offering any specifics on timelines or possible terms of renegotiation, she said, “We cannot afford any more loans.”

Meanwhile, Pakistan’s power ministry is trying to address some of the structural problems that began with the 1990s-era power plants. Officials said in a statement that they have terminated five “redundant” independent power producers that predate CPEC, saving an estimated $210 to $215 million annually, and renegotiated terms with 14 others to save even more per year.

Davide Zoppolato, a researcher affiliated with Mapping Global China, which looks at Beijing’s overseas engagement, sees that 1990s privatization as the prelude to Pakistan’s current woes. China stepped into the policy space already shaped by Western lenders, he noted. In his view, China made a clear choice to profit from a vulnerable system.

“China was there to make money,” he said, adding that it’s not taking responsibility for the fallout.

Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged in 2021 to stop financing new coal abroad, but so far that has not helped Pakistan extract itself from CPEC coal plants.

Zoppolato said China is shifting toward a “small and beautiful” development model after years of frustration with corruption and instability in countries like Pakistan. But whatever the next phase of CPEC looks like, China now dominates both ends of Pakistan’s energy transition. It owns a major slice of the fossil generation fleet and is “almost the sole seller of solar panels” flooding Pakistan’s rooftops, he said.

That combination of long-term fossil contracts and reliance on Chinese solar imports leaves Pakistan more dependent on Beijing than before. “There’s no easy way out,” Zoppolato said.

What strikes Muhammad Tayyab Safdar at the University of Virginia about the CPEC coal plants is how the contracts maximized returns no matter how ill-thought-out any of the projects were. He said it amounts to 17 to 20 percent guaranteed profit rates, which “you wouldn’t get anywhere else in the world.” That means the investors have already recovered most of their investments, he said, even as Pakistan struggles to run the plants.

The Sahiwal coal plant, in his view, is a clear example of bad planning. The decision to build it in the middle of Punjab’s farmland “doesn’t make sense,” he said, but Pakistani officials wanted it near population centers to cut transmission losses.

He doubts Beijing will budge on restructuring or retiring Pakistan’s coal plants. “Why would they?” he asked.

What Was and What Comes Next

In 2022, Asma Rafique was posted in Qadirabad as a veterinarian at a government-run facility. The modest housing came with the job. What she didn’t realize was how difficult it would be to live next to the massive coal-burning power plant that shared a boundary wall with her residential colony.

Imran, her husband and a fellow veterinarian, had just found a job in Oman. Over the next three years, as he tried to find a good place to raise his family, he moved to Ireland and then to Australia, coming home every few months for brief visits.

Sitting in the courtyard of their Qadirabad home as the sun set on one of his final days in the country, Imran felt the weight of his family’s imminent move to Australia. They would escape the plant’s pollution, he said, but what about their neighbors?

“All the people living here, we are a family here. So I think about them as well,” he said. “It’s our collective issue, our national issue, so that should be addressed.”

It was beyond him why government officials approved such costly and dirty operations or why the plants are still running today. “I would tell them that solar and wind will be the cheapest and environment-friendly options. This will be my message for them.”

He wished he didn’t have to leave his parents. “Any expat would love to come back,” he said, adding: “I will come back.”

That has had competitors concerned even before Canada this week agreed to cut its tariffs on Chinese EVs in exchange for concessions on Canadian farm products.

Experts now say an easier path into Canada could be a big boost for Chinese carmakers looking to dominate the global market — particularly as their domestic market weakens. That poses a threat to other auto manufacturers, particularly American companies.

U.S. officials acknowledged that in remarks at an assembly plant for Jeep-maker Stellantis in Toledo, Ohio, on Friday. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the Chinese Communist Party invests in its auto industry to “control this industry.”

“Why? They want to take over the auto industry. They want to take away these jobs,” Duffy said. As far as the Canadian trade deal, he added, “They will live to regret the day they partner with China and bring in their vehicles.”

Others say the shift is inevitable.

“This is telling us that Chinese automakers continue to be really popular and are doing better and better and not just something that’s sold in global markets that are more marginal or less important to U.S. automakers,” said Ilaria Mazzocco, deputy director and senior fellow with the Trustee Chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

What makes Chinese vehicles stand out?///

Chinese-made vehicles are high-quality, stylish and inexpensive, experts say.

“It’s clear that the vehicles made by Chinese brands come at a very competitive cost but are also technologically quite desirable,” Mazzocco said. “They tend to be connected vehicles, so they have a lot of additional software capabilities that consumers seem to like. But the price point and the competitiveness are really big selling points.”

These vehicles can cost as little as $10,000 to $20,000; in the U.S., new vehicles are running close to $50,000 on average, and EVs even more so.

“They’ve found a way to make small and mid-sized cars — cars that people want — at a reasonable price,” said Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions. “These are the segments where GM and Ford and almost everybody else have abandoned.”

Why are Chinese EVs such a threat to U.S. automakers and others?///

Much of the global auto market is electrifying, an ideal opportunity for advanced Chinese automakers to capitalize on. China saw 17% growth in plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles in 2025, according to data released by Benchmark Mineral Intelligence this week, and Europe saw a 33% increase.

Meanwhile, U.S. sales of electrified cars grew just 1% last year. As the rest of the world advances, U.S. automakers have weakened their once-ambitious, multibillion-dollar electrification plans, instead opting for more efficient hybrid electric and gasoline vehicles amid the Trump administration’s shift away from EV-friendly policy.

Tesla lost its crown as the world’s bestselling electric vehicle maker last year, delivering only 1.64 million vehicles in 2025 to Chinese rival BYD’s 2.26 million.

Chinese automakers will have to meet standards required for the Canadian auto market for the latest trade arrangement to be successful — standards that are similar to those in the U.S. — which is likely to incentivize Chinese auto manufacturing investment in Canada.

The firm predicts Chinese brands will account for 30% of the global market by 2030.

“They’ve already started in Europe,” Wakefield said. “They started in South America. Now Mexico and Canada.”

American carmakers “don’t want to end up as a Brazil with your ethanol-based cars that aren’t sellable anywhere else in the world and … like Britain or Australia that used to matter in the auto world and no longer really matter.”

Why have others sought to regulate Chinese EV makers’ expansion? ///

Countries have attempted to regulate Chinese EVs from entering their markets for several reasons.

“China has become this overwhelming machine making inexpensive vehicles,” Fiorani said. “And the fear is that if you give them an inch, they’re going to take a mile. The other issue is technology. These vehicles are data centers … and the idea that a state-owned company in China could have access to where a high portion of drivers are going gives them leverage for all kinds of outlets.”

The European Union hiked tariffs on Chinese EVs last year, though the two have been resolving that at the start of this year.

“The advance of Chinese manufacturers is inevitable,” Fiorani added. “It will happen eventually. Everybody is negotiating to put up the roadblocks to figure out: What data is being processed, how much market share you’re going to allow Chinese manufacturers to have.”",https://nsjonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26016745120320.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 08:58:07.304958

He estimated the U.S. put 5.9 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in the air in 2025, which is 139 million tons more than in 2024.
The cold 2025 winter meant more heating of buildings, which often comes from natural gas and fuel oil that are big greenhouse gas emitters, King said.
That included plants using coal, which creates more carbon pollution than other fuel sources.
Solar power generation jumped 34%, pushing it past hydroelectric power, with zero-carbon emitting energy sources now supplying 42% of American power, Rhodium found.","WASHINGTON -- In a reversal from previous years' pollution reductions, the United States spewed 2.4% more heat-trapping gases from the burning of fossil fuels in 2025 than in the year before, researchers calculated in a study released Jan. 13.

The increase in greenhouse gas emissions is attributable to a combination of a cool winter, the explosive growth of data centers and cryptocurrency mining, and higher natural gas prices, according to the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm. Environmental policy rollbacks by President Donald Trump's administration were not significant factors in the increase because they were only put in place this year, the study authors said. Heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas are the major cause of worsening global warming, scientists say.

American emissions of carbon dioxide and methane had dropped 20% from 2005 to 2024, with a few one- or two-year increases in the overall downward trend. Traditionally, carbon pollution has risen alongside economic growth, but efforts to boost cleaner energy in recent years decoupled the two, so emissions would drop as gross domestic product rose.

But that changed last year with pollution actually growing faster than economic activity, said study co-author Ben King, a director in Rhodium's energy group. He estimated the U.S. put 5.9 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in the air in 2025, which is 139 million tons more than in 2024.

The cold 2025 winter meant more heating of buildings, which often comes from natural gas and fuel oil that are big greenhouse gas emitters, King said. A significant and noticeable jump in electricity demand from data centers and cryptocurrency mining meant more power plants producing energy. That included plants using coal, which creates more carbon pollution than other fuel sources.

A rise in natural gas prices helped create a 13% increase in coal power, which had shrunk by nearly two-thirds since its peak in 2007, King said.

""It's not like this is a huge rebound,"" King said. ""We're not sitting here claiming that coal is back and going to dominate the sector or anything like that. But we did see this increase and that was a large part of why emissions went up in the power sector.""

King said the list of more than two dozen proposed rollbacks of American environmental policies by the Trump administration hadn't been in place long enough to have an effect in 2025, but may be more noticeable in future years.

""It's one year of data so far,"" King said. ""So we need to see the extent to which this trend sustains.""

Solar power generation jumped 34%, pushing it past hydroelectric power, with zero-carbon emitting energy sources now supplying 42% of American power, Rhodium found. It will be interesting to see what happens as the Trump administration ends solar and wind subsidies and discourages their use, King said.

""The economic case for adding renewables is quite strong still,"" King said. ""This stuff is cost-competitive in a lot of places. Try as they might, this administration can't alter the fundamental economics of this stuff.""

Before the Trump administration took office, the Rhodium team projected that in 2035, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions would have fallen between 38% and 56% compared to 2005 levels, King said. Now, the projected pollution drop is expected to be about one-third less, he calculated.

Others who were not involved in the Rhodium report said last year's increase in emissions is an ominous sign.

""Unfortunately, the 2025 U.S. emission increase is likely a harbinger of what's to come as the U.S. federal leadership continues to make what amounts to a huge unforced economic error by favoring legacy fossil fuels when the rest of the world is going all in on mobility and power generation using low-carbon technology, primarily based on renewables and batteries,"" said University of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck.

Overpeck said that favoring fossil fuels will harm both the U.S. economy and air quality.

Longtime climate change activist Bill McKibben said bluntly: ""It's so incredibly stupid that the U.S. is going backwards on this stuff.""

The Environmental Protection Agency said in a statement it wasn't familiar with the Rhodium Group report and is ""carrying out our core mission of protecting human health.""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/photos/212064822_212009541-c688d37fbf6a41adba1f48e65d470e96_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2026-01-25 08:58:04.176683

But land-based wind projects—often described in the industry as “onshore wind”—are a much larger contributor to the nation’s electricity supply and are struggling to make even modest gains.
Since the country has only three operational offshore wind farms, onshore wind accounts for nearly all of this production.
His organization lists 58 of Iowa’s 99 counties as having rules designed to limit wind power development, including many of the counties with the strongest wind resources.
Exacerbating Global Roadblocks If Iowa isn’t building much wind power, it’s a bad sign for the industry as a whole.","SHENANDOAH, Iowa—First viewed from a pickup truck driving south on U.S. 59, the wind turbines seem small and delicate.

The newly constructed wind farm is a matter of pride for Gregg Connell, the man behind the wheel of the truck. He is a former two-term mayor of this southwestern Iowa city and an official with the local chamber of commerce.

The turbines are “beautiful,” Connell said, looking out the driver’s side window. “You’re capturing energy, you’re helping the environment.”

But the sight of a new wind farm is increasingly rare, even in Iowa, a state that trails only Texas in electricity production from wind.

Wind energy development has all but ground to a halt in the face of community opposition, a phaseout of federal tax credits and the Trump administration’s actions to slow the approval of federal permits.

Some of the administration’s most notable moves on wind power have been attacks on offshore development, including a stop-work order in December that halted construction on five projects. But land-based wind projects—often described in the industry as “onshore wind”—are a much larger contributor to the nation’s electricity supply and are struggling to make even modest gains. Without robust growth in onshore wind, the United States will be severely limited in its ability to build enough power-generation capacity to meet rising demand and combat climate change.

One of Iowa’s few new developments, the Shenandoah Hills Wind Farm, illustrates what it takes to build in the current political and regulatory environment.

The developer, Chicago-based Invenergy, faced years of blowback from residents who raised concerns about damage to the visual landscape along with concerns about potential harm to human and animal health and effects on property values. The opposition campaign dragged on into court cases and led to one county supervisor losing his re-election bid.

Though controversial, Shenandoah Hills still had the advantage of obtaining all of its federal permits before the Trump administration returned to office in January and began using federal agencies to slow or halt new projects.

If the Shenandoah Hills ordeal is what success looks like for the wind industry, then it’s understandable that investors, developers and others see few reasons to pursue new projects.

“U.S. onshore wind is in its weakest shape in about a decade, not because the technology has stopped being competitive, but because the policy and, to an extent, the macro-environment have turned sharply against it,” said Atin Jain, an energy analyst for the research firm BloombergNEF, in an email.

In 2024, the most recent full year for which data is available, wind energy produced 7.7 percent of the nation’s electricity, more than any other renewable source, according to the Energy Information Administration. Since the country has only three operational offshore wind farms, onshore wind accounts for nearly all of this production.

New projects peaked in 2020 when 14,878 megawatts of onshore wind farms came online in the United States, according to the EIA. This number has decreased steadily since then, bottoming out at 5,026 megawatts in 2024.

The industry had a slight rebound in 2025, with 7,804 new megawatts of capacity—including completed projects and those that were projected to be operational by Dec. 31—and will grow more in 2026, with 10,044 megawatts listed by EIA as planned for completion.

After that, things are likely to get much worse. Developers and analysts expect a drop-off in 2027 and beyond, when the current chill in development stemming from the Trump administration’s actions will lead to fewer completed projects.

Meanwhile, electricity demand is soaring as utilities and grid operators determine how to meet the needs of large users such as AI data centers.

There is a disconnect in the market when demand is surging while wind power development is slowing, a situation that bodes poorly for the future of clean energy in the U.S., said Michael Thomas, CEO of Cleanview, a market intelligence platform focused on power plants and data centers.

“The decline in wind energy development is one of the trends that I’m most concerned about when it comes to climate progress in the United States,” Thomas said in an email. “I’m not aware of a single model that shows us meeting our climate targets or avoiding significant warming without a huge buildout out of wind power.”

A City Divided

Connell, 76, parked his truck on the gravel lot that the wind farm’s construction crew has used as a staging ground for the past year. Workers installed the last of 54 turbines in November, bringing the total generating capacity to 214 megawatts.

Acting as a tour guide for two reporters, Connell had spent much of the day discussing his work as mayor and now as executive vice president of the chamber of commerce to attract jobs and investment to Shenandoah.

A city of about 4,900 residents, Shenandoah was the childhood home of the Everly Brothers, the musical duo behind hits such as “Wake Up Little Susie.” The main street has a vitality that many other cities of this size would envy, with a first-run movie theater and a recently renovated mill that now hosts an indoor farmers market.

Still, such vibrance is a challenge to maintain.

The median age in Page County, which includes much of Shenandoah, is 45 years, the 12th highest of Iowa’s 99 counties. To grow and prosper, the community needs to attract new residents, and, to do so, it needs to maintain and expand a tax base that can support schools and government services.

“We need more young people,” Connell said.

The Shenandoah Hills wind farm is one of the largest investments in the county’s history. Payments to landowners and local governments are projected to total $234 million over the life of the project, according to Invenergy.

For context, the Shenandoah school district has an annual budget of $28.4 million, with $6.2 million from local property taxes. The wind farm is expected to generate an additional $1.3 million in property taxes annually for the district, based on a 2022 estimate from a consulting firm on behalf of Invenergy.

Its plans for a wind farm in the area had been underway since the mid-2010s. The company already had the support of landowners willing to lease their property and of government officials who were moving forward with permit approval.

Then, in the late 2010s, something changed. In both Iowa and nationwide, wind energy projects began to face local opposition that was more aggressive and better organized than before.

Some of the shift was due to the boom in wind energy, which had already changed the landscape in parts of Iowa, contributing to backlash from residents who disliked the look of the turbines.

Some of the changing tide was partisan, fueled by the hardening of beliefs that Democrats support renewable energy and Republicans—the large majority in rural Iowa—support fossil fuels. President Donald Trump helped to popularize this view with his use of the unfounded term “wind cancer” and other criticism of wind and solar energy.

The upshot was that the development of Shenandoah Hills turned bitter.

The opposition organized on social media, including a Facebook group, Page County Horizons, which served as a forum to encourage attendance at public meetings and share video clips and articles portraying wind energy as dangerous and unreliable.

Todd Maher, who lives within view of the wind farm, opposed the project and decided in 2022 to run for the county Board of Supervisors because he felt that officials weren’t listening to concerns. He won in the Republican primary, defeating the incumbent, who supported the wind farm, and then ran unopposed in the general election.

“A lot of people want to live where they can see the sunrise and sunset without having to look at a wind turbine,” he said, interviewed on a recent Sunday afternoon.

Legal counsel warned county officials that there was a decent chance of losing in court and then facing a judgement so large that the government might need to file for bankruptcy.

Maher was unwilling to take that risk. In November 2024, he was in the majority in a 2-1 vote to accept a settlement with Invenergy that would allow the project to move forward.

“It was the toughest vote I’ve ever made,” he said. “I lost a lot of friends over it. I lost a lot of people that supported me.”

“Closed for Business”

Iowa, especially its western half, has some of the richest wind resources in the country.

Early developers capitalized on this, with the completion of Storm Lake 1 in northwestern Iowa in 1999, the first wind farm in the state with a capacity exceeding 100 megawatts. By 2010, wind farms were a familiar part of the landscape, with more than 3,500 megawatts of capacity, including some large installations along I-80, the major east-west highway that bisects the state, connecting California to New Jersey.

For years, Iowa’s leadership in wind energy was a point of pride, with the silhouette of a wind turbine appearing on the state’s license plate next to images of city skylines and farm buildings.

Wind power enjoyed bipartisan support in the state, with proponents including Democrats such as former U.S. Sen. Tom Harkin and former Gov. Tom Vilsack, and Republicans such as former Gov. Terry Branstad and U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley. They viewed wind farms as an opportunity to increase incomes in rural counties.

Their vision paid off. As of 2024, Iowa led the country in the share of electricity produced by wind farms, with 63 percent.

But the era of growth in Iowa’s wind industry is almost certainly nearing its end. Shenandoah Hills was one of just three wind farms to be completed in the state in 2025, and only one was completed in 2024, according to the EIA. The last significant year of development was 2020, when 12 projects went online.

The contraction of the industry is a grave concern for Jeff Danielson, a Democrat who served four terms in the Iowa Senate and now is vice president of advocacy for Clean Grid Alliance, a clean energy business group.

“Iowa is essentially closed for business when it comes to wind development,” he said.

The resistance comes almost entirely from the local level. His organization lists 58 of Iowa’s 99 counties as having rules designed to limit wind power development, including many of the counties with the strongest wind resources.

He described the opposition as formidable in its ability to organize at the local level and then throw out a large number of objections in the hope that one of them will stick. It’s not a fair fight, with one side repeating a litany of claims found on anti-wind websites, and the wind power companies obligated to stick to facts that will stand up in court, said Danielson.

“It’s not even really an adult conversation anymore,” he said.

If Iowa’s legislature and governor wanted to encourage wind energy development, they could pass a law to expand state authority to approve projects, limiting the ability of local governments to pass restrictions. The state has previously done this on hot-button issues such as regulating large animal feeding operations, but there’s little indication they’ll intervene when it comes to wind.

“One thing you find out about legislators is they like local control when they like it, and they don’t always like it,” said Iowa Rep. Brent Siegrist, a Republican whose district is a short drive from Shenandoah.

Siegrist supports wind energy and thinks it is important for making Iowa an attractive location for providing plentiful, affordable electricity for data centers. But he doesn’t expect any push at the state level to make it easier to build wind farms. Republicans control both chambers of the legislature and the governor’s office.

“I’m not sure that we would step into that,” he said.

Exacerbating Global Roadblocks

If Iowa isn’t building much wind power, it’s a bad sign for the industry as a whole.

But local opposition in rural areas is just one of several obstacles for wind developers.

The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July included a rapid phaseout of the production tax credit, an important federal policy that had helped to encourage development.

Developers are now on a tight deadline. Projects must be completed by the end of 2027 or begin construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify for the tax credit.

Amidst the rush to begin construction, the Trump administration has issued executive orders to slow development of wind and solar. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has taken additional steps, requiring that he personally sign off on new wind or solar projects subject to his agency’s jurisdiction.

Jain, the BloombergNEF analyst, said the global wind energy market faces challenges tied to local acceptance and slow progress in building enough power lines to serve new projects.

The United States deals with those same problems, as well as the obstacles created by its federal policies.

The U.S. outlook, Jain said, “now looks so much weaker than the global picture.”

Uncertain Ground

In Shenandoah, the wind farm is up and running but the debate over its approval has left scars.

In February 2025, Invenergy sold the project to MidAmerican Energy, Iowa’s largest electricity utility. Invenergy quietly walked away from the wind farm while MidAmerican inherited a community relations crisis.

MidAmerican has attempted to smooth things over, hosting events for landowners and community members and meeting with supervisors and engineers of Page and Fremont counties.

Outside of the two counties, MidAmerican’s publicity for the wind farm has been scant. However, in recent correspondence with Inside Climate News, the company expressed no regrets over its decision to take on the project.

“The Shenandoah Hills wind farm is an economic success story for both Page and Fremont counties,” Geoff Greenwood, media relations manager for MidAmerican, wrote in an email. The company projects paying nearly $87 million to Fremont County and $65 million to Page County in property taxes over the life of the project, said Greenwood.

“Wind energy has helped us create relationships with partner landowners and helps Iowa attract new companies to the state. It also provides direct, long-term economic benefits to our rural areas,” Greenwood added.

But as the very last turbines were erected outside Shenandoah, the atmosphere hardly felt triumphant.

The closest thing to a celebration was a ribbon-cutting held in September 2024 when Invenergy opened an office in downtown Shenandoah to manage the construction and community relations.

Connell, who has been unabashed in his support for the project since the beginning, was one of the people holding the ribbon. But his words that day didn’t feel like a victory lap.

“This has been a difficult project,” he said, quoted by KMA, the local radio station. “There are people that oppose wind, and there are people for wind. But I admire the fact that Invenergy, in my estimation, has taken the high ground on everything.”

The office closed a few months later, around the time of the sale to MidAmerican.

Maher, the county supervisor, wishes the wind farm had never happened. But since it’s here, he is hopeful that he and his neighbors can learn to live with the change.

No big countdowns, no dramatic switches being flipped overnight. But behind the scenes, something important is building momentum.

Energy experts say the way the world produces electricity is shifting again — and this time, the change isn’t loud. It’s steady, spread out, and already taking shape in places you might not expect.

Solar and wind continue to dominate global power growth

Over the past few years, wind and solar have become the backbone of new electricity generation worldwide. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), renewable energy is expected to provide around 36% of global electricity in 2026, making it the single largest power source.

Solar power remains the biggest driver of this growth. While experts say expansion may slow slightly in 2026, it is far from stopping. The IEA estimates that global solar capacity will still grow by about 540 gigawatts, even after record-breaking growth in previous years.

Some of the slowdown is linked to policy changes, supply chain issues, grid limits, and stronger industrial competition. Still, analysts expect growth to pick up again in 2027 — especially with many large projects already prepared to go live.

A quiet shift begins in an unexpected place

This is where the story becomes more concrete.

When people think of Michigan, solar energy is rarely the first thing that comes to mind. The state is better known for cars than clean power. But that image is starting to change.

Earlier this year, a major new solar project began operating in Muskegon County, turning a former industrial site into a new energy hub. The project was developed by Consumers Energy, which says it represents the future of Michigan’s power grid.

A new high-voltage transmission line, nearly 0.75 miles long, now connects the site to existing infrastructure — allowing large amounts of clean electricity to flow directly into the grid.

Half a million panels, built to follow the sun

The Muskegon Solar Plant is a 250-megawatt project spread across 1,900 acres. Once fully running, it will use up to 500,000 sun-tracking solar panels, arranged in long rows across the site.

Unlike traditional fixed panels, these panels move with the sun throughout the day. This simple motion helps them capture more light, boost efficiency, and increase total power output.

The result is significant: the plant is expected to generate enough electricity to power nearly 40,000 homes in Michigan.

Project partners say the site shows what happens when local expertise, modern technology, and long-term planning come together. Beyond clean power, the project also strengthens regional energy security and reduces dependence on older systems.

While solar growth may slow slightly this year, projects like Muskegon show the bigger picture. Solar isn’t fading — it’s spreading, adapting, and quietly becoming a central part of how electricity is made.

And as more plants like this come online around the world, 2026 may be remembered as the year solar power truly stepped into the spotlight.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/7.-Energies-Media-Up-to-500000-sun-tracking-panels-to-power-40000-homes-—-Michigan-s-Muskegon-Solar-Plant-begins-operations.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 14:58:47.821036

LFP chemistry has now become the dominant technology in the country’s EV ecosystem, moving beyond mass-market models and gaining acceptance even in higher-end vehicles.

LFP batteries become the mainstream choice

Several Chinese carmakers have increasingly aligned their product strategies around LFP batteries. Manufacturers that once depended on nickel manganese cobalt chemistry have either expanded their LFP offerings or redesigned their portfolios entirely. Advances in battery design and manufacturing have helped LFP cells address earlier concerns around energy density, while offering cost stability and durability.

This transition is reflected clearly in production data. In 2025, LFP batteries accounted for 625.3 GWh, representing more than 81 per cent of China’s total EV battery output. This marked a year-on-year increase of over 50 per cent. In contrast, NMC batteries contributed 144.1 GWh, or under 19 per cent of the market, with growth remaining marginal. The figures underline a steady decline in the relevance of NMC chemistry within China’s fast-growing EV sector.

Production momentum stays strong through the year

Battery production in 2025 exceeded the previous year’s levels in every month, despite seasonal slowdowns linked to the Chinese New Year. December emerged as a high point, with output reaching close to 100 GWh. LFP batteries continued to dominate monthly volumes, while NMC production showed limited movement compared to previous years.

CATL and BYD drive market concentration

Two manufacturers continue to anchor the market. CATL retained its leadership with over 333 GWh of EV battery production, giving it more than 43 per cent market share. BYD followed with nearly 166 GWh and over 21 per cent share. Although several other battery makers increased their presence, their combined impact remains limited, with most holding single-digit shares.

CATL’s position is particularly strong in the NMC segment, where it controls over two-thirds of total output. In LFP batteries, CATL also leads, though the gap with BYD is narrower. Other players such as Gotion High-Tech and CALB remain some distance behind, reinforcing the concentration at the top of China’s EV battery manufacturing sector.

The result would be damaging for Texas oil and gas production, the backbone of the state's economy, some experts argued.
And parts of Texas, such as the Permian Basin, where city and county governments rely on oil and gas, stand to lose revenue as a result.
Texas Oil and Gas Association President Todd Staples said in a statement that the current conditions don't spell serious trouble for the industry.
""The Texas oil and natural gas industry has a long history of delivering essential products while navigating price volatility,"" Staples said.","After covid-19 tanked oil prices, Texas' oil and gas industry rebounded.

By 2024, operators were drilling record amounts of oil. Each barrel sold for at least $70, bringing profits and momentum that enriched the state's coffers, school districts and local government budgets with billions in tax revenue.

Now, President Donald Trump's pledge to bring oil prices down to $50 a barrel could decimate that momentum, making trouble -- even if temporarily -- for the Lone Star State.

Trump, who suggested the U.S. should take control of Venezuela's oil after the country arrested President Nicolás Maduro, could certainly deliver on his promise to lower fuel costs for consumers by flooding the market with the South American country's oil.

The result would be damaging for Texas oil and gas production, the backbone of the state's economy, some experts argued. Operators will find it harder to break even on costs -- much less profit -- resulting in dwindling production for the industry's estimated 495,000 Texas employees. And parts of Texas, such as the Permian Basin, where city and county governments rely on oil and gas, stand to lose revenue as a result.

Tom Manskey, director of economic development for Odessa, said prices that low, while beneficial at the gas pump, could injure the regional economy. In Odessa, a city of about 120,000, oil and gas is the dominant employer, he said.

""I would imagine it would have a negative effect on our region with regards to jobs and everything else,"" Manskey said. ""We're in a very unpredictable economic time, and I think that's just adding to it. There's no predictability right now in the marketplace.""

Ray Perryman, an economist and founder of the Perryman Group, which conducts economic analyses across several Texas industries, suggested that if the price per barrel drops to $50, it would cause trouble and major market shifts with short and long-term impacts. Oil companies would change their practices and limit how much new oil is entering the marketplace, eventually driving the cost back up to make a profit, creating a volatile and unpredictable economic environment.

""If oil prices were to drop to $50 per barrel, the short-term effects are likely to be somewhat positive for many segments of the U.S. economy, but there would clearly be winners and losers,"" Perryman said.

""In an area such as the Permian Basin, reducing activity in the oil and gas industry has substantial ripple effects on housing, retail in other areas,"" Perryman said. ""Because economic activity leads to tax receipts, an inevitable outcome is lower tax revenue to local entities.""

Other oil and gas industry leaders were bullish on the economy. While production will take a hit, existing drilling techniques will help operators continue to access an abundance of oil, said Ed Longanecker, president of the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association, an industry trade group. Horizontal drilling, for instance, allows operators to access larger reservoirs of hydrocarbons, reducing the need to drill new wells.

""A slight decline in production in 2026 would modestly pressure (state and local) budgets, but Texas'srobust economy and drilling efficiencies would help to mitigate statewide impacts,"" Longanecker said.

Texas Oil and Gas Association President Todd Staples said in a statement that the current conditions don't spell serious trouble for the industry.

""The Texas oil and natural gas industry has a long history of delivering essential products while navigating price volatility,"" Staples said. ""What we're seeing today reflects market adjustment rather than distress, recognizing that companies are necessarily adapting to current and forecasted market conditions.""

Staples said efficiency and innovation allow Texas producers to remain competitive into the future.

In Texas, it takes at least $62 per barrel to cover the cost of drilling more oil and gas wells and still make money.

Anything below that that price, operators will make little -- if any -- money from their wells, said Dane Gregoris, managing director of Enverus, an energy analytics firm. And shareholders who have been pushing oil companies to become profitable would not see their demands met.

Despite Trump's promise to ""drill, baby, drill"" oil and gas production in Texas between December 2024 and October 2025 remained relatively flat, at 5.8 million barrels per day. The number of drilling rigs, which indicate whether there is an appetite to extract more oil and gas, also declined. Texas has lost 20 rigs since Trump took office, according to the company's data.

""These companies would be in survival mode rather than thriving in this environment,"" Gregoris said. ""At $50 (a barrel), things look pretty dire, and then at $40, you're looking at big cuts to capital budgets, likely big declines in crude oil production in the US, and a significant amount of sort of cash flow negative producers out there, which usually spells trouble for foreign investors in the space.""

Declining production could have damaging effects on regional economies that rely on the industry for its revenue and workforce. Companies, for instance, could lay off more workers who are a key tax base for Odessa, said Renee Earls, president and chief executive of the city's Chamber of Commerce. If those workers spend less, the local economy slows.

""We're all in the oil business, regardless of whether we work at a restaurant, in a chamber, or in a bank,"" she said. ""We've learned to always prefer stability.""

Earls, who has witnessed many booms and busts in West Texas, said she'd really start to panic if oil dropped to $40 a barrel.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/static-4/teaser_images/www.nwaonline.com_default.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 04:58:14.693921

Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, we are reversing those failures and using every available tool to keep the lights on and Americans safe through this storm.”

On day one, President Trump declared a national energy emergency after the Biden administration’s energy subtraction agenda left behind a grid increasingly vulnerable to blackouts. According to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), “Winter electricity demand is rising at the fastest rate in recent years,” while the premature forced closure of reliable generation such as coal and natural gas plants leaves American families vulnerable to power outages. The NERC 2025 – 2026 Winter Reliability Assessment further warns that areas across the continental United States have an elevated risk of blackouts during extreme weather conditions.

Power outages cost the American people $44 billion per year, according to data from DOE’s National Laboratories. This order will help mitigate power outages in the Mid-Atlantic and highlights the commonsense policies of the Trump Administration to ensure Americans have access to affordable, reliable and secure electricity.

The order is in effect from January 25—January 31, 2026.

“Wisconsin finds itself at the center of a national debate surrounding data center development,” the Clean Economy Coalition of Wisconsin (CECW) said in a statement announcing the framework Friday.
The coalition is worried data center development will lead to delays in shutting down coal-fired power plants and potentially spur investment in other fossil-fuel-powered energy infrastructure.
She also called data center regulation “one of the most important issues” currently before the Legislature.
The coalition is asking for the state to put the brakes on further data center development until a comprehensive framework is adopted.","A large coalition of environmental organizations in Wisconsin is calling for a pause on data center development until plans are in place for protecting climate goals, energy infrastructure and energy ratepayers.

“Wisconsin finds itself at the center of a national debate surrounding data center development,” the Clean Economy Coalition of Wisconsin (CECW) said in a statement announcing the framework Friday. “Too often, this discussion suggests the state only has the ability to choose between prioritizing economic growth or meeting our state’s clean energy and climate goals.”

The coalition includes dozens of major nonprofits and advocacy organizations from across the state interested in protecting the environment, advancing a clean economy and addressing climate change.

The coalition has drafted a proposed framework for regulating large-scale economic development projects, with particular focus on data centers. The organizations are calling on the governor and the Legislature to work with local communities and state agencies to adopt the framework.

The groups see data center development moving too quickly and at an unprecedented scale, with the energy needs of planned data centers expected to quickly outstrip the energy consumption of all the residential consumers in the state. The coalition is worried data center development will lead to delays in shutting down coal-fired power plants and potentially spur investment in other fossil-fuel-powered energy infrastructure. They are also concerned about the impact rapid data center development will have on the state’s energy grid, the cost residents pay for utilities and the environment.

“By placing Wisconsin’s clean energy and climate commitments at the center of planning, Wisconsin’s leaders can steer data center development in a way that prioritizes energy affordability, safeguards public health, and upholds our clean energy and climate commitments,” the coalition said.

To protect these priorities, the framework includes 10 general policy solutions for state government to work toward:

Ensure lower costs for ratepayers

Lead with 100% clean energy

Maximize investment in an array of non-fossil-fuel energy sources to meet demand

Plan for future energy infrastructure needs

Ensure prevailing wage and labor standards for the workforce involved in data center development

Negotiate community benefits agreements between tech companies and local communities

Engage local communities

Protect taxpayers through responsible use of public funding for economic incentives

Minimize water use and protect local natural resources

Create consistent reporting requirements for environmental impact and energy use

The proposed framework stands in contrast to Republican-backed legislation that recently passed the Assembly. The bill would direct the Public Service Commission to ensure residential ratepayers are not covering the cost to construct or expand energy infrastructure for data centers, and requires them to recycle water used to cool servers. But critics point out that it does little to ensure data centers don’t drive further reliance on fossil fuels.

The bill requires renewable energy generation to occur on the property of any new data center. Democratic lawmakers who opposed the bill said the renewables provision locks data centers into fossil-fuel-generated power and makes it harder to add more renewable energy to the grid.

Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos said the provision prevents people who “don’t want to live across from a solar field” from paying for somebody else’s power needs.

State Rep. Robyn Vining said the legislation was “rushed” and fails to protect residents from rising energy costs. She also called data center regulation “one of the most important issues” currently before the Legislature.

The coalition is asking for the state to put the brakes on further data center development until a comprehensive framework is adopted.

“While we recognize the immediate and time-sensitive factors driving data center developments, we urge state leaders to take a holistic, forward-looking approach – one that balances speed-to-market timelines with long-term sustainability, affordability, and reliability practices,” the coalition said.",https://urbanmilwaukee.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-from-rawpixel-id-9648108-original-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 06:58:55.948829

Legal Battles and Uncertainty for Offshore Wind The year closed with a dramatic intervention in offshore wind.
Projects affected included Revolution Wind, Empire, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, Sunrise Wind, and Vineyard Wind.","“Drill, baby, drill” — the rallying cry of his first campaign — returned with Donald Trump as he took office again in January 2025. From the very start, the president made it clear that renewable energy would take a back seat to fossil fuels. In his inauguration speech, Trump rejected the Green New Deal, vowed to roll back electric vehicle mandates, and promised a renewed push for oil, gas, and coal, framing it as the key to lowering energy costs and restoring American energy independence.

Fossil Fuels Take Center Stage

Within his first 45 days, Trump declared a national energy emergency, expedited permits for oil and gas projects, and suspended permits for new offshore wind farms. Biden-era regulations aimed at reducing carbon emissions were revoked, and the United States formally withdrew from the Paris Agreement. Federal restrictions on drilling in Alaska were lifted, and more than 625 million acres of offshore waters were reopened to oil and gas exploration.

Shortly after returning to the White House for a second term, Trump once again ordered the United States to exit the Paris Agreement, the international pact aimed at coordinating global action against climate change. Recently, the administration went even further, severing ties with broader international climate efforts by withdrawing the country from key global bodies, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), effectively cutting off U.S. participation in multilateral climate governance.

While fossil fuels gained momentum, renewables began to face mounting obstacles. In April, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management ordered a halt to construction at the Empire Wind 1 offshore project, citing the need for a new environmental review. In August, the administration imposed a 50% tariff on imported wind turbines and parts, dramatically increasing costs for projects in development. Just days afterward, work on the Revolution Wind offshore project was suspended despite being over 80% complete. Once operational, it would have delivered enough clean energy for more than 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut.

Renewables Under Pressure, Solar Still Grows

Federal funding was also redirected away from wind energy. In September, $679 million previously allocated to twelve offshore wind projects was withdrawn or canceled, with officials citing the need to strengthen the nation’s maritime industry and core infrastructure.

Meanwhile, coal and nuclear power were elevated as policy priorities. DOE approved a $1 billion loan to restart a nuclear plant, launched programs to extract critical minerals from coal waste, and invested $800 million in small modular reactors. By January 2026, the administration claimed to have prevented the closure of more than 17 GW of coal-fired capacity and announced a $2.7 billion investment to expand domestic uranium enrichment.

Even as federal policy favored fossil fuels, U.S. solar manufacturing boomed. By October, 65 new or expanded solar and storage facilities had begun operating, bringing $4.5 billion in private investment. Domestic capacity for solar modules surpassed 60 GW, solar cell production more than tripled, and battery storage reached 21 GWh — enough to power the city of Houston overnight. Yet industry leaders warned that federal tariffs and regulatory uncertainty threatened more than 100 planned factories and $31 billion in investment.

Legal Battles and Uncertainty for Offshore Wind

The year closed with a dramatic intervention in offshore wind. On December 22, the Department of Interior issued stop-work orders for all five major projects under construction, citing national security concerns in a classified report. Projects affected included Revolution Wind, Empire, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, Sunrise Wind, and Vineyard Wind. Courts quickly intervened, granting preliminary injunctions that allowed some projects to resume, but the episode underscored the legal and political uncertainty now surrounding the U.S. offshore wind sector.

By the end of 2025, the contrast was stark. Fossil fuels and nuclear power were elevated as pillars of national energy policy, receiving loans, regulatory support, and federal investment. Renewable energy, meanwhile, faced suspensions, tariffs, funding withdrawals, and regulatory scrutiny that slowed deployment and increased uncertainty. Even as U.S. solar manufacturing expanded at record pace, the policy environment threatened to undercut that growth and shift investment overseas.",https://www.review-energy.com/fileuploads/news/review-energy-noticias-1-copia17691799041.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 04:58:05.785555

However, as Electrek notes, drivers will lose free access to Autosteer, which keeps the vehicle centered in its lane and helps it navigate curves, unless thy pay for an FSD subscription.

Until Feb. 14, drivers can purchase FSD as a one-time $8,000 upgrade, which in theory grants lifetime access to the software. FSD also offers more advanced functionality than Autopilot, including support for urban environments like city streets and tasks such as lane changes and parking. It uses more cameras, sensor data, and computing power than Autopilot.

Paying $8,000 for lifetime access may not initially seem appealing, but Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said prices for the subscription are likely to rise as FSD's capabilities advance.

Tesla did not announce why it chose to remove Autopilot, but the move comes amid the threat of a potential ban in California, as well as a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) investigation into the feature.

In December, California’s Department of Motor Vehicles threatened Tesla with a 30-day sales suspension in the state if it failed to stop using the terms “Autopilot” and “Full Self-Driving” in its marketing, arguing they were misleading and violated state law. Tesla was given a 60-day deadline to take action before the suspension would take effect.

Autopilot has also been the focus of several costly lawsuits for Tesla. In August 2025, the EV maker was found liable for $249 million in damages after a Florida court ruled that Autopilot was partially responsible for the death of a young woman in Key Largo, Florida, though Tesla is set to fight the decision.

After withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement for a second time last year and declining to send a delegation to the 30th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Brazil, the U.S. administration announced earlier this month its intention to exit the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change -- delivering yet another blow to global climate governance.

By contrast, defying global headwinds, China has accelerated its green, low-carbon transition, putting in place the world's most complete policy system on reducing carbon emissions and building the world's largest renewable energy system.

As a global leader in renewable energy, China's green production capacity not only enriches its own energy supply, but also creates broad opportunities for Global South countries to achieve low-carbon, leapfrog development, helping build a clean and beautiful world.

REMARKABLE STRIDES

In China, the world's largest electricity consumer, one in every three kilowatt-hours of electricity comes from green energy sources, powering daily life, while reshaping the national and global energy and industrial landscapes, according to the National Energy Administration (NEA).

China has ranked first worldwide in installed wind power capacity for 15 consecutive years. By November 2025, its total installed capacity had exceeded 600 million kilowatts (kW), far exceeding that of any other nation, official data show.

With vast onshore wind farms across its northern and western regions and rapidly expanding offshore projects along the eastern coastline, China's wind energy not only provides clean electricity to millions of households but also plays a crucial role in reducing carbon emissions.

Northwestern Chinese regions like Qinghai, Xinjiang and Ningxia have turned their sunbaked, wind-swept deserts into treasure troves of green power through large-scale solar development, while coastal provinces like Guangdong, Jiangsu and Shandong are scaling up offshore wind power clusters to meet high electricity demand.

China's total installed power-generating capacity reached 3.79 billion kW by the end of November 2025, marking a 17.1 percent year-on-year increase, according to the NEA. Solar power capacity led the growth with a 41.9-percent year-on-year surge to 1.16 billion kW, while wind power capacity expanded by 22.4 percent to 600 million kW.

Yao Shangheng, a researcher at the Energy Development Research Institute under China Southern Power Grid Co., Ltd., said that China has built the world's largest and most integrated renewable energy system, with complete industrial chains.

Its outputs of PV polysilicon, wafers and cells account for 90 percent of the global total, with its module outputs accounting for about 85 percent of the global total.

China is also spearheading cutting-edge technology. Recently, a Shanghai start-up announced a breakthrough in creating sustainable aviation fuels (SAF).

Using high-performance catalysts, the method converts carbon dioxide and green hydrogen produced from water electrolysis into liquid fuels, primarily hydrocarbons.

Song Xuefeng, the project's manager and vice president of Shanghai Airport (Group) Co., Ltd., said the one-stop synthesis process consumes less energy than alternatives. ""Electrolysis can tap low-cost wind and solar power in northwest China to yield high-value, storable and transportable clean fuels,"" he said.

COMMENDABLE CONTRIBUTIONS

""Two years ago, there was nothing here but barren hills and the wind blowing dust everywhere,"" recalled Sarvan Gahramanov, a civil engineer with PowerChina Huadong Engineering Corporation Limited (HDEC).

Standing at the booster substation of a new wind farm in eastern Azerbaijan, he looked up toward the ridgeline -- one now dotted with towering white wind turbines.

As one of local engineers engaged in the site's transformation, Gahramanov has witnessed every stage of the 240-megawatt Khizi-Absheron Wind Power Plant's construction. The Chinese-built project's commissioning was described by Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev as a milestone in the energy sector of Azerbaijan, a nation targeting a 30 percent share of renewable capacity by 2030.

This is only one example of how China has shared its green achievements beyond its borders. During the 2021-2025 period, the wind power and photovoltaic products China exported helped reduce around 4.1 billion tons of carbon emissions in other countries, official data show.

China's new energy products and technologies, which are of high quality and affordable, meet the urgent need of developing countries for sustainable and affordable energy, offering a viable alternative to fossil fuels and paving a new path towards green development.

In Jordan, the country's cooperation with China on green energy is helping Jordan's Economic Modernization Vision for 2023-2033, which aims to spur growth, create jobs and reduce reliance on imported energy.

Firas Blasmeh, a member of the Jordanian energy and environment association, said Chinese firms are increasingly active across the sector, from renewable power projects to equipment supply and electric transport.

""They combine technical expertise with flexible financing and fast execution,"" Blasmeh said.

Thong Mengdavid, deputy director of the China-ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Studies Center of the Cambodia University of Technology and Science, said that the renewable energy equipment produced by China has driven down costs for solar, wind and battery technologies sharply over the past decade.

""It is also helping ASEAN expand renewable power generation, smart grid integration and electric mobility infrastructure. Such cooperation supports ASEAN's commitments under the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), while positioning the region to benefit from the global transition to a low-carbon economy,"" Mengdavid said.

Georg Pflomm, the project manager at the Competence Center for Energy, Environment and Sustainable Economy of AHK Services Eastern Africa Ltd., said that Chinese-manufactured solar products have boosted energy diversification and security on a continent keen to advance low-carbon growth.

Across the globe, models such as ""photovoltaics plus agriculture"" and ""small hydropower plus aquaculture"" have alleviated the problem of insufficient electricity in rural Africa, and also improved people's livelihoods.

The U.S. academic journal Science named the renewable energy surge as the 2025 Breakthrough of the Year, noting that China's mighty industrial engine is the driver.

Quoting the Britain-based Carbon Brief, it said solar panels, batteries, electric vehicles and wind turbines exported from China in 2024 are set to cut annual CO2 emissions in the rest of the world by 1 percent.

Official data showed that during the 2021-2025 period, wind power and photovoltaic products China exported helped reduce around 4.1 billion tons of carbon emissions in other countries.

Also, Chinese firms have pledged roughly 200 billion U.S. dollars in overseas clean energy investments since 2022, reported The Wired in December, saying that this is ""beginning to narrow the gap in funding needed to slash the world's climate pollution.""

Maroun Kairouz, managing director of the World Economic Forum (WEF), told Xinhua recently that China's massive investment in advanced manufacturing and green technology demonstrates how innovation can be deployed at scale.

""China's strengths in green technology and advanced manufacturing play a vital role in addressing the dual challenges of climate change and supply chain instability,"" he said.

""China's principle of integrating industrial, digital, and climate strategies with skills development offers valuable lessons for other emerging markets,"" he said.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2026/2026-01-20/99e83a2e-a118-4444-834b-b86e6655ac11.jpeg,N,,2026-01-25 00:58:04.398427

Recognizing this evolved mission, first responders would benefit if FirstNet empowered interoperability across various public safety networks rather than focusing solely on one.
Congress should also examine the need to expand competition in public safety communications and direct agencies across the federal government to do the same.","This challenge is magnified by a foundational dynamic of the program: The “FirstNet network” is entirely owned and operated by a single telecommunications provider, AT&T. Given the magnitude of the scale and complexity of the public safety challenges facing our first responders, consolidating this risk with one provider could result in the network’s failure when police officers, firefighters and other emergency response personnel need it the most to save lives. As we have seen several times in recent years, most recently earlier this month, even the most sophisticated wireless providers can experience service disruptions.

The renewal of FirstNet should not simply be a reaffirmation of the importance of interoperable new generation communications for first responders. That debate has been settled. It must embrace a reality that public safety professionals know all too well: no matter how rugged the network, there is always a risk of failure. This includes A&T’s FirstNet network, as documented by several significant inspector general reports. Congress has a unique opportunity to consider changing technological landscapes and confront a critical question: In an era of increasing technological complexity, do we really want to put all our public safety eggs in one basket? Absolutely not. The threats we face continue to evolve, and the way we approach those threats must, too.

A natural disaster, a large-scale cyberattack, or even a local network outage could sever the capabilities of a single network, turning a lifesaving tool into a useless piece of hardware. We don’t have to wonder about these scenarios; we have evidence of the challenges posed by a single point of failure in AT&T’s FirstNet network.

A Commerce Department inspector general report evaluating the 2023 Maui wildfires found that the “FirstNet Authority did not ensure that timely, adequate [communications] services were provided to support public safety’s response to the wildfires.” As an example, the report noted that AT&T took up to 11 days to restore service at affected cell sites; even then, “issues with connectivity and communication hampered first responders’ ability to provide their services.”

The Nashville Christmas bombing in 2020 provides another instance of FirstNet falling short. The Commerce Department inspector general found that the National Guard requested a deployable for a network outage during the bombing, but it “was defective and it was no longer needed by the time it was repaired.” Notably, the bombing occurred in front of a central building housing AT&T equipment, taking out all customer and public safety services at the same time — further illustrating the inherent risks associated with excessive reliance on a single network provider.

Resilience is now the ultimate measure of preparedness. After the disruptions of the pandemic, supply chains have shifted away from a sole focus on efficiency to a new emphasis on resilience. Major companies no longer rely on a single overseas manufacturer for a critical component, instead opting for “dual-sourcing” or “multi-sourcing” from geographically diverse locations.

The principles of resilience and redundancy must guide the FirstNet reauthorization debate. As the former acting secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, I know how important it is for preparedness policy to move beyond the post-9/11 single-network paradigm and build public safety infrastructure that mirrors the redundancy and resilience we demand of other critical systems.

RESTORING AMERICA: WELL-TRAINED MIND GOES WOKE

FirstNet was created as an investment in the future of public safety communications. As Congress weighs reauthorization, it should consider how that investment can be better utilized to meet the evolving needs of first responders and how it can fully leverage a more reliable and resilient multi-provider ecosystem. Recognizing this evolved mission, first responders would benefit if FirstNet empowered interoperability across various public safety networks rather than focusing solely on one. Congress should also examine the need to expand competition in public safety communications and direct agencies across the federal government to do the same.

Given the vast public safety challenges facing our nation — including natural disasters, terrorist threats, cyber events, lone wolf actors, as well as sophisticated criminal networks — complacency is not an option. We should always be asking how we can meet the emergency response needs of today and working to prevent the threats of tomorrow. Our first responders, and the people they protect, deserve nothing less.

The Trump Administration has been looking for ways to cancel billions of dollars of commitments to clean energy projects, including solar, wind, and EV production. Hundreds of projects worth dozens of billions have been terminated since President Donald Trump took office a year ago.

In the year since Inauguration Day, the Trump Administration has made abundantly clear that it will back fossil fuels and gas for affordable and reliable energy and will look to degrade solar and wind as contributors to meeting America’s surging power demand—the highest demand growth since the 1990s, due to AI, data centers, and advanced manufacturing.

Earlier this month, the Trump Administration gave the latest signal that it prefers natural gas, coal, and nuclear power to provide the bulk of new generation supporting the data center build-out.

Energy Secretary Wright, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, and the bipartisan group of governors of all 13 states served by PJM Interconnection issued a so-called Statement of Principles urging the biggest U.S. power grid operator to hold a capacity auction, in which leading technology companies have committed to funding this new generation capacity.

Coal, natural gas, and nuclear will be the pillars of the new U.S. power capacity, providing reliable baseload, and ending years of “misguided policies” that favored intermittent energy resources such as solar and wind power, the U.S. Administration said.

Following the call on PJM for a capacity auction, the American Clean Power Association (ACP) said in an analysis that without timely deployment of significant new clean energy resources, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest states “face serious reliability risks and dramatically higher electricity costs over the next decade.”

The mismatch between immediate demand growth and the lead time of new conventional generation means that, without new clean energy development, ratepayers across nine PJM states would pay an additional $360 billion over the next ten years, driven primarily by higher wholesale electricity prices. The average residential household would see $3,000 to $8,500 in additional electricity costs over the next decade, ACP estimates.

“To keep the lights on and power economic growth, PJM needs resources that can be built quickly, operate reliably, and protect customers from surprises on their electric bills,” said John Hensley, Senior Vice President of Markets and Policy Analysis at ACP.

The Trump Administration has been actively overhauling, restructuring, and rescinding billions of dollars in clean energy loans and funding commitments established during the Biden era. This shift marks a renewed focus on supporting fossil fuels and nuclear energy as part of the nation’s energy dominance strategy.

In a recent move, the Department of Energy revealed that the Office of Energy Dominance Financing (EDF)—formerly known as the Loan Programs Office—will be modifying, reviewing, or canceling over $83 billion in what it described as “Green New Scam” loans and conditional agreements from the previous administration’s portfolio.

According to the Department of Energy, EDF has spent the past year evaluating each recipient to ensure that taxpayer funds are invested wisely and align with the current administration’s priorities.

The EDF is now being restructured to better manage public funds and to promote financing for projects that deliver affordable, dependable, and secure American energy.

For the Trump Administration, these priorities translate to supporting fossil fuels and nuclear power, while excluding solar and wind initiatives from their definition of reliable energy.

The Department of Energy noted that the Biden Administration had previously approved over $104 billion in energy financing, with $85 billion of that amount finalized or committed between the 2024 election and the 2025 inauguration.

Related: Azerbaijan Commits to Supplying More Gas to Europe Amid Production Challenges

Energy Secretary Chris Wright stated, “We discovered that more funds were distributed by the Loan Programs Office in the final months of the Biden Administration than had been allocated in the previous fifteen years.”

Out of the $104 billion in principal loan obligations from the Biden era, EDF has already rescinded or is in the process of rescinding over $29.9 billion (about 29%), and is revising another $53.6 billion (roughly 51%) of the total.

Additionally, EDF has canceled approximately $9.5 billion in government-backed wind and solar projects, opting instead—where feasible—to replace them with natural gas and nuclear upgrades that are considered more cost-effective and reliable.

Currently, the EDF has more than $289 billion in available loan authority. With the office’s new direction, EDF will now support six key sectors: nuclear energy; coal, oil, gas, and hydrocarbons; critical materials and minerals; geothermal energy; grid and transmission infrastructure; and manufacturing and transportation.

Ongoing Rollback of Clean Energy Support

The continued reversal of Biden-era clean energy funding comes as no surprise. The Trump Administration has been seeking ways to revoke billions in commitments to renewable energy projects, including those for solar, wind, and electric vehicle manufacturing. Since President Trump took office a year ago, hundreds of projects valued at tens of billions have been terminated.

Over the past year, the administration has made it clear that its energy policy will prioritize fossil fuels and natural gas to ensure affordable and reliable power, while reducing the role of solar and wind in meeting the nation’s rapidly growing electricity demand—driven by AI, data centers, and advanced manufacturing, resulting in the highest demand growth since the 1990s.

Earlier this month, the administration signaled its intention to rely on natural gas, coal, and nuclear energy to supply the majority of new power generation needed for the expanding data center sector.

Energy Secretary Wright, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, and a bipartisan coalition of governors from all 13 states served by PJM Interconnection released a Statement of Principles urging the nation’s largest grid operator to conduct a capacity auction, with leading tech companies pledging to invest in new generation capacity.

The administration asserts that coal, natural gas, and nuclear power will form the backbone of America’s future energy supply, providing stable baseload power and ending what it calls years of “misguided policies” that favored intermittent sources like solar and wind.

Following this call, the American Clean Power Association (ACP) warned that without significant new clean energy projects, states in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest could face major reliability issues and much higher electricity costs over the next decade.

ACP estimates that the gap between surging demand and the time required to build new conventional power plants could lead to an extra $360 billion in costs for ratepayers across nine PJM states over the next ten years, mostly due to increased wholesale electricity prices. The average household could see their electricity bills rise by $3,000 to $8,500 during that period.

John Hensley, Senior Vice President of Markets and Policy Analysis at ACP, stated, “To ensure reliable power and support economic growth, PJM needs resources that can be deployed quickly, operate consistently, and shield customers from unexpected costs.”

The Climate and Clean Energy Equity Fund (Equity Fund) is a trusted and strategic collaborative funder and movement-builder whose focus is to lift up the leadership and organizing of multiracial, working-class communities to drive equitable climate action and clean energy policy. The Equity Fund’s work is grounded in climate equity, strategies that mitigate climate change, rectify racial and economic injustices, and thereby create the political will needed to propel the transition to clean energy. The Equity Fund is strategically building power by: (1) Investing in the leadership and organizing of diverse communities (Black, Latinx, AAPI, Indigenous people, and communities bearing the brunt of climate change); (2) Engaging voters in these communities through nonpartisan civic engagement campaigns; and (3) Winning climate and clean energy policy solutions that reflect the priorities of communities and advance racial, economic, and environmental justice.

Founded in 2016, the Equity Fund partners authentically with community-based organizations in 14 states (Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia), to build power in communities, transform public narratives about climate change, and build political will for lasting public policies.

Grassroots groups advocating for and organizing communities of color, Indigenous, working class and rural communities – often people hit hardest by climate change – are accomplishing critical work to build the collective power of communities. These communities are often the strongest supporters of climate policy and are a key political force to advance community demands and win durable policy change. The Equity Fund serves as a conduit for foundations and donors to partner with and support these grassroots organizations across the country. Because of Equity Fund’s expertise and deep relationships with community-led groups working at the intersection of climate change and economic, racial, and environmental justice, the Equity Fund can identify and nurture local grantee partners that have large-scale bases of members and track records of winning policy victories in their cities and states. The team then works to synthesize and share lessons learned from their grantee partners so that foundations and donors can better understand how grassroots groups can more effectively build power to advance climate solutions and then develop and coordinate funding strategies that will have the greatest results.",https://d3ogvqw9m2inp7.cloudfront.net/assets/dynamic/headers/cc/responsive/partner_lib/23842/img/email-logo-23842.png,N,,2026-01-24 23:58:51.540497

As Michigan faces frigid winter temperatures, DTE Energy announced a $15 million donation to three nonprofits to help families heat their homes and stay safe throughout the winter season.

The funding includes $5 million each for The Heat and Warmth Fund (THAW), United Way for Southeastern Michigan, and The Salvation Army Great Lakes Division. The organizations provide energy assistance to residents across Michigan who are elderly, unemployed, underemployed, disabled, or otherwise in need.

“Michigan winters can be harsh, and we know how hard this season can be for families,” said Joi Harris, DTE’s president and CEO. “We want every household to feel safe and warm, and this donation is just one way we’re standing alongside the communities we serve to provide relief and hope during these challenging months.”

The $15 million commitment will help expand support for customers by preventing or minimizing service disruptions, lowering or eliminating past-due balances, providing emergency assistance during extreme weather events, and connecting households with long-term resources for energy affordability and stability. The nonprofits also help customers enroll in affordable payment plans such as DTE’s Low Income Self-Sufficiency Plan (LSP).

Help is available now. Customers are encouraged to reach out as soon as possible, as assistance can begin faster when contact is made early. Residents can call 211 to connect with local energy assistance agencies, which will guide them through the application process and help identify the best options for their situation.

IRS Direct File is gone for 2026 After piloting a free Direct File tool in limited states for the past two filing seasons, the IRS is not offering Direct File for the 2026 tax season.
But the 2025 tax law backs away from the controversial $600 threshold for Form 1099‑K reporting.","You may have heard that the 2026 tax season, which begins January 26, is the first to be impacted by President Donald Trump’s 2025 tax law, known by some as the ""big, beautiful bill.""

New tax changes, from revamped credits and one less free filing option to updated 1099‑K rules and new schedules for special breaks, could affect whether you owe money or get a tax refund, and how quickly the IRS processes your return.

On that note, the IRS is still implementing the changes and updating systems amid budget and staffing pressures. So be prepared this filing season for longer wait times for phone assistance and potentially slower resolution if your return needs extra review.

In the meantime, here are eight key 2026 tax season changes to know before you file.

1. The standard deduction is bigger

The 2025 Trump tax bill, signed into law on July 4, 2025, makes the lower individual tax brackets from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA, from Trump's first term as president) permanent. That means the seven federal income tax rates remain and range from 10% to 37%.

But for 2025 returns you'll file this tax season, the standard deduction increased to about $15,750 for single filers, $31,500 for married couples filing jointly, and $23,625 for heads of household.

(Those numbers reflect the higher base TCJA amount plus the Trump tax bill 2025 boost and inflation adjustment.) For more information, see 2025 Standard Deduction Changes Under the Trump Tax Law.

2. The SALT cap has increased — for now

Speaking of the state and local tax deduction, the ""big beautiful bill"" raises the SALT cap from $10,000 to $40,000 for 2025 returns.

The cap will increase by 1% annually through 2029. Phase‑outs begin for households with modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) over $500,000.

Note: This expansion is temporary. After 2029, the SALT deduction cap is scheduled to revert to $10,000.

The higher cap will likely have the most significant impact on joint filers with high property‑tax bills in high‑cost housing markets. For many in that group, itemizing could now result in a bigger deduction than claiming the standard deduction.

For more information, see SALT Deduction: Three Things to Know.

3. Child tax credit amounts and rules have changed

Taxpayers with children see a modestly higher federal child tax credit (CTC) for 2025, along with some eligibility rule changes.

For 2025 returns, the maximum child tax credit is $2,200 per qualifying child under age 17. That's up $200 from last year and is subject to income limits.

Up to about $1,700 of the credit can be refundable for eligible lower‑income families through the additional child tax credit, depending on earned income and other requirements.

Income‑based phase‑outs still apply. For most single filers, the CTC begins to phase out when MAGI exceeds $200,000. For most married couples filing jointly, it begins to phase out at $400,000, with the credit shrinking as income rises above those thresholds.

Co‑parents should coordinate which parent will claim each child for the year to avoid duplicate claims and processing delays.

4. Older adults get a 'senior' bonus deduction

Beginning with the 2025 tax year and running through 2028, individuals age 65 and older may claim an additional $6,000 deduction on top of their standard or itemized deduction, subject to certain conditions.

This “senior bonus” deduction phase-out starts at modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) of $75,000 for singles (and $150,000 for joint filers), and disappears once income exceeds $175,000 (single) or $250,000 (joint).

The deduction requires a Social Security number valid for work and is not available to those filing as married filing separately.

For retirees living on Social Security, pensions, and IRA withdrawals, that extra $6,000 can significantly reduce taxable income. That's especially when it's combined with the higher standard deduction and the existing extra standard deduction for people over 65.

Note: Tax software should automatically calculate the amount once the date of birth is entered, but paper filers should check the age boxes and follow the form instructions.

To learn more, see How the New Senior Bonus Deduction Works.

5. There are several new deductions and a Schedule 1‑A

The 2025 Trump tax bill also introduces several new “above‑the‑line” deductions and organizes them on redesigned schedules.

A revamped Schedule 1 now works with a new Schedule 1‑A to capture adjustments to income created by the new tax law. That includes the new car‑loan interest deduction and targeted tax relief for qualified tip income and overtime pay.

For 2025 through 2028, individuals may deduct interest paid on a loan used to purchase a “qualified vehicle,” subject to a $10,000 annual cap and strict requirements, including final assembly in the United States and other eligibility rules.

This deduction is treated as an adjustment to income, meaning eligible borrowers can benefit even if they don't itemize.

For more information, see New Car Loan Interest Deduction: Which Buyers and Vehicles Qualify.

In addition, workers can claim new deductions for certain earnings: up to $25,000 of qualified tip income (subject to income phaseouts and specific occupation eligibility) and up to $12,500 of overtime pay for single filers ($25,000 fo joint filers), subject to income limits and qualifying work definitions.

These overtime pay and tip income amounts are generally claimed through the new schedules rather than directly on Form 1040, and they depend on accurate employer reporting of wages and tip income.

Note: For many filers who previously used only Form 1040, taking full advantage of these breaks may now require completing Schedule 1 and Schedule 1‑A. Expect your tax software or preparer to ask extra questions about car loans, tip reporting, and overtime pay in its income and deductions sections.

6. IRS Direct File is gone for 2026

After piloting a free Direct File tool in limited states for the past two filing seasons, the IRS is not offering Direct File for the 2026 tax season.

Taxpayers seeking free filing options must instead rely on IRS Free File (if eligible), commercial software (some exceptions may mean filing isn't free), volunteer tax‑prep programs such as VITA and Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE), or paper forms (IRS Free Fillable Forms) to file 2025 federal tax returns.

7. Casual sellers get 1099-K rule relief

Third‑party payment platforms remain a major source of information for the IRS. But the 2025 tax law backs away from the controversial $600 threshold for Form 1099‑K reporting.

Instead, the tax agency reverts to an old rule: platforms send a 1099‑K if you have more than $20,000 in gross payments and over 200 transactions in a year. That gives casual online sellers far more breathing room.

Some side‑gig workers and people who regularly use payment platform apps for business activity will still receive 1099‑Ks, and the IRS can compare those gross amounts to what’s reported on the return.

Because a 1099‑K can also reflect non‑taxable reimbursements and sales at a loss, it helps to keep good records. Those records should separate actual taxable income from personal transfers and other non‑taxable amounts.

Good records can help lower the odds of an IRS mismatch notice or make it easier to straighten things out if the tax agency flags a discrepancy.

See: Another 1009-K Rule Change for Your 2025 Taxes.

8. Small‑business owners see full expensing again

For 2025 returns,100% bonus depreciation (or full expensing) is available and can increase the deduction you claim for the year. However, the tax break only applies to qualified business equipment placed in service after January 19, 2025.

Business owners should confirm the “placed in service” date for major purchases.

The January 19 date, not when the equipment was ordered or paid for, determines how much can be expensed on the 2025 return.

Given this mix of higher and new deductions, new schedules, and reworked rules, it makes sense to treat this filing season as more of a reevaluation rather than an automatic replay of last year.

Check your withholding or estimated tax payments against the new tax brackets and deductions, gather any 1099‑K and new‑account forms, and confirm that you're eligible to use your desired filing method.

As mentioned, because the IRS is rolling out these changes while managing budget and staffing cuts, taxpayers should anticipate longer phone wait times and slower processing for returns that need human review.

The IRS advises not waiting until the last minute to file, responding promptly to legitimate IRS letters (beware of tax scams), and using online tools where possible can also help reduce friction and improve the odds of a timely refund, if you're due one.

And, speaking of tax refunds…

As Kiplinger has reported, U.S. House of Representatives tax writers have said many filers could see 2026 refunds jump by roughly $1,000 under the new law if they claim every tax break they are entitled to.

Though, as always, whether a taxpayer receives a refund—and how much—will depend on their individual tax situation.

When The Power of the Powerless was written in 1978, Havel's country was still in the grip of Soviet Communist control. The essay could only be circulated by hand, and read in secret.

It was eventually published around the world. Havel's essay invites us to ask ourselves: how can good people sign on to the nonsense of a bad regime?

Havel presents a greengrocer who puts a sign in his window saying, ""Workers of the world, unite!""— an old Communist rallying cry.

""Why does he do it?,"" asks Havel. ""He could be reproached for not having the proper decoration in his window; someone might even accuse him of disloyalty. He does it because these things must be done if one is to get along in life.""

And, Havel asks, who would say it's wrong for workers of the world to unite?

""It is an excuse that everyone can use,"" he writes, ""from the greengrocer, who conceals his fear of losing his job behind an alleged interest in the unification of the workers of the world, to the highest functionary, whose interest in staying in power can be cloaked in phrases about service to the working class.""

Havel's essay did not call for mass demonstrations, although many would follow. It suggested that change might begin in a society when people stop the rote motions by which a government infers loyalty.

Prime Minister Carney did not mention President Trump by name. But he called on what he called middle-powers, like Canada, and most of the European states at Davos, ""to live the truth,"" and see the scaffold of American power on which so much of their security had been built was being abandoned.

""When even one person stops performing, when the greengrocer removes his sign, the illusion begins to crack,"" Carney said. ""Friends, it is time for companies and countries to take their signs down,"" and find a different way forward.

Almost half a century later Vaclav Havel's vision and words may offer strength as the world faces another great change.

This story was originally published by Canary Media and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

The Double Island Volunteer Fire Department in Yancey County, North Carolina, is the beating heart of this remote community in the shadow of Mount Mitchell, about 50 miles northeast of Asheville. Once home to a schoolhouse that doubled as a church, the red-roofed building still hosts weddings, parties, and other events.

“It was built to serve as a community center,” said Dan Buchanan, whose family has lived in the area since 1747 and whose mother attended the school as a young girl. ​“A place to gather.”

Sixteen months ago, when Hurricane Helene hit this rugged corner of countryside with catastrophic floods, Double Island’s fire department was where locals turned for help.

“This is [our] ​‘downtown,’” said Buchanan, who serves as the assistant fire chief. ​“In the wake of the storm, people were like, ​‘Let’s get to the fire station.’ That was the goal of everybody.”

“We aren’t only preparing for a disaster; we’re also helping utility diversification, cost savings, and normalization of the technology.”

Fresh out of retirement and living back in his hometown to care for his ailing mother, Buchanan drew on his long career in emergency response to spring into action. With the station, powered by generators, serving as their command center, he and his neighbors gathered and distributed food, water, and other provisions to those in need. They hacked through downed limbs and sent out search teams.

“By the end of the fourth day, we had accounted for all the residents of the Double Island community,” Buchanan said. And while no one in the enclave died because of the hurricane, some suffered while they waited for medications like insulin.

A lack of drinking water and limited forms of communication were also huge obstacles. ​“When we finally got the roads cleared, and people could get in here, we were literally writing down our needs on a notepad and giving it to whomever, and then they would ferry supplies,” Buchanan said. ​“A carrier pigeon would have been nice.”

Helene was a ​“once in 10 lifetimes” storm, Buchanan said, with devastation he and the community hope to never see again. But more extreme weather events are all but certain thanks to climate change, and today Double Island is better prepared.

The station is equipped with a microgrid of 32 solar panels and a pair of four-hour batteries. The donated equipment will shave about $100 off the fire department’s monthly electric bill, meaningful savings for an organization with an annual operating budget of just $51,000.

When storms inevitably hit, felling trees and downing power lines, the self-sustaining microgrid can provide some electricity and an internet signal.

“We’ll have at least a way to run our radio equipment, run our well and basic lighting and refrigeration,” Buchanan said, adding that the latter was vital for medication. ​“It may not seem like much—but that’s the Willy Wonka golden ticket.”

Communication, he stressed, was key. ​“If you can’t communicate, you can’t get the help you need.”

The microgrid project, called a resilience hub, was made possible by a network of government and nonprofit groups that came together after Helene to help fire departments like Double Island and other community centers with long-term recovery. Now, a state grant program is injecting a burst of funds into their efforts. Using both public and private time, know-how, and money, the program aims to create a model for resilience that can be replicated nationwide.

“We aren’t only preparing for a disaster; we’re also helping utility diversification, cost savings, and normalization of the technology,” said Jamie Trowbridge, a senior program manager at Footprint Project, a leading nonprofit in the initiative. Those benefits aren’t unique to Yancey County, he said. ​“We’d like to see this be a pilot for us on what scalable microgrid technology could be across all of western North Carolina—and maybe the country.”

The Double Island experience was common in the immediate aftermath of Helene. Across the region, communities isolated by closed roads and mountainous terrain turned to their fire departments for help.

That’s part of how Kristin Stroup got involved in the resilience hub effort. Based in Black Mountain, a popular tourist destination 15 miles east of Asheville, Stroup helped start a corps of volunteers who gathered at the town’s visitor center. In coordination with an emergency operations center based at Black Mountain’s main fire station, she led over 200 volunteers in doing whatever they could, from cooking and doling out food to making the country roads passable.

“People [were] just driving around the town with chain saws,” said Stroup, today a senior manager in energy and climate resilience with the nonprofit Appalachian Voices. The weekend after Helene hit, she said, ​“Footprint rolled into town with a bunch of solar panels. I became an instant part of their family.”

With founders who cut their teeth in international aid, the New Orleans–based Footprint Project had teamed up with the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, Greentech Renewables Raleigh, and others to pool donations of batteries, solar panels, and other equipment to deploy microgrids to dozens of sites in the region before the end of 2024. From Lake Junaluska to Linville Falls, recipients included fire stations such as the one in Double Island and an art collective in West Asheville.

By February 2025, Footprint had hired Trowbridge and another staff person to work in the area permanently. Footprint continued to cycle microgrid equipment throughout the region from its base of operations in Mars Hill, a tiny college town 20 miles north of Asheville that was virtually untouched by Helene. It launched the WNC Free Store, which donates solar panels and other supplies to residents still far from recovery—like those living out of RVs and school buses after losing their homes.

From the outset, Footprint had a critical local ally in Sara Nichols, the energy and economic development manager at the Land of Sky Regional Council, a local government partnership encompassing four counties that stretch from Tennessee to South Carolina.

“A lot of the other organizations we saw come through in the same way Footprint did, most of them did not stay. They leverage resources to do really important work, and when that work feels done, they go home,” Nichols said. ​“The fact that Footprint is working thoughtfully to figure out how our recovery and resiliency can be taken care of—while also thinking about their own organizational strategic growth—means a lot to me. They’ve been incredible partners.”

To be sure, assistance and rebuilding in the region are ongoing, and many systemic inequities exacerbated by the storm can’t be solved with a solar panel. But the power is back on. The cell towers are functioning. The roads are open. Piles of debris, from fallen limbs to moldy furniture, have been cleared. In relief parlance, western North Carolina is beginning to see ​“blue skies.”

That’s why it’s all the more important that Footprint, Appalachian Voices, and other local collaborators haven’t let up in their efforts. The web of organizations involved is thick and, seemingly, ever expanding. Last fall, the network announced it was deploying five resilience hubs around the region, including the Double Island project and a permanent microgrid at a community center in Yancey County.

“These projects, driven by a small group of determined partners, have accelerated Appalachia’s long-term resilience and preparedness,” Invest Appalachia, another nonprofit partner, said in a news release.

Now, the local public-private effort is getting a boost from the state of North Carolina. Under the administration of Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat who has made Helene recovery a centerpiece of his first-term agenda, the State Energy Office will deploy $5 million from the Biden-era Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to install up to 24 microgrids across six western counties impacted by Helene.

The money will also go to two mobile aid units for rural counties on either end of state—one in the east and one in the west. Dubbed ​“Beehives” by Footprint, these solar-powered portable units will be full of equipment that can be deployed to purify water, set up temporary microgrids, and otherwise respond to storms and extreme weather.

Expected recipients of the stationary microgrids could include first responders like the Double Island Fire Department and second responders like community centers. Peer-to-peer facilities and small businesses are also encouraged to apply.

Land of Sky and other stakeholders are choosing grantees on a rolling basis through next summer. There’s already been an inundation of applicants, and six grantees have been selected, including a community center about a dozen miles up the road from Double Island in Mitchell County. But organizers say they need more interest from outside the Land of Sky region, especially in Avery County, north of Yancey on the Tennessee border; and Rutherford County, east of Asheville, which includes Chimney Rock, a village that was infamously devastated by Helene and is slowly rebuilding.

Geographic distribution isn’t the only problem organizers have faced. Some entities—while undoubtedly deserving of assistance—aren’t appropriate for the government grant because they are located in areas at risk of future flooding.

“A battery underwater is not that useful,” Trowbridge said, ​“so if your site is in a floodplain, maybe this isn’t the right fit for you. But we definitely want you to know about the Beehive.”

Above all, organizers like Nichols, a passionate promoter of the Appalachian Region, are determined to ensure that the state’s effort is not the be-all and end-all of resilience.

“What we’re being tasked with as recipients of this money is to try and figure out how we make this a much bigger project,” she said. ​“That means we’ve brought in other partners like Invest Appalachia. We’ve been seeking other kinds of money. We’re using this state money to successfully build what could be a much more comprehensive resiliency hub model.”

She added that communities across the country—even if they think they’re safe from extreme weather and climate disaster—could take cues from the western North Carolina example.

“We were a place that was not supposed to get a storm,” Nichols said. ​“We were a climate haven.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Helene-Cropped.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2026-01-24 20:00:17.443209

The Trump Administration has been looking for ways to cancel billions of dollars of commitments to clean energy projects, including solar, wind, and EV production.
Earlier this month, the Trump Administration gave the latest signal that it prefers natural gas, coal, and nuclear power to provide the bulk of new generation supporting the data center build-out.","The Trump Administration continues to revise, restructure, and cancel billions of U.S. dollars of Biden-era loans and funding commitments to clean energy projects as the United States shifted its policy to supporting fossil fuels and nuclear power as part of its energy dominance agenda.

In the latest instalment of canceled or revised funding, the Department of Energy this week announced that the Office of Energy Dominance Financing (EDF), previously known as the Loan Programs Office (LPO), is restructuring, revising, or eliminating more than $83 billion in what it called “Green New Scam” loans and conditional commitments from the Biden-era loan portfolio.

EDF has reviewed in the past year each borrower of these funds “to ensure loans were a responsible investment of taxpayer dollars and aligned with the Administration’s priorities,” the Department of Energy said.

EDF is reforming the office to more responsibly steward taxpayer dollars and support financing opportunities that accelerate the deployment of affordable, reliable, and secure American energy.

For the Trump Administration, affordable, reliable, and secure energy means fossil fuels and nuclear power, and excludes solar and wind capacity projects.

The Biden Administration has committed over $104 billion in financing, of which $85 billion was closed or committed between Election Day 2024 and Inauguration Day 2025, DOE said.

“We found more dollars were rushed out the door of the Loan Programs Office in the final months of the Biden Administration than had been disbursed in over fifteen years,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said.

Out of the $104 billion in Biden-era principal loan obligations, EDF has completed or is in the process of de-obligating over $29.9 billion (about 29%) and has completed or is in the process of revising another $53.6 billion (approximately 51%) of this total.

EDF has also eliminated about $9.5 billion in government-subsidized, intermittent wind and solar projects, and, where possible, replacing those projects with natural gas and nuclear uprates that provide more affordable and reliable energy, DOE said.

The financing vehicle now has more than $289 billion in available loan authority, and the restructuring of the priorities of the loan office means that EDF will be backing six energy sectors. These are nuclear energy; coal, oil, gas, and hydrocarbons; critical materials and minerals; geothermal energy; grid and transmission; and manufacturing and transportation.

The latest axing of Biden-era loans to energy projects shouldn’t be a surprise. The Trump Administration has been looking for ways to cancel billions of dollars of commitments to clean energy projects, including solar, wind, and EV production. Hundreds of projects worth dozens of billions have been terminated since President Donald Trump took office a year ago.

In the year since Inauguration Day, the Trump Administration has made abundantly clear that it will back fossil fuels and gas for affordable and reliable energy and will look to degrade solar and wind as contributors to meeting America’s surging power demand—the highest demand growth since the 1990s, due to AI, data centers, and advanced manufacturing.

Earlier this month, the Trump Administration gave the latest signal that it prefers natural gas, coal, and nuclear power to provide the bulk of new generation supporting the data center build-out.

Energy Secretary Wright, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, and the bipartisan group of governors of all 13 states served by PJM Interconnection issued a so-called Statement of Principles urging the biggest U.S. power grid operator to hold a capacity auction, in which leading technology companies have committed to funding this new generation capacity.

Coal, natural gas, and nuclear will be the pillars of the new U.S. power capacity, providing reliable baseload, and ending years of “misguided policies” that favored intermittent energy resources such as solar and wind power, the U.S. Administration said.

Following the call on PJM for a capacity auction, the American Clean Power Association (ACP) said in an analysis that without timely deployment of significant new clean energy resources, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest states “face serious reliability risks and dramatically higher electricity costs over the next decade.”

The mismatch between immediate demand growth and the lead time of new conventional generation means that, without new clean energy development, ratepayers across nine PJM states would pay an additional $360 billion over the next ten years, driven primarily by higher wholesale electricity prices. The average residential household would see $3,000 to $8,500 in additional electricity costs over the next decade, ACP estimates.

“To keep the lights on and power economic growth, PJM needs resources that can be built quickly, operate reliably, and protect customers from surprises on their electric bills,” said John Hensley, Senior Vice President of Markets and Policy Analysis at ACP.

Some states have seen energy bills increase at a faster pace than others, with Washington DC experiencing the more dramatic increase, with electricity costs at 23 percent higher in 2025.

The increase in U.S. energy demand is expected to drive up consumer energy bills.","Despite President Trump’s big promises of driving down consumer energy bills, the cost of energy actually rose for consumers in 2025. Throughout his electoral campaign and during his first year in office, Trump pledged to slash Americans’ energy bills. However, his new approach to energy seems to have done the opposite, with higher prices expected for 2026 and beyond.

Upon entering office for his second term, President Trump announced a state of energy emergency, quickly passing executive orders to curb the rollout of former-President Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and limit the deployment of renewable energy, to instead focus on expanding fossil fuels. This resulted in the pause of several wind energy projects across the U.S., as well as greater investor uncertainty in the clean energy sector, which stalled development. Meanwhile, the U.S. continues to expand its oil and gas operations and is prolonging the life of several of its coal plants.

According to a Guardian analysis of data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the average household electricity bill in the U.S. was 6.7 percent higher in 2025 than in 2024. This equates to an average household spending of around $116 more in 2025 than in the previous year. Some states have seen energy bills increase at a faster pace than others, with Washington DC experiencing the more dramatic increase, with electricity costs at 23 percent higher in 2025. Indiana came in second, with a 17 percent increase.

In addition to higher electricity bills, the cost of gas has also increased, by around 5.2 percent on average in the last year, according to EIA figures. This has led to an upsurge in disconnections for unpaid bills across several states. For example, the disconnection rate in New York State rose fivefold. This trend reflects the rising pressure on the consumer to choose between essentials, as the cost of groceries has also increased.

The executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, Mark Wolfe, stated, “Instead of reducing electric bills by 50 percent, the president’s actions have raised the cost of home energy for all Americans.” Wolfe added, “It used to be the poorest Americans who struggled with their power bills, but now we are seeing more and more middle-income families who have to make sacrifices to avoid being shut off. But there’s a limit to how much people are able to sacrifice, which we are very concerned about.”

In recent weeks, Trump has claimed that the affordability crisis is a “hoax” and a “fake narrative” invented by his political enemies. The president has also suggested that 2025 was the “greatest first year in history” for the economy.

As Trump focuses on expanding oil and gas production and keeping coal plants running, Americans are losing out on cheaper and cleaner sources, such as wind energy. Because coal-fired plants are increasingly costly and inefficient to run, delaying the decommissioning of several ageing U.S. plants is costing the consumer billions. Meanwhile, works have halted on several offshore wind energy projects over the past year, as Trump has restricted development in the sector, leading several companies to fight the move in court.

The projects that have been cancelled or delayed since Trump came into office have resulted in a loss of almost 25 GW of planned energy generation, which could have provided power to almost 13.2 million households, according to a Climate Power report published in December.

Meanwhile, Trump’s broad support for large-scale data centres, to support the rollout of artificial intelligence (AI), has driven the U.S. energy demand to increase for the first time in decades. Greater pressure from consumers about rising bills and concerns over an energy supply gap has finally led the White House to call for an emergency wholesale electricity auction, aimed at forcing tech companies to pay for the new power they require to run giant data centres.

In addition to encouraging fossil fuel expansion, Trump has also shown support for nuclear power, with significant investments in a range of nuclear technologies. While new power plants could help provide vast quantities of clean power to consumers, they will take several years to develop, during which time there will likely be a power supply shortage if tech companies are given free rein.

The increase in U.S. energy demand is expected to drive up consumer energy bills. While tech companies may be more than happy to pay a high price to get their data centre expansions approved, finding the energy needed to power normal households will be challenging. This is largely because the shift away from renewable energy expansion has slowed the development of new energy capacity. While investments in nuclear power may eventually help to fill this gap, it will likely take decades for them to make a meaningful impact.

State Rep. Jack Patrick Lewis raises many important points in his opinion piece (""Democrats can't accept false premises about our future,"" Jan. 18) about the Democrats and their need for a more honest dialogue.

However, Rep. Lewis does not need to separate the topic of affordability from climate. Action on climate can actually help affordability. For example, after decades of reliance on coal, Australia is launching a plan to offer many of its citizens three hours a day of free electricity when its enormous solar output is at a peak. Here in the U.S., a study in 2015 found that the states with the most renewable energy were paying less for electricity, on average, than states with less renewable energy. Since then, the cost of renewables has come down even more. In 2024, The Wall Street Journal published an article with the title, “For Lower Electricity Prices, Invest More in Renewables.”

I hope Rep. Lewis and his colleagues keep this in mind. They should reject the provisions of the Climate Rollback Bill (H.4744) that weaken MassSave and keep us tied to natural gas infrastructure. We need to keep Massachusetts on track for a rapid transition to cleaner, more affordable renewable energy.

They are the conditions that global automotive and battery investors now expect as standard.

The UK Battery Strategy, the Modern Industrial Strategy, DRIVE35, the Battery Innovation Programme and recent gigafactory investments in Sunderland and Bridgwater all represent important steps forward.","Governments across the world are racing to secure leadership in EV and battery manufacturing. Europe, the United States and Asia are deploying substantial incentives and aggressive investment strategies, cutting planning times and lowering energy costs. The UK is in this race – but unless firm and coordinated action is taken, it risks falling behind.

Set against these challenges, however, lies a significant opportunity. Establishing a robust, domestic battery manufacturing ecosystem will create thousands of high-skilled, well-paid jobs, support regional growth and secure the long-term future of the UK’s automotive sector. It offers a route to link industrial competitiveness with net zero ambitions, demonstrating that economic resilience and environmental sustainability can – and must – go hand in hand.

Gigafactories – large-scale battery manufacturing plants – should be recognised not merely as individual industrial projects, but as elements of strategic national infrastructure. Countries that succeed in co-locating EV manufacturing with gigafactories will determine where future automotive platforms are allocated, where new EV models are built, and which nations retain volume automotive production. In short, decisions taken over the next few years will determine whether the UK remains a serious player in global automotive manufacturing or sees production and investment move offshore.

Against this backdrop, the UK cannot afford a passive “open for business” stance. It needs a more interventionalist mindset: one that combines financial incentives, site readiness and proactive ministerial engagement to prioritise attracting a major global OEM as demand anchor and secure investment in gigafactories and their supply chains. The question is no longer whether government should act, but how quickly and how decisively.

That is why the policy commission on gigafactories – bringing together senior cross-party figures and experts from industry, policy, academia and public service – has set out a clear, practical roadmap in its report, The UK Gigafactory Commission: Britain’s Battery Future. Its recommendations rest on three pillars: proactive government leadership, strengthened domestic capabilities and capacities and targeted policy and regulatory reform. These are not abstract policy ambitions. They are the conditions that global automotive and battery investors now expect as standard.

Government leadership must be central. Attracting gigafactory investment and securing long-term commitments from automotive manufacturers as a demand anchor requires decisive, top-level engagement. A named Cabinet minister should be given personal accountability for delivering a package of investments in EV, battery and active material manufacturing. That minister, supported by a small but empowered secretariat, should have the authority to convene departments, remove barriers – on grid, planning and skills – and lead senior-level negotiations with prospective investors.

Capabilities and capacity on the ground are equally critical. Investor-ready sites with pre-secured grid, water and transport infrastructure, coupled with predictable, competitive energy costs, are now a basic requirement if the UK is to compete with rival locations. In parallel, the UK must close persistent supply chain gaps by attracting investment in cathode and anode active materials and recycling, alongside development and scale up of next-generation chemistries.

Skills must be treated as strategic infrastructure as well. Gigafactories and active materials plans will require a steady pipeline of technicians and engineers. A coordinated national approach to skills – including apprenticeships specific to battery manufacturing, reskilling programmes drawing from adjacent industries and curriculum reform in colleges and universities – will be needed to build the skilled workforce required to be in place at the right scale and time.

Policy and regulatory interventions must underpin this strategy. The Zero Emission Vehicle mandate should be reviewed to align with market realities. Relief for energy-intensive industries relief must be broadened across the EV and battery supply chain on a predictable, long-term footing. A deferral or phased transition for post-2027 rules of origin deadlines should be pursued with EU partners to protect UK exporters from tariffs while domestic battery and materials capacity is built up.

There has been significant progress. The UK Battery Strategy, the Modern Industrial Strategy, DRIVE35, the Battery Innovation Programme and recent gigafactory investments in Sunderland and Bridgwater all represent important steps forward. The UK retains strong research and engineering capabilities and an established automotive base. But the Commission’s conclusion is clear: on their own, these initiatives are not yet sufficient to make the UK genuinely competitive. Without more proactive and coordinated intervention, the UK risks losing momentum at a critical time – with global firms committing capital elsewhere.

The Commission has therefore set out 10 priority recommendations that together provide a coherent roadmap. This represents a significant but achievable agenda. The next 12–18 months will be decisive. What is required is the political will, industry focus and collective resolve to turn ambition into delivery.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/d6ec20e003b07da1d4877cfb2b79fda7:bb68cd1d50b023c79ea655f3b2dab5e7/screenshot-2026-01-23-091642.png.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 18:59:25.559224

About 60% of European Economic Area LNG imports now come from the United States.","By Robert Cyran

NEW YORK, Jan 23 (Reuters) – Greenland deal or no, the international order is fraying. As the Trump administration ramped up – before stepping back from – brazen territorial claims, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney captured the mood at the World Economic

Forum in Davos: “Great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons.” The global linkage most vulnerable to disruption, from the 1970s oil shock to Russia’s aggression in Europe, has been energy. The United States controls enviable supplies. The possibility of weaponizing them, though, is ebbing.

While Uncle Sam is the world’s largest oil producer, churning out over 13 million barrels daily, it also consumes most of what it makes. That leaves just over 2 million barrels of net exports, about 2% of global consumption.

Where it dominates is sales of liquefied natural gas. It sold 111 million metric tons last year, roughly a quarter of all exports, according to LSEG data. Nations are frenziedly building facilities to handle shipments as the United States tracks toward roughly doubling export capacity by 2030.

The reason is simple. Domestic gas production surged nearly 50% over the past decade, largely thanks to a boom in hydraulic fracturing. That subdued local prices. The Henry Hub benchmark, despite a recent cold-snap-induced spike above $5 per million BTU, probably will spend most of this year below $4, judging by futures pricing.

In post-Ukraine-invasion Europe, prices are substantially higher, around $13 per million BTUs for March, based on the Dutch TTF benchmark. As the European Union sought to wean itself off Russian fuel, the United States has become the supplier of over 60% of its LNG, about a quarter of total gas supplies. This especially matters during winter doldrums, when renewable power generation falls and nations deplete their storage reserves.

However, this overstates Europe’s bind. Germany could not switch to a different supplier to fill Russian pipelines. Any ship could supply an LNG terminal. There would be delays, given that gas is usually sold via long-dated contracts. But if U.S. tankers go toward Asia instead, then gas from Qatar, Australia or elsewhere will find its way directly to Europe, or Asia buyers might re-ship gas off to the EU. After all, LNG is a fungible commodity. Meanwhile, the EU has reduced consumption by about a fifth since 2021. A further 25% drop is expected by 2030, according to the IEEFA, thanks to curtailed demand and growth in green electricity and batteries. Anxiety over U.S. belligerence might increase decarbonization budgets. That’s before getting into a rapidly growing domestic U.S. demand from data centers or rising export capacity elsewhere. The simple arbitrage underlying of cheap U.S. gas and European demand with nowhere to go was always going to wane. Trump has given his putative allies every reason to accelerate the shift.

CONTEXT NEWS

The United States exported 111 million metric tons of the fuel last year, over 20 million more than the year before, accounting for about a quarter of all global exports of the fuel, according to LSEG data.

About 60% of European Economic Area LNG imports now come from the United States.

The remarkable turnaround in sentiments regarding nuclear energy generation around the global market has opened the door to a significant revival of the international nuclear power sector. Now, the U.S. DoE has signed two new OTAs (Other Transaction Agreements) to accelerate the new surge in nuclear energy projects in the United States.

The U.S. is aiming to lead the surge in new nuclear energy developments across the international market

Since taking office for his second term, Donald Trump has shaken the U.S. energy market to its core. Trump signed several executive orders aimed at increasing the oil and gas production in the U.S., and has actively been approving the nuclear buildout as part of the government’s efforts to increase nuclear energy output in the United States.

The U.S. DOE has now finalized two new Other Transaction Agreements with Terrestrial Energy and Oklo. The new OTAs form part of the U.S. Reactor Pilot Program, which has outlined a target of fast-tracking the deployment of the reactors by July 4 of this year.

The context behind the new nuclear development in the U.S.

In August of 2025, the U.S. DOE formally selected ten companies as part of the Reactor Pilot Program, a new path for nuclear energy developers to leverage the accelerated DOE approval instead of the standard Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing process. Initially, the U.S. was targeting to get up to three reactors online within a year, but that target was amended by Energy Secretary Chris Wright at the 2025 ANS Winter Conference & Expo.

Other notable selections by the Department as part of the Reactor Pilot Program include:

Aalo Atomics

Deep Fission

Last Energy

Natura Resources

Standard Nuclear

Oklo and Terrestrial Energy will boost the U.S. nuclear energy output capacity

Oklo is as unique as it gets within the framework of the Reactor Pilot Program, as it has three distinct nuclear energy projects in the United States, namely the Aurora Powerhouse development, the Pluto reactor, and a third reactor being developed by the company’s subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy.

“This OTA establishes a framework for execution and risk reduction. By building and operating a pilot reactor, we generate the data and experience to streamline future commercial deployments, improve regulatory efficiency, and deliver long-term value.” – Oklo co-founder and CEO Jacob DeWitte

Terrestrial Energy, on the other hand, follows a more conventional OTA process. The company’s Project Tetra has been slowly developing over the past few months and has now been added to the Reactor Pilot Program by the U.S. authority.

“The agreement sits on our development center-path, allowing the company to expedite key elements of its program to prepare licensing applications for commercial plant operation,” – Simon Irish, Terrestrial Energy’s CEO

The remarkable growth that is expected across the U.S. nuclear sector has positioned the U.S. as a major nuclear energy developer, alongside its arch nemesis, China, which has been developing several new nuclear energy projects over the past few years.

How effectively institutions respond to the US energy supply risk will influence future policy direction and investment priorities.","Washington, January, 2026 — Brussels Morning Newspaper notes that the US energy supply risk has become a defining national concern as a prolonged winter weather system grips large parts of the United States. From the Plains to the Northeast, freezing temperatures, ice, and snow are testing oil fields, natural gas infrastructure, and electricity grids at a time of elevated seasonal demand. Federal agencies, state regulators, and private operators are coordinating closely as households and businesses brace for potential disruptions.

The convergence of cold weather and high consumption has placed energy resilience at the center of policy and market attention, highlighting vulnerabilities that extend beyond regional boundaries.

Winter Conditions Reshape the Energy Landscape

Severe cold has settled across major producing and consuming regions, altering the balance between supply and demand. The US energy supply risk is amplified during winter because fuel consumption for heating rises sharply while production systems face physical stress from freezing conditions.

Meteorological forecasts suggest temperature swings rather than a quick thaw, increasing uncertainty for energy planners tasked with maintaining steady flows under unpredictable conditions.

Oil Production Under Seasonal Strain

Crude oil operations have slowed in several producing basins as companies take precautionary measures to protect equipment. The US energy supply risk in the oil sector stems from surface infrastructure exposure, including wellheads, pipelines, and storage facilities that are sensitive to extreme cold.

Industry analysts note that even temporary shutdowns can remove significant volumes from daily output, tightening supply and influencing price expectations.

Natural Gas Output Meets Rising Heating Demand

Natural gas systems face a more complex challenge, as cold weather simultaneously restricts production and accelerates consumption. The US energy supply risk becomes more pronounced when processing plants and gathering lines freeze while residential and commercial heating demand surges.

Storage withdrawals have increased, drawing attention to inventory levels that will be critical if cold conditions persist deeper into the season.

Electricity Grids and Fuel Dependence

Electricity reliability is closely linked to fuel availability, particularly in regions reliant on gas-fired generation. The US energy supply risk extends into the power sector as generators balance peak demand against constrained gas flows.

Grid operators have issued conservation advisories in some states, emphasizing the importance of managing load during peak hours to reduce the likelihood of outages.

Regional Variations in Impact

Not all regions experience winter stress equally. The US energy supply risk differs by geography, with colder northern states accustomed to winter conditions while southern regions face greater challenges adapting infrastructure to rare freezes.

These regional differences complicate national coordination, requiring tailored responses rather than uniform solutions.

Energy Markets Respond to Uncertainty

Financial markets have reacted to weather-driven uncertainty with cautious price movements. Traders factor the US energy supply risk into short-term contracts, particularly for natural gas and electricity tied to winter delivery periods.

Market analysts emphasize that sentiment remains closely linked to weather forecasts and the pace of infrastructure recovery.

Federal Oversight and Coordination

Federal agencies have increased monitoring of energy systems, holding regular briefings with state authorities and industry leaders. Addressing the US energy supply risk involves ensuring transparent communication, rapid information sharing, and readiness to deploy emergency measures if needed.

Strategic reserves and regulatory flexibility are among the tools discussed to mitigate potential shortages.

Industry Preparedness and Winterization

Energy companies have invested in winterization following past cold-weather crises. Despite these improvements, the US energy supply risk persists due to the scale and duration of the current cold pattern.

Operators stress that resilience is cumulative, built through incremental upgrades rather than a single solution.

Consumer and Business Implications

For consumers, winter supply stress often translates into higher heating costs and calls for conservation. Businesses, particularly in manufacturing and logistics, monitor the US energy supply risk closely as it affects operating expenses and scheduling.

Utilities have expanded assistance programs aimed at protecting vulnerable households during prolonged cold spells.

Lessons From Earlier Winter Disruptions

Previous winter events exposed weaknesses in infrastructure and coordination. The US energy supply risk observed today reflects both progress made since those events and ongoing gaps that require attention.

Experts argue that learning from past disruptions remains essential as climate variability increases.

Climate Variability and Long-Term Planning

Shifting climate patterns have introduced greater extremes into seasonal weather, complicating energy planning. Managing long-term US energy supply risk increasingly involves preparing for both severe cold and unexpected heat, stretching systems designed for historical norms.

This dual challenge underscores the need for flexible infrastructure capable of adapting to a wider range of conditions.

Infrastructure Investment and Policy Debate

The current winter has reignited debate over infrastructure spending and regulatory standards. Reducing US energy supply risk is now framed by some policymakers as a matter of national resilience rather than market efficiency alone.

Proposals include enhanced weatherization requirements, expanded storage capacity, and grid modernization initiatives.

Technology and Innovation as Mitigation Tools

Advances in monitoring, automation, and forecasting offer tools to manage winter stress. While technology cannot eliminate the US energy supply risk, it can improve response times and situational awareness for operators navigating rapidly changing conditions.

Investment in smart grids and advanced analytics continues to gain momentum.

Expert Perspective

One senior energy strategist observed,

“Winter stress tests every layer of the system at once, revealing whether resilience plans exist only on paper or function under real pressure.”

The remark captures the broader challenge facing those tasked with safeguarding energy reliability.

Outlook for the Remainder of Winter

Forecast models indicate alternating cold and mild periods through late winter. The US energy supply risk will depend on how quickly production rebounds during warmer intervals and whether demand moderates accordingly.

Officials emphasize preparedness rather than prediction, noting that rapid shifts require constant vigilance.

International Context and Comparisons

Other major economies face similar winter challenges, offering comparative lessons. Observers note that approaches to mitigating US energy supply risk can benefit from global best practices in storage, diversification, and emergency response.

International coordination remains limited but informative as climate pressures intensify worldwide.

Economic Ripple Effects

Energy reliability influences inflation, consumer confidence, and industrial output. Persistent US energy supply risk can amplify economic uncertainty, particularly if disruptions coincide with other global market pressures.

Economists stress that stability in energy systems underpins broader economic resilience.

Public Communication and Trust

Clear communication plays a vital role during periods of stress. Authorities managing the US energy supply risk aim to balance transparency with reassurance, providing timely updates without causing unnecessary alarm.

Public trust is shaped not only by outcomes but by the clarity of messaging during crises.

A Test of Systemic Resilience

The winter of 2026 serves as a real-time test of reforms implemented after earlier disruptions. How effectively institutions respond to the US energy supply risk will influence future policy direction and investment priorities.

Resilience is increasingly measured by adaptability rather than absolute prevention.

A legal dispute over the halted construction of a proposed electric vehicle battery plant near Big Rapids is intensifying, with the company behind the project now seeking damages against a small mid-Michigan township.

Gotion, a Chinese tech company that had planned to build a $2.4 billion EV battery manufacturing facility in Green Charter Township, filed new court arguments this week asking for fiscal damages. The move comes after state economic development officials previously clawed back subsidies and as the project remains stalled amid a years-long legal fight.

According to the new filing, Gotion argues that the township’s actions amounted to a contract breach that has ultimately made the project impossible to complete.

Gotion Claims Township Breach Made Project “No Longer Viable

The legal battle centers on a lawsuit between Green Charter Township and Gotion over access to the local water supply — a necessity for battery manufacturing. The township revoked Gotion’s access, which led to construction being paused and the case working its way through court.

In its latest filing, Gotion said the township’s opposition has rendered the plant “no longer viable.” The documents were submitted after a judge asked whether the legal fight still matters if the facility will likely never be built.

Green Charter Township’s legal team has taken the opposite position, arguing the case should be dismissed because the company’s development intentions have shifted.

In a separate filing, township attorneys argued “Gotion no longer intends to develop the plant and soon will not own the Gotion property. This court can afford no real relief.”

Opposition Has Been Years in the Making

The proposed facility became one of Michigan’s most divisive economic development projects in recent years, drawing sustained protests from residents and political opposition from Republican lawmakers.

Local critics raised concerns about the company’s public ties to the Chinese Communist Party and questioned what the project could mean for regional safety and governance.

U.S. Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Caledonia, has been among the project’s most vocal opponents and criticized Gotion’s legal action.

“The people of Mecosta County, and the State of Michigan have thoroughly rejected it, but it is still trying to hold the town hostage,"" Moolenaar said. ""The CCP-affiliated company will stop at nothing to build a plant that no one wants.""

A recurring concern among some opponents was the plant’s location roughly 100 miles south of Camp Grayling, the nation’s largest National Guard training base. Republicans warned the site could become a hub for surveillance and intelligence-gathering tied to military activity — claims that fueled even more backlash in the region.

Local Leaders Warn Legal Fees Are Draining Township Resources

As the fight has continued, Green Charter Township leaders say the case is draining resources and adding financial pressure to a small community.

Township Supervisor Jason Kruse told WCMU the mounting legal fees have become one of the most difficult consequences of the dispute.

“It's just terrible to watch the amount of money that's chewed up,"" Kruse told WCMU. ""That could have just gone to other township projects.""

Last year, Mecosta County provided $193,987 from marijuana tax revenue to help the township cover legal expenses — funding officials say was needed to keep up with escalating costs.

State Pursues Millions in Recovered Incentives

The Michigan Economic Development Corporation has also stepped back from the project financially. Officials are seeking $23 million back after determining the company failed to meet progress benchmarks required to maintain state support.

The project had originally been approved for up to $270 million in state subsidies, but state officials later moved to reclaim a portion of those funds, adding another layer of financial uncertainty as the development stalled.

Gotion’s legal team has not yet responded publicly to requests for comment.

What Happens Next

With the project’s future increasingly unclear, the court dispute may determine whether either side is responsible for damages and whether the case can continue if the plant does not move forward.

For Green Charter Township, leaders say the priority is limiting financial exposure and moving ahead after years of uncertainty. For Gotion, the latest filing signals the company may pursue compensation for a development it now says can no longer proceed.",,N,,2026-01-24 15:59:25.582482

Electric cooperatives in Texas and nearby states were working to restore thousands of power outages Saturday as a massive winter storm began an onslaught of heavy snow, ice and frigid temperatures across more than 2,000 miles from New Mexico to New England this weekend and beyond.

Co-ops in the projected path of Winter Storm Fern have been gearing up for the brutal weather, and mutual aid crews from co-ops in states outside the storm’s main path were already beginning to arrive Saturday.

“Electric cooperatives are well-versed in safely responding to Mother Nature’s worst and have been preparing for this winter storm for days,” said NRECA CEO Jim Matheson.

“Electric co-ops have been coordinating ahead of the storm to ensure we can respond to potential power outages as quickly and safely as possible, drawing on crews from unaffected areas if needed. We urge consumers to take the storm seriously and prepare for the possibility of extended power outages.”

Co-ops said they are worried most about ice coating power lines and toppling tree limbs onto lines.

“Ice accumulation continues to be the main concern, as ice forming on tree limbs and power lines can cause catastrophic damage to the distribution system,” Georgia Electric Membership Corp. said as the storm headed its way.

Texas had the most outages in the nation as of midday Saturday, with about 50,000 reported across all types of electric utilities, according to poweroutage.us.

Ice accumulation on the lines caused outages to more than 7,300 meters at Deep East Texas Electric Cooperative Saturday. The San Augustine-based co-op serves about 45,000 meters.

“Crews are working and will continue to work as quickly as they safely can,” the co-op said on Facebook.

Bowie-Cass Electric Cooperative in Douglassville reported outages at more than 6,000 of its nearly 40,000 meters as of midday.

“There are several reports of fallen trees/limbs across the territory, along with other damage,” the co-op said on its website. “Roads and other surfaces are icy and hazardous, which may impact travel times and outage location access.

“Our crews are working as quickly and safely as possible to restore power to all affected members, but please keep in mind that it will take time due to weather conditions. Freezing rain is expected to continue throughout the day with temperatures below zero and bitter cold wind.”

Rusk County Electric Cooperative in Henderson reported that more than 6,500 of its nearly 24,000 consumer-members were without power.

“Trees are heavy, lines are stressed, and crews are moving as safely and quickly as possible to restore power,” the co-op said Saturday afternoon on Facebook.

Panola-Harrison Electric Cooperative in Marshall reported that about 2,100 of its nearly 21,000 members were without power as of early afternoon. The co-op serves both Texas and Louisiana.

“As a reminder, due to hazardous road conditions and working conditions, it will take crews longer than usual to make repairs,” the co-op said on its website.

In New Mexico, Cloudcroft-based Otero County Electric Cooperative reported about 6,000 of its 21,000 members without power as of about 12:30 p.m.

Co-ops throughout the storm’s projected path were gearing up for extended power outages.

“Based on weather predictions, Rappahannock Electric Cooperative is preparing for a multi-day outage event,” said Casey Hollins, the Fredericksburg, Virgina-based co-op’s managing director for communications and public relations. “Wet snow and ice add weight to power lines, causing them to break, and weigh down trees and limbs, which can lead to power outages.”

Florida-based SECO Energy was among the co-ops rushing to send mutual aid crews to help co-ops in neighboring states.

The Sumterville-based co-op sent a nine-member crew to South Carolina on Saturday to help with power restoration efforts in northern South Carolina and Georgia.

“Mutual aid is a cornerstone of the electric cooperative network,” said Kathy Judkins, the co-op’s vice president of communications, community and member experiences. “We are proud to support our fellow cooperatives and the communities they serve during severe weather events.”",https://www.electric.coop/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/fern-home.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 15:59:48.129970

“Pressure Geothermal is designed to be commercial, scalable, and deployable almost anywhere,” said Cindy Taff, CEO of Sage Geosystems.
Tech giants need “firm power,” energy that runs 24/7 without weather interruptions.","Geothermal energy usually requires finding specific spots with natural hot water bubbling underground. It’s a great power source, but you can’t put it just anywhere. Sage Geosystems wants to find a solution to that limitation. The company just closed a $97 million Series B funding round to build its first commercial facility.

Ormat Technologies and Carbon Direct Capital co-led the round. The goal is to take Sage’s “Pressure Geothermal” technology out of the lab and into the real world.

Engineering an Underground Reservoir

Here is the main difference with Sage’s approach. Instead of hunting for rare natural hydrothermal systems, they tap into hot, dry rock. This rock is found almost everywhere if you dig deep enough.

The technology creates an engineered underground reservoir. It uses the Earth’s natural heat and pressure to make hot water expand and contract, which generates power. According to Sage, this method unlocks significantly more potential than traditional geothermal, over 130 times more in the U.S. alone.

They are moving fast to prove it works. Sage will deploy its first commercial facility at an existing Ormat power plant. This partnership helps them skip the long setup times usually associated with new energy projects.

“Pressure Geothermal is designed to be commercial, scalable, and deployable almost anywhere,” said Cindy Taff, CEO of Sage Geosystems. “This Series B allows us to prove that at commercial scale, reflecting strong conviction from partners who understand both the urgency of energy demand and the criticality of firm power.”

Scaling Geothermal Energy

A big driver behind this funding is the massive energy appetite of AI data centers. Tech giants need “firm power,” energy that runs 24/7 without weather interruptions. Solar and wind can’t always promise that, but geothermal can.

Additionally, Sage announced a partnership with Meta back in August 2024 to deliver up to 150 MW of power for their data centers. Investors see this as a key solution for the tech industry’s growing power bill.

“Enhanced Geothermal Systems (“EGS”) are extremely well-positioned to deliver for hyperscalers, who want clean firm power for their AI computing needs,” said Jonathan Goldberg, CEO at Carbon Direct Capital. “Sage’s pressurized EGS technology is advantaged on both economic and environmental evaluation criteria.”

Doron Blachar, CEO of Ormat Technologies, called the investment a “natural next step in a partnership we believe strongly in.”",https://www.tomorrowsworldtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sage-Geosystems.png,N,,2026-01-24 20:00:07.351180

But the immediate needs can and should be met with natural gas.
She must secure New York’s energy future by embracing natural gas and other reliable energy sources.
The path to success for the Dunkirk NRG plant has already been mapped out, including land easements that were secured for the gas lines to come from existing natural gas wells nearby.
That can only occur by using affordable, abundant natural gas to re-power the Dunkirk NRG plant.","In early 2013, New York’s then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo showed up in Dunkirk on a wintry day to announce with great fanfare that the NRG power plant in Dunkirk would be converted from a clean-coal facility to natural gas-fueled power production. I was a Chautauqua County Legislator at the time and I was there that day to experience the community’s collective sigh of relief that the county’s largest property-taxpaying entity would continue to operate.

However, everything changed as the governor pivoted and decided he would bow to political pressure from the advocates on the far left that ultimately led to this critical power plant closing down by 2016. The Dunkirk NRG plant was one of many casualties of Cuomo’s war on low-cost, reliable power in New York State.

Instead of investing in cleaner, reliable energy production using natural gas, hydropower and nuclear, Cuomo chose to shutter power plants in favor of importing power from outside New York, largely from coal-fired power plants. This was the start of a virtue-signaling emissions shell game that continues today; claiming that New York is “clean and green” while actually increasing overall emissions outside our state to meet our power needs. This reckless, costly agenda was designed to appease special interests at the expense of New York taxpayers and ratepayers.

In 2018, while I was county executive, a broad group of stakeholders came together, after securing a federal grant, to commission a study of re-use options for the closed power plant. After looking at everything from a public park to a resort hotel, the results were clear … the “best and highest use” for the NRG plant was for it to generate power again.

We have seen the devastating negative impact of power plant closures, including its contribution to Dunkirk’s financial woes. Our state is now importing more power than ever before. New York was once energy independent. But now, on peak demand days, our state often imports more power than it produces thanks to Albany’s incoherent and irresponsible energy policy.

Our energy situation is now so bad that the New York Independent System Operators (NYISO), which operates the state’s electric grid, is sounding the alarm that New York may face energy shortages, and even rolling blackouts, as soon as this year.

To her credit, Gov. Kathy Hochul has finally recognized that New York’s increasing energy demands cannot be met solely with wind and solar. However, the solution she is now offering is simply too little and too late to meet New York’s urgent power needs. I support the idea of developing nuclear power as a part of a diverse energy portfolio. But energy experts caution that developing a new nuclear power plant is likely a decade or more away from reality. The far more cost-effective and quicker solution to New York’s energy supply problem would be to expand the use of natural gas for electricity production. That was the right plan for the Dunkirk NRG plant back in 2013 and continues to be now. Nuclear power can be a long-term goal for a transition to a zero-emission energy future. But the immediate needs can and should be met with natural gas.

The governor needs to show leadership in this moment. She needs to push back against her far-left colleagues and radical special interests. She must secure New York’s energy future by embracing natural gas and other reliable energy sources. New Yorkers deserve relief from sky-high utility bills and a secure future with reliable, low-cost energy.

The path to success for the Dunkirk NRG plant has already been mapped out, including land easements that were secured for the gas lines to come from existing natural gas wells nearby. Most importantly, the people of Dunkirk, and all of Chautauqua County, deserve a future with a power plant that is providing energy, tax relief, and good paying jobs — as soon as possible. That can only occur by using affordable, abundant natural gas to re-power the Dunkirk NRG plant.

The Energy Department said Thursday that its Loan Programs Office — now called the Office of Energy Dominance Financing — also plans to revise an additional $53 billion of funding.

In a statement, the department said it has eliminated about $9.5 billion in financing for wind and solar projects as part of the adjustment and plans to redirect the funding toward natural gas and nuclear projects.

The Energy Department, which didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, didn’t provide specific details on which other deals were affected.

The Energy Department’s loans office swelled into a $400-billion green bank under Biden, partly due to an infusion in funds from his signature Inflation Reduction Act. The office has been used to finance Tesla Inc.’s Model S sedan and some of the first new nuclear reactors built in the U.S. in decades by Southern Co. But the program drew criticism from Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who said the department closed or offered $85 billion of financing in the final months of the Biden presidency after Donald Trump’s election.

“We found more dollars were rushed out the door of the Loan Programs Office in the final months of the Biden Administration than had been disbursed in over 15 years,” Wright said in Thursday’s statement.

While Trump once proposed killing the Energy Department program — arguing during his first term that the government had no business picking winners and losers — his administration later sought to tap the bank to pay for its own energy priorities.

Trump’s fascination with fossil fuels and dislike of renewables, for whatever reason, is costing the country, and consumers and businesses, money.","The Trump administration reportedly has canceled $30 billion in green loans from the Biden era and is revising another $53 billion, reported The Hill.

To be accurate, some of this total includes cancellations from last year, like a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for a power line that would connect wind and solar power to the grid, because generating power means nothing if it cannot reach where it’s needed.

But that is just one example. The administration’s animosity extends to every area, and the results are often unseen costs for taxpayers. The dismantling of the Energy Star program might seem unimportant — just some appliance labeling program. But it was much more than that, providing a vast data resource needed across multiple industries.

Forget for a moment that consumers wanted to know how much appliances would cost to run, to better calculate the true cost over time. Companies of all sorts need the same info, which has been available for such commercial equipment as HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning), refrigerators, freezers, ovens, boilers, large-scale data processing equipment, windows, doors, and more. The lack of information means a lack of insight into how to save money.

The data cutoff is also hurting the entire real estate industry. Anyone who claims that businesses don’t care about environmental issues know next to nothing about corporate practicalities. Developers and investors focus on the long-term costs of building and maintaining properties, as I’ve learned over years of speaking to people in all areas of commercial real estate. Energy efficiency and, yes, even carbon footprints are important to them as they consider costs and current and eventual regulatory compliance.

Green tech is important for lowering environmental impact but also for saving money and providing the energy the country needs. Here are some graphs from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Over the next couple of years, electric generation from natural gas, coal, and nuclear will decline. Growth is going to come primarily from solar and wind, slightly from hydropower. These are critical to ensuring that the U.S. has the amount of electrical generation it needs.

More specifically, according to the EIA’s short-term energy outlook report, natural gas will drop from 40% of electrical generation to 39%. Coal will drop from 17% to 15%. Hydropower will be flat at 6%. Wind will climb from 11% to 12%. Solar, from 7% to 10%.

Then there is the question of how much energy costs. This is a lot more complicated than it might seem. Some fuels are used to directly create heat or power engines like cars. Some are used to generate electricity.

The costs of power from new renewables is now cheaper than from fossil fuels, according to an article in Our World in Data. In the last 10 years, in most places in the world, this changed from fossil fuels being cheaper. “The fundamental driver of this change is that renewable energy technologies follow learning curves, which means that with each doubling of the cumulative installed capacity their price declines by the same fraction,” they wrote. The more that’s done, the cheaper it becomes. Fossil fuel-generated electricity doesn’t follow the same path.

Jan 23 (Reuters) – A federal judge on Friday ruled President Donald Trump’s administration unlawfully suspended funding awarded to support the expansion of electric vehicle charger infrastructure, in a victory for 20 Democratic-led states ‍that sued over the action.

U.S. District Judge Tana Lin in Seattle ruled in favor of 20 states as well as the District of Columbia, which had filed their lawsuit after the U.S. Department of Transportation in February suspended an EV charger infrastructure program enacted by Congress in 2021 under Democratic President Joe Biden.

Lin, a Biden appointee, said the DOT and the Federal Highway ‌Administration “yanked the NEVI Formula Program’s cord out of the outlet,” ‌without working within the statutory confines of established administrative law as required.

Environmental groups including the Sierra Club hailed the ruling, saying it ensures states can move forward with building infrastructure funded by the law.

The Transportation Department did not immediately ​respond to a request for comment.

Shortly after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy took office in February, ‍the DOT suspended the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, which was part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that Biden signed into law in 2021.

“In short, Defendants defied the will of ‌Congress by withholding funds in a manner not contemplated by the IIJA,” she wrote.

The U.S. Senate is slated next week to consider legislation that has already cleared the U.S. House of Representatives that would redirect $879 million in funds approved under Biden for the EV charging network to other infrastructure priorities.

Budget 2026 is all set to arrive with 2025’s harsh climate warnings still echoing across India. The water you drink and the air you breathe continue to hang in the balance as Nirmala Sitharaman and Co take centrestage to outline where New Delhi’s purse will be spending in the new fiscal year.

Unseasonal floods drowned farmland across the Gangetic plains, heatwaves scorched cities from Delhi to Nagpur for weeks on end, and coastal storms forced repeated evacuations in the east and west.

Crop yields fluctuated, power demand shattered records and municipal budgets were pushed to breaking point.

Climate change was no longer an abstract future risk -- it was a line item in every government file.

Live Events

It is against this backdrop that India walks toward the upcoming budget, with the world watching how the fastest-growing major economy plans to square its exploding energy appetite with its Net Zero commitments.

Over the past three years, New Delhi’s thinking has undergone a quiet transformation: climate action not just framed as an environmental duty, but became an industrial and economic strategy.

If earlier budgets laid the groundwork, 2026 is expected to be the year of full-scale execution - where policy blueprints harden into concrete infrastructure, capital deployment and national systems.

Union Budgets: ‘Industrialisation of climate action’

However, this transformation did not happen overnight. Rather, it has unfolded in stages, with each budget adding a new layer to what policymakers increasingly describe as the “industrialisation of climate action.”

The change is most visible when the last three budgets are read as a single evolving strategy rather than isolated policy documents.

In the Union Budget 2023–24, the PM Modi-led Centre placed “Green Growth” among the seven Saptarishi priorities of the ‘Amrit Kaal’ vision.

That year focused on establishing foundational missions and institutional frameworks, most notably the National Green Hydrogen Mission with an outlay of Rs 19,700 crore to steer the economy toward low-carbon intensity.

In addition to that, the Centre laid critical infrastructure groundwork through a Rs 20,700 crore inter-state transmission system to evacuate 13 GW of renewable energy from Ladakh, signalling that renewable expansion would be backed by serious grid investments rather than symbolic announcements.

What came next was the Union Budget 2024–25 that marked the shift from planning to rollout. The focus then shifted from design to deployment and energy security.

The centrepiece of this phase was the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, a nationwide rooftop solar programme backed by a massive central allocation of Rs 75,021 crore.

This budget also introduced a pivotal industrial shift with the launch of the Critical Mineral Mission, which fully exempted customs duties on 25 essential minerals needed for renewable energy tech and nuclear power.

With this move, India began addressing the raw material vulnerabilities that could otherwise constrain its clean energy ambitions.

The last Union Budget 2025–26 took the strategy into higher-stakes territory by explicitly placing nuclear power at the core of India’s energy transition.

Nirmala Sitharaman, in her eight consecutive budget speech, announced a target of developing at least 100 GW of nuclear capacity by 2047. On top of that, a dedicated Nuclear Energy Mission with a Rs 20,000 crore outlay for research and development of Small Modular Reactors was also established.

The mission aimed to operationalise at least five indigenously developed SMRs by 2033, reflecting a long-term commitment to stable, low-carbon baseload power.

Alongside this, the National Manufacturing Mission was expanded to support clean tech manufacturing, with a focus on building domestic ecosystems for solar PV cells, electric vehicle batteries, electrolyzers and wind turbines.

As such, climate policy was no longer separate from industrial policy; the two had effectively merged.

As policymakers now prepare for Budget 2026, the expectation is that this industrial footprint will widen even further.

“This budget has a real opportunity to sow the seeds of a multi-trillion dollar green economy for India. Extending PLI towards circular products, sending strong demand signals through green public procurement mandates and incentivising private sector investments in the green sectors via matching grants or tax breaks on R&D investments are some concrete measures to spur an economically and environmentally resilient future,” said Gunjan Jhunjhunwala, Programme Lead, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).

Financing the resilient frontier

Parallel to this industrial transformation, climate finance and resilience planning have also undergone a fundamental shift.

What began as conservation-focused spending has evolved into a sophisticated blend of public funding, private capital mobilisation and multilateral financing.

In the 2023–24 Budget, resilience policy was anchored primarily in nature-based solutions through initiatives such as MISHTI for mangrove plantations along India’s coastline and the Amrit Dharohar scheme to promote sustainable wetland use.

These programmes were crucial for ecological protection but remained largely within the traditional conservation framework.

By the time of the 2025–26 Budget rolled around, climate resilience had been integrated into the foundations of infra development and food security planning.

For example, the National Mission on High Yielding Seeds was launched with a specific focus on developing crop varieties that combine high productivity, pest resistance and climate resilience.

This move was a direct response to the increasing volatility of India’s agricultural systems under erratic weather patterns.

It also marked a recognition that food security is now inseparable from climate adaptation.

The most significant financial innovation, however, arrived with the creation of the Rs 1 lakh crore Urban Challenge Fund, which fundamentally altered how green infrastructure is financed in India.

Instead of relying solely on government grants, the fund finances up to 25% of the cost of bankable urban projects while requiring that at least 50% of funding be mobilised through bonds, bank loans and public–private partnerships.

In effect, climate resilience was no longer seen just as government spending, but as an investment opportunity that could attract private capital.

This approach was reinforced by the launch of the Rural Prosperity and Resilience Programme, a multi-sector initiative designed to operate in partnership with state governments while seeking technical and financial assistance from multilateral development banks to address under-employment and climate-related shocks in rural India.

Bridging the Gaps: What Budget 2026 must fix

Despite the progress of recent budgets, policy observers and research institutions such as the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) have identified critical gaps that must be addressed if the strategy is to deliver long-term stability.

One major concern is the continued imbalance between mitigation and adaptation finance.

Current allocations remain heavily skewed toward emissions reduction, often overlooking the urgent need to protect vulnerable communities from floods, heatwaves and other climate-induced disasters.

ORF argued that Budget 2026 must revive a dedicated National Adaptation Fund with clear and transparent allocations and apply a strict climate-risk lens to the Urban Challenge Fund so that new infrastructure automatically includes heat mitigation, flood management and nature-based solutions.

Beyond funding priorities, there are also persistent implementation challenges.

Calling for a decisive shift in India’s economic thinking, Rusen Kumar, Managing Editor of India CSR Network, said the Union Budget 2026 must place climate action at the heart of national economic planning.

“India’s climate fight will succeed only when green transition also becomes an employment mission. Budget 2026 should focus on green jobs, renewable energy expansion, and sustainable agriculture while ensuring vulnerable communities are not left behind during the transition,” said Kumar.

“The real shift will be measured by how much funding moves from intention to implementation,” he reinforced.

Energy transition planning also needs sharper alignment. While funding for renewable energy and electric mobility has increased, the absence of clear sectoral targets and regulatory roadmaps remains a bottleneck.

Budget 2026 must accelerate grid modernisation and expand hybrid renewable projects to support the 500 GW non-fossil target by 2030, particularly in light of recent cuts to wind and hydropower investments.

“While solar and hydrogen saw increased allocations, the cut in wind energy funding and stagnant hydropower investments indicate an imbalanced path to energy transition. Strategic focus on grid modernisation, hybrid renewable projects, and domestic manufacturing incentives is essential to meet the 500 GW non-fossil target by 2030,” read the ORF report.

At the same time, stagnating afforestation budgets and earlier reductions in coastal mission funding need correction if India’s natural defences against climate shocks are to remain viable, noted the New Delhi-based thinktank.

Meanwhile, according to CEEW, water and urban resilience are now expected to take centre stage in Budget 2026. According to Nitin Bassi, Fellow CEEW, the upcoming budget is likely to feature three major water-related announcements.

“First, continued financial support is expected for drinking water and sanitation in rural areas, which received around Rs 74,000 crore in the previous budget, with a stronger focus this time on water source sustainability and service delivery in peri-urban regions,” Bassi said.

“Second, there is likely to be a significant allocation for the management of used water, including sewage treatment, grey water management, rejuvenation of water bodies, and reuse for non-potable purposes. As per CEEW’s analysis, achieving 100 per cent treatment coverage by 2047 represents an investment opportunity of Rs 1.6–2.3 lakh crore,” he added.

“Third, urban flood management is expected to receive enhanced financial commitment. Rainfall intensity is increasingly breaching local drainage design thresholds of 12–20 mm per hour, and more cities may be brought under a national adaptation framework to address rising flood risks.”

Moreover, sustainable mobility policy must also move beyond component-level tax incentives for electric vehicles to include large-scale investments in public transport, cycling networks and pedestrian infrastructure.

Finally, green finance needs clearer rules including a formal climate finance taxonomy and stronger carbon markets to attract the large private investments required for the transition.

To wrap up, India stands at a critical inflection point. The policy direction is clear, the building blocks are largely in place, and climate action has firmly entered the economic mainstream. What now matters is follow-through and whether ambitious targets are matched with steady funding, clear roadmaps, and on-ground delivery.

NMED News:

SANTA FE — The New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board has unanimously adopted regulations establishing the Clean Transportation Fuel Program, setting April 1 as the opening date for the Southwest’s first clean fuel market.

Signed into law by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in 2024, the Clean Transportation Fuel Program is a market-based initiative that incentivizes and expands access to lower-carbon transportation fuels, including ethanol, biofuels, renewable diesel, renewable natural gas, electricity, and supporting infrastructure.

The program will boost economic development across the state, create more than 800 jobs, and reduce health care costs by improving air quality. Overall, the program is expected to deliver $1.65 billion in net benefits to New Mexicans through avoided air quality health impacts and climate change infrastructure damages. Cumulatively through 2040, the program will prevent 337 asthma cases, 60 work-loss days, 59 school-loss days, and 353 restricted activity days for children.

“Affordability is a must-have with any new state policy, including our Clean Transportation Fuel Program,” Lujan Grisham said. “This practical yet powerful program will spur job growth and investments while decreasing health care costs for New Mexicans – to the tune of up to $20.8 million annually once fully implemented.”

“New Mexico is racing towards affordable, clean energy solutions in the transportation sector,” Environment Secretary James Kenney said. “Our state is officially open for clean fuel business investments – from cleaner renewable diesel and hydrogen for long-haul trucking to more charging infrastructure to accommodate our increasing battery-electric passenger vehicles.”

Transportation is the second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in New Mexico, accounting for approximately a quarter of statewide emissions. It contributes significantly to particulate matter (PM2.5), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which worsen asthma and other respiratory illnesses and disproportionately impact overburdened communities.

By 2030, the Clean Transportation Fuel Program is projected to reduce PM2.5 by 144 tons, VOCs by 200 tons, and NOx emissions by 169 tons. The program will move New Mexico closer to meeting the state’s goal of cutting climate pollution 45% by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

Our teams are closely monitoring conditions and are prepared to respond as soon as it is safe to do so.

Real-time updates, outage information, and preparedness resources are available at: https://www.entergy.com/stormcenter

Restoration efforts

If outages occur, crews will begin restoring power as quickly and safely as possible. Restoration may include closing circuit breakers and rerouting power when available and deploying damage assessment teams to identify and prioritize repairs.

Following winter storms, it can take additional time to fully understand the extent of damage and provide more specific restoration timeframes. Ice, snow, weighed-down vegetation and extreme cold make restoration work especially dangerous, and icy roads may limit access to some communities. When possible, we restore power while damage assessments are still underway.

If you don’t see crews working nearby, they may be repairing another part of the electric system that must be fixed before power can be restored to your area.

Additional resources

As of 7 a.m., roughly 2,900 restoration workers are in place or mobilizing across our service area ahead of the storm.

Crews are also coming from more than a dozen states — including Maine, Florida, Illinois, Tennessee, Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Colorado, Alabama, Connecticut, West Virginia and New York — as well as Canada.

Safety is a core value

The most dangerous time during a storm is often after it has passed. Please keep yourself and your family safe:

Stay away from downed power lines — assume they are energized

Avoid areas with storm debris, where power lines may not be visible

Use extreme caution in icy and snowy conditions

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are pervasive in Maine soils, surface water, and groundwater. Over the past several years a significant body of data has developed to characterize the hazard posed by these contaminants and understand why and how they move between sources, various media, and receptors. Our understanding of PFAS transport mechanisms is still nascent, but an interconnected system is now recognized in which PFAS persist throughout the water cycle as they are 1) transported from sources like waste processing systems, agricultural biosolid applications, or aqueous film-forming foam applications to surface waters, groundwater, and wells; 2) possibly transformed by hydrolysis, oxidation, or microbial action; and then 3) continuously recycled via irrigation from contaminated wells, gray water, septic leachate, or runoff from other waste streams. This session will focus on our current scientific understanding of transport mechanisms of PFAS, their accumulation and longevity in different parts of the water cycle, and what it means for users and downstream consumers of the water.

MORNING SESSION

8:30AM – 8:50AM

An analysis of PFAS in soil and groundwater at septage land application sites in Maine

Madeline Bruno, Louise Roy

Maine Department of Environmental Protection

As part of Maine’s LD 1600 investigation, the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (MEDEP) has investigated, or overseen the investigation of, all sites where septage was licensed to be spread. This presentation provides background on this statewide dataset and examines how PFAS associated with septage land application processes are distributed between soils and groundwater, and how those distributions manifest in on-site and off-site receptors.

The analysis is high-level, and includes descriptive evaluations of PFAS compositional fingerprints we observed in soils within spreading areas and in groundwater, both on-site and downgradient of licensed application areas. We focus on identifying if any clear/repeatable patterns exist to better inform our understanding of PFAS transport, persistence, and attenuation across interconnected media, rather than pursuing full source apportionment. Fingerprints are summarized by compound class (PFCAs, PFSAs, and precursors such as fluorotelomer sulfonates and fluorosulfonamides), chain length, and selected ratios that provide insight into mobility and subsurface longevity.

In order to place the chemical patterns into the transport framework, compositional summaries are paired with spatial analyses (e.g. detection frequency and rates with distance from site boundaries, generalized downgradient alignment, and contrasts between overburden and bedrock aquifers where data allow).

Using statewide soil and groundwater data, this work explores how historical septage land application contributes to PFAS transport in Maine and what that may mean for long-term exposure. This first-pass analysis is designed to be accessible to policymakers and the public but useful for a technical or academic audience.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are prevalent in biosolids, which had historically been amended to soils as fertilizer on agricultural lands in Maine and other U.S. states. Our understanding of PFAS fate and transport in agroecosystems is nascent, though the consequences for human health of PFAS movement into ground and surface waters are potentially severe. PFAS transport behavior in soil is related to numerous factors, including PFAS composition, soil chemistry, and subsurface hydrogeologic properties. To better understand and characterize PFAS transport behavior, we derived key PFAS transport parameters, including partitioning coefficients, from analytical chemistry and soil data collected by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (MEDEP) between 2022 and 2024. We integrated these parameters into recently published 1-dimensional unsaturated zone transport models to assess parameter sensitivities and the utility of different modeling frameworks. MEDEP soil data were used to initialize these models and results were compared with collocated MEDEP groundwater analytical chemistry data.

In this talk we evaluate the ability of these models to effectively and consistently relate concentrations of PFAS in soils to concentrations in groundwater and assess the relative value of input parameters. This information has the potential to help agencies and consultants in planning cost-efficient field campaigns; to help regulators make decisions about risk; to help residents and municipalities make decisions about treatment for water-supply wells located near source areas; and to help farmers make decisions about where to grow crops, graze animals, and obtain water.

PFAS transport from irrigation water to crops

Randy Martin

Central Aroostook Soil and Water Conservation District

Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) persist throughout interconnected components of the water cycle, creating emerging risks for agricultural production, drinking water and food safety. In Maine, legacy aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) applications have contaminated surface and groundwater resources that are increasingly used for agricultural irrigation. This study evaluates how irrigation with PFAS-impacted water contributes to soil accumulation, crop uptake, and potential human exposure in the Lower Aroostook River Watershed.

The Central Aroostook Soil and Water Conservation District, in partnership with the University of Virginia, the Mi’Kmaq Nation, Upland Grassroots, and The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, received U.S. Environmental Protection Agency funding to examine PFAS fate and transport in irrigated cropping systems. Irrigation was collected from tributaries affected by leachate from the form Loring Air Force Base in Limestone, Maine, where over four decades of AFFF training activities occurred. Recent investigations have documented groundwater PFAS concentrations exceeding 17,000 ng/L in portions of the former base.

Over two growing seasons, potatoes, and selected vegetable crops including broccoli, yellow beans and kale, were irrigated with contaminated surface water representative of watershed conditions. Results demonstrate that repeated irrigation leads to measurable PFAS accumulation in the soils and translocation into plant tissues. Uptake varied by crop species and was strongly influenced by soil chemistry, including organic matter content, texture, pH, and cation exchange capacity. Crop PFAS concentrations differed substantially from those observed in biosolid-contaminated systems elsewhere in Maine, indicating that contaminant source, exposure pathway, and soil-PFAS interactions are critical determinants of risk.

These findings identify irrigation as a continuous PFAS recycling pathway and support the need for water screening, soil specific risk assessment, and crop-sensitive guidance to inform agricultural policy and consumer protection.

9:30AM – 9:50AM

Management strategies to reduce PFOS uptake by forages

Ellen Mallory, Sonora Ortiz, and Daniel Wasonga

University of Maine Cooperative Extension

Plant uptake from contaminated soils is a major pathway by which per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) enter our food system and an emerging agricultural crisis. In Maine and elsewhere, forage producers (dairy, beef, and hay) are among the most impacted farmers. We initiated a replicated field trial in 2023 on a PFAS-impacted farm to investigate the effects of various forage management practices on perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) uptake by perennial and annual forage plants. Experimental treatments included crop species, harvest timing, harvested product, cutting height, and seasonality. Co-located plant and soil samples were analyzed for PFOS and PFOS transfer factors (TF) were determined (plant concentration divided by the soil concentration). Forage quality characteristics, leafiness, and evapotranspiration were evaluated as possible explanatory variables. First year results indicate seasonality has a strong effect on PFOS levels of perennial species, where PFOS TFs of aftermath growth harvested in August were 35-109% higher than TFs of the original spring growth harvested in May/June. Harvested product also had a substantial effect. In all cases tested (winter triticale, spring oat, field pea, and corn), PFOS TFs in grain was zero or close to zero versus TFs from 0.025 to 0.225 for the whole plant forages of these species. For corn, harvesting snaplage (cob, grain, and husk) is another promising strategy with a TF of 0.01 compared with 0.06 for whole plant silage. Second year results will be incorporated and presented, and together they offer farmers and decision-makers actionable information to guide recommendations and management options for PFAS-impacted farms.

This research investigates whether the incorporation of biochar and/or high carbon ash in PFAS -contaminated agricultural fields will reduce PFAS uptake by grasses and improve overall soil health. Published research indicates that biochar has the ability to bind to PFAS compounds, and potentially reduce bioavailability of PFAS compounds. In this research, biochar and high carbon ash were applied to field plots at two application rates. Plots were seeded with grass and crop uptake of PFAS was monitored. Parallel greenhouse trials were conducted with soil from the field that the field trials were conducted in, similar application rates of high carbon ash, and the same grass seed mix.

Results from the greenhouse trials show statistically significant differences between the uptake of PFAS compounds in pots that were amended with high carbon ash as compared to control pots. In contrast, data from two growing seasons in the field trials show variable results in crop uptake of PFAS compounds in plots that were amended with biochar or high carbon ash as compared to control plots. These results indicate that high carbon ash can be effective at immobilizing PFAS compounds in soil, but may not be immediately effective at doing so in the field, highlighting a need for more research and long-term monitoring of the plots. Northern Tilth is currently considering ways to research why high carbon ash was effective at reducing crop uptake in the greenhouse trials but not reliably so in the field trials.

1:30PM – 1:50PM

Transport of PFAS in rural school communities: Three case studies in Maine

Richard Hilliard, Jane E. Disney

MDI Biological Laboratory

We investigated the possibility that rural schools in Maine, with documented per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) contamination in their drinking water, may be sources of contamination of nearby neighborhoods and surrounding environments. We focused on communities around three schools in Hancock County, Maine (each with previously documented PFAS contamination of drinking water): Mount Desert Island High School (MDIHS), Tremont Consolidated School (TCS), and Deer Isle–Stonington High School (DISHS). Across these three study areas, we collected drinking water samples from residences as well as additional samples from surrounding wetlands and downstream sites for PFAS analysis. Based on statistical analysis of PFAS profiles, we determined that groundwater and surface water from rural school campuses are a significant source of PFAS in nearby private wells and environments.

Several factors may influence the extent of PFAS contamination of drinking water, groundwater, and surface water near schools, including the types of PFAS-containing products used at the school, the type of wastewater treatment employed by the school, hydrological conditions, and the local bedrock composition. Subsurface transport of PFAS in bedrock aquifers will by faster than in typical porous media aquifers where PFAS may adsorb to organic matter or accumulate at air-water interfaces. Groundwater transport of PFAS, with lower attenuation than in porous media aquifers, represents a possible threat to public health for residents dependent on private wells which may presently test as non-detect but in subsequent years may see PFAS levels above drinking water standards. Surface water PFAS concentrations may also impact private wells and must be considered in long-term management of drinking water quality.

Evaluating for the variability of PFAS from eleven low PFAS level residential drinking water supply wells over ten months

Christopher Evans, A. Newcomb, R. Williams. J. Royer, M. Young, L. Roy

The primary objective of the study was to quantify how representative a single point-in-time sample is when PFOA or PFOS concentrations fall between 3.5 and 10 ppt, or when the Hazard Index exceeds 1 while PFOA and PFOS remain below 2 ppt, or when test results are close to the Maine Interim Drinking Water Standard for PFAS, currently 20 ng/L for the sum of six PFAS (PFHpA, PFHxS, PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFDA) or SUM6. The study was composed of sampling at 11 locations for 10 months to assess variability by using consistent sampling personnel and methods. A secondary objective was to determine whether the new EPA Method 1633 would produce data comparable to results obtained using the methodology DEP currently utilizes for evaluating PFAS in drinking water which is a Modified EPA Method 537 with Isotope Dilution (537MOD). To further evaluate geochemical variation between the study sites, the samples were analyzed for general water chemistry during two rounds, using a standard DEP analyte list in August and December. This parameter list is commonly used by MEDEP to assess ground and surface water chemistry at landfill sites. These parameters were evaluated to assess water chemistry variations between locations and potential correlation to PFAS concentrations or variability. Data were evaluated in several ways to assess the representativeness of a single residential well sample result relative to the Maine SUM6 or to the federal MCL values for PFOA and PFOS.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent, bioaccumulative contaminants of increasing concern for environmental and human health. While PFAS occurrence has been widely studied in terrestrial and freshwater systems, less is known about their transport and fate in estuarine and coastal environments. These transitional zones receive cumulative inputs from diverse sources and provide vital ecosystem services.

To address this gap, we conducted three sampling campaigns across more than 90 sites in the Casco Bay Estuary, targeting surface waters and, in one campaign, sediments. We also implemented a year-long, monthly monitoring program in an area impacted by an aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) spill. This study approach was designed to characterize spatial and temporal PFAS patterns, identify dominant sources, and assess their relative contributions to the estuary.

PFAS were detected at low background levels throughout the system, with distinct source-specific patterns near river mouths and the AFFF spill site. Compositional signatures and concentrations indicated that rivers are major contributors, particularly for the legacy compounds PFOS and PFOA. The spill site exhibited elevated levels of AFFF-associated marker compounds for two to six months, with tidally driven advection and dilution dominating attenuation. Interestingly, PFAS concentrations were not systematically higher near urban centers, and wastewater treatment plant effluents were minor sources. Instead, non-point inputs, likely linked to agricultural runoff and upstream sources, dominated PFAS loading.

These findings provide new insights into PFAS dynamics in temperate coastal systems and demonstrate the importance of spatially intensive and temporally resolved monitoring for source attribution and coastal contaminant management.

Stream to supper (and field to freezer): PFAS exposure pathways through wild harvested foods

While PFAS transport and persistence are critical to characterize, exposure is shaped by human behavior in response to those physical processes: whether people are aware of contamination and advisories, how they interpret that risk, and whether they can change what they harvest and consume—especially when wild foods are a key component of food security. In partnership with the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, we fielded surveys of licensed anglers (n=3,549) and hunters (n=13,330) to assess fish and wild game in Maine, including awareness of consumption advisories related to environmental contaminants and associated behavior changes. We find that concern about environmental contaminants is common, yet awareness of and confidence in advisories is not consistent across participants. Maine hunters had higher advisory awareness, with 74% reporting that they have heard of consumption advisories related to PFAS. Of anglers who report consuming freshwater fish caught in Maine, 63% have heard that there is PFAS in Maine’s lakes or fish, but only 26% have heard of a “do not eat” or “limit consumption” advisory related to PFAS. Food security appears to shape exposure-relevant behavior: anglers who describe freshwater fishing as important for their household food security report significantly higher levels of freshwater fish consumption than those who do not. We will also evaluate whether this relationship generalizes to hunters using preliminary results from an ongoing survey effort, and explore relationships between advisory awareness and respondents who report that fish and wild game are important for their household’s food security.

The widespread occurrence and persistence of the per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), in the environment may pose significant health risks to humans. Fish consumption is a direct pathway for exposure prompting extensive monitoring. In the United States, fish consumption advisories for PFAS generally focus on perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), the most frequent and abundant PFAS compound reported in fish. However, PFAS analysis is costly, leading monitoring programs to frequently use composite samples —combining different fish of the same species. This financial saving comes at an analytical cost of lost information on individuals’ variation. It is unclear how this may influence threshold-based decisions. We used a modelling approach using aggregated data distribution from individual freshwater fish. We simulated the measurement of PFOS for individual fish compared to composites (3, 5, and 10 fish) at different levels of error structure. We assumed a composite is the mean of the components. These values were then compared to a typical do-not-eat threshold (200 ng•g wet mass-1). These results show that the probability of assigning PFOS levels above or below the threshold are shifted with a composite sample by masking individual value contributions. Because true individual contaminant loads are variable, composite sampling is a more conservative metric for contaminant thresholds. The greater the variability, the lower the detection probability for truly contaminated samples. Our study may help to inform sampling for monitoring programs aimed at managing human exposure to PFAS.

That means higher maintenance costs – and once again, working Americans footing the bill.","In 2022, Democrats rammed through what they misleadingly called the Inflation Reduction Act. The name was deceptive then, and the results are undeniable now: it didn’t reduce inflation. What it did accomplish was shovel hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars into “Green New Deal” subsidies — chief among them, electric vehicle (EV) tax credits that disproportionately benefited the wealthy.

At the time, I stood on the Senate floor and asked: why should working Americans struggling with high prices be forced to subsidize luxury car purchases for the rich? Nearly every Senate Democrat voted to keep these handouts alive. Now, more than four years later, the data proves I was right.

The National Bureau of Economic Research found that seven out of 10 EV tax credit recipients would have bought an electric car anyway. In other words, taxpayers were footing the bill for decisions affluent households were already going to make. That’s not an incentive — that’s a windfall.

AMERICANS ARE PUMPING THE BRAKES ON ELECTRIC VEHICLE ADOPTION: ‘AFFORDABILITY IS A BIG ISSUE’

And who reaped that windfall? The wealthiest Americans. A study conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research shows that before the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, the top 5% of earners claimed half of all EV tax credit benefits, while the bottom 60% of earners received less than 3%. Democrats claim they fixed this by adding income caps, but they set the ceiling at $300,000 for joint filers. Since when is $300,000 considered middle class? In what world should taxpayers be buying $80,000 SUVs for families earning three times the median household income?

The environmental case isn’t much stronger. Yes, EVs produce fewer emissions than gas-powered cars. But the Congressional Research Service highlights research showing that the credits mostly displaced sales of other efficient vehicles like hybrids. When you account for that substitution, the supposed climate benefits are overstated by nearly 40%. Simply put: these credits aren’t nearly as ‘green’ as Democrats claim.

Meanwhile, the price tag was massive. That’s why I’m pleased we repealed these wasteful tax credits in July’s reconciliation law. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that this will save taxpayers $190 billion over the next decade. Republicans are saving taxpayers from this costly policy that was never going to deliver on Democrats’ own goal of 50% EV sales by 2030.

The verdict is clear: EV tax credits are inefficient, inequitable, and irresponsible. They don’t meaningfully change consumer behavior, they don’t deliver the promised environmental gains, and they drain taxpayer dollars into the pockets of the rich. If Democrats were serious about helping working families — instead of virtue-signaling about climate change — they would back policies that deliver a real return on investment.

A good place to start would be addressing the dwindling Highway Trust Fund (HTF), which is projected to run insolvent by 2028. While drivers of gasoline-powered cars pay into the HTF through the federal gas tax, EVs currently do not contribute at all – despite their heavier batteries putting greater wear and tear on our roads and bridges. That means higher maintenance costs – and once again, working Americans footing the bill.

That’s why I introduced the Fair SHARE Act, which would require EVs to contribute to this fund. I encourage my Democratic colleagues to cosponsor it and to work with me on including an EV fee in the upcoming Surface Transportation Reauthorization Act. That would be a fairer, smarter policy – one that actually serves working families instead of subsidizing the wealthy.

“At this time, NERC is encouraged that industry has taken actions to prepare for what appears to be a very challenging winter storm system,” the organization said in a statement Jan. 22.
Depending on conditions, PJM could also set a new all-time winter peak load on Tuesday, Jan. 27.","Stay with Factor This Power Engineering for updates.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright on Jan. 22 directed grid operators to be prepared to call on unused backup generation at data centers and other large facilities as Winter Storm Fern bears down on much of the country this weekend.

The storm is testing the electric system across multiple regions, with heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain spreading across the south-central U.S. and moving east through Sunday. As of Saturday morning, more than 95,000 power outages had been reported nationwide, including roughly 36,000 in Texas and about 10,000 in Virginia.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, more than 35 GW of backup generation capacity remains idle nationwide. DOE said making those resources available, if needed, could help mitigate the risk of rotating outages during periods of extreme cold and high demand.

The draft emergency order, issued under Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act, would apply to data centers and major industrial or commercial facilities with auxiliary, standby, directly connected or battery storage resources. The order would allow grid operators to call on those resources only after demand response options are exhausted and before a Reliability Coordinator declares an Energy Emergency Alert Level 3.

The action aligns with warnings raised in the North American Electric Reliability Corporation 2025 Winter Reliability Assessment, released in November. The assessment found elevated risk across much of North America of insufficient energy supplies during extreme operating conditions.

NERC urged Reliability Coordinators, Balancing Authorities and Transmission Operators in higher-risk regions to review seasonal operating plans and communication protocols for managing potential supply shortfalls. The assessment also emphasized advancing winterization measures and securing fuel supplies to ensure generation remains available during prolonged cold weather events.

“At this time, NERC is encouraged that industry has taken actions to prepare for what appears to be a very challenging winter storm system,” the organization said in a statement Jan. 22.

In a separate update issued Jan. 23, PJM Interconnection said it has issued precautionary alerts ahead of the winter storm and an extended period of extreme cold expected to affect much of its footprint, which spans 13 states and the District of Columbia. Forecasts call for single-digit temperatures across much of the RTO between Jan. 23 and Jan. 27, with subzero conditions possible in PJM’s Western Region.

PJM peak demand could exceed 130,000 MW for as many as seven consecutive days next week, a duration PJM said it has never experienced during winter operations. Depending on conditions, PJM could also set a new all-time winter peak load on Tuesday, Jan. 27.

PJM said it is taking additional precautions with generation and transmission owners, including issuing Cold Weather Alerts and expanding them to the full region through Jan. 27. The alerts prompt coordination with generators to ensure staffing levels are sufficient, units are fully winterized, and operational limitations are accurately communicated to the grid operator, including startup times and minimum and maximum run durations.

PJM said it is preparing for the possibility that the cold weather could extend into early February and emphasized the importance of fleet performance during sustained, high-load conditions.",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-5-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 13:58:54.382734

Justin Marquez, a member of the EPA’s National Lithium-Ion Battery Task Force, noted that prior to this development, there were few safe options for disposal.
“Up till about this point, there really hasn’t been any good way of disposing of lithium-ion batteries.","A new protocol for disposing of damaged lithium-ion batteries, developed by Maui County officials in the wake of the 2023 wildfires, is now being recommended by federal regulators as a preferred standard for handling such hazardous waste.

Known as the “Maui Method,” the process involves submerging damaged batteries — specifically those from electric and hybrid vehicles — in a brine solution. This neutralizes the energy stored within the cells, allowing them to be processed as nonhazardous waste.

Maui Emergency Management Agency Administrator Amos Lonokailua-Hewett said the initiative demonstrates the power of local innovation .

“The ‘Maui Method’ shows what is possible when innovation, collaboration and expertise come together,” Lonokailua-Hewett said. “Considered one of the first full-scale, nondisaster initiatives of its kind, this operation sets a national and even global precedent for safe and effective EV battery management while protecting our community and environment.”

The technique was successfully deployed late last year during a Wildfire Risk Reduction project in Ukumehame. Over a five-week period in November and December 2025, crews stabilized, decommissioned and destroyed 13 tons of batteries using the method.

The US Environmental Protection Agency has identified the “Maui Method” as the preferred approach for lithium-ion battery disposal.

Justin Marquez, a member of the EPA’s National Lithium-Ion Battery Task Force, noted that prior to this development, there were few safe options for disposal.

“Up till about this point, there really hasn’t been any good way of disposing of lithium-ion batteries. A lot of them are going into people’s trash cans and ending up in landfills and causing tons of fires, burning up garbage trucks all over the place and causing millions of dollars of damage for local entities,” Marquez said. “Our ultimate goal is for this ‘Maui Method,’ or some version of it that accomplishes the same goals, to be rolled out across the entire nation and even potentially globally.”

The urgency to develop such a method arose following the Aug. 8, 2023, Lahaina fire. The disaster left thousands of damaged electric vehicle batteries scattered or buried. With no battery disposal facility on the island and shipping companies refusing to transport the damaged units due to safety risks, local officials were forced to find an on-island solution.

Lithium-ion batteries pose significant risks when damaged, including the potential for thermal runaway, a phenomenon where the battery self-heats and can lead to fire or explosion. These fires are difficult to extinguish with water or foam and emit toxic gases.

The “Maui Method” uses the conductivity of saltwater to slowly and safely pull remaining energy out of the battery, effectively destroying its structure and eliminating safety hazards before transport.

The recent operation at Ukumehame was conducted under the direct oversight of the Hawaiʻi Department of Health with technical guidance from the EPA.

What does this mean for the future of environmental reporting in Western Pennsylvania?

The Allegheny Front’s Reid Frazier spoke with two recently retired Post-Gazette reporters who covered the environment for the paper: Don Hopey and David Templeton.

Templeton and Hopey worked on a large investigation called Mapping Mortality, which found higher numbers of death for certain diseases in Southwest Pennsylvania than national rates would predict. They also wrote about a large number of rare cancers in Southwest Pennsylvania, which led to a state investigation into fracking’s public health impact.

Templeton retired in 2020. Hopey retired in 2022.

REID FRAZIER: I want to go to each of you and ask your reaction to the paper ceasing publication. Dave, we’ll start with you.

DAVID TEMPLETON: I wasn’t surprised. I was kind of expecting that upon my retirement in 2020. [There were] some rumors that they might shut down at that point, but they did persist. I retired just at the point where things started to get really bad with the contract. So I took a buyout and got out of there.

REID FRAZIER: Did you have an emotional reaction?

DAVID TEMPLETON: I was not upset. I felt bad for my fellow reporters who had been there. I was concerned about what the legacy of the Post-Gazette would be and the lack of investigative tools that are necessary for a community as big as Pittsburgh.

REID FRAZIER: Don, what was your reaction?

DON HOPEY: I also wasn’t surprised. The company followed through on the threat that they had publicly made to pull the plug if it lost the court cases. I think it’s a tragedy for the region in terms of coverage, even though it hasn’t really been doing a whole lot of environmental coverage recently.

REID FRAZIER: So did you guys detect or did you notice how the environmental journalism beat changed over the years? Were there any significant evolutions, did things get better, or worse?

DON HOPEY: There was a time when most of what I was writing was about longwall mining in Washington and Greene counties. Things that I had seen when I worked on the zone edition down in Washington in Greene County for the Pittsburgh Press, I kind of segued very completely into discussions of the Marcellus Shale and stories about Marcellas Shale drilling. So in that way, there was a change in topics, but [it was] again, extractive industries.

REID FRAZIER: Dave, did you detect any evolution of the beat?

DAVID TEMPLETON: Don would know better than I, but I think the continuing issues with extraction industries and the legacy of coal mining in Washington County as people were building and Washington County was growing, (that) became an ever more important issue.

And I think Don was very much aware of that, that more and more people were becoming aware and more activist groups were emerging. They were very helpful. You had to check [what they said] as much as you had to check the industry on details, but they were very active in alerting us reporters about pollution issues and things that they were seeing. So I think it evolved.

Environmental journalism, maybe more so than other forms of journalism, requires someone interested in doing a lot of investigation, a lot of phone calls, record searches, getting into the studies in the archives. This takes a lot of effort. –David Templeton

It started out as something that we reporters were detecting on our own, and then it got to the point where there were a lot of people interested in this and there were a lot of people feeding us information that we had to check out, you know, right or wrong. A lot that led to things that required more investigation.

DON HOPEY: They were interested because things were happening in their backyard. And to them, in terms of their health, in their homes. And that really brought them out of the woodwork and really helped us in terms of our reporting.

REID FRAZIER: After you retired Don and Dave, the P-G no longer had a dedicated environmental journalist. What are your thoughts about the importance of having dedicated environmental journalists where that is their main job and their main area of expertise?

DON HOPEY: I think it’s very important to have that. I don’t see that very much anymore. I think that all the media outlets are facing constrictions because of budgets. I don’t see how that’s going to change. We also, in addition to budget cuts, we see publications like the Post-Gazette going out of business. There’s just fewer of them. Three out of the four newspapers that I’ve worked for in my career no longer exist. The other one has been sold twice since I was there.

[Environmental stories] can be complicated. They can be very scientific. You get to educate yourself, story by story, to the science involved. It can be challenging and you need reporters who are familiar with the science, familiar with subjects. – Don Hopey

DAVID TEMPLETON: I think that environmental journalism, maybe more so than other forms of journalism, requires someone interested in doing a lot of investigation, a lot of phone calls, record searches, getting into the studies in the archives. This takes a lot of effort.

When you don’t have a dedicated newspaper or any other media source that is devoting resources to this, then the public is not hearing the information it needs to hear. For example you see a lot of people supporting fracking statewide. And it does produce some jobs and money for landowners, but they’re not getting the other side, and that information does not come out in the news release generally. It takes a lot of effort to uncover that.

REID FRAZIER: As a follow-up to some of your reporting, Dave and Don, a team of researchers at the University of Pittsburgh found children living near shale gas activities like fracking in Southwest Pennsylvania had a higher risk of developing lymphoma, as well as a strong link between some of the phases of shale-gas development and severe exacerbations, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations for asthma.

DON HOPEY: Yeah, a lot of the stories are not simple stories. They’re not, as Dave said, they’re not the result of a news release. They’re a result of lots of news gathering. They can be complicated. They can be very scientific. You get to educate yourself, story by story, to the science involved. It can be challenging and you need reporters who are familiar with the science, familiar with subjects.

REID FRAZIER: What do you guys think is lost when the paper of record for a given city goes out of business or stops dedicating a reporter to environmental topics?

DON HOPEY: A lot of energy, for lack of a better word, gets lost, I think, in bringing reporters up to speed or reporters coming into an area, parachuting in, and not knowing the terrain, not knowing the geography. There’s also no one to talk to on the staff, no designated person. And getting a reporter up to speed on some of these things is time-consuming and energy-consuming.

DAVID TEMPLETON: It’s just a real detriment to the community and all of those people who are fighting these battles daily and need help and need good information, solid information. There’s a lot of bad information out there about, oh, this happened to me because of that. Well, the reporter is a neutral party that goes to both sides and talks to both sides. Without it, the whole community is lost and the whole community is lacking needed information, both for environmental and health reasons.",https://www.alleghenyfront.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC03744-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 11:59:38.628524

According to a press release, grants of between $25,000 to $100,000 support “assessment, planning, and implementation of efforts to reduce … environmental impact through clean energy generation and energy efficiency measures.” The initiative is managed by the Frankenthaler Foundation in partnership with Environment & Culture Partners, a Washington-based climate advocacy nonprofit, and Green Design Collaborative, a Colorado-based sustainable architectural design firm.

Lise Motherwell, Frankenthaler Foundation Board Chair, said, “We are proud to continue supporting the arts community as it integrates environmental responsibility into its infrastructure and operations. This work not only strengthens individual organizations, but also the broader cultural ecosystem they sustain.”

Elizabeth Smith, the foundation’s Executive Director, said, “Arts organizations across the country are translating their values into action, developing projects that not only improve their energy performance but also model new ways of thinking about stewardship and resourcefulness. Each cycle contributes to shaping a resilient, low-carbon cultural landscape.”

The initiative, now in its sixth annual granting cycle, is structured in four granting tiers: Catalyst Grants, Scoping Grants, Technical Assistance Grants, and Implementation Grants.

Visual arts organizations with annual budgets under $500,000 are eligible for Catalyst Grants of up to $20,000, for new or smaller-scale energy efficiency projects. Scoping Grants of up to $25,000 provide support for assessing ways to implement energy efficiency. Following a comprehensive assessment, Technical Assistance Grants award up to $50,000 for further evaluation on developing energy efficiency projects. Implementation Grants of up to $100,000 fund planned infrastructure upgrades for reductions in carbon emissions and overall energy usage.

Among 74 visual arts organizations receiving $3.4 million in project awards in 2025, Texas Scoping Grant recipients included Ballroom Marfa, The Contemporary Austin, and DiverseWorks in Houston. DiverseWorks partnered with Lawndale in Houston to develop its headquarters as “the first carbon net-positive facility for the arts in the city,” according to the FCI project description. The Contemporary Austin received funds to help in preservation of the historic Driscoll Villa building at its Laguna Gloria location, along with climate control improvements in all its buildings. Ballroom Marfa received funding for assessing energy efficiency upgrades in its newly acquired 1920s-era building.

Past Texas institutions to receive grants include the Arlington Museum of Art and the Chinati Foundation in 2024, Artpace in 2023, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston in 2022, and the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth and the Nasher Sculpture Center in 2021.

Since the nationwide initiative was launched in 2021, the Frankenthaler Foundation has awarded $17.5 million to 249 visual arts organizations in 40 states, for 318 energy efficiency-related projects promoting “sustainable cultural infrastructure,” according to the foundation’s website.

Sarah Sutton, Environment & Culture Partners CEO, said, “FCI grantees continue to show extraordinary leadership in implementing practical energy solutions that yield long-term benefits … strengthening both institutions and the communities they serve while demonstrating that environmental progress and cultural vitality go hand in hand.”

Examples of visual arts-focused institutions eligible to apply for grants are museums, archives, colleges and university art programs, artist residency programs, community art centers, and other artist-endowed foundations.",https://glasstire.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/1160_frankenthaler-driscoll-Laguna_Gloria.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 11:59:49.230681

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s (MIT) “2025 Global Change Outlook” finds the world on track to exceed key climate thresholds under current policies, even as renewable energy expands rapidly. Released amid stalled global cooperation and the United States’ withdrawal from major climate commitments, the report projects continued emissions growth and dangerous levels of warming by the end of the century.

The outlook is based on MIT’s Integrated Global Systems Model, which links population growth, economic activity, energy use and international policy decisions to changes in the climate system. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has described it as “a comprehensive tool built to analyze interactions among humans and the climate system.”

“The current trends are very concerning,” said Sergey Paltsev, co-author of the “Global Change Outlook” and deputy director of MIT’s Center for Sustainability Science and Strategy. “We are nowhere near the stated goals of the Paris Agreement.”

Under current trends, the model projects a rapid expansion of renewable energy, led by wind and solar, with renewables supplying more than 70 percent of global electricity by 2050—up from roughly 40 percent today. It also finds that, despite U.S. efforts to revive the coal industry, global coal consumption is expected to continue declining.

Those gains from renewable energy are largely offset by ongoing economic and population growth. Global greenhouse gas emissions are expected to rise until around 2030, driven primarily by growth in developing countries, while emissions in developed nations, as well as in China and India, remain largely stagnant. Much of this increase comes from continued use of liquid fuels and natural gas. Between 2030 and 2050, emissions are projected to decline slowly, only to rise again later in the century, partly due to agricultural emissions linked to population growth.

With no significant emissions reductions on the horizon, the model projects global temperatures are likely to surpass 1.5 degrees Celsius within the next few years, reach roughly 1.8 degrees by 2050, and approach 3 degrees by 2100. These projections represent the model’s “middle of the road path,” or most likely outcome. Across hundreds of simulations, some outcomes show far greater warming, while others fall below that central estimate.

“The findings align with other models and with my own modeling from about a decade ago,” said Ross Salawitch, an atmospheric researcher and climate modeler at the University of Maryland. According to Salawitch, political challenges and energy demand exceeding early projections explain why emissions reductions are not yet clearly reflected in current long-term projections.

More recent independent analyses point to similar outcomes. Rhodium Group estimates “middle-of-the-road” warming of about 2.7 degrees by century’s end, while Climate Action Tracker projects 2.5 degrees to 2.9 degrees, depending on future policy.

Keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees has long been a central goal of the international climate framework. Exceeding the threshold risks triggering critical tipping points and causing irreversible damage. The Paris goal of 1.5 degrees is a global average that masks regional extremes that are, in some cases, two to three times larger, meaning many places experience average warming of 3 degrees to 4.5 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit).

The European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service report released last week ranked 2025 as the third-warmest year on record, just a hair cooler than 2023 and within striking distance of 2024, the hottest year on record. Together, the past three years averaged more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures, the first time any three-year stretch has crossed that threshold.

“Any increase in temperature is an indication that the global system is taking on more energy,” said Adam Schlosser, co-author of the “Global Change Outlook” and deputy director at MIT’s Center for Sustainability Science and Strategy. “That energy has to go somewhere and it shows up as more intense and/or frequent extreme events.”

In addition to fueling deadly heat waves that already kill over half a million people each year, rising global temperatures are projected to intensify extreme weather, make precipitation more erratic, increase the risk of drought and disrupt agricultural production worldwide. The outlook warns these shifts would also accelerate biodiversity loss.

Despite the grim outlook, there is still reason for hope. The report also outlines “accelerated actions”—projections of emissions and climate outcomes if strong economic and policy commitments are implemented.

“Two years ago, governments promised to triple renewable energy, double efficiency and act on methane.” Bill Hare, CEO and senior scientist at Climate Analytics, said in a statement. “Our results show if they achieved this by 2035 it would be a game-changer, quickly slowing the rate of warming in the next decade and lowering global warming this century from 2.6 degrees to about 1.7 degrees.

Achieving rapid electrification and decarbonization will demand substantial public and private investment, coordinated global commitments and a robust regulatory framework. “There’s no one magic bullet,” Paltsev said.

Even if these actions are realized, warming is still expected to exceed 1.5 degrees by 2050, under almost every IGSM projection. In some scenarios, by 2150, global temperatures could return to 1.5 degrees after a brief period of cooling.

“We are more than likely going to overshoot,” Schlosser said. “The question then becomes for how long and how strong.”

“It’s not a reason to give up hope or stop the necessary action,” Paltsev said. “Limiting every degree possible matters, even every tenth of a degree.” Small differences can determine how many lives are lost, how much land becomes uninhabitable and how severe the damage ultimately becomes.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Houston-1024x681.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 12:59:12.607728

What’s more, the TikTok deal may not meet the law’s requirements.
All this has happened with nary a peep from Congress, which passed this law overwhelmingly—with Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) one of the few raising many of the unanswered questions about the TikTok deal.
We may never know what this TikTok deal entails, how it happened, or if it is legally compliant.
Should the questions of the deal’s compliance with the law remain unanswered, a future administration should direct the Department of Justice to examine the deal and its legality.","The Thursday night press release announcing the joint venture appears to be the only information that will be officially released about the change in TikTok’s management, an app that has more than 170 million U.S. users. As of 4 p.m. ET on January 23, there appear to be no updates related to TikTok on the White House website or on the press pages of the three newly named lead investors—Silverlake, Oracle, and MGX. Oracle, a publicly traded company, shows no new filings on the SEC website.

The details of the TikTok deal may never be known, and Congress and the American people are left with more questions than answers about what actually transpired.

The saga of TikTok matters because it encapsulates every abusive practice of the Trump administration: unprecedented nonenforcement of the law, sweeping claims of executive power, an opaque process enriching some Trump favorites, a deal that may not comply with the law, and total secrecy—all while Congress says nothing. Regardless of how Americans feel about banning TikTok, President Trump’s actions on this were among his first as president, and his handling of this deal is emblematic of the assault on the rule of law that has defined his second term.

The TikTok saga is a laundry list of the Trump administration’s preferred abuses

The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act was passed by Congress on an overwhelming bipartisan basis, signed by President Joe Biden, and upheld by the Supreme Court. The law took effect on January 19, 2025, but President Trump has refused to enforce it, promising after the 2024 election to save TikTok from the legislation. His first batch of executive orders included one that paused enforcement of the TikTok ban for 75 days and directed the attorney general to issue letters promising not to prosecute companies that let TikTok back online. These actions blatantly violated the letter of the law, which includes no mechanism for presidential delay. It immediately signaled Trump’s willingness to flaunt the government’s legal authority and ignore his own constitutional duty as president to ensure laws are “faithfully executed.”

Next, the president claimed unprecedented executive powers to justify his actions. In July, following Freedom of Information Act litigation, the U.S. Department of Justice released the letters it sent to companies promising not to prosecute them if they restored TikTok. The department argued that enforcing the TikTok ban would impede President Trump’s duty to protect national security and U.S. foreign affairs—an argument that Harvard Law School Professor Jack Goldsmith called “an astounding assertion of executive power—maybe the broadest I have ever seen any president or Justice Department make, ever, in any context.” Trump issued a total of five separate orders delaying enforcement of the TikTok ban.

When a TikTok divestment deal was finally announced, the selection of the three managing investors benefited one of Trump’s supporters and foreign governments that have been trying to curry favor with the president. It is unclear how these lead investors were selected to purchase TikTok despite reported higher offers from others. The deal reportedly values TikTok at $14 billion—far below what analysts believe it is worth. There are many questions that remain unanswered about how the managing investors were selected and how the valuation was determined.

What’s more, the TikTok deal may not meet the law’s requirements. While it seemingly addresses foreign ownership limits and data sharing, the law also requires no operational relationship with former owners, specifically regarding the content recommendation algorithm. The press release states, “The Joint Venture will retrain, test, and update the content recommendation algorithm on U.S. user data. The content recommendation algorithm will be secured in Oracle’s U.S. cloud environment” but provides no additional information that allows observers to judge if the law’s requirement has been met. The press release does confirm that “TikTok global’s U.S. entities will manage global product interoperability and certain commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing.” That means ByteDance—or BD TikTok USA LLC or TT Commerce & Global Services, as they are referred to in the newly updated TikTok Terms of Service and Privacy Policy—will continue running advertising for TikTok USDS. Since that is how the site makes its money, this almost certainly constitutes the “maintenance of any operational relationship” with “formerly affiliated entities that are controlled by a foreign adversary” that is prohibited by the law.

The Trump administration negotiated this deal in near total secrecy. The law does not require disclosure, and the U.S. secretary of the treasury has called the agreement “commercial terms between two private parties,” which seems to indicate these terms will never be made public. Beyond compliance with the law, there are very real and important questions that need to be answered about the new TikTok USDS. The press release states, “The safeguards provided by the Joint Venture will also cover CapCut, and Lemon8, and a portfolio of other apps and websites in the U.S” but does not list those apps and websites. The TikTok ban law names TikTok but it also names ByteDance and includes all of its apps, of which there are at least 10 more in the United States that could be affected—those that Apple removed from the app store in the brief period when it complied with the law. In another case, and one of real public interest, Trump’s September executive order mentions that “[t]he Attorney General or the Attorney General’s designee shall serve as the United States Government’s representative under the Framework Agreement,” but there has been no further information on that U.S. government representative and any corporate powers or information they may be granted. Finally, there is no information about any fee the U.S. government would be paid for brokering the deal or the possibility that the U.S. government could take an ownership stake in the new entity, known as a “golden share,” which this administration has now taken in several companies. Americans and Congress alike will probably remain in the dark about whether the deal complies with the law, the scope of government involvement in this new entity, and even whether the government will take money or an ownership stake in TikTok USDS.

Unfortunately, the law has no mechanism to ensure the divestment meets its requirements. It only requires the president to certify compliance with the law, which Trump did in his September executive order with minimal details and many open questions remaining. There are few if any legal avenues to pursue since few entities—possibly only TikTok—have standing to sue if the deal fails to comply with the law.

All this has happened with nary a peep from Congress, which passed this law overwhelmingly—with Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) one of the few raising many of the unanswered questions about the TikTok deal. The lack of members of Congress willing to call out the president for ignoring a law they themselves passed is disappointing, but unsurprising. Beyond partisanship, the executive branch’s flaunting of the law while Congress does nothing has shredded the latter’s credibility. Congress has an opportunity to demand details about the deal, and they should do so immediately.

We may never know what this TikTok deal entails, how it happened, or if it is legally compliant. The Trump administration could and should release all the details and participate in congressional oversight hearings. Even though the deal has closed, these questions still deserve to be answered, and they represent a roadmap for future congressional investigations about abuse of power, secrecy, and flaunting existing laws—all the hallmarks Americans have come to expect from this administration. Should the questions of the deal’s compliance with the law remain unanswered, a future administration should direct the Department of Justice to examine the deal and its legality. Congress and the American people deserve the truth; a future Congress should seek to uncover it, and a future president should ensure that U.S. law is complied with, even if—especially if—a previous president ignored them.",https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/GettyImages-2257850965-CROPPED.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 14:59:33.145639

Energy experts warned that the worst effects of the potentially catastrophic storm could come on Monday and Tuesday in areas like Texas and the Mid-Atlantic States, after snow and ice accumulate on tree branches and power lines, eventually causing them to snap and damage electrical equipment.

The damage could be compounded by sharp increases in electricity demand at the start of the week. Peak energy usage typically occurs in the early morning and evening hours on weekdays, when consumers fire up their appliances and raise the temperature on their thermostats as they get ready for work and school, and again after they return home.

“Just because the snow stops, that doesn’t mean the worst is over,” said Wei Du, a managing consultant for PA Consulting, which advises utilities, investors and other in the energy industry. “That’s frequently not the case.”

Analysis by ICF, an energy consulting firm, shows that the main grid in Texas, which is run by Electric Reliability Council of Texas, will hit its peak demand between 5 a.m. and 8 a.m. on Monday. Across the Mid-Atlantic region, on the grid managed by PJM, which includes 13 states and the District of Columbia, demand is expected to crest from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. on Tuesday. That’s when the system operator anticipates it will reach the highest winter demand in its history.

PJM also warned customers that it may extend its winter weather alert through Jan. 30. That has prompted utilities and government officials to call on large energy users like data centers to prepare to reduce the amount of power they take from the grid.

“Definitely in the PJM system things are going to be extremely thin, and frankly we are concerned,” said George Katsigiannakis, a vice president at ICF.

The anticipated demand on Tuesday is almost 10 percent higher than the highest demand last winter, Mr. Katsigiannakis said. But PJM has not added many new power plants, batteries and other resources to its system. The Texas grid, by comparison, has added many new large battery storage systems and solar farms.

During recent winter storms, the freezing temperatures shut down many power plants connected to the PJM and Texas grids.

In February 2021, the main Texas grid experienced a huge failure that left many electricity customers without power for days. More than 200 people died in that storm.

Then, over the Christmas holidays in 2022, about a quarter of the natural gas power plants in PJM’s service area failed as snow, wind and subzero temperatures froze natural gas pipelines. Various types of power plants — fossil fuel and renewables like solar and wind — failed during both the 2021 and 2022 storms. But in PJM’s case, about 70 percent of the units were fueled by natural gas.

Mr. Katsigiannakis said managers of the Texas and PJM grids have tried to strengthen their systems to withstand the extreme winter weather, as neighboring energy networks in the Midwest do. Such potent winter storms had not been as common in Texas or at PJM, which extends from around the Chicago area to Virginia Beach.

The powerful storm this week began making its way east from the Rocky Mountains, and is expected to drop snow, sleet and freezing rain on an area that runs from the Southwest into New England, and is home to more than 160 million people.

The grid managers said they have sufficient reserves to meet the anticipated demand over the weekend and next week but are preparing for a storm that is worse than expected. Depending on the actual path it takes, the wintry mix could pose challenges for multiple grid systems, straining resources.

“This is a formidable arctic cold front coming our way, and it will impact our neighboring systems as much as it affects PJM,” Mike Bryson, senior vice president of operations for PJM, said in a statement.

The Edison Electric Institute, a utility industry organization, said top executives at its member companies were coordinating responses with state and federal agencies to minimize power outages.

Part of the strategy includes tamping down demand from data centers that support development of artificial intelligence. These facilities are increasingly using a larger share of the country's electricity, particularly in places like Ohio and Virginia, where forecasters are expecting snow squalls and freezing rain.

On Thursday, the energy secretary, Chris Wright, said the federal government was drafting orders that unused backup generators at data centers and “other major facilities” could be deployed to help prevent blackouts.

The orders would let grid operators force data centers to run on backup generators as a “last resort,” after all other supplies are exhausted. Data centers generally are not set up to feed energy back onto grids, but they can power their own operations from the generators, reducing the amount of electricity they draw from the grid.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/24/business/24biz-power-outage/24biz-power-outage-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 10:59:56.466589

“Under these extreme weather conditions, don’t do anything crazy,” St. Tammany Fire Protection District No. 1 Chief Chris Kaufmann said.

Using an extension cord to plug in a space heater or placing it within three feet of anything combustible is what Kaufmann might consider crazy.

“And don’t leave it unattended, because something can happen, a pet can knock it over, and before you know it, you have a fire started,” Kaufmann said.

He also said no matter how cold it gets, never use a gas stove to heat your home.

“It could cause carbon monoxide poisoning,” Kaufmann said. “You don’t want to create that situation.”

Carbon monoxide is emitted by gas-powered appliances, including generators, which is why if you end up relying on one to keep your house warm during a power outage, it should always be placed 20 feet away from the home.

“Whether it comes through a window or a door, it gets into an environment that you’re sitting in, or laying in, and you won’t even know it’s happening.” Kaufmann said.

Unless you have a carbon monoxide detector installed in your home, there is no way to know you are in danger until it’s too late.

“It’s odorless. It puts you to sleep. It makes you tired, and before you know it, you pass out and you don’t wake up,” Kaufmann said.

The department is also asking people to check on elderly friends, family, and neighbors to make sure they are prepared as well.

CDX Role Definitions: 1.","Introduction

The CAMD Business System (CBS) is the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Industrial Processes and Power Division system for managing environmental compliance, allowance trading, and emissions reporting. Due to Federal and EPA security mandates, both ECMPS 2.0 and CBS will use EPA's Central Data Exchange (CDX) with Login.gov identity and access management solution.

This page outlines steps and serves a resource for users to begin the registration process in CDX ahead of the ECMPS 2.0 and CBS launch. Additional information and steps will be added when ECMPS 2.0 and the updated CBS are launched. For now, users should follow the CDX registration process only when instructed to do so by EPA or their Designated Representative (DR). At this time, users will not be able to link their existing CBS accounts with CBS nor log into the new ECMPS 2.0. As a reminder, if you have been beta testing, any CDX, Login.gov, or ECMPS test/beta account information will not translate into production, so you will have to follow the steps below in order to access the new system when it goes live.

CBS-CDX Transition Process

Important Notice: CBS will be updated to work with CDX in Q1 2026. We strongly encourage all users to begin registering with CDX as soon as the bulk registration process is started to prepare for this transition. EPA will email users directly when they are able to begin this process.

Why Register Early?

Ensures smooth transition when CBS-CDX integration is released

Allows time to resolve any registration or verification issues

Enables familiarity with the new authentication system

Facilitates bulk pre-registration of key personnel

Transition Timeline:

Phase 1 (Current): Bulk pre-registration of Initial Authorizers (IA), primarily Designated Representatives (DRs)

Phase 2: Extended user registration of other users types (alternate DRs, agents) by requesting sponsorship from IA

Phase 3: Full CBS-CDX integration release

Key Changes for Users:

CDX Registration Required: You must register in CDX/Login.gov before being assigned as a representative, agent, consultant, MATS Responsible Official in CBS

Consultant Access: Consultants will also need to be registered in CDX/login.gov before being assigned facilities

Unified Login: Use CDX/Login.gov credentials to access both CBS and ECMPS 2.0

Organization-Based Access: Users must have a CDX role with a CDX organizations

Role-Based Permissions: DRs and Alternate DRs (ADRs) can only assign agents who have a role that shares the same CDX organization

CBS provides secure access to various environmental programs including:

Allowance Trading and Transfers

Compliance Reporting and Management

General Account Management

Facility (Certificate of Representation) Management

Emissions Data Submission Access

CDX CBS Production

What to do Now

Before the Q1 2026 release ensure you have:

Current CBS Production Access: Verify you have up-to-date and appropriate access in CBS production

Correct Email Address: Use the SAME email address for CDX and Login.gov that is currently in CBS production - this is critical for proper account linking

Updated Information: Ensure all personal information (name, email, agent relationships) is current in CBS production

Key Notes and Best Practices

Organization ID Management

Critical Importance: CDX Organization ID (Org ID) of your role must match for all people you work with (DRs, ADRs, agents, consultants)

Obtaining an Organization ID (applies only to Initial Authorizers, likely DRs):

Primary Method: Initial Authorizers (IAs), which will likely be Designated Representatives, will receive an email from EPA directly with additional information on how to create their Org ID. Once an Org ID is established, anyone in the relationship hierarchy of a DR (i.e, ADRs and agents), should utilize the same Org ID when registering in CDX.

Finding Organization IDs (after an Org ID is already established):

Primary Method: CDX Manage Page - Click ""My CDX"" tab, then click the gear icon labeled ""Manage"" in the green services bar to view all your program services, organizations, and roles

Secondary Method: CDX Profile page - Shows Organization ID but not role-organization-program service connections

Important: Use BOTH the Manage page and Profile page to determine the correct Organization ID to communicate with others in your group

CBS General Account page for DRs and ADRs

CBS Certificate of Representation page

CBS Manage Agent Relationship section for agents

Role Understanding: Understand whether you need Initial Authorizer, Sponsor, Submitter, or Preparer role based on your responsibilities for each org (if you need multiple)

See User Types and Roles

Keep Track: Write down your Organization ID(s) and share with team members

No Direct Org-Facility Connection: CDX organizations are NOT tied to specific facilities or plants. Access is entirely people and relationship-based; facilities are accessed through individual user relationships with DRs/ADRs

Email Address Requirements

Same Email: Must use the SAME email address that is currently used in CBS production

Existing CDX Account: If you already have a production CDX account, continue using that email address and update your CBS production email to match if different

Update First: If your email differs, update it in CBS production BEFORE registering the program service in CDX

Login.gov Consistency: Use the same email for Login.gov account creation

Network Updates: Notify everyone in your network to update their information in CBS production

Account Limitations

One Account Rule: Do not create multiple CDX accounts. If you already have an existing CDX production account that you use to report for another EPA program, use that login information to add the EASEY program service to your account (instructions on how to do this appear below). Ensure the email in that CDX account is the same as your CBS account; otherwise, update the CBS account email address to match.

Transition Process and Early Registration

Transition Support

EPA provides dedicated support during this transition period:

Registration Assistance: Help with CDX account setup and verification

Organization Coordination: Support for establishing and managing CDX organizations

Role Assignment: Guidance on appropriate CDX roles for your CBS responsibilities

Issue Resolution: Priority support for transition-related problems

Phase 1: Bulk Pre-Registration of Initial Authorizers

Target Users: Designated Representatives (DRs) and key organizational contacts

Process Overview:

EPA will work with organizations to identify primary DRs who should become Initial Authorizers

Bulk invitation emails will be sent to selected DRs. EPA will reach out to users directly to initiate this process; do not attempt to register for the EASEY program service without being instructed to do so by EPA

DRs will complete the registration process to establish CDX organizations

This creates the foundation for subsequent user registrations within each organization

Phase 2: Extended user registration of other users

Target Users: Alternate representatives, agents, consultants, MATS Responsible Officials

Process Overview:

After being instructed to do so by EPA, Initial Authorizers (likely the DRs) will communicate the organization ID that they created or registered with and pass that information down to other users

It would be beneficial to approve another sponsor in the organization first so they can also help add people into the organization

Other users will register with the appropriate role and use to organization ID that was provided

The Initial Authorizer and sponsors will approve or reject requests into the organization

CDX Account Registration Process

There are a few paths for CDX registration depending on your role and situation. Choose the path that matches your needs:

Path 1: Initial Authorizer Registration (DRs: Bulk Pre-Registration Only)

When to use: You are a DR who has received a pre-registration email from CDX as part of EPA's bulk pre-registration process.

Important: This registration path is exclusively for DRs (or those previously approved individuals who have been delegated authority by their DR) who receive direct invitation emails from CDX and instruction from EPA.

Bulk Pre-Registration Process: EPA is conducting bulk pre-registration of selected DRs to establish organizational foundations in CDX. Only DRs who receive a pre-registration invitation email should use this process.

Step 1: Wait for CDX Pre-Registration Email and EPA instruction Email

You will receive a pre-registration invitation email directly from CDX as well as a separate email from EPA with additional information

The CDX email will contain your unique registration link

Do not attempt to register without receiving this official invitation

Step 2: Registration Process

Click link in email response to start registration

Either log-into your existing CDX production account or create a unique username for your account

Click ""Confirm Registration"" if you are creating a new CDX account

Click ""Proceed to Login.gov""

Step 3: Login.gov Setup

If new to Login.gov: Click ""Create an Account"" and follow steps

Complete multi-factor authentication setup

If existing Login.gov user: Sign in with existing credentials

Step 4: User Information

Fill out personal information

Answer three security questions

Submit information

Step 5: Organization Setup

Important: Check with your network before adding new organization as there may be an organization that exists with other EPA programs

Search for existing organization by Organization ID first

If truly new organization needed: Use ""request that we add your organization"" link

Step 6: Identity Verification

Complete LexisNexis verification process

If LexisNexis fails: Print and complete ESA (Electronic Signature Agreement)

Mail the ESA by following the instructions on the ESA. Note the address on that form; do not mail it to any other address.

Step 7: Approval Process

Your role will be automatically processed as part of the bulk pre-registration

If you experience any delays, email cbs-support@camdsupport.com

Subject: ""CDX Bulk Pre-Registration - Status Inquiry""

Include: First name, last name, email, CDX username

Step 8: Confirmation

Receive email: ""Your Central Data Exchange (CDX) CDX Role has been activated by EPA""

Log into CDX to confirm active status

Find your Organization ID using both ""My Profile"" and the Manage page (""My CDX"" tab → gear icon ""Manage"") to see role-program service connections

Path 2: Self-Registration (Requiring Sponsorship)

When to use: You do not have an existing CDX account. This should be done AFTER the assigned Initial Authorizer has fully registered.

Step 1: Start Registration

Go to CDX

Click ""Register with CDX""

Accept Terms and Conditions

Step 2: Program Selection

Type ""EASEY"" to filter results

Select ""EASEY: Emissions and Allowance System for Energy""

Preparer: If you prepare data as a consultant

Step 4: Account Creation

Enter unique username

Click ""Proceed to Login.gov""

Complete Login.gov setup (same as Path 1)

Step 5: Organization Selection

Search for existing organization by Organization ID

Do not search by using a company name or other identifier as this is less reliable; Org ID will guarantee you're added to the correct relationship hierarchy

Critical: Use same email address as in CBS production

Do NOT create new organization

Step 6: Sponsorship Request

Provide email of Sponsor in your organization

Sponsor receives email and must approve request

Sponsor logs in and signs Sponsor Agreement

Step 7: Complete Registration

Click link in email once sponsorship is approved

Complete LexisNexis/ESA verification

Email EPA if approval needed

Path 3: Adding EASEY to Existing CDX Account

When to use: You already have a CDX account with Login.gov but need to add the EASEY program service to access CBS. This should be done AFTER the assigned Initial Authorizer has fully registered.

Step 1: Login to CDX

Go to CDX

Sign in with your existing Login.gov credentials

Step 2: Add Program Service

Navigate to ""My CDX"" tab

Click ""Add Program Service"" or similar option

Type ""EASEY"" to filter results

Select ""EASEY: Emissions and Allowance System for Energy""

Step 3: Role Selection

Select appropriate role:

Sponsor: If you're a DR/ADR or MATS official with sponsorship responsibilities

Submitter: If you submit data as an agent or are a MATS official

Preparer: If you prepare data as a consultant

Step 4: Organization Selection

Search for existing organization by Organization ID

Critical: Ensure this matches your team's CDX organization

Do NOT create new organization

Step 5: Sponsorship Request

Provide email of Sponsor or Initial Authorizer in your organization

Sponsor receives email and must approve request

Sponsor logs in and signs Sponsor Agreement

Step 6: Complete Process

Click link in email once sponsorship is approved

Verify role is active in CDX

Final Steps for All Paths:

Sponsorship Requests:

Initial Authorizers and sponsors can approve requests by going to the ""Sponsorship"" tab in CDX.

The PJM Interconnection - the largest U.S. regional grid which serves 67 million people in the East and Mid-Atlantic - reported temporary spikes in spot wholesale electricity prices to nearly $3,000 per megawatt hour on Saturday morning from earlier levels of less than $200 per MWh.

The Reuters Power Up newsletter provides everything you need to know about the global energy industry. Sign up here.

Prices soared as stormy weather and temperatures hovering around 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 C) pushed up electricity demand and prompted some operators to shut in natural gas production in key basins, while grid companies also faced constraints on gas pipeline supply.

Faced with constricted gas supplies, regional grid operators in the U.S. are asking producers such as coal-fired power plants to boost their output, according to grid operations reports.

The Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) called on power plants to maximize output and curtailed electricity exports in a territory that stretches across 15 states in the Midwest and South and Manitoba, Canada.

MISO's all-hands-on-deck emergency action is designed to avoid capacity shortfalls as some power plants are forced offline or reduce their output because of freezing temperatures, alerting utilities to be prepared to produce as much electricity as possible.

MISO spot wholesale electricity prices soared to nearly $500 per MWh in MISO's Minnesota hub, as the upper Midwest experienced transmission bottlenecks across high-voltage power lines. By contrast spot electricity prices in MISO's southern territory were less than $50 per MWh.

In New England, fuel oil generation kicked into high gear to help the six-state region's electric grid to conserve natural gas, its top fuel source.

Early Saturday, oil-fired generation accounted for 26% of the New England grid's output, compared with a typical level of about 1% or less, ISO New England's operations display showed. Natural gas accounted for 28% of the grid's generation output.

New England spot electricity prices were more than $300 per MWh, or about double the price on Friday.

Over the past decade, India has made rapid progress in renewable capacity addition. Installed renewable energy capacity has grown from 76 GW in 2014 to over 226 GW by mid-2025, underscoring the scale of the transition already underway. However, industry leaders now argue that the next phase must focus on quality, resilience, and integration, rather than capacity alone.

Decentralised Renewables Seen as the Next Growth Engine

Calling for a sharper policy focus, Radhika Choudhary, Co-founder and Director, Freyr Energy, said the upcoming Budget should prioritise decentralised renewable energy, particularly distributed and rooftop solar. She noted that decentralised systems can strengthen grid resilience, reduce transmission losses, and improve energy access in semi-urban and rural regions. According to Choudhary, these solutions are well positioned to drive the next phase of renewable growth.

In addition, she advocated targeted incentives for battery storage, domestic solar manufacturing, and digital energy platforms. Measures such as interest subvention, simplified GST structures, and faster project approvals could significantly boost rooftop solar adoption, she added.

Policy Support Sought for Low-Carbon Technologies and Green Finance

Meanwhile, Bharath Jairaj, Executive Program Director, WRI India, emphasised the need for stronger policy and financial support to scale low-carbon technologies, especially in hard-to-abate sectors. He called for expanded tax credits, guarantees, and R&D funding, along with greater investments in Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) pilot projects, electrolyser manufacturing, technology transfer, and workforce skilling.

Jairaj also proposed the creation of a green bank or credit guarantee institution to mobilise capital for battery storage, green hydrogen, and industrial electrification. In parallel, he highlighted the importance of Just Transition Funds for coal-dependent regions to support an equitable energy transition.

Strengthening Domestic Supply Chains and Industrial Decarbonisation

Beyond finance, Jairaj urged policymakers to deploy pooled procurement funds to accelerate adoption of green steel and green cement, while also investing in critical minerals and solar village initiatives. He further recommended expanding the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme to cover the entire solar value chain, a move he said would help reduce import dependence and strengthen domestic manufacturing.

Grid Reliability and Discom Reforms Take Centre Stage

Shifting focus from capacity addition to system performance, Akshay Hiranandani, CEO, Serentica Renewables, stressed that India’s renewable strategy must now prioritise grid reliability and market viability. He flagged the urgent need to fix discom finances, noting that weak balance sheets have stalled nearly 50 GW of Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). Budgetary support, he said, is also essential to accelerate transmission expansion and grid modernisation, particularly through the deployment of advanced grid technologies.

Energy Storage as a Core Grid Asset

Hiranandani further argued that energy storage should be treated as a grid asset under the control of system operators. He highlighted Viability Gap Funding (VGF) for grid-connected battery systems as a critical requirement to scale storage capacity and enable round-the-clock renewable power integration.

Legislators must have thought as much in 1975 when they passed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, creating CAFE.
""We think the rule is giving freedom to manufacturers to build the vehicles that people want to buy,” he said.

“We can't let that happen.” As DOT secretary, Duffy has to contend with much more than car engines, and the last third of the panel touched on some of his other responsibilities.","Weeks after the Trump administration put the Biden administration’s strengthening of fuel-economy standards in reverse, Trump’s transportation secretary defended the move as a matter of fairness to fossil fuels.

In a talk at the Washington Auto Show’s public policy day on Thursday, DOT Secretary Sean Duffy called the previous administration’s phased increase in average fuel economy rules “a backdoor way to an EV mandate.”

Changes to the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards finalized in June 2024 would have required automakers to meet a fleetwide average of 50.4 miles per gallon by the 2031 model year. The changes the DOT announced in December would lower that 2031 goal to 34.5MPG.

Speaking with John Bozzella, president and CEO of Washington-based trade group Alliance for Automotive Innovation, Duffy said the Biden requirement—which he incorrectly described as a 60MPG standard, an error he’s made before—set a goal unattainable with internal combustion engines. ""The problem is, nobody can meet that,” he said, justifying a combustion-compatible rewrite of CAFE on the grounds that Congress enacted it with combustion engines in mind.

Legislators must have thought as much in 1975 when they passed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, creating CAFE. But the text of the Energy Independence and Security Act that raised and expanded these standards in 2007 has numerous mentions of hybrid, battery-electric, and even fuel-cell vehicles.

Duffy did not mention another recent change to CAFE: the budget-reconciliation bill that last year killed off Inflation Reduction Act tax credits for EVs and other clean-energy expenses, and also reduced the fine for CAFE violations to zero, going back to 2022 model-year vehicles.

“We want fuel efficiency,” Duffy said. “That's a great thing.”

But the US government is now leaving the value of that up to the market, as Duffy reaffirmed more than once in his roughly 45-minute conversation with Bozzella. ""We think the rule is giving freedom to manufacturers to build the vehicles that people want to buy,” he said. He expects this to lead to cheaper cars, which in turn will prompt people to upgrade from older, less efficient, and less safe vehicles.

The Trump administration, however, has not been so free-market-minded in other areas of energy policy. It’s denied permits to solar and wind power-generation projects, attempted to halt construction of already-approved offshore wind projects (courts keep setting aside those stop-work orders, allowing work to resume), and is leveraging US military action in Venezuela to force the opening of that country’s oil industry to American firms.

While allowing that he expects some customers to keep buying electric or partially electric vehicles—“I have no problem with EVs and hybrids,” he said—Duffy suggested that EVs were more of a niche product propped up by Biden-administration policies. “Northern Wisconsin, where it's rural and cold, they don't work so well,” he said.

Stats published by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation show that EVs made up 5.33% of car sales in Duffy’s home state from September 2024 to September 2025, the most recent 12-month period available. The nationwide EV share over that timeframe was 8.96%, which is far below EV adoption in other countries such as Norway, where, notwithstanding many rural and cold areas, that figure now stands at 96%.

China vs. the US: An Unfair Comparison?

Bozzella quizzed Duffy at some length about another country now making a sharp turn toward vehicle electrification, China. The secretary professed respect for China’s efforts; ""They pay for 100 engineers compared to our five, they get this remarkable innovation, and they develop good products."" But he also said “massive” government support for Chinese EV manufacturers made this an unfair competition and raised concerns about data privacy.

Duffy criticized Canada’s recent move to allow the sale of 49,000 Chinese EVs at a tariff rate of just 6.1% instead of the current 100%, saying Canadians “will one day regret” that decision, and that other countries following similar policies would do the same. “You'll see the world be gouged by China, and they'll control all the manufacturing,” he said. “We can't let that happen.”

As DOT secretary, Duffy has to contend with much more than car engines, and the last third of the panel touched on some of his other responsibilities. He predicted that self-driving car technology could make highways more efficient through closer spacing of vehicles; voiced his enthusiasm about two other kinds of electric vehicles, drones and eVTOL air taxis; and said he looked forward to the prospect of quieter supersonic passenger flights over land.

On a more somber note, he observed that it had been almost a year since the mid-air collision over the Potomac River that killed 67 people and recalled how he had since met with so many relatives of those lost. “I think about safety all the time,” Duffy said.

Duffy’s plans for the coming year include making transportation part of celebrations of America’s 250th birthday. He said the DOT is working on one event in particular that would be “the coolest damn thing you've ever seen in DC,” but which will first require Congressional approval.

Public power is not foreign or experimental but firmly established in the United States.","Affordability will remain a top issue in 2026, continuing to draw political attention and likely defining this year’s midterm election races. Among the principal contributors to the cost-of-living crisis are power bills. For millions, the cost of keeping the lights, heating, and cooling on feels like “a second rent,” a problem that the explosive growth in the development and use of AI and associated data center capacity appears poised to aggravate.

The nation’s capital is no exception. A quarter of residents in the District of Columbia are unable to pay their power bill and in debt to the city’s private electricity company Pepco, which prioritizes short-term profits over affordable service. In 2024, the utility sent disconnection notices to 187,000 customers, threatening to shut off their electricity if they did not pay their arrears in full and forcing them to choose between, for instance, keeping their home safe and comfortable and food fresh or making their car payment.

Thankfully, we have a proven alternative–public ownership of power–that has worked for decades in thousands of towns and cities and is being actively pursued in the District and other communities across the country.

Alongside rent, home prices, dining, and entertainment, our electric bills have shot upwards. The only difference? Our power rates are comprehensively regulated. To protect against the monopoly power of Pepco, we have the Public Service Commission (PSC): a three-person board that reviews Pepco’s costs when the company wants to raise rates. Officially, the PSC acts as our watchdog to protect consumers from being billed thousands of dollars each month and to ensure the lights stay on in an environmentally sustainable way. In reality, it’s a depressingly familiar story of corporate capture of government.

We Power DC, a local campaign for energy democracy, has a simple demand: replacing Pepco with an electric utility that belongs to the people of the District.

In just the past few years, Pepco has jacked up rates while slow rolling climate action and energy efficiency. According to a 2023 PSC report, Pepco obtained only 16% of its power supply from renewable energy sources, while it thwarted the adoption of rooftop solar across the city. In response to this bad behavior, the PSC rewarded Pepco: approving a $147.2 million dollar rate increase in 2021 and a $123 million dollar rate hike in 2023. These dollars flow out of the District and into the coffers of Pepco and its holding company owner, Exelon of Chicago.

Despite a wide-ranging outcry from the community, industry experts, and even landlords, the PSC in November 2024 largely approved Pepco’s latest proposed rate increase. Commissioner Richard Beverly wrote a blistering dissent in which he said the other two commissioners were essentially approving the case “because Pepco said so.”

The effects of the rate increase were immediate and expected. Following a cold winter, the additional 5% bump on bills slammed DC residents, with some customers seeing their bills double or triple. Public anger forced Pepco to suspend shutoffs for the first few months of 2025—but both bill collection and the rate increase stayed in place.

Meanwhile, Exelon flaunted the rate hike in DC as a major success, all the while an impending recession looms across the city and the country at large. Even in bleak times, the pursuit of profits by Pepco (and utilities like it) is relentless.

Unfortunately, the District is not an outlier: Regulators across the country rubber-stamp requested rate increases, despite the lack of economic logic. State regulatory agencies liberally reward utility shareholders even though they assume little risk by parking their money in a safe and stable industry.

Fortunately, there is an alternative for all of us. In towns and cities across the country, utilities are not controlled by shareholders—instead, they are governed by the communities that they serve and run on a not-for-profit basis. Public power is a proven model that altogether supplies electricity to about 55 million Americans in around 2,000 towns and cities across red and blue states, including Los Angeles, Nashville, and Seattle. On average, publicly owned utilities provide electricity that is cheaper and more reliable than their shareholder-controlled counterparts. Public power is not foreign or experimental but firmly established in the United States.

Affordable power is not the only argument in favor of public ownership. The urgency of the climate crisis means that we cannot rely solely on cajoling private utilities to remake our power grid. Despite the declining costs and rapid growth of wind and solar over the past 15 years, decarbonization of the American power sector is not happening quickly enough.

Furthermore, for the next few years, the responsibility of cleaning up the power sector will largely fall to state and local governments. Congress’ gutting of the Inflation Reduction Act in the One Big Beautiful Bill means that federal tax credits for wind and solar will soon dry up. Instead of trying to bribe the private sector to invest, we should take control of the climate transition through direct public investment. New York did exactly this in 2023 when it enacted the Build Public Renewables Act (BPRA) and empowered the state-owned New York Power Authority to build large-scale renewable projects and lead a just transition to a clean electric sector.

Inspired by the successful movement behind BPRA and determined to end the unbearable burden of power bills for hundreds of thousands of residents, We Power DC, a local campaign for energy democracy, has a simple demand: replacing Pepco with an electric utility that belongs to the people of the District. A utility governed by us could provide reliable service at lower rates; provide high-quality union jobs; and be a leader, not a laggard, in the fight against climate change. On top of its grassroots organizing, We Power published a report describing in detail how DC would benefit from a publicly owned utility, and how we can get there. While the road to public power can be long, the report outlines key intermediate steps that DC should pursue, including commissioning a study on municipalization of Pepco, taking control of grid planning, and building and operating community solar projects.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=63087723&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C178%2C0%2C178,N,,2026-01-24 09:59:09.720821

Along with this action the DOE has renamed the loaning organization, the Loans Programs Office to the Office of Energy Dominance Financing (EDF).

The action follows a review of the Biden administrations $104 billion principal loan obligations, “including approximately $85 billion rushed out the door in the final months after Election Day,” said a press statement from DOE.

The department stated that nearly $30 billion has been or is being de-obligated, while an additional $53.6 billion is undergoing revision.

According to the department, approximately $9.5 billion in subsidies for wind and solar projects were eliminated. These funds are being redirected toward baseload energy sources, including natural gas, nuclear power, and coal-fired facilities. The agency said that the changes are intended to prioritize grid reliability and lower electricity costs for consumers.

(Read: “Solar cost of electricity beats lowest-cost fossil fuel – even without tax credits”)

The department maintains $289 billion in available loan authority. It identified six sectors it will fund, notably excluding renewable energy and battery energy storage. The EDF will administer funds to:

Nuclear

Coal, oil, gas and hydrocarbons

Critical materials and minerals

Geothermal

Grid and transmission

Manufacturing and transportation

Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said the office will now focus on supporting the private sector through energy projects that provide consistent power rather than intermittent generation.

Recent analysis finds that solar and battery energy storage costs have fallen enough where cost-competitive “anytime electricity” is available around-the-clock.

The department has already begun closing loans under the new priorities, including a deal to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear facility. A coal-powered fertilizer plant in Indiana also received support.

Meanwhile, many solar and storage developers that had received conditional commitments under the previous administration must now navigate a revised landscape where federal backing is no longer guaranteed for renewable technologies.

The department noted that $85 billion of the original portfolio was finalized in the final months of the Biden administration, a timeline the current leadership described as “rushed.”

The move signals a departure from federal support for the energy transition as previously defined, focusing instead on traditional energy production and nuclear expansion.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/Chris_Wright_52994732548-1200x800.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 08:58:38.686500

CHARLOTTE, N.C., Jan. 23, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- With Winter Storm Fern expected to move into the Carolinas this weekend, Duke Energy crews and support teams are completing their preparations and urging customers to finalize their own storm plans.

Forecasts point to dangerous travel conditions and outages that could last several days in the hardest‑hit areas.

Our view

Rick Canavan, Duke Energy storm director:

""Forecast models continue to shift, and both precipitation type and amounts may change as the storm approaches.""

""We're making our final preparations to ensure our 18,000 crew members have everything they need to assess damage, clear trees and restore power as soon as conditions are safe.""

""Freezing rain is going to be our enemy over the days ahead. It will build up on tree branches until the weight causes them to break – bringing down power lines and poles. The freezing rain and ice will also make roads extremely difficult for our crews to navigate, slowing power restoration efforts.""

""Winter storms like this can create serious challenges. I urge customers to ready themselves and their families for outages that could extend into next week – and check in on neighbors to make sure they're prepared, too.""

The latest

Meteorologists continue tracking Fern as it approaches from the west. Snow, sleet or freezing rain could begin as early as Saturday, with ice accumulation posing the greatest risk of extended outages.

Ice buildup of a quarter inch can bring trees and branches onto power lines. A half inch or more can pull down the lines themselves.

Tree and vegetation crews are completing targeted trimming today to help reduce outage risks ahead of the storm.

More than 18,000 restoration workers will be in position across the Carolinas by Friday night.

These include Duke Energy and contracted lineworkers, vegetation specialists and storm support staff from 27 U.S. states and Canada.

Duke Energy serves about 4.7 million electric customers in the Carolinas – about 3.8 million in North Carolina and nearly 860,000 in South Carolina.

What Duke Energy is doing

Tracking the latest updates from internal meteorologists.

Positioning crews, equipment and materials in locations that may experience the most severe weather.

Standing up 22 basecamps across the Carolinas where out‑of‑state crews park their trucks, pick up supplies and equipment, eat meals and board buses to nearby hotels where they sleep.

Preparing to deploy damage assessors, lineworkers and vegetation crews once travel conditions allow.

Trimming trees and vegetation in targeted areas to reduce potential damage to power lines.

Coordinating closely with state and local emergency management officials.

What customers should do right now

Review emergency plans and supplies: Charge phones, gather flashlights and extra batteries and take steps to stay ready.

Use the American Red Cross Emergency app: The app, sponsored by the Duke Energy Foundation, offers emergency checklists, maps of open shelters and tools to monitor multiple locations for weather alerts.

Download or update the Duke Energy app: Available through the Apple Store or Google Play.

Confirm your Duke Energy account login: Log in through My Account or the mobile app to check contact information and communications preferences.

What customers should know

Safety hazards: Stay away from downed power lines and storm debris. Use generators safely and follow the manufacturer's instructions.

Grid improvements: Upgrades such as stronger poles, undergrounding and self‑healing technology will help reduce some outages and speed restoration.

Extended outages remain possible: Freezing rain and ice can cause dangerous road conditions, which can slow repairs – especially in rural or heavily treed areas.

Restoration will begin as soon as conditions allow: Crews will assess damage, prioritize critical facilities and restore power as quickly and safely as possible.

In some areas, restoration may be delayed due to blocked roads, hidden damage or hazardous travel conditions.

Within the UK context, the partners will look to address the current challenge of a lack of grid capacity, which is keeping projects in a connection queue for years in some instances.

They say this urgently needs to be addressed, as power-hungry data centres are expected to drive demand significantly in the coming years.

To attempt to combat this, Octopus Energy and Masdar will identify portions of available capacity on the distribution network and design energy systems around them. These systems will include solar, batteries and flexible grid connections, allowing data centres to access the power needed without delay.

The systems will be powered by Kraken technology, which will balance on-site generation to ensure a secure supply, while decreasing costs by shifting consumption to cheaper periods.

The Africa-focused agreement aims to scale clean energy for the benefit of commercial and industrial users. The collaboration, which will initially being in South Africa, will see distributed energy and local grids deployed to support job creation and industrial growth in the region.

“This is about delivering projects that make energy cheaper, cleaner, and unlock real opportunities for businesses and industry,” said chief executive of Octopus Energy, Greg Jackson.

The sentiment was echoed by Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, his Masdar counterpart: “Through these agreements, we continue to reimagine the potential of renewables in the AI era, while also bringing much-needed clean energy to communities and businesses across Africa.”

Octopus Energy is looking to scale renewables across the African continent. In November last year, the company’s generation arm joined the European Commission, the Republic of South Africa and Global Citizen’s Scaling Up Renewables in Africa campaign – a pioneering and coordinated effort to expand renewable energy and grid infrastructure across Africa.

“If you were to stop most people on the street in this town, they would say Chuck Fleischmann is synonymous with nuclear energy.
I like the fact that we are extending the life of our larger nuclear power plants in this country because they’re built well.
It’s nuclear.
And nuclear energy definitely is going to have a huge role.” “But we need all kinds of energy.","“It’s safe. It’s clean. It’s one of those energies that is actually attracting people from both sides of the aisle. It’s truly amazing.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. – With America facing unprecedented energy demands driven by data centers, artificial intelligence, and technological advancements, U.S. Reps. Chuck Fleischmann and Dan Newhouse appeared this past Thursday before a breakfast discussion of The Ripon Society to discuss the effort they are leading to meet this demand and boost U.S. energy security in the coming years.

Fleischmann represents the 3rd District of Tennessee and serves as Chairman of the Energy & Water Subcommittee of Appropriations. Newhouse represents the 4th District of Washington and is a member of the subcommittee. In their remarks, the two lawmakers talked about the increasing importance of nuclear power in meeting the country’s growing energy needs, and the steps they believe Congress and the President should take to make sure that America — not China or Russia — remains the top energy producer around the world.

“I’m all about energy,” Fleischmann stated in remarks to open the discussion. “If you were to stop most people on the street in this town, they would say Chuck Fleischmann is synonymous with nuclear energy. And I respect that. I do associate with those remarks. I like big and existing nuclear. I like the fact that we are extending the life of our larger nuclear power plants in this country because they’re built well. We’re going back. Companies like Holtec are going to bring a big one back in Michigan. Constellation is going to bring one back in Pennsylvania. My fervent hope is that New York State comes back at some point in time. Our friends on both sides of the aisle — excuse the pun—are warming towards nuclear energy.”

In addition to serving as Energy & Water Appropriations Subcommittee Chair, Fleischmann also serves as Co-Chair of several related caucuses, including Fusion Energy Caucus, the National Labs Caucus, the Advanced Nuclear Caucus, and the Nuclear Security Working Group — all of which reflect the fact that there is growing support for nuclear energy across the U.S., and that much of this support is bipartisan.

“The bottom line is we need energy in this country,” Fleischmann said. “We need natural gas. We need renewables. But we need all the above to get on the grid because we are going to have a dearth of energy. Nuclear is a big part of that. It’s safe. It’s clean. It’s one of those energies that is actually attracting people from both sides of the aisle. It’s truly amazing. I threw an event at the beginning of this Congress, and I invited Republicans and Democrats. It was a new nuclear dinner, and an equal number of Democrats and Republicans showed up. Our caucuses are bipartisan. Our efforts are bipartisan.”

Fleischmann noted that he is finding support for nuclear energy not only across the political aisle on Capitol Hill, but on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, as well.

“The Administration is working hand in hand with me,” the Tennessee lawmaker stated matter-of-factly. “Secretary Wright, Secretary Burgum, and the President of the United States — I work very closely with them. I’m a Republican who actually supports the Tennessee Valley Authority. I think it’s a great institution. The reality is, in our part of the world, we have less expensive, abundant energy, with a very diverse portfolio. It’s nuclear. It’s natural gas. It’s hydro. There is some coal in there. There are renewables in there. It is just very robust.”

Newhouse agreed.

“We are experiencing a never-before-seen demand for power in our country,” he stated. “It’s not just here, but throughout the world … We’ve got to meet these demands. And nuclear energy definitely is going to have a huge role.”

“But we need all kinds of energy. I think natural gas is still one of the things that we’re going to depend on, at least till we get to where we are with some of the other things. I’m really excited about geothermal, too. There are a lot of possibilities there. But nuclear — I don’t know that you could find another community in the country that is more pro-nuclear than the Tri-Cities of Washington State. And that’s a good thing. I think part of Tennessee absolutely falls into that category. Not too long ago, nuclear was almost a four-letter word. Now, people from both sides of the aisle and all philosophies are looking at nuclear as being a very viable option. And the good thing is we’ve got a lot of technology that will get us to a very strong nuclear future.”

Still, Newhouse cautioned, these and other developments related to expanding America’s nuclear power capacity, will not occur on their own. They will require smart policy in Washington and smart investment in innovation around the U.S.

“I believe the federal government has a clear role here,” the Washington state Republican said bluntly. “We were on the verge of losing a lot of that assistance and influence that we have to provide in H.R.1, the Big Beautiful Bill. Some of the tax credits that were very important to a lot of aspects of nuclear production were left on the cutting room floor — literally — until a group of us decided, ‘Hey, this is crazy — we can’t be throwing the baby out with the bath water here.’ Nuclear has got to be a part of our future. And we have to have those tax policies in place that will allow the industry to move forward.”

“We are very excited in Washington state about the small modular reactors. We believe that the Tri-Cities and the state of Washington will be a hub of production of that equipment. We’ve got the technology and we’ve got the brain power of the people that really know how to make this happen. I’m very excited about all of the different projects that are in place around the country. And we need more of that. We need some of these to actually come to fruition so that we can realize this future that we absolutely have to have.”

In addition to serving on the Energy & Water Appropriations Subcommittee, Newhouse also is a member of The Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, which, he noted, had been assessing the threat facing the U.S. from China and other energy powers around the globe.

“This is not just a domestic problem,” he stated. “We are faced with competition. I’m on the China committee, looking at the threats of the CCP. They’re producing not only nuclear, but coal and all kinds of different power generations. They are moving forward like there’s no tomorrow. Russia is the same way. We’re getting left in the dust as far as keeping up with them in this category. We can’t let that happen.”

On Friday (Jan. 23), the Arkansas Public Service Commission approved the rate increase as proposed in the joint settlement agreement that was filed Nov. 7 in the case.

In November, a SWEPCO participant said the bill of an average residential customer will increase by $24.32 per month, under the settlement agreement. The increase was based on November fuel rates rather than those when SWEPCO filed for the rate increase in March.

According to the regulatory documents, 227 public comments were filed in the case, and all comments opposed the proposed rate increase and/or investments made by the company in its coal plants.

Still, case participants recommended the commission approve the settlement because it resolved some of their concerns, including SWEPCO’s request for a resource-retirement study from Southwest Power Pool to consider the early retirement of the coal-fired Flint Creek Power Plant in Gentry, that SWEPCO complete a confidential economic analysis of the plant annually, look to procure clean energy resources in Northwest Arkansas, and consider all available technologies in its next request for generation resources.

A SWEPCO participant affirmed that the system can operate within Southwest Power Pool’s guidelines without Flint Creek online but said “it’s still the company’s thought process” to retire the plant in 2038.

Another participant said ratepayers would likely face a higher rate increase amid litigation, according to the documents. The settlement will result in a “significantly reduced rate increase” compared to what SWEPCO had originally requested in March. The rate increase in the settlement is roughly half of the original increase.

The Sierra Club was one of the participants opposing the rate increase.

“While it’s nice that the commissioners recognized the public’s outrage at SWEPCO’s rate request, nice doesn’t pay the bills,” said Cameron Rackley, a Northwest Arkansas resident and organizing intern for the Sierra Club. “Ultimately it’s the decision that impacts our lives, not the rhetoric.

The state oversees the pipelines that run through Santa Barbara and Kern counties, said Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta.

(AP) — California sued the federal government Friday for approving a Texas-based company's plans to restart two oil pipelines along the state's coast, escalating a fight over the Trump administration's removal of regulatory barriers to offshore oil drilling for the first time in decades.

The administration has hailed the project by Houston-based Sable Offshore Corp. to restart production in waters off Santa Barbara damaged by a 2015 oil spill as the kind of project President Donald Trump wants to increase U.S. energy production.

The state oversees the pipelines that run through Santa Barbara and Kern counties, said Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta.

“The federal administration has no right to usurp California’s regulatory authority,” he said at a news conference. “We’re taking them to court to draw a line in the sand and to protect our coast, beaches and communities from potentially hazardous pipelines.”

But the U.S. Transportation Department agency that approved Sable's plan pushed back on the lawsuit.

“Restarting the Las Flores Pipeline will bring much needed American energy to a state with the highest gas prices in the country,” said a spokesperson with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.

Sable did not respond for comment on the lawsuit.

Trump signed an executive order on the first day of his second term to reverse former President Joe Biden’s ban on future offshore oil drilling on the East and West coasts. A federal court later struck down Biden’s order to withdraw 625 million acres of federal waters from oil development.

The federal administration in November announced plans for new offshore oil drilling off the California and Florida coasts, which the oil industry has backed for years.

But critics say the plans could harm coastal communities and ecosystems.

Bonta said one of the pipelines Sable wants to restart burst in 2015, spilling oil along the Southern California coast. The event was the state’s worst oil spill in decades. More than 140,000 gallons (3,300 barrels) of oil gushed out, blackening beaches for 150 miles (240 kilometers) from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles. It polluted a biologically rich habitat for endangered whales and sea turtles, killing scores of pelicans, seals and dolphins, and decimating the fishing industry.

The drilling platforms were subsequently shuttered.

Sable has faced a slew of legal challenges but has said it is determined to restart production, even if that means confining it to federal waters, where state regulators have virtually no say. California controls the 3 miles (5 kilometers) nearest to shore. The platforms are 5 to 9 miles (8 to 14 kilometers) offshore.

“It’s crazy that we are even talking about restarting this pipeline,” said Alex Katz, executive director of the Environmental Defense Center, a Santa Barbara group formed in response to a catastrophic 1969 California oil spill.

The federal government's approval to restart the pipelines ignores painful lessons the community learned from the 2015 oil spill, said California Assemblymember Gregg Hart, a Democrat representing Santa Barbara.

""California will not allow Trump and his Big Oil friends to bypass our essential environmental laws and threaten our coastline,"" he said in a statement.

California has been reducing the state’s production of fossil fuels in favor of clean energy for years. The movement has been spearheaded partly by Santa Barbara County, where elected officials voted in May to begin taking steps to phase out onshore oil and gas operations.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/estWH3lIGykGLkEytMuDrQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03ODI7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/508f2a1156db07f0d0625bfbccf4a740,N,,2026-01-24 12:00:07.304861

Lin, a Biden appointee, said the DOT and the Federal Highway Administration ""yanked the NEVI Formula Program's cord out of the outlet,"" without working within the statutory confines of established administrative law as required.

Environmental groups including the Sierra Club hailed the ruling, saying it ensures states can move forward with building infrastructure funded by the law. Lin's order permanently bars the Transportation Department from taking away the states' funds or canceling their previously approved implementation plans.

""Judge Lin's order is a resounding win for the rule of law and for smart investment in our clean energy future,"" Mike Faulk, a spokesperson for Washington State Attorney General Nick Brown, said in a statement.

The Transportation Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shortly after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy took office in February, the DOT suspended the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, which was part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that Biden signed into law in 2021.

The Trump administration has pursued a number of policies to boost the sale of gas-powered vehicles and cut EV incentives for automakers and consumers.

States led by California, Colorado and Washington sued in May, alleging the Trump administration was wrongly withholding billions of dollars they were previously awarded.

The administration argued it was but a temporary pause, which it later ended after the judge earlier issued a preliminary injunction and the agency issued new guidance.

But Lin said the 2021 law never contemplated even temporary pauses in funding for the construction of EV infrastructure.

""In short, Defendants defied the will of Congress by withholding funds in a manner not contemplated by the IIJA,"" she wrote.

The U.S. Senate is slated next week to consider legislation that has already cleared the U.S. House of Representatives that would redirect $879 million in funds approved under Biden for the EV charging network to other infrastructure priorities.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108213726-1760727737527-gettyimages-2240740353-AFP_78VR7T3.jpeg?v=1760727759&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2026-01-24 08:58:42.747826

A Hot Spot Over the last year, rural Wisconsin has become somewhat of a hotspot for data center developers.
The debate over Wisconsin’s data center boom is both rooted in local governance and relevant to the national conversation about rising electricity costs.
In an election year, data center infrastructure has become a political issue, yet it’s one that rural coalition members insist is nonpartisan.
In addition to TIDs, Wisconsin also offers a sales and use tax exemption to incentivize data center development.","Blaine Halverson joked that his only exposure to data centers was from the Mission Impossible movies in the 1990s. That was, until one came to his town. Over the last seven months, Halverson’s community of Menomonie, Wisconsin, population 16,700, has become a flashpoint in a growing debate over data center development and local control in the state.

Halverson has lived in Menomonie, which is just over an hour east of Minneapolis, for most of his life. Like many others in his rural community, Halverson didn’t know much about the hyperscale data centers, built by the world’s largest technology companies, that are cropping up across the U.S. to power artificial intelligence. Then, in July 2025, Halverson was on vacation with his wife when he learned of a $1.6 billion data center proposal slated for around 320 acres of farmland on the outskirts of Menomonie.

Immediately, Halverson had questions.

“All of a sudden, I was activated,” said Halverson. “What really activated me was how far along this was, and that the public was just finding out.”

Over the next six months, Halverson and dozens of other concerned Menomonie residents coordinated a local opposition campaign that on January 5, 2026, resulted in Menomonie’s City Council revising a zoning ordinance to bar Balloonist, LLC, the developer representing an undisclosed ‘tech giant’, from moving ahead on construction.

An attorney for Balloonist did not respond to the Daily Yonder’s request for comment.

Halverson’s frustration about the project’s lack of transparency is one that has echoed throughout the state. In other rural counties and in villages sandwiched between larger cities like Milwaukee, Madison, and Green Bay, data center proposals in places like Beaver Dam, Port Washington, and Caledonia have been met with fierce opposition from residents. Developers eyeing land in Greenleaf, a village outside of Green Bay, and in Grant County, which borders the Mississippi River, have also faced community backlash. Commonly cited concerns revolve around project secrecy and the data centers’ projected energy usage, water needs, and financial impact on communities with small tax bases.

Beyond requiring vast amounts of power and water to keep operations running 24/7, large data center proposals in rural areas often represent a significant, if not dominant, share of the community’s tax levy. This leaves residents fearing what will happen if the planned data centers do not live up to their promises, should the stock market take a turn, the developers go bankrupt, or the technology inside the warehouse-like structures become obsolete.

“They’re not seeing the long-term risks,” said Prescott Balch about the elected officials who push for data center development in Wisconsin’s rural communities. Balch is a retired software developer and former technology executive at U.S. Bank. He also lives in Caledonia, Wisconsin, a rural village south of Milwaukee whose residents ousted a 244-acre Microsoft data center that was slated for land zoned for agriculture in October of 2025.

“No investment advisor, for example, would ever let you do [that] with your investment portfolio. They’d get fired for saying, ‘Put all your eggs in this one basket.’ It doesn’t matter how solid that one basket is. It’s still one basket with a lot of risk if it walks out the door,” Balch said.

A Hot Spot

Over the last year, rural Wisconsin has become somewhat of a hotspot for data center developers. The allure for Big Tech companies racing to build infrastructure to train and run complex AI models comes in the form of tax incentives, low-cost land, and, in many rural communities, flexible zoning codes.

But residents like Halverson and Balch are taking notice and starting to organize together. Opposition groups that have formed in communities faced with data center proposals are using digital tools like Facebook and Signal to connect with one another across the Badger State. Now, a growing coalition of rural residents and environmental organizations are urging state legislators to regulate data center development and, in some instances, taking legal action to improve transparency.

The debate over Wisconsin’s data center boom is both rooted in local governance and relevant to the national conversation about rising electricity costs. In an election year, data center infrastructure has become a political issue, yet it’s one that rural coalition members insist is nonpartisan. What’s on the ballot, including a crowded gubernatorial race, could influence that.

Why Wisconsin?

To grasp why data centers are coming to Wisconsin, you have to understand a particularly wonky part of the state’s tax code, according to Port Washington resident Michael Beaster. A resident of the rural city just north of Milwaukee, Beaster opposes the $15 billion campus being built by Vantage Data Centers to serve end-users Oracle and OpenAI as part of their $500 billion Stargate campaign to develop AI infrastructure across the U.S.

The wonky policy Beaster is talking about is a tax incremental district, or TID.

In Wisconsin, a TID lets developers pay their property taxes into a separate box from the rest of the community as a way to capture property value growth associated with new projects. During construction, a developer, like Vantage, contributes taxes to this special box to cover infrastructure costs associated with their project, like new roads and power lines. Depending on the terms of the TID, that tax money is then kept in the box until all infrastructure costs have been paid, often a period of 15-20 years.

Typically, this kind of tax policy helps small- or medium-scale developers, like new packing plants or housing developments, pay for their associated infrastructure costs over time. With hyperscale data centers, however, rural residents worry that the high costs of the developments’ power and water infrastructure will rack up for the community to pay while the developers’ taxes sit in a special box.

“If the village decides to raise the tax levy, it comes off the backs of the current residents only, and that is completely and utterly invisible right now to most people,” said Balch, who worked to reject Microsoft’s proposed data center campus in Caledonia last fall.

In November of 2025, the city of Port Washington approved a TID that enables Vantage to pay upfront for the estimated $175 million in infrastructure costs, plus $91 million for an electrical substation and $187 million in interest, associated with their data center campus, including upgraded water and sewer mains and new power infrastructure. Port Washington will then be responsible for paying Vantage back for those infrastructure costs over time.

The TID is set up as a pool of money to remain open for up to 20 years for the city to draw from to reimburse Vantage. Some residents, including Beaster, have expressed concerns that the financing model could end up raising taxes for locals. On January 2, 2026, a Port Washington-based group of activists filed a lawsuit against the city to challenge the TID.

“People don’t want to see their communities handed over to large corporations,” Beaster said.

Port Washington Mayor Ted Neitzke did not respond to the Daily Yonder’s request for clarification on whether the city’s TID would result in higher taxes for residents.

Last summer, a bipartisan measure in Wisconsin’s legislature updated the state’s tax incremental financing policy to exempt data centers from caps on the amount of money that can be held in a TID. The act mentions both Port Washington and Beaver Dam by name and was signed into law by Democratic Governor Tony Evers on July 8, 2025. In addition to TIDs, Wisconsin also offers a sales and use tax exemption to incentivize data center development. The exemptions are offered on a ladder based on a developer’s intended investment and the host county’s population, with less populous counties requiring less investment. For rural counties, the minimum investment required to claim the exemption is $50 million.

For Asad Ramzanali, former deputy director for strategy at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy under the Biden Administration, it is this kind of policy that goes against the idea that data centers should have to pay their “fair share”.

“When the largest companies, the most well-resourced companies, in the history of the world are behind these data centers, it feels particularly unfair to have states level tax breaks for construction,” Ramzanali told the Daily Yonder.

“People should not have to pay increased utility bills. People should not have to pay for transmission lines going up, [and] people shouldn’t have to deal with dirty water sources because of a data center.”

Nonpartisan, but Political

With local pushback to data centers picking up steam, state legislators are taking note. Beaster said that’s a change from the attitude that some legislators had a few months ago, when his rural community members were mobilizing against the data center in Port Washington last summer and fall.

“When we started really getting involved in trying to mobilize, we tried to write letters and emails and stuff to state legislators, and they just weren’t very responsive,” Beaster said. “It felt to us like they were more interested in bringing these things here than regulating them.”

In early December, 2025, Democrats introduced a bill to regulate data centers and entice them to take climate-friendly steps. Under the proposed legislation, residents would be protected from footing the utility costs associated with data centers. If passed, the bill would also subject data centers to an annual fee, ranging from $2-3 million, to fund clean energy and low-income heating assistance programs. The legislation also includes a measure to hinge state tax incentives, like the sales and use tax exemption, upon data centers using at least 70% renewable energy.

In January, 2025, Republicans introduced a data center bill of their own, with similarities including mandated reporting on water usage and restrictions on passing development-related utility costs onto families and small businesses. The Republican legislation would also mandate that data centers wanting to use renewable energy would need to build those energy sources, like solar, on the same property.

The utility provisions in both the Democrat and Republican-backed bills come as the Wisconsin Public Service Commission (PSC) prepares to hear a case in February of 2026, from We Energies, the state’s largest utility, that will determine how much data centers will have to pay for their infrastructure, and how much gets passed onto other ratepayers.

We Energies has requested a pay structure that holds data centers accountable for 75% of their capital costs. That request has been challenged by the Wisconsin chapter of the Sierra Club, which argues large customers like data centers should be held responsible for 100% of their associated costs.

“This is the decision for how much the largest utility is making large customers pay, and right now the proposal is really bad for an average residential customer,” said Cassie Steiner, a senior campaign coordinator at Sierra Club. The PSC is expected to hand down a decision on the 2026 rate structure in the spring.

Even as data center regulation captures lawmakers’ attention at the state capitol in Madison, organizers in Menomonie, Port Washington, and Caledonia maintain that local opposition isn’t tied to party.

“One of the things that has been really amazing to me about this process is that I know the people I’m standing shoulder-to-shoulder with in this group, a lot of them never vote the same way I would when we go into the into the voting booth in November,” Halverson said of his work in Menomonie.

“If it’s your farmland and your community, you’re an extreme environmentalist, and if it’s your power bill going up, then you’re a fiscal conservative.”

“New York City … is unbelievably vulnerable in a climate-changing world.”","Climate advocates in New York City celebrated when Zohran Mamdani won the mayoral election, applauding his history of opposing the expansion of gas infrastructure in the city and his framing of climate action as important to his affordability agenda. Now, those advocates will closely monitor how he addresses the city’s pressing climate issues, including flooding, heat and pollution.

As he put it in his inaugural address, “every blizzard and flood we withstand, together.” The question of how well New Yorkers withstand them, and how the city responds, rests in part in the hands of the Mamdani administration. And it’s a heavy burden.

According to the city’s 2024 report on environmental justice, nearly half of the city’s population lives in an environmental justice community—an area that has historically been overburdened with environmental hazards such as air pollution.

Under local law, the city must now develop a plan of action to mitigate the environmental issues in these communities. This plan, likely to be released under Mamdani, could meaningfully address the concerns of residents who are disproportionately low-income and non-white.

Summer Sandoval, who worked on the environmental justice report, would like to see more clean energy opportunities for these communities, especially since they often face high levels of air pollution in their neighborhoods due to highways and gas power plants. Sandoval is now the community investment and implementation director of the Urban Sustainability Directors Network.

“I think it’s a very important issue of not only having access to clean energy, but having access to affordable and reliable energy,” Sandoval said. “It’s going to significantly impact people’s quality of life.”

Under former Mayor Eric Adams, City Hall expanded city zoning to allow more solar panels and battery storage to be built in the city. His administration also launched the Blue Highways Pilot Program, part of a larger plan to shift some freight entering the city from roads to waterways—limiting pollution from trucks in environmental justice communities near highways.

Advocacy groups have also pushed for City Hall to dedicate 1 percent of the city’s budget to the Department of Parks and Recreation, which cares for the city’s green spaces, nearly 14 percent of the city. Under Adams, the department’s budget hovered around 0.6 percent.

Chronic underfunding of the department means that parks in low-income neighborhoods often receive less maintenance work. Wealthier areas’ green space, like Central Park or Prospect Park, receive independent funding through conservancies—nonprofits that help fill those gaps.

Hanging over all that, federal funding for environmental justice communities has sharply declined. The Biden administration spearheaded multiple efforts to improve the lives of these communities, while the Trump administration has pulled back.

“That has never stopped New York before,” said Sandoval, “and it shouldn’t now in terms of the city working very closely with the state to create local and state resources that are necessary to address local environmental justice issues.”

520 Miles of Coastline

When New Yorkers think about flooding, Hurricane Sandy looms large. In 2012, it killed 44 city residents, destroyed 300 homes and caused over $19 billion in damages.

The disaster kickstarted the flood resilience conversation in the city, triggering the formation of plans to prevent the “surrender to the sea,” according to Rob Freudenberg of the Regional Plan Association, a civic organization that has conducted research into local flooding problems.

Flooding along the city’s 520 miles of coastline is a significant concern, especially with sea level rise and the likelihood of more frequent and devastating storms due to climate change.

According to a 2025 report by the Regional Plan Association, New York City, the Long Island counties of Nassau and Suffolk and Westchester County, just north of the city, could lose as many as 82,000 housing units due to “permanent, chronic and coastal flooding” by 2040.

Currently, the city has a mix of plans to protect lower Manhattan from storm surge, nicknamed the “Big U.” Developed with a combination of city, state and federal funds, the plan is designed to protect the Financial District and surrounding neighborhoods from coastal storms.

Projects like the East Side Coastal Resiliency Project, which raised a waterfront park by 10 feet to protect nearby residents, will become a feature of the lower Manhattan waterfront. The city is likely to employ a combination of natural solutions, like parks, and hard infrastructure, such as floodwalls, to curb storm-related flooding. Green areas can absorb a lot of stormwater, preventing it from flooding the streets.

Park advocacy groups have been pushing for more park funding for years, in part to better combat the city’s climate pressures. Mamdani has pledged to allocate 1 percent of the city budget to parks and has appointed Tricia Shimamura as the commissioner of the city’s Department of Parks and Recreation. She was previously Manhattan borough commissioner at the department.

The city also has tentative plans to protect areas of Staten Island, Brooklyn and Queens from potential disaster. In Staten Island, the city built hard structures off the island’s coast to break up potential large waves and fitted the structures with small holes to provide habitat for marine life.

In New York, the risk of flooding is not just coming from the coasts; it’s also coming from the skies. As the climate changes, New Yorkers are likely to experience more short bursts of heavy rain—“rain bombs,” as Bill Ulfelder, the executive director of The Nature Conservancy in New York, described them.

“[The new administration] needs to make sure that there’s good coordination between the coast and the areas that flood inland,” said the Regional Plan Association’s vice president of energy and environmental programs Freudenberg. “They’re too often kept separate in approaches.”

Freudenberg hopes to see changes to the city’s flood policy. He believes that a neighborhood-by-neighborhood approach that identifies all flooding sources in an area, along with potential solutions, would offer a clearer picture and enable more coordinated city policy under a new mayoral administration.

The city has a long history of project-by-project approaches to flooding, Freudenberg says. Under Adams, the city addressed rainfall flooding through a combination of policies such as sewer upgrades and the Cloudburst Management program, which uses a combination of infrastructure and natural solutions to absorb water, preventing street flooding that could overwhelm the sewer system.

The city’s myriad flooding problems may also complicate Mamdani’s campaign promise to build over 200,000 new affordable housing units over the next decade. According to the Regional Plan Association, approximately 77,300 acres, or just over 10 percent, of residential-zoned land could face future flooding.

If the new mayor’s eventual housing policy does not consider future flood risk, his administration may end up building housing units that will be uninhabitable in a few decades. City policy, Freudenberg said, also needs to provide options to those who already live in areas with high flood risk.

“This mayor no longer has the luxury of being a one-issue mayor,” said Freudenberg. “You can be an affordability mayor, you can be a housing mayor—but in order to truly succeed, you need to be a resilience and adaptation mayor at the same time.”

50,000 Polluting Buildings

The city’s building decarbonization law was a hot-button issue during the mayoral race. Local Law 97, passed in 2019, imposes gradually escalating limits on greenhouse gas emissions from large city buildings—starting in 2024.

According to the Urban Green Council, a nonprofit focused on building decarbonization, and energy benchmarking data, around 92 percent of buildings comply with last year’s limit. The more stringent limits will come in 2030, 2035 and 2040. Co-op and condominium owners are concerned about the cost of complying with these limits, which can sometimes require replacing a building’s heating system.

“We’re looking at the next four years and seeing that the priorities are pretty clear, it’s to reduce costs and simplify the process,” said Chris Halfnight, chief operating officer at the Urban Green Council, who served on the Mamdani transition team.

Over the course of his campaign, Mamdani suggested that the city could bulk-buy equipment like heat pumps, which are central to decarbonizing a building’s heating system, in order to provide them at lower prices to some building owners. He also said he wanted to “make it easier” for co-op and condominium owners to comply with the law.

Advocates like Halfnight will be closely watching how Mamdani approaches this issue. Many climate activists were unhappy with how Adams implemented the law. They have advocated for limits on the purchase of renewable energy certificates, which represent electricity generated by a renewable source, to mitigate fines.

Implementing the law stringently while still offering pathways to limit the cost of decarbonization has proven to be a delicate balance. Halfnight and his organization hope the mayor will expand his bulk-purchase campaign proposal to a one-stop shop for compliance with the law.

A program like this would call for the city to bulk-purchase equipment and installation services—hopefully making the process faster and cheaper. The program, Halfnight said, would be funded by public money at first and would ultimately be repaid by building owners through property taxes.

“There’s been some signs from the administration that this approach really aligns well with a joint climate and affordability focus,” said Halfnight.

Climate hazards in the city intersect with a variety of quality-of-life issues, and the Mamdani administration will be scrutinized for how it handles them.

But the limits of the governor’s $200 million EV proposal become clear in the numbers.

Fewer easy EV buyers in California California needs to design its next rebate program well because its most eager EV buyers are gone and the state now faces a harder, more price-sensitive market, experts said.","This story was originally published by CalMatters. Sign up for their newsletters.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s $200 million plan to revive the state’s stalling electric-car market faces several fundamental problems: It isn’t enough money, it may not reach consumers quickly enough and the state hasn’t decided whether to subsidize – or exclude – wealthier buyers.

The Newsom administration’s budget proposal — rolled out after President Donald Trump dismantled federal electric vehicle incentives and blocked California’s clean-vehicle mandate — would cover rebates for only about 20% of last year’s EV sales. That CalMatters estimate assumes the state follows the model of the Clean Vehicle Rebate Program, which offered rebates of up to $7,500 toward some electric and hybrid cars before the California Air Resources Board ended it in 2023.

So far the administration has released few details about the proposal, leaving experts and lawmakers circling a basic question: Who should get the money?

“It is better than nothing, which is what a lot of things are getting right now,” said Mars Wu, a senior program manager with the Greenlining Institute, which advocates for investments in communities of color. “How far that $200 million goes really depends on how the program is going to be structured.”

A small incentive in a huge market

California’s electric car market is one the governor celebrates on the world stage. While at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland earlier this week, Newsom highlighted that California has surpassed 2.5 million clean car sales, saying the achievement came after the state “invested in this future when others said it was impossible.” He framed the number against a modest goal to get 1.5 million clean cars on the road, set more than a decade ago.

California officials remain confident the state’s policies will succeed in pushing the transition to electric cars. Even as sales have slipped, EVs will drive future electricity demand, according to a long-term forecast approved Wednesday by the California Energy Commission.

But the limits of the governor’s $200 million EV proposal become clear in the numbers. A CalMatters analysis found the incentive would cover only one out of every five EV sales, assuming similar sales to last year, and the same average rebate level as the state’s last mass-market rebate program.

Advocates are also raising concerns about how quickly the money can get to consumers. Christopher Chavez, deputy policy director at the Coalition for Clean Air, a California-focused advocacy group, warned that the proposed rebates may not reach consumers until 2027, given how long it takes to approve the budget and to set up a new program. If the funding only lasts a year, the program would leave out buyers who need time to plan or save, he added.

“It's not going to be enough — just to be blunt about it,” Chavez said. “Two-hundred million for a mass-market program will go very quickly.”

The proposal comes as the latest sales numbers show an electric car market slump. Nationally, the loss of the uncapped, popular federal tax credit has accelerated manufacturer write-downs and sales declines as automakers adjusted to a tougher EV market.

In California, the slowdown has pushed the state further off course from its climate goals: even before Congress and President Trump blocked its vehicle mandate last year, California was struggling to hit a requirement that 35% of new cars sold in 2026 be zero-emission. Last year electric and other zero emission cars made up about 23% of new car sales in 2025, down from roughly 25% the year prior, California Energy Commission data shows.

Sales slowed down dramatically at the end of the year, when EVs and other clean cars accounted for just under 19% of new car sales in the fourth quarter of 2025 — the lowest quarterly share since mid-2022.

The Newsom administration will likely lay out the details of its proposal in a draft bill tied to the state budget. The Clean Vehicle Rebate Program would be “the foundation we’d be building from,” wrote Lindsey Buckley, an air board spokesperson, in an email, adding that the goal would be to deploy the $200 million “as soon as possible to support the market.”

Buckley said it is “speculative” to predict the impact of a new EV incentive or how quickly the money would reach consumers.

With limited funding, advocates say the question of who qualifies for the rebates becomes critical.

“What we really don't want to see is that money going towards higher-income folks for whom it would just be kind of like a bonus coupon,” said Wu, of the Greenlining Institute.

Fast or targeted: lawmakers face a choice

How the Newsom administration and lawmakers design the state’s next EV incentive will determine how quickly the air board can deliver rebates — and whether the program avoids recreating past inequities. California ended its last, broad EV rebate program in 2023 over concerns it benefited higher-income buyers. Targeting lower-income drivers delivers the greatest benefits because they tend to drive the most, and switching to EVs saves them money on fuel and maintenance, said Ethan Elkind, a climate law expert at UC Berkeley.

But income-based “means testing” can slow programs down, requiring income verification and layers of bureaucracy that eat up funding and discourage participation.

That’s a critique of one California program aimed at low-income buyers, Clean Cars 4 All, which offers grants to help drivers trade in older, more polluting vehicles for cleaner alternatives. As the state moved from budget surplus to deficit, the Newsom administration and lawmakers never adequately funded it, advocates say.

Lawmakers provided no new funding in the 2024–25 budget year, and in the current budget cycle, the state provided only about $45 million through a combination of funds and one-time budget actions, according to the Legislative Analyst’s Office. That falls well short of a sustained, long-term commitment, said Chavez, of the Coalition for Clean Air.

“It's become — especially as the budget has become more difficult — more of a secondary priority, which is unfortunate,” he said.

Competing ideas, no clear consensus

California’s EV problem has no shortage of potential solutions — only disagreement over which one to choose.

Some policy analysts argue the state should focus on first-time adoption. A recent brief from Atlas Public Policy found that incentives are most cost-effective when they bring a household’s first electric vehicle into the garage — because once a family owns one EV, it is far more likely to buy another.

Elkind, of UC Berkeley, said a simpler approach — a point-of-sale rebate tied to lower-priced vehicles — would be easier for the air board to administer while avoiding subsidies for high-income buyers.

“If it's just tied to the price of the vehicle, that's pretty straightforward,” Elkind said.

Some lawmakers told CalMatters the air board should tightly target the rebates to communities most affected by pollution and transportation costs. State Senator Ben Allen, a Democrat from El Segundo, said incentives should focus on communities that suffer the most from air pollution, “so as to increase the bang for air quality buck.”

Senator Josh Becker, a Democrat from Menlo Park, said new incentives should go to the people “who are most burdened by transportation costs and drive the most.""

Fewer easy EV buyers in California

California needs to design its next rebate program well because its most eager EV buyers are gone and the state now faces a harder, more price-sensitive market, experts said.

“California is one of the first states to sort of get into that mainstream market: and it's a harder market to convert,” said Loren McDonald, a Danville-based EV analyst. Potential buyers now expect seamless charging and balk at waiting 30 to 40 minutes. They also are not keen to install home chargers or pay more upfront. Many, he says, stick with traditional gasoline-powered vehicles.

“We burned through the innovators and the early adopters — those people who want to save the planet, those people who make good money,” McDonald said.
